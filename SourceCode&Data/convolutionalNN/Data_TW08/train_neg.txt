 Hi welcome to the library media center At the entrance we post school community events and have some newspapers so that our readers can keep up with the current news and community happenings At our situation desk we have a suggestion box our series list and magazines and books to entice students as they check out In our commercial seating area we have state book award nominees and winners as well as numerous magazines for you in the library for your checkout For the teachers I have a professional library with over 3 000 books DVDs manipulatives and kits developed to support the curriculum Fiction is concentrated on the right side of the library The paperbacks a student favorite arranged by genre just like in retail stores All of the series books are clearly labelled so students can quickly find the next book in a series I give special consideration to my reluctant reader s needs if students interests were looking for fiction or making sure we have quality literature for all reading levels We have 13 desktop computers and a mobile laptop lab with which students access the internet numerous databases Impact and a variety of software On the school library website they find reviews blogs links to resarch sites as well as book suggestions trainers and podcasts many of which are created by the students On the left hand side of the library the reference and the non fiction sections are located Our many biographies are housed on the non fiction side of the center counter I have many displays throughout the library and around the school but two of the most effective ways I encourage student interaction with literature is by display of their works such as book reviews or projects and by intermingling related materials to encourage further exploration of the topics I keep the collection current and relevant through annual reading and by following my collection development plan so I can offer my patrons a fantastic collection with enthusiastic and professional service But we don t we don t find our food and just like The three little pig wolf thing She counted all the way up And she wants to know the lines or something We re going to now that you guys have most of your categories filled in I would like for you to flip over the lab sheet that s in front of you There are two reviews for this book Compare what you have on your graphic organizer to what you find in the review If you had mentioned that Bridge was a protagonist or basically mention Bridge and give some description of Bridge then that would be something that is in common with one of the reviews If you find something in common circle it on your graphic organizer I would like for you to circle everything on your graphic organizer that you also see in the reviews And again you can work with your partner on this one it talks about what they deserve and 30 more seconds That s okay Did you find that there were several things in common between the elements you looked for and found in the story and what you find in the review Yes The review has some additional items in it doesn t it There are a lot of people with the same basic items Anyway I wanted to do a quick Venn diagram up here and compare and contrast I want for each group this group I want each of the two of you to find one thing that you found that wasn t in the review Or one thing that was in the review that was not on your paper Okay Okay you guys I want you to find one for each of those groups I want you to find one thing that was in common So this is compare this is contrast Contrast compare Find one thing that was in common and one thing that s different Oh okay here s a sticky in the middle of the table I want you to write it on the sticky You guys hard Awesome step up here and tell us what it is and where does it go Awesome perfect So all you guys came up with a We did like don t count your chickens before they hatch and it was in our graphic organizer Oh okay Perfect and that was Good perfect Okay so everybody here found something that they had that wasn t in the review it was in their graphic organizer You guys come on up This table everyone at this table is looking for something that was found in both their graphic organizer and in the review We found Super Super so that goes in the middle because it s in common with both of them This group Perfect they found both in the review and in their organizer that So that was a What category Oh was that in common Did you find it in the review also or was it Just you guys found it So where would it go Excellent excellent That would go in the graphic organizer because it was something that wasn t in the review so it would go over here perfect Okay next We found that the Okay so you found something that was only in the review that the how the pigs disguised themselves Where do we put that on that Excellent something that was only found in the review Save the best for last What d you guys find We found that the graphic organizer and the review they both talked about that related to like the The allusions in there Wizard of Oz Three Little Pigs Excellent that was So we see an awful lot is in common with these Sometimes you guys find something that aren t in the reviews the reviews sometimes had something you didn t find They are a little bit different Not necessarily in your review cover every literary element there is You won t necessarily tell them the five different types of literary devices that are used there and that s okay What you want to do with your review is tell some about the book and give a substantiated opinion of the book Why do What are the good features of this book What are the weaknesses in the book that you read Now there are other things that you may need in there and I ll show where you can get some additional information Let s bring this on down here In the online catalog Both of those computers are logged in over there Okay look up So far So if you want to make a note of how many pages as a reminder to yourself Oh yeah that was a really long book or Oh that was a quick read That would be something to kind of jog your memory there Things like Oh yeah this was about Korea 
 Write at the top of your paper The color that you want for your sugar and the color you want for your salt on both of them Sugar on one salt on the other Yes because you can make from your sheet two Now the purpose of these sheets is so you can actually take your spoon Malik take your spoon and dip out onto that paper This gives you a better visual of how much sugar and how much salt is in that particular food Now what s the most important thing about the label Serving Size Serving size Good Aaron serving size So that is showing most of these is the container itself That s the reason we went to snack foods so that you could see how much that is This also gives you a better idea of how much you eat Some of you like Aaron may eat two or three of these especially if it was Gummies right Aaron Yes It s not Gummies but it s close Okay so any questions before you get started Okay decide who is going to do calculations decide who s going to measure first I want you to rotate those responsibilities around and Devon what is your question Remember the personal column is how much you would eat the serving size Doesn t matter your group remember has to cooperate figure out who s going to do what and just look at responsibilities Just make sure everyone sees how much sugar how much salt it is That s the important part On the back of your paper When it says about 29 grams right here What s the serving size Serving size is here there are four servings in here They would eat half the bag then it would be two servings So next is the total calories and it s got 130 calories total carbs ok so nine grams Now when you dip out your salt and sugar try to replace it in the correct bucket we don t want the salt in the sugar or the sugar in the salt So pay attention to what you re doing Now remember you have to calculate what you would eat Give me some sugar 11 grams divided by four Put two teaspoons on here Is it sodium Dip it out you see how much See visually how much it is I don t have any salt Yes Paul I want to encourage you that after you done something that s really sugary do something that you would think would be salty as if it surprises you how much sugars in it 
 Does everyone agree on the first question Yeah What did you all agree on That it wasn t really fair for For First and Second Class to go through without any problems and the people from the Steerage had to go through examinations and this whole long hassle And why was that Why did people who were First and Second Class just get to come right on in and not have to go through examinations Cause of the money What about the money Because they thought that they had they were perfect They had no disease They had lots of money and thought they would work hard So the stereotype is what That rich people are more can work harder or have less chance of disease than the people in Steerage Do you think that that stereotype is still true today Or do you think it s not true anymore It was just for First and Second Class passengers for Steerage passengers before emigrating Well it s kind of like this It s not over the top but it s just a little bit What do you guys think about what Eric said I agree with him Why It s not fair because First and Second Class usually are kings or royalty and so if you re in Steerage you re just a normal person If you re in Steerage it s not going to be fair You have to go walk through that and Well First and Second Class Passengers they weren t necessarily royalty they were just people who had a lot of money People who had enough money to buy those tickets which they were really expensive What do you guys think about what Eric said That the stereotype today is still here but not really Just kind of back and forth It s back and forth They don t do the same thing anymore Who s they And what s the same thing The American Embassy The people that take care of the immigrants and everything and all about them They don t go to Ellis Island anymore They don t go to Ellis Island anymore You have to go on a plane or you have to drive here But do you think the stereotype in general that rich people are better or they don t have diseases and they re just better than people who don t have a lot of money Do you think we still have those stereotypes today Sometimes Sometimes Have you seen it ever No No but you just think it s still there I haven t really seen it at all Yeah I agree with Okay You can start the next one Hold on Josh did you have something else to add Yeah On TV shows sometimes they have rich people in huge carriages with horses sometimes And they re usually pretty snotty And how do you know they re snotty They re always like Don t touch that It s going to fall and you re going to pay for that Oh okay So you do see in TV sometimes Yeah All right Do you think immigrants were treated fairly at Ellis Island Why or why not I don t think they were treated very fairly because they had to go through I agree with Jacob because sometimes people just sent them back at Ellis Island but some doctors at least tried to keep us here to help us be better until we got to stay in America Yeah and that was good that the doctors are supposed to check them and see if they were okay Some of the doctors two people could have the same diseases but both the doctors one doctor could send one person home and one person could stay at Ellis Island which is unfair Possibly because of their religion or the way their language I think they were mostly I think they were mostly yeah So they were mostly treated well but sometimes not Sometimes not Yeah The doctors or the inspectors might think that one person can stay because of their religion or their language and others might have to be sent back And remember the book that we read It kind of said that the cousin he had to be sent back to well he almost had to be sent back to his country because To Russia Yeah to Russia because he had a scratch and they thought it was infected His father was trying to tell him but they didn t listen Yeah He didn t I think they should have translators with all of them so then it would make it fair That spoke English and that language That language So they can understand things So I would say mostly Yeah Mostly So should we check them both off I think we should check off the first one If they were sick or something or if they needed food they had places where they could get food Or if they were sick and had to go to the hospital like Sophia said So I m in the middle Kind of Because sometimes they were treated badly I agree with Josh because if they were sick they would probably be treated less fairly because they were sick and had their diseases Like Oh Get away from me because you re going to spread that disease to everybody It s going to be an epidemic I want to add if they were sick they could have been contagious and there were a lot of people at Ellis Island so they might have Usually if they were at a hospital they were curing curable diseases because if they couldn t cure it they didn t have a medicine or anything to cure that they got sent back Yeah I agree with Eric and Sophia Go ahead Were you going to say something I was going to say if we all agree on this So your general feeling here is were they treated fairly at Ellis Island They weren t treated not very fairly Like they were treated half the fair that they should have been but they weren t treated really good They were fed very well and all their needs were there but they weren t treated very good like if you were on an airplane in First Class It s kind of like I would like to add they were treated way better in Ellis Island because on the ship in Steerage they didn t have good food They couldn t really bathe and it was all crowded They didn t really have a good place to sleep but in Ellis Island they actually had okay food They weren t treated like Do you think that it was fair that they each had to have 20 on them in order to stay Yeah Sort of Sort of What I think is they need to take care of themselves and America is actually bringing lots of them over here America just could say Stop No more immigrants at all but they ve been letting people in A lot of people in and they ve been very generous by giving them food and letting them live here in this wonderful country So they ve provided enough I have something I have two things to say I agree with Sophia because I sort of agree with Sophia because if they didn t have 20 they wouldn t have much to live and the government is not really responsible for the immigrants They re responsible for themselves They re on their own and I would like to say is that going back to Sophia s It said that then they were fed well and that they were All wanted to get to America and even if some of them had money how do you know that they didn t have a disease or something How do you know if they didn t have lice or something I kind of agree with you because if they paid more I think they shouldn t get a lot a lot more but I think they should get a little bit more but they still should go to Ellis Island Yeah Sometimes they did have doctors who came on the ships and kind of gave the medical exams to First and Second Class Passengers to make sure they didn t have any diseases And then if their medical exams checked out fine then they could skip everything else So they didn t have to get asked all those questions and they didn t have to wait in all those long lines and things like that So what do you think about that I think it s still unfair that they didn t have to wait in long lines just because they were already examined on the boat I think instead of Ellis Island they should have checked them before they got on the boat for everyone Yeah I agree with you I think they got all seasick Think that s where they all got sick Yeah Like in the Steerage Some of them got sick because they were in Steerage and then when they got to Ellis Island they had to get sent back The reason why some of them got sick was because they didn t have fresh air and so they couldn t breathe that well Stuffy in Steerage I think all doctors should have been actually fair instead of sending some immigrants back just because they don t like them for their religion and stuff Could doctors send people back because they didn t like their religion Doctors could send people back why Doctors couldn t send people back but they would mark letters on your back Why could they mark letters on your back Because they probably thought they probably saw something different when it was actually a scratch So just if you were hurt and then they had to go through further medical exams to see but doctors couldn t just say I don t like you You have to go back They were just examining you to make sure you didn t have a contagious disease that could get other people sick When we were reading they said something about the doctors where they didn t have any diseases or anything but they d still send them back And you read that in the book We were reading one of the things Oh and why would they send them back Why would they get sent back by the legal inspectors and other people Sometimes it was like there were random reasons they sent them Just because Yeah That s not fair That s what you re saying Yeah I d also change the part where they had to why did they have to mark stuff on their own clothes Yeah I mean they should have given a sheet or something Or something Because what if that s the only thing they had You know I think they should mark on their skin or something so then you could just wash it off Like a marker or something No I don t think they should do it on the skin because then if there was a water fountain they could just wash it off and say I m in this line Right True They could They could do that We all agree they should do something other than your own clothes They should give you a sheet of paper and You could rip it apart I think that they way they did it for example that guy in the book did his jacket inside out They should have been kind of more smart about what they gave them Because someone could just say Take this jacket inside out and then go into the other line Or he could just put his jacket on tomorrow Yeah Oh I don t have a jacket Yeah Yeah If we didn t have Ellis Island not as many immigrants would be here probably because it d be a lot harder And Ellis Island they fed you food It was good I like it I agree with Josh because they gave you food and water a place to sleep They built stuff and made kinder cares and made stuff with the little kids and stuff for the grown ups The people that were there at Ellis Island didn t even have to pay for any of that That was all for free I mean imagine that happening to us right now That will never happen I definitely agree with Sophia because if you just come to Ellis Island and they just give you potato soup every meal it s kind of like they don t get a good impression of America I think they try to give a good impression for the immigrants on America from giving them good food and a good way to start their time in America and then they realize how complicated it is Yeah According to everyone I kind of agree It was good I think 
 Well you know what especially after Mrs Bennett taught you the three things she wanted you to do in reading by having you look around the room and skip around the room and flip on the carpet we thought Oh boy that Nathan really needs to do something hands on And I know from you being in Reading Recovery that when you heard a book twice you practically knew it I mean you knew the story You could go somewhere and tell it right Yep When you read the book is it easy for you to retell it What is it like to retell a story that you just read Not so easy for me cause I had to pick up a book look at it for a minute and then I pop it and then I know it Okay if I read a story to you would you be able to go tell it to someone else Yes Okay But right next to me Okay Okay All right well these are the things we re gonna practice And because we don t want to leave out the visual style of learning because it s also an important way to get information we re gonna focus on the auditory and the kinestetic the hearing and the hands on type learning and we re also gonna include some visual so that it will strengthen that part for you But we wanna make sure we re getting you where your strength is Because you are fantastic at listening and doing hands on activities Oh you have a plan in your mind about what kind of castle you re gonna build It s not a castle It s gonna be like when I see that in movies Like a tower like where the Egypt Egyptites The Egyptians Yeah Like a pyramid Yeah Okay cool All right Would you like some extra things like maybe some games or some extra things you can do to help you remember in class Yeah because my teacher she gives us free games like learning games in our math book There s math games and you have to put your thing on it and you have to guess who much it is And if you get it right you stay on there Okay cool Well I want to add some games like that that you re gonna And we re gonna add some things that you can do to help you remember directions in class and remember what Miss Smithson has asked you to do Cause one of the things that I ve noticed is that when Miss Smithson gives you two or three directions you ll start one and then you forget what the other ones are And you re like Ugh what do I do now Yeah because my brain it has so much stuff and because if I get more it kind of breaks the other stuff And you know I wasn t gonna talk about this yet but by you saying that your brain has so much stuff I wanted to remind you about do you know what good listening looks like Uh huh What do good listeners look like Their hands are crisscrossed with their hands in their lap and wherever the teacher goes they keep their eyes on em Okay and then if you have a comment if I say Would anyone like to ask a question or make a comment about what we re learning Let s say I just taught you about Clemson Football Or I like hockey That s my favorite Okay let s say we were learning about hockey The equipment used in hockey okay So if I asked you to either ask me a question or make a comment about what we re learning would you tell me the names of some of the hockey equipment that you know of Or would you ask me a question about a piece of hockey equipment that you ve seen but you don t know what it s called Or would you tell me a story about how you really like hockey Hmmm how I really like hockey I knew you d say that You always do that You remember one of things that Miss McGinnis taught you in Reading Recovery And one of the strengths this is what I love about you one of the things that a lot of people have trouble with when they re reading is that they can t relate what they re reading to themselves or to their lives You are absolutely fantastic with that Fantastic If there s a story of a dog and I have a dog and my dog did the same thing Right So since you re so good at that though sometimes I think that that is one of the things that gets your mind off on on Hey my dog did that Instead of on exactly what your teacher s wanting you to do So one of the things about being a really good listener is to remember what comments and what statements and what questions are necessary for what you re learning And which comments and questions should wait for later even though they re zinging around in your head okay So if I m doing a whole class lesson about different colored fur on dogs and I say Can anyone think of a color that a dog s fur might be What would be a comment you could make Black and brown cause that s what my dog is made out of Okay black and brown All right let s say somebody says blonde somebody else says white and then somebody raises their hand and they say Well I don t know what all colors dogs can be but my dog Sandy is really pretty Is that a comment that is necessary for what we re talking about No Okay so that s one of the things that you can practice And I love your stories and I know Miss Smithson does too And you have a lot of kids and grownups in this school that feel really close to you and we feel like we have a good relationship with you because you do share things about yourself Yeah but I only do that at the beginning of the day the end of the day and at writing Cause I write down the things in writing Good well then I m glad Miss Smithson is also working on this with you because as much as I want to know about you I don t want it to distract you from what it is you re supposed to be thinking about Okay Okay Three more blocks Okay let s talk about some of the things that we re gonna put in place for you okay A couple of em I m pretty excited about okay We re gonna work on your memory with reading and in general with classwork so that when someone tells Nathan what to do Nathan s gonna be able to remember it Instead of getting distracted and thinking Huh I have no idea what I m supposed to do next Yeah because in my class there s some kids Zachary and Brody and the two new kids they re talking in the back And that s can be very distracting can t it Okay do you know how to focus Do you know how to tune people out What do you do when you re distracted in the classroom I just turn around and go like this Okay do you think you know how to tune people out without having to tell them to stop What if you knew they were gonna talk no matter what but you still needed to listen Could you I could do this to block their sound Okay you could That kinda reminds me of the bat we were talking about for some reason It s kinda like you re directing your hearing at one place And sometimes I push it to what I m hearing at So then when I do that in my mouth I can hear it more good without noises from the construction site that s near our house I can focus on it Okay I think that s fantastic what you ve just said You make a conscious effort to focus on what you re trying to hear That what I want you to do when you notice that other people are talking behind you Instead of worrying about what they re doing I want you to focus on what you need to be hearing I want you to stop and think I m not gonna listen to them I m gonna listen to Miss Smithson Okay And see if that helps Just like you strain to hear the construction noises okay All right we re gonna do some fun things with you that I think you re gonna like First of all I know you love video games So one of the things that we ve tried before that doesn t seem to be working very well is Odyssey And I know that when you get on Odyssey you like to choose the math games over the reading games Probably just Why do you choose math over reading Cause I wanna get more math so then I can just focus on reading cause if I m really smart at math I can just drop it so I know everything I know sweetheart It s a lot more fun to do something that you re really good at So we re gonna change up your computer program Instead of having you work on Odyssey during the day instead of Odyssey you re gonna work on a new program called Earobics And it s supposed to be super helpful with your reading skills And Mrs Price the speech teacher whose office is across the hall she said it is really fun and that she knew kids at Griggs Road that did it and they loved it okay So we re gonna try Earobics So we re gonna keep a computer game for you but we re gonna try one that hopefully is gonna work better to help your reading skills come up instead of Odyssey Okay All right The next thing we re gonna do is we re gonna give you a little tape recorder Have you ever had a tape recorder No and I haven t even seen one I know a lot of people don t use tape recorders anymore Most people can record things on their phone and all kinds of gadgets Well I had when I was little I had this little thing and it had a recorder When I would sing a song into the microphone I could record it and then play it to my friends Okay well we re gonna do something like that We re gonna have you if Mrs Smithson is giving directions and then you guys are getting ready to do an assignment or group work or whatever it is she wants you to do she s gonna come over and she s gonna give the directions to you You get to press record on your tape recorder and say the directions yourself into the tape recorder Then you get to stop it and play it back and hear yourself saying the directions Okay Unless you need them we re gonna have you put the little tape recorder away so that it doesn t bother you Like maybe in a pocket behind your seat or something And then only if you get stuck and you think Hmm what did Miss Smithson want me to do can you get out that recorder and listen Yeah or I can have it recording beside me so I could record everything and if I still remember it like it s so easy I can remember it I can just erase it Okay But I think the actual act of hearing it whole group with the rest of the kids in your room hearing it with just Miss Smithson telling it you saying it again yourself and then hearing what you said that may be all you need You may not have to listen to it again I think just making sure you re really concentrating on what the directions are is gonna be a really good thing for ya Okay also oop I gotta get something from over here Okay One of the other things we might do is maybe Miss Smithson might tell you something like give you a direction and she s gonna whisper it in your ear and then you have to whisper it to the person beside you And they re gonna whisper it to the person beside them and it s gonna go around the table until it gets back to you How many of you all sit at one group Five or six I think it s gonna be five cause we got two more kids Okay so sometimes Miss Smithson might say Get out your pencil get out your math book and turn to page 50 Okay So then you have to whisper that into the ear of the person beside you What would you say Get out your pencil and get out your math book and turn to page 50 Okay and then that person would have to whisper it to them Then it s gonna come all the way around and then the last person s gonna say Get out your pencil get out your math book and turn to page 60 Is that right I ll just turn back to em and say It s 50 It s 50 Okay okay That s another way we might make sure that we understand the directions before we get started Sometimes my teacher she just writes it on

the letter that makes the sound that you hear at the beginning of the word worm Worm W W What letter W Good job We have been talking about spring and we have been talking about the seasons of summer and winter and springtime What season are we in right now Winter Winter Very good Well this book Hedgehog is Hungry that s written by Beverley Randell is about a hedgehog And he is asleep during the wintertime And he wakes up in the springtime and he is hungry But first look at this picture Have y all ever seen anything like this before No I saw a hedgehog in a book but not real You ve seen a hedgehogs before in a book but not real Not me Hedgehogs are pokey And when they curl up their little spikes poke out They pop up That s right Why do you think they pop up Cuz that means you re scared That means they re scared Nature protects If a person runs into the pointy stuff they ll say Ouch That s right And it protects them Well as we are reading this book today we re going to read this book

Alright So we re going to read this book to find out what Hedgehog is going to eat Alright why are we reading this book To find out what Hedgehog is going to eat But guess what There s going to be some words in this book that we might not know how to read One of the words we are going to work on today is new high frequency word And remember high frequency words there aren t any rules for them are they We just have to learn the way they look so that we can learn to read them Can you read tell me what this word is Here This is the word here I love how you decoded it We already learned about it We have learned about here Here is on our Word wall Word wall isn t it Excellent job Well today it is important that you not only know how to read words but it s important that you also know how to spell words So I m going to give you the letters that you need I want you to dump them out and I want you to spell here for me I m going to turn this around so you can t look at it And I want you to spell here for me I hear Lilly saying it s Here I spelled it Alright I m going to turn it back around Are you all ready Alright check it H E R E I did it Are you all right What word did you just build Here Here Alright now we can build it so I want you to write it I want you to write the word here Not look at your letters Okay Are you ready Show me how you write the word here And then I ll let you check it again You re almost there What else do you think comes next I think you push harder You want to try pushing harder You think you got it Natalia I put an exclamation mark Here You put an exclamation mark at the end I spelled it You did Alright I m going to turn it around You all ready to check it Did you get it Alright read your word Here Here Very good H A R E here Here It s not A Alright now one way that we can help ourself is by looking at high frequency words and learning all of our high frequency words Our high frequency words are on our word wall So that s one place that you can look if you get stuck Another thing that we can do is we can look at the pictures to help us with the tricky part So we re going to go through and that s what we re going to do right now We are going to look at the pictures Are you ready Hedgehog is hungry That s our title Now what time of year do you think it is Winter Winter It is definitely winter Because all of the leaves are off the tree Because all of the leaves are off the tree Alright let s look at the pictures Now who do you see buried down in the leaves there I see Hedgehog You see Hedgehog Is Hedgehog awake or is he asleep Asleep And you know why he s asleep Because it s winter and he hibernated And he s hibernating Very good turn to the next page Now what season is it What season is it It s spring It s spring And is Hedgehog still asleep No No Hedgehog is awake Let s turn to the next page And there he goes Here he comes He s going out for a little walk What do you think he s doing Find something to eat He s going to find something to eat Let s turn to the next page Hedgehog is hungry And what is the first thing he finds He finds a Snail I was right Uh you were right And me Okay let s turn to the next page He s still hungry He ate worms and caterpillar Okay now that is a very big word caterpillar How did you all know that that was the word caterpillar I saw it right there Alright listen closely You all just told me two strategies you can use to help yourself when you come to a tricky word You can get your mouth ready for the beginning sound Or you can look at the pictures Tell me again You can get your mouth ready for the beginning sound Or you can look at the pictures Okay let s turn to the next page Now what does he find What is that Okay we talked about one of the strategies is we can get our mouth ready for the beginning sound Alright let s run our finger underneath it now Let s look at it Let me write it Let s do Bug Let s spell bug and see How would we spell bug Get your arms ready Is that going to be the word bug No No So we re going to have to look at that This is the word beetle Can you say that word Beetle And look underneath it What do you see underneath it That is a slug Ooooh Now just like eyes are up here Lilly Eyes are up here Okay there we go Just like we can get our mouth ready for the beginning sound you all also know how to decode words Is everybody s eyes up here So we can get our mouth ready for the beginning blend which is sl What sound is the U going to make Uh Because there s only one vowel And what sound s the G going to make Guh Let s blend it together Are you ready Sl u g Slug Now look at me You have three ways now You can look at the pictures You can get your mouth ready for the beginning sound And you can decode words that have one vowel in them Alright let s close our book up All the way up When you are reading I want you to read to find out what Hedgehog eats What is your purpose for reading To find out what hedgehog eats Alright start reading Hedgehog is hungry What did we say he was Use the pictures to help you with the tricky part We said he was a asleep Asleep Good job It wasn t doing that space in there That s right because asleep is one word There s our high frequency word here I m tricked You re tricked Alright so what will you do H un gry Hungry Very good Hedgehog is hungry Good job Slug Good job It does spell the word spring Good job Alright I love the way you all did two things I love the way you can all use your fingers to help you point I saw Lilly stretching lots of words out When she came to a word that she didn t know she got her mouth ready and she stretched those out just like we did with the word slug I saw Poniyota using the pictures help her with the tricky part We are reading to find out what hedgehog ate Do you remember what hedgehog ate Snails He ate snails What was something else he ate A snail A snail What was something else he ate A bug A bug What was something else he ate He ate a beetle bug A beetle bug Alright let s read it and make it sound like talking Hedgehog is hungry Hedgehog is hungry Winter is here Hedgehog is asleep Spring is here Hedgehog wakes up Here comes hedgehog Let s all get together Here we go Hedgehog is hungry Here is a snail Hedgehog is hungry Here is a worm Here is a caterpillar Here is a beetle Here is a slug Hedgehog is hungry in the spring Very good job I am very proud of you all 
 Glue Here we are Compression is really Compression is really getting it Hey guys what ya doin Adding our stuff to this Oh I ve been trying to tell you that this bridge holds one kilogram without breaking A thousand grams Wow That s really good That s probably why you want us to have a railing Uh huh So it doesn t just slide off That s true you do want to keep something on the bridge Well that s very good And we re thinking about it bends a lot so we could do this It s really bendy bendy And you just broke it Don t break it The last time she just dropped it and it splattered all over the place Okay so this is the roadway Yes Okay and then what s going to hold this up We re trying to figure out everything If we get all the pieces and then trying to see what we can do to add it all together Do we have um wait a minute guys we could have one of the railings on the front and the bottom The top and bottom Stick Cause I was thinking we could put this on the bottom Guys like if we had one on the top and bottom like on the movie it would hold it down and up at the same time keeping it flat Hey you know what we could do We could make kind of like a T shape and then bend the top of the stick and then glue it on that way What would you glue that to You say you re bending it into a T shape okay so you d have a T shape Go like Okay Try to bend that Hand me a book we need to put more compression I learned by that idea if I put a book on it it would keep the glue down and it would keep it compressed We need more compression let s get a couple of books Here s another one Also put a kilogram on it Yes you did put a kilogram on it that s true I mean like on there Oh okay So this rail that you have over here that s a truss And as soon as we add this Is that going to be under or above the railway We were deciding to go above Cause it has to have a railing and then below is optional Okay but how is it going to get attached We were trying to figure out that Okay Now we just keep going Okay I will come back and check on you all right Okay give me a couple Popsicle sticks so I can put it underneath Will we put them underneath the thing Oh dang dang dang It s hard because these right here but only two places are touching Oh I see what you mean I don t think it s overlapping because there s the one in between I was just making sure okay Yeah I see what you re saying but I kinda think they work because this is really only touching this and here it touches this one but it s not like it s continuously touching from here to here I was just making sure sheesh you guys Why don t you all tell me more about your bridge Well it s kinda a mix between an arch bridge and just a regular bridge I mean beam bridge Okay can you sit up We re continuing to make our arch but we have run into a problem Okay We decided we re going to put glue on top of here to fill in some of the cracks that we had It would act like cement but we forgot that when glue dries it contracts So the bridge has kind of curled Guys guys Logan we re not in your group we re okay Also I was thinking when we did the arch it might need support under the bottom but the triangle might be a little odd cause it would stand on this end part We could do what we did here Can you get the popsicle stick to be the shape you want it to be Well I was thinking we could just like bend it and put it on that I m going to test this on the weights We need two kilograms if you can get it Now how long is your bridge Have you measured your bridge Our bridge is Are you doing it in metric or in customary We re doing it in customary Customary okay It s 55 cm or 22 inches and 2 cm Okay we re not going to mix measurements It s like 22 and a half inches Okay So if you had 12 is that 12 plus 9 Yeah So 21 and a half maybe Yes Okay You guys I got the two 200 kilogram things so we could Gram I said gram 200 grams It will be heavier than the glue bottle And that way we can use the glue Okay so this is the bridgeway where the cars are going to go The arch is going to be above the roadway No because here you can t fit two cars but it will go smoothly for the rest of it Like we made it so two cars would go right next to each other like we didn t think we could leave the extra space Right but they might take off each other s rear view mirrors Right We ran into that though What could you do about that We don t really know because all of this stuff is dry so far it s holding up quite well Well what if this was only one lane What if you made another one just like it to be the other lane That would be perfect But it would take a good long while No it wouldn t We built this in a couple of days Yeah we could glue it together with like these Yeah okay Perfect Thanks Miss Hoyle All right guys let s start working on that one So are these the same size as these Let s try to make it more even this time Making that is going to take like 50 days We need 50 of these guys right Tell me a little bit about this arch and what it s going to do As you build the arch how is that going to keep your bridge steady Well it s like when the arch gets pulled on it s gonna be secured here so instead of the bridge itself getting the tension it s going to go a little bit like it is now Okay it s going to pull it away A little bit Which means I ve got to get the weight on it So it s going to create the outward thrust Yeah Which with an outward thrust what do you need to have on the sides of the bridge if you have an outward thrust Remember Oh it s uh Abutments do you remember that Yeah You need that something over here to take the force the pressure that s being exerted from the center outward the outward thrust I have a thing with that one it hates me I hate it So have you tried laying your bridge across a 20 inch span Yeah we did it on a desk It caved in a little in the middle but when our arched is finished it ll actually help Tell me why you feel like it caves in in the middle The important thing is what we did was we put glue in between in to act like cement to keep it together Uh huh Well that made it curl a little bit and so it was a little weaker in the middle because that s where it was starting to bend And also partially because it s it s We don t have a lot of support on the bottom which makes the um its tension affected I kind of suggested triangles at the bottom but we haven t really done that yet Yeah that s because we haven t got the arch up yet Oh you mean on the bottom of the bridge Yeah That s a good idea Well we need to start working on it All right well I ll leave you alone and I ll come back and check on you later okay Guys we ve got four of these We need a lot more All right then well let s get going I m going to keep working on the arch okay Wait wait wait that was part of the arch support The first arch needs to get worked on Could you guys make the second road and I ll continue on the arch It needs to get to get built This idea isn t working Maybe we should try to like add this on here so that it doesn t like fall Oh okay And that way the arch will stick to the top and this arch will stick to the bottom Do you girls want to try that Sure sure Also I think it will hold maybe a little better because Nicky it s not all like This is just like that it s still gonna kind of it s still going to kind of stick to this even if we had this idea it d be like that it won t exactly hold that very well Show me how it s going to be touching like this onto there I think yeah well like Like that this way Yeah but like with this on top so like that and then this at the bottom Okay It will hold better now Actually this is the right way here right Yes It s like that okay Yes and then we also figured out um when there s going to be 1000 grams on there it broke in half Oh no This part it kinda snapped It can hold 500 Yeah it can hold 500 It can hold 500 grams Yes and 200 And 200 grams Yes so I don t Oh you tried 700 grams also Yes Okay So that s not bad It kinda snapped here but yeah so um it might be a little more sturdy once we add the like underneath Okay the piers We should add the piers in the middle seriously Well yeah we can add it like side middle and side I feel like we should do it like bang one on that side and one on the other Yeah but it s still with the one on top Yeah Yeah We definitely want it Want it to hold Yeah definitely Yes All right I want to see what s going on over here Right now working on the railing Okay And Molly s doing that by she gluing she s working on the sidewalk right now we re almost done with the railing Okay And what Molly s doing right now is she is we re gluing two popsicle sticks together like this Okay And uh we re going to glue them against here Okay So they can we re probably going to put another popsicle stick like this in the middle so they glue together easily Glue them right here to the side Okay And then we re going to put the railing on the side of this so like on this side like this and then the railing will be on this side so that ll the railing is three inches Brooke said Right So we re almost done with our bridge stuff at this Would it be helpful to work from the bottom to glue the pedestrian bridge would it be helpful to work on it from the bottom Yeah probably would And even though it bends it s bent it s really really strong Uh huh It can hold more than a kilogram Oh that s wonderful Now did you um what kind of force what do we call it when the bridge is bending like that in the middle Um it s compression and tension Tension is pushing it out like this making the sides curl up and then the compression is what makes the bridge Okay so you re going to compensate for that like this So are these your trusses No these are the railings We thought that it would act like a truss Okay Even though we re not going to have one going on the bottom They re going to be on the top It s all going to be on top And you did try laying it across a 20 inch gap We measured it to make sure it s 20 inches Okay good well do want to try measuring a 20 inch gap between a couple of desks and just seeing what it not while it s wet but when it s dry See what it s like What are you doing Molly I m gluing the popsicle sticks together for the start of the sidewalk and then when it s dry I m going to get them to go together like that Okay and then I m going to take my railing How s that going to attach With another popsicle straight up and down attaching the railing to the sidewalk And then just attach the whole thing to the bridge as one piece Okay I was thinking that you guys should take popsicle sticks and put them across the top connecting the two railings together with popsicle sticks at the top Like a covered bridge Yeah So this is for a crab run bridge is that what it s called Yes That s a real bridge that needs to be replaced isn t it Yes And we ve actually figured out what s it s going to be replaced by Oh okay you found it on the internet It s actually it s um a beam bridge But it s not over water it s over rough terrain Okay And it s in Highland County it s way to the It s northwest 
 It s similar to when we had the hand warmer What happens is when you add heat energy to the hand warmer it makes the water rise up So in the glass in the two liter bottle in the glass too the heat lamp added heat to it the heat energy Then the water started to rise up Of the water okay So why do you think the water spilled over last time I think that it s because of the molecules expanding Okay And then the molecules didn t have enough room Well the water didn t have enough room so it had to get out So then it popped out through the tube Okay Do you share the same idea Yeah Do you agree with her Yes Okay Alright Let s talk about this Yes I have something Like with mine we thought that since there was oxygen I mean there was a glass tube that the water had room to expand and like spill out So what s why it did Okay thank you Alright Let me ask you something How many of you put that water molecules expanded Raise your hand As a reason for water spilling Alright Okay They gave you the reason why right So who can tell me why you put that Alright Rebecca I put that because well you see it Well in the bottle lab we had water in there so when it heated up they expanded and they didn t have enough room so they had to it had to come out So molecules got bigger right Yeah If you don t believe molecules got bigger what did you guys think that the water spilled over Yeah I think if the water molecules didn t get bigger I think that the heat caused them to move around and bump into each other Okay so what is the evidence for both of these You played with the water heater Where is the evidence to support this Anybody Anthony Like what I think is that that the steam is like mostly involved with this cause the only type of air water has is steam And like since the water was heated so intensely it had to let out all the air it contained So it spewed out steam Okay thank you very much Good job I m gonna go over with Moorea Why do you think that water You didn t agree with water molecule being expanding right Yeah So what is your evidence that it is not expanding Well I think when we added the heat to the water I think the molecules started getting hotter and the heat was transferred from the lamp to the molecules and they started moving around more Kind of like how sugar makes people like have a sugar rush and kind of move around more and get more excited And then they just needed more room so they spilled out into the tube Okay Now let me ask you something If that is true how come if I press it here it s going down Why Yes Tyshon Because of the heat in your hand What s happening the heat of my hand Right Saron So it goes down faster because the heat in your hand is enclosing around the top I guess So it will make it come down Jake I m not sure but I think it goes down faster yes because of everybody else saying that when you hold from the heat of your hand But I think it s also because gravity pushes things down Okay Alright Alec has two finger means he has something to add I agree with Jake And I also think that since the water went down it s because it had more room at the bottom So when you put your hand around it it immediately goes down also because of gravity and how it has more room How did you come up with that answer Well when you were holding the top I saw that the bottom was empty And like so I thought that cause of gravity when you hold it at the top it has more room to go down But if you hold the bottom Look at the whole bottom Hold the bottom What s happening It s right there It s against the gravity It s going up So hold on I m gonna provide the evidence about the result This is computer simulation Watch this carefully I want you to watch this carefully And look at this The right side is water Okay the right side is water And did I turn the heat on Yeah Yeah Okay So who turned it off I m gonna reset it Okay And then heat is off Watch Look at air and water molecule Let s look at the water molecules first since we re doing the liquid part Are you with me Yeah Alright What is happening to water molecule Write it down with your group You ve got 30 seconds Talk to the group Molecules are vibrating very slightly Since the water s mostly cooled down more than the air it s more stable It s like doesn t vibrate as much as air cause water is like more still and more like a solid than air Okay Please observe everything And I m going to be asking you questions Alright And here we go I m gonna turn the heat on As a group you need do discuss and write everything down what you see here Just the air I mean I m sorry Just observe the water yes Everything okay Here we go Group Water only Okay now discuss with your group Alright Water only The water molecules they aren t moving around like the air ones but they re vibrating They re moving like back and forth They re vibrating like really violently They re staying in the same general area Like But the water ones are like I m sorry the molecules in the air are bouncing around and when the heat is applied they start bouncing around faster I agree with Maor but I think that with the air ones that they have more room to bounce around That the water is all contained in one thing So the molecules have to stay in one position but the air has to What do you think ladies You haven t said anything I think the same thing as Maor because the air molecules have more room to the surrounding because it s really nothing in there And since water is a liquid it has less room Whatever I see that the more the heat gets on the water Alright 30 more seconds So we re gonna start the discussion There are people who need more time to write but you already know what to do So here we are Okay I m gonna call on individuals so please do so You don t have to stand up Ivree I saw that when you turned on the lamp it started vibrating faster than Which one We re talking about which one The water Okay Vibrating faster Joon Po you think through The temperature also started rising very little Excellent Dylan what else did you notice I m noticing that when the heat is on the water is starting to vibrate very fast when it s turned on but they are staying stationary they re not actually moving anymore So why do you think the water molecules are vibrating Chelsea Because of the heat that is going on to the molecules So what you re saying is the heat source is going to molecules Class What do you call the heat source Which is the lamp What is it Heat energy Heat energy Very good So in this case I don t know if you agree with Chelsea Raise your hand How many of you disagree Raise your hand Alright How many of you agree with Chelsea Raise your hand Okay Alright The molecules are transferring energy The heat energy is transferring heat to the energy Thank you very much Now next part I m going to give you a life problem to solve And I want you to come up with solutions Okay How many like to play ping pong Oh excellent You know I grew up playing ping pong because in Asian culture ping pong s a lot cheaper to purchase than basketballs So most every home has ping pong or ping pong table because it s easy to make out of wood Now having said that Suppose you received a set of ping pong balls for holiday because you asked for it from your parents and your parents being really nice and you behaved really well They decide to give you these ping pong balls you got The problem is you lost all of them except one And your best friend came over to play with this But he stepped on it on accident So now here s a dent Right he has to fix it Can you fix it You re all worried Because you ve never seen anybody can fix this So give me some suggestions by talking to your group Alright You have buddies back up there alright Kind of like the water bottle right Especially like you can fix another part Maybe you could do the same thing with the ping pong ball Like if you start to squish the ping pong balls down and maybe you could its place It d be easier to pop it out I think you can apply air You can apply air like with heat Like at least heat Cause you know when the heat was added to the water Right Like you could apply air with a little Do you need more time Like the thing Okay So I m going to write the solution alright by asking group that has an answer Just stand up one at a time the group that hasn t answered yet Alright So here s a solution Say ping pong ball dilemma Alright Okay number one Which group is gonna be Just stand up Just stand up if you haven t spoke in this group We already thought that you could try and use your hands and like pop the air back into it and get it to its original shape Okay Alright number two Something different Which group that hasn t spoken yet Okay Chelsea s group Alec said that if you push around the edges it might pop back into shape So kind of the same thing Yes We think that somehow if you maybe poked a hole in it you can use like an air pump or some sort of machine to get the air in it and maybe the air will push against the dent And make it a sphere again Let s see how many of you believe this dilemma raise your hand Okay Alright How many of you believe this is gonna work Raise your hand How many believe this is gonna work Alright Is there a third option anybody Okay Yes I don t know if this will work but maybe you can put in front of a lamp Okay Excellent start But why would you put it in front a lamp Let me ask you something Maybe so that the molecules in it like in the water example maybe they ll start like vibrate No you re okay Well it s air so You want to add heat energy right Yeah you want to add heat Alright so we re gonna try all of those So let s try with number one So I m going to give Sasha a ping pong ball that s been dented by my best friend Or not my best friend Her best friend so she s gonna try to do it Okay number two is what Pop a hole in it So how many of you disagree with this Or of this idea Why would you disagree with this idea Dylan Because if you poked a hole in it it would be kind of like ruin it and release all this stuff and it would be kind of hard to Okay What are you ruining in this case The ping pong ball In other words What you re saying is a surface of the thing Yeah Okay Did you try Yeah like it s really hard So it s actually hard to pop it back in Let s see Who s strong Me Okay You re strong She wants to do it If she doesn t work then let s do it Okay how about the lamp Lamp thingy So Let s see Are you the one that says the Come on over Okay Leave it like this Turn the heater on Okay On the top yeah that s it The other way There you go Right there Yeah there you got it Oh okay Oh what happened It helps if it s connected isn t it Okay Try that again There So we re gonna time it While we re working on this for a couple minutes Okay Alright Okay Alright So who has the ping pong now The dent was too strong Okay now Look at the ping pong ball I m gonna show it to you Okay look You saw it right All of you What happened It has more dents Not only the dent What else It broke Is this gonna work That s completely ruined What did that do Nothing Alright so let s say first idea is no good Okay So second idea poke a hole We agreed that it s not gonna work because it s gonna compromise How many of you agree with that It s gonna compromise the shape of the thing Okay Alright the third idea Alright It s about a minute Nothing s happening Okay Do you have any other suggestions Who hasn t said anything Sydney I think maybe you could like put it between your hands because it might work the same as the lamp but just faster Okay So how many agree that looks like both of you if I m not mistaken that you have to have some kind of heat right You said because I said because like the water it needs room to expand Well it s not actually expanding but it needs room to move so the ball will probably expand Okay I m gonna show you this simulation Is there something Yes Dylan Yeah I want to add Maybe it would work better under a stronger heat source Okay like a sun Yeah like Okay Can I tell you something that I did before the class I put it under the lighter and the ping pong went like pshhh You know to be honest with you the ash was big as this one That was it I was looking for ping pong ball It ll burn Alright now I want to show you this simulation again Okay So bear with me here You all said the two things I m gonna talk about You all said the molecules were expanding meaning molecules are getting bigger right Tell me Is this molecule getting bigger No Okay so molecules are not getting bigger How many of you believe it s not getting bigger Remember simulation is evidence Is that what is happening Like many of you said already Jake They re moving around really fast in the space For air and water they re vibrating So look at the air this time Alright The air So class which one would you say is moving faster Air Okay So air is moving faster Okay we re gonna discuss this next step So everyone s gonna get a big picture You have a question I need to see the finger thing Yes I have a I guess reason Well I have another thing that I noticed about that I guess you could say I think that the reason why the water molecules are moving slower is because the water is taking up space and they can t travel around that fast because in the air there s really nothing in there that s stopping them from moving But I guess you can compare it to us when we re swimming under water We move slower than we normally do on land Yeah So air molecules are moving really fast right So what s happening as it s moving very fast Sydney you have something to add Okay I was just gonna say if you look at water it sort of looks like it s in an invisible cage And it s trying to move around but it can t So it s restricted It doesn t move as well 
 What I m going to do is we are going to use these projects to help students at our school Mrs Ess s class is not the only class that has had problems with students accidentally plagiarizing And that was the original reason that you guys came here today because somebody in another class had plagiarized something accidentally in Mrs Ess s class Your projects today are going to be used in other classrooms So we re going to have a contest We re going to pick the 5 best Powerpoints and we re going to send them out to other classrooms to help students learn why they shouldn t plagiarize Now some of you are already experts at Powerpoint We re not learning how to do Powerpoint right now A lot of you already know how to summarize because you learned to summarize in Mrs Ess s class So you have that experience There was a disconnect where you didn t put the two together So what we re doing right now is we re saying okay I know how to summarize now I know how to avoid plagiarism So let s start working right now You have your rubric Look at your rubric If you have a question raise your hand and I ll come and explain it And we re going to start right this very second So go ahead and get into Powerpoint and do your powerpoint If you re going to be doing something different like making a newspaper a brochure or maybe a podcast then you re going to start working on that And I am just going to walk around you guys Our focus is plagiarism and the way we avoid plagiarism is through focusing on summarizing So you can refer back to your notes Remember you used your Cornell notes the other day when you were here and we went online and you took a summarization quiz and tutoring session I ll be right there in a second Yes I m sorry Okay David Yes yes absolutely I m sorry I ll be back to you in a moment Yes I think that would be a great idea We re focusing on plagiarism and we ve learned about how summarization is one of the ways to avoid it Right Okay I m sorry Sure Very good Oh great you re back up Okay tissues are behind the globe Can you go get one for me Okay have you been helped You have to know how to spell it Right over there on the board How s it going Cathy Pretty much Take off the S I like that though It was good You need some help Mr Phillip No thank you You re fine What you re doing is looking through here at all the requirements So when you use your creativity to put this together And I yes what does this word mean Okay So multimedia basically means that it could be either Powerpoint or a podcast So you need all of these to get the highest grade So if you come up with something additional you re going to get a higher grade This part you did here is basically your method of memorization which would be number 3 How is it going Pretty good Now remember if you re taking a definition of plagiarism from a website then you really need to say where you got that There s a way of doing that You re going to state where you got that and when it was yes That s okay You re going to use your own words It s interesting how different all of these look Yes you can You definitely can I also have some books available They re hiding You could Eric use this book too I ve got you marked right here Would anyone else like a dictionary You can get an online definition too Okay I ve got them marked You can find it easily that way Can we use our paper to take notes Yes of course you can If that would help you Cathy Have you gotten to Powerpoint yet No Do you know how to do that Oh good Okay David I m sorry I ve got it in this book too Is that your second slide or your first slide My first Okay Okay like I said before the purpose of doing this is to try to help other students in our school And a lot of you already know ways of avoiding plagiarism Maybe you were even aware that you were plagiarizing And we ve been focusing on summarizing Of course there s another way you can do it Paraphrasing is a little bit harder but we re focusing on summarizing And besides summarizing another thing that you can do with summarizing is still giving credit to where it came from Yes Hang on Okay What was this Animoto video telling us Can someone raise their hand and Yes Brandy Telling you not to plagiarize Telling you not to plagiarize Very good So if that s what you were thinking you are thinking about what we re going to talk about today which is plagiarism Now I m going to go on the internet right now and we re going to look at the definition of plagiarism Well actually we re going to look at the definition for plagiarize which is to steal and pass off as your own So you can think of internet plagiarism as equal to Cheating Cheating and that is considered Academic misconduct Academic misconduct and that s when you get in big trouble sometimes Now we re going to watch a TeacherTube video about plagiarism So you will be using your worksheet and we re going to hear a story about this kid named Billy and you ve got some bubbles here So right here in the central box is what you re going to write down you re going to write in this box and you can t write anything yet because nothing s happened so far but you re going to write about what Billy did And in the little circles right here you re going to write the causes why it probably happened and you re going to predict what happens to Billy So we re going to start right now so I want everybody to listen carefully Here we go Mrs Calstad Hey Mr Harris I have to show you this research report by Billy He did it on horses It sounds really good The pictures are good too Oh I love horses let me see it Wow Mr Harris this is really good I told you it was But you know what it kind of sounds familiar I ve seen a lot of students looking at this website called allhorses info and I think it s some of this exact same information I think we should check it out Let s pull it up Sure Here s the website Mr Harris and it says right here The horse has been one of the most popular domesticated animals for centuries What does Billy s report say The horse has been one of the most popular domesticated animals for centuries So it s the exact same sentence That s not good That s not good That s cheating And look at that picture too It s the exact same photo That is the exact same photo Did Billy give credit to his sources anywhere on that page No I don t see it anywhere No Well that s a pretty serious thing I ve heard of students in college being expelled for that Really Yes I think they call it plagiarism when you copy someone else s work and don t give them credit and that s a shame because all Billy had to do was write down where he got his facts and give some credit to that photo too How could he have written his report differently Well if you look at his first sentence when it says The horse has been one of the most popular domesticated animals for centuries he just could ve changed the words a little bit Maybe he could have explained what domesticated means I don t think that s a word that he would use a lot I see what you mean What could he have done with this picture though Well he could use this picture If he took the picture himself he wouldn t have to do anything but if he did take it from this website which it looks like he did he d just need to copy the web address down at the top and that would be it That way he could give the photographer credit for that person s work So what you re saying is it s okay to use facts from other sources just put them in your own words Correct And be sure to include in your report who wrote these facts Exactly and as far as the photos go you can use a photo as long as you include the web address that s on your screen and I think in library and psychology class you and I will work on that with students so everyone will know how they can properly give credit to their sources We definitely will That sounds good Now we just need to talk to Billy about this Sounds like a plan Where is that Billy Okay you have your work sheets Let s start filling them out right now Make sure your name s on your paper and we won t take too long we ve got some extra time as well So when you start writing if you have a question raise your hand You re going to do the predicted cause and the predicted effects Now while you re filling these out I m also going to ask a question I want to do a quick question What do you think happened to Billy Can somebody raise their hand and tell me What do you think might happen to Billy He got in trouble with the teacher He probably got in trouble with the teacher Anybody else Detention And possibly detention yes Suspension Say it one more time A suspension Very good Okay Now let s do a quick think pair share Okay what is the message of this video So talk to you neighbor Let s think in a pair Talk to your neighbor The person sitting right next to you Cassie you work with Brandy Brandy you work with Santiago Talk to your neighbor real quick Your question is what is the message of this video Okay we re going to stop right now Raise your hand if you can share if you can share out right now Yes He could use facts and research Very good So if he used facts and research information in his own words this wouldn t have happened Yes He has to give credit to the original site or the place he got it Very good Thank you Cassie that was great Okay So now we ve done our video and I just wanted to say that as a sixth grader I made a big mistake Before they had the internet I used an encyclopedia set and I copied stuff into my report and I thought Here s the information I didn t realize I was actually plagiarizing it because I didn t put it in my own words So now what we re going to do is we re going to move over to our renaissance responders So right now you re all logged in and I am going to go over to that right now and we have a survey So it s all re programmed and we re ready to go and what we re going to do is we re going to flip our paper to the back side and you ve got your questions right here We re doing an anonymous survey to find out how you feel about plagiarism So I don t want you to feel that it s going to be something that I m going to know your response to because it really is going to be anonymous and I want you to circle the answer that is the most popular response to the group So when you look up here you re going to see a graph and you re going to circle the answer that is the most popular and you re going to star the answer that is the second most popular Okay What is the level of plagiarism at our school You have three choices students do not plagiarize very often that s letter A B about half of the students plagiarize C almost everyone plagiarizes Go ahead and respond Now we re going to look at the graph and we re waiting for everybody to respond right now and I m looking and I can see some people have responded and some people have not responded On your paper you will be circling the most popular response and you re starring the second most popular response Can somebody tell me what the most popular response is right now A A Okay and that was students don t plagiarize very often That s good to know So go ahead and mark on your paper right now A has a circle around it for number one and our second most popular response actually is C and E so both of those will get starred I m so sorry did I say E I meant C I think that what happened is somebody made a response in a column that they shouldn t have made a response in that column So they answered the wrong question So you did it the proper way We re going to move on to our question number two 
 What do you think it is going to be this time I think it s going to be like negative 57 59 Maybe like 54 or something Colder or hotter You don t need to touch You don t need to touch it You and your temperature I got a playing with your Go down The temperature is going to go down with the ice It was 22 22 no not 22 You think ice the temperature is going to go down The water went up It s your choice how much of anything you put in Should we put a lot A little more A little more Why don t you dump it into Not the whole thing Yeah Oh Don t put it all in like that There s hardly any room Ready Go Science is kind of messy isn t it It s okay Just put it back in there and work together Tell me when to go Ready Ready and start What do you think I think it s going to be like maybe 20 degrees Or maybe negative 10 We ll just have to see 40 Jacob 40 No it s 50 40 50 degrees it s almost It s 50 degrees Jake It s 50 degrees It s 50 degrees Jake What s he doing So where s the line Try to put one in Oh so now you get it Where s the line And it s 40 40 comes out like 44 What s the temperature It changed 44 It says 40 No it s 44 Jacob it doesn t matter What are you having a dispute about here get out now It was right here So it s on It s not even gone down And now it went up to what Well a little higher than that Yours went up so what did how do you know Jacob by looking at the thermometer how it went up or down Explain to me I know how it went up because I see because if you turn your head away and then you look at it it went up You think so How do you read this though Are they There s five lines right let s see but how do you break it up so you can read it to get from 70 to 80 How do you break that up Jacob do you know Um Right you count by twos Okay you guys get busy I m interrupting your experimental time you re scientists here Down all the way down Just color it up to 50 Down 30 I wonder what was in it I think it s salt I don t think it s salt Last time I used last time I used it it went down and then it went down even more That s what I told you It s floating I m breathing in good water Water What happened Use the thermometer Ready set go one more I think it s going to get colder and I think it s going to get I think it s going to get negative 10 What do you think Emily Zero degrees Maybe negative zero I m not sure there is a negative zero It s like frost all over it Cold Frost right here Whatever was in it makes it go down Temperature go down makes frost Mystery is salt The mystery grain is salt The mystery grain is salt it s melting the ice And it s condensing on the outside Ready guys Five four What do you guys think it is What do you think the temperature s going to be this time I don t know Lower than 50 555 degrees That would be toasty Got to be lower One two three four five I see that most of you have finished your experiment I would like to call and see I m going to get some questions Take it out Okay eight I have questions Teagan your group needs to come to me please Thank you very good Jacob what did you notice between the base temperature and the first time when you put the water in what happened I noticed that when the base temperature when we put in the base temperature it was only water it only changed by one degree It only changed by one degree Very good Number nine who s number nine Kayla Kayla What did you guys notice about the temperature We What happened to it what happened to the temperature It went down It went down What happened to your can who knows Think about that take a minute with your group I want you to talk about what s happening to your can and why So maybe it got frost for They get more frost on it When I put and it got yellow The water was clear and then it got yellow when we put salt in It got dirty _ It looks like lemonade It s all mushy The stuff is looking to the ice that And making it squishy Okay one two three four five come back to me for a minute I pulled number five Number five what is happening to your can It s getting frost on it It s getting frost on it Why do you think it s getting frost What did your group think that it was getting frost on it from The ice and the mystery ingredient The mystery ingredient and the ice are making the can frosty What did we learn about with the weather cycle we talked about that what s really happening Talk in your group is it the can making the water come on in and make the frost Talk in your group and figure out if you guys know what s coming that s making the stuff on the outside of the can There is water on the side of the can Maybe the mystery thing Making condensation on the can And because I learned a lot about that I think the mystery one and the ice did it together That could be Yeah that could be And combined and then it created frost on the outside of the can I think that the water the mystery ingredient Okay one two three four five Number three what is making your can get the frost or the wet stuff what s that wet stuff called Ella Condensation It s called condensation What do you why is that happening to your can Number three that s you right Luke Okay what s happening Because it s like evaporating and when it touches the cold can then it turns back into cold water What s evaporating Stop don t answer that Think in your group what he said it s evaporating and then it s touching the can What s touching the can Talk in your group figure out if you can figure out what s coming to touch your can So well really it can Yeah it s kind of melting so the water is on the can So it s the mushy icky I know whatever mystery stuff Now I ll take it It makes me and then it makes water water water Everything you know water How will Eve s last question Nope we re just asking questions right this second You guys need to wait then we re gonna One two three four five come back to me Number 19 who s 19 Ella Okay Ella What is happening to make that can wet on the outside The water and the ice well the water tries to evaporate but since there s ice at the top it hits the ice and then it comes back down But then it gets on the can So the water you think the water in the the can itself is coming and making that water come back on and catch that hit the ice Good thought let s keep going let s see if we can get some more Who is number 12 Hayden Hayden s not here so let s move on and let s find number nine Who s number nine Kayla Kayla Kayla what s happening to your can what s happening to it and why It frosting It s frosting 
 What are you noticing about it compared to these two This one s light brown These are all dark So I think this one s not getting enough water So we should water it What s happening because it s not getting enough water It s like drying out What s happening to the seed The seed is dying It can t grow And the seed s gonna die Yeah Because what s the first stage of a life cycle And you have water in it It s a seed Yeah And then it sprouts But on this one all stems are dying Oh wow that looks really dry So which one are you measuring We re measuring water Okay let s measure it Let me measure it Okay let s measure it and let s record how tall it is I don t know how you use it Yeah almost four inches Centimeters Here I ll measure it Seven and a half centimeters Can you hold it yeah Maybe if you hold it Oh no it came out It s okay It s alright we ll just Ours came out and then it s still good Just hold him up It s six centimeters Okay let s check Wow it s growing two times enough Keep it there and let s see Let s see if the rest of your group agrees Yeah I agree That leaf is up to six centimeters Okay so what in in a week how much has it grown It s grown three Three centimeters Three centimeters yeah Three centimeters Okay write and record it So that s parsley Write write Why do you think parsley is doing so much better than roma tomato Because the tomato is like a tomato has one thing and parsley has the same thing and they come out What do you mean the same I think maybe because parsley Because parsley has a rose it s easier because because a tomato has more time to grow because it like it s the kind of vegetable that has Which is actually even drier Can you guys help her out Can you help her out I think well I think that s growing better than the roma tomatoes Is tomato a fruit Day one Like it s growing a fruit that s what the tomato is Like a vegetable it s the fruit of the plant Yeah That we eat But I think that what I think it s important is that we grow this Yes Yes they ll grow at different times Once they grow it ll grow fast Yeah we started this one planting faster right We started this one two weeks later Do you think we need to water the tomato more though Yeah When you look at the parsley and feel feel how wet that one is And it s doing so well I know Compared to the tomato maybe we need to water more Yes Is this parse It s the parts No it s the gender I think they need to get more sun and water Okay so Abby s measuring her tomato I did it What do you guys want to do Do you want to do the top of the leaf or should we do the top of the stem Top of the leaf Top of the leaf The leaf is part of the plant Okay so you re putting it down all the way down Down and round It s four Okay It s four Alright Four So every single time when you measure this plant are you gonna measure the top of the leaf not the top of the stem Is that what you re going to do Yeah It started four sessions ago It started four sessions ago This one started two weeks before This one Let s look at the measurements and how much for growing can you compare these two What are some things that you notice I notice that It s grown three and a quarter centimeters Everything else won t be able to have two more centimeters G plant Can you tell me which one s growing quicker This one are pregnant Are you sure about that Yes Actually maybe because This started out and this one not so here before Okay and we started this one when We started this on I mean two weeks ago Two weeks after this one Yeah So even though this one was started later what s happened It s growing More Faster taller yup Okay Why do you think and you guys even noticed that it was dry and it s still growing faster Yeah So should we keep water should we water it more and see what happens Yeah What do you want to do I want to want to since there s no more seeds in there because we took two of them out and then the other one died I think we should grow more seeds in there and then water it and see what happens Okay go ahead you can plant it And there are sometimes seeds they just won t germinate They re sometimes just like a bad seed and they just won t they won t grow Maybe that s what happened to this one too Can I go through and bob it But in the inside of it it looks very dark But the outside of it does So maybe it s not as dry as we thought Yeah Now we have to take measurements again We ll just see if that helps There s only this one left Let s look at this seed What do you notice about it I know for we came from last time when we grow the parsley this seed is way bigger than that parsley seed These are not dead How about compared to the sunflower seed or a pumpkin seed It s really small And things can use the lines smaller maybe because they re smaller things or like a sunflower Oh so you think maybe the seed the size of the seed tells you how big the plant is going to be Yeah Okay On that some of the tomatoes are as big as that or bigger than that Sometimes the seeds are how they start out are smaller but sometimes the shape of it sometimes determines the shape of it sometimes but others not You mean the seed tells you the shape of the plant Sometimes yeah It could What about a flower or something Flowers seeds are different They all look different No So is that always the case No But some of your classmates have plants that are gonna grow bigger And so maybe we should ask them about theirs and find out if their plant is growing faster or slower compared to these two plants than yours And maybe we can see if the seed size makes a difference Alright you guys can get online Yeah you can go ahead and water it One in here and one in here And then I want you to go to that website and start your graphs when you e done You might want to water it a lot more Let me try And then over it We finished watering our plants Do we each get a computer We need help When we type into trying capitals in it it deleted our numbers So Okay We didn t know what was wrong Well you have your title Plant Type Let s be more specific because you re not doing all the plants What plant are you graphing right now Swiss chard And Kale Did you measure them already Yeah And then we drag the numbers but then they don t I think it s because of all that room James where is your measurement for swiss chard for today Right here You want to record that Swiss chard And kale was What was kale again Seven This height look correct No What are we missing Do you guys notice The up need Oh I notice There you go alright Okay so what s going to be your label for your bar graph That s the one going along the bottom The bottom the plant height How high the plant reading Are you gonna what are you gonna graph then for your bars Hmm What do we always look at when we re thinking about our graphs We always go back to our data table right What are we gonna do instead of getting ahead or not Seven centimeters for kale You re gonna have to put kale right there I know It s just that was the big plan I think I m on the tail now because Okay you have what s this one That was eggplant Okay And this is swiss chard Yeah Well here s that why don t you measure that You haven t measured it yet About five centimeters Did you agree Walt Yeah about five centimeters Is that what you got too Yeah So why are we gonna have a graph for just swiss chard and just kale Or are we gonna have a graph for both together What would be easier Both together I think Should we put it together How would we do that How would you merge that I think like both should have their own bar like in the same graph I think so too So which plant do you want to graph today Are you gonna do swiss chard or kale They really needed help Let s do kale Let s look at kale Okay What s kale Here s the kale Which one are we measuring James what did you get for the height for kale Seven centimeters Okay look see if Andrew gets seven Yeah about seven Okay And what was the height of it last week James So Andrew knows It was six centimeters Okay it was six centimeters So just put six centimeters here There you go Okay so lets fix this let s just make it kale height Or grow And then what s this what are you gonna put at the bottom Look at your table The height of kale Is that gonna go along the bottom How tall it was like in day one and day two Let s look What were the labels for our table Date and measurement Okay so that s what we re going with So the measurement will be on the bottom and the date is on the side Do you guys agree James You think that s right Okay we ll try it Go date and then go ahead and type measurement Should we have a unit on it since we re talking about measurement Mhmm Okay So the whole point of And what s in row one One four 13 Okay write that You re gonna put the date there Will would you like a turn Mhm Instead of doing commas if you re gonna write it like that you re gonna put a dash in between I m gonna have Will Will type this time We ll take turns So type in the date Okay and then what would go here under the What are you gonna graph Like what s gonna be the bar graph part Six centimeters No no the height was the another beam So type that in 
 Yeah I wanna talk to you some more This is cool that s probably how you attract them is start doing this Hey tell me why you think Adam he s able to do this again Because he has these legs like his legs stick to the ground so I think they can do it because they stick to the ground to get the strength then he pulls it up and he does it again Hey that sounds like a connection to what we ve been learning about the structures and the functions Yeah so when it s time to start making those connections I really want you to write that down with your team Just make sure that that gets on your paper Okay I want you writing out how many paper clips is this beetle pulling Two grams Two grams right now mathematician get busy Okay I m gonna keep putting another one on here to make sure Put four on there let s see if he can do it with four Hey little buddy don t don t don t No no no no pull him away What am I doing He s making a sound He s making a sound He s making a hiss He s making a hissing sound You think Why do you think he s hissing Maybe because he thinks we re trying to hurt him Yeah for self defense Yeah alright Let me go check in with some other teams You all keep working on your beetle Okay What s going on at your all s beetle team He s pulling The beetle is pulling two times its weight Two times right now Yeah So how many paper clips is that that he s pulling Two Three three He s pulling three Your beetle s not moving You think it s because of the loudness Yeah Class city class should you be going to other team s beetles I know it s fun and I know it s interesting but should you be going to other team s experiments No ma am You need to be engaged with your team Okay We re trying to Okay Did he pull two He s pulled two and then we re gonna He has pulled two Okay So let s see let s just give him a little nudge in the rear When I put a pencil right here he ll go after it Oh well see if that works do you think I know like earlier he was trying to get out of the bucket Let s see if he can pull it He s doing it He s moving Oh my gosh I see he s moving some but I haven t seen the paper clips move yet that s what we have to wait and see Are the paper clips going to move Wait I have to do my job They re moving They re moving So he just pulled three grams Okay so Did the beetle pull three grams Beth where s your sheet Go ahead help Talk to each other about what s happening Woah you can t hold him you have to leave him on the table Wrecking ball Somebody pick these up I got it You hold him up good teamwork You hold him up You re hurting him you re hurting him There we go now we ve got four paper clips on there Now lets put the paper clips behind him Now Talk to each other Talk to each other I think he s I think he ll be able to pull many many many Right now I think the beetle may be able to pull Eight eight That s how many we have Oh this team over here has eight I might need to go over Woah wait wait wait Get a green Let s see him in action I am noticing that we underestimated our beetles didn t we We underestimated our beetles didn t we Yeah Our beetles may be able to pull more than we anticipated We can do nine Okay Not yet not yet Keep working mathematicians keep track He s going Talk to me team about what s going on He can talk It can pull nine times It pulled eight Its body weight It is pulling nine times its body weight Wow how many paper clips is nine times its body weight Nine grams Nine grams Holy moly Did any of you all predict that this beetle would be able to pull nine grams No we only did all four We only thought four he d pull four We only thought four We only thought four Okay are you all making any connections How in the world is this beetle able to pull nine grams of paper clips Nine times its body weight What do you think Oh now look when it s on the desk is it able to do it No its harder for him to do it on the desk Why can t it do it on the desk I think he might have a better grip on the construction paper What grips better What structure is gripping better on that construction paper Because it has It s because it s got it s got like suction cups and I guess it s not used to the slippery desk It has claws to pull it It s pulling it I think it looks really It s what Abby Even though it s really loud in here its still moving It s still moving even though it s loud in here that s right I think it just wants to go to Justice You think the beetle s trying to go to Justice I don t know about that Are you gonna try a tenth paper clip Yep Yes Look look ten Ten paperclips Let s see He s taking your pencil He s wants to get your pencil Oh why do you think Because it s wood Because he likes wood And what type of animal is the beetle Bess Betsy beetle But what do they do Why do they eat wood They are It s pulling ten Why does the bess beetle eat wood Look at him I don t know if he s pulling ten or not Look at him Because he s a decomposer He is a de He is barely pulling ten He s having to work really really hard Yeah I think it s probably time to stop adding them to the beetle you think I put max Maximum is ten Do you think we can add Class city class if your beetle is struggling and like arching its back and like flipping its legs but it s barely pulling it it may be time for you to give the beetle we don t wanna be mean to the beetle Our max was ten Okay So we re left on thank you for taking them off Alright class city class Yes baby yes Put your eyes on me Oh I m waiting I m waiting Thank you Most of us have come to the point where the beetle is struggling okay And having a hard time pulling the weight At this point if your beetle is struggling it is time to start the summarizer and the connector job Okay so I wanna hear you talking summarizing connecting what has happened Let s give him a rest Yeah let s give him Wait don t pull that Oh my gosh How many is he pulling Seven Okay here I ll bring you some more Where are the rest of your paper clips Right there Get off He s starting pulling Okay oh be nice to my beetle friend I m trying to He keeps on getting his foot stuck to my hand Hi little buddy Oh I almost touched it We learned before that beetles Hang on you re learning that beetles what That beetles are really strong but with their little legs and their thorax maybe Their thorax you think is what makes them really strong Because the thorax it may be the biggest part in their body Yeah it is probably the biggest part What else on their legs what on their legs are helping it Their Look at it I know what it is Their The thing that s sticking to the table and helping it move faster Okay so the sticky part on their feet Here let me do it Yeah okay You all have done a really nice job noticing what structures of this beetle are helping it to be so strong How do you think it uses that in the wild Like out in nature How do you think it uses that It s functional and it almost You may even think it s cool but he could use his wings to fly away Some beetles do have wings to fly away but what do you think is I need you in your seat Nathan what do you think it s using to move Its that s a lot of strength Its abdomen Right okay its abdomen is but in nature What might it use that for It might use it to catch its prey maybe Okay what does it What does it do What does it eat It may eat Casey say it again to your team Organic and it breaks it down It breaks it down What is that called What type of insect would It s a it s a d A d A d A d A D A disposer Not a disposer close A decomposer That s it Not a disposer but a decomposer good And so okay think it s okay Think about if it was trying to dig into the wood of a tree Wouldn t it have to be really strong It can make a hole In the wood of the tree That little thing the little might be to decompose the wood So it can bite and then break down It s really gonna have to be biting harder Yeah that mouth part is really strong to bite Okay so now may I have your attention how many do you have We have 10 You have 10 and it s pulling it let s send him home I want 11 They re moving look at his legs how hard they re trying to pull You might he might be able to pull 11 I m gonna give him one extra No No 12 Okay you all keep working on that you re doing a great job Thank you I wanna come back to my very first team Carrying 10 10 Ours can carry 11 Yeah It did Yeah And he pooped on the paper Okay it pooped Twice It pooped twice Yeah twice Okay let me put this here I don t know where to put it There we go So what are you doing Are you adding 11 We re gonna see our 11 puller You re gonna do 11 What connections can you make The legs are like a crayfish The legs are like a crayfish Yeah How They have joints They re jointed How do you think those joints help that beetle to pull 11 times its body weight The beetle is like a able to grab on Yes so Tim s saying something say it loud It helps it walk It helps it walk but And escape from predators And escape from predators how Because What might it do with those powerful legs What did we notice them doing in their containers They get under the what They get under the rocks and the dirt Like Tim like when he was on the corner Tim was like picking him up and he was holding on to the paper He was holding the paper Tim lift him up Okay Oh yeah it s neat I can make a connection What s your connection If we didn t have jointed legs we couldn t walk up stairs if we didn t have jointed legs If we didn t have jointed legs we couldn t walk upstairs right Is that what you said Coner You re okay You re okay Alright I want you talking to each other Help Halle she s writing down some of your connections Help her team help her Talk to Halle What s another thing The aphid s have pincers and the bess just have Tim s telling you something It has little like claws Hang on Tim s telling you something Listen to Tim The aphids have pincers and the beetle has these things that helps it eat out the wood They look like little They look like pinchers The beetle has a pincher like a crayfish A pincher like a Oh this could pull 11 Good connecting keep connecting 
 It s probably three Because five to the third is 125 Alright so let s test that out Can I use my calculator You can have your guy test it out here Oh The other thing to work on is the pronunciation of this This is something that is unusual because it s got that subscript Read that first line up at the top where it says pronouncing logarithmic equations Log base b of x equals y Yeah so can you transfer that pronunciation to for example the one in example six How would you say that out loud Log base two of eight equals It s three Equals three So that s how we say these things out loud Log base two of eight The little number this subscript is the base Keep going you guys are doing fantastic Speak up The log of 10 000 is four Forgot I don t have a pencil You re off No pencil In number nine is it one For number nine Yeah When the log when the base is equal to X When B is equal to X it will be one So would 10 be negative one Uh 10 yeah negative one Oh I think I get it now And then 11 would be Negative three Negative three yeah It s like the power stable thing you know Yeah It s like four to the y would be equal to this Yeah So 12 and 13 would be zero Let s see Yeah Yep Okay Pretty easy Yeah and What s 14 14 is one half So again what you re saying is If it s a fraction or if like like for 14 Yeah It d be a fraction So 14 came out a fraction or a decimal of half Yeah So that what about that one made you think it s going to come out a fraction versus the other ones that were all integers The other ones were integers because in the log the little exponent there Mmhm is less than the actual number Okay let s work on the pronunciation because this is something that s brand new as far as how to say this thing out loud Let s go back up to the top where it says read this out loud So Matt I ll have you Are you the what is your role here We re professors here Oh so that s a good role for you So why don t you speak that out loud Log base root of x equals y Yeah now I want you to say the first example out loud Log base of log base five of 25 equals 2 Yeah so it s hard to pronounce it Yeah But the little number that s down is what Uh base Yeah so it s the base So when we say it we re gonna say base little number whatever it is Alright so now say what you were saying before either of you guys You told me why it comes out a fraction How will you recognize it comes out a negative number When the y or when the x is a fraction and the log base is a whole number Okay yeah so like which examples do that Ten and eleven Alright that s good How will you recognize if it comes out as zero See any patterns for the ones that log If the x is a 1 Alright yeah Why does that make sense Have you figured it out Like any number to the power of 1 is itself or no it s zero Or I mean not any number to the power of zero is one Exactly Alright you re very you re getting right to the idea of what a log is How will you recognize the ones that will come out one without calculating X equals the base Okay well said Why does that make sense in terms of exponents Cause if you divide itself it ll equal one Can you give me an example of an exponential equation that might look like this one Because that s the next thing we re going to try to do Seven to the fifth power Seven to the one equals seven Good having done all of this can you say what a log is in one word A single word It s like the power of Mmhm it s the exponent Yeah Good a log is an exponent Now what I d like you to do is try to do the bottom ones based on what your understanding of log is yeah Woah oh oh oh oh It would be Don t stop So it s gotta be two Take the so the first one would be 32 because basically the base is the actual number and the answer to the logarithm is the actual number So right to the there Yeah so 32 Something with Something to the fourth Yeah Maybe five five to the fourth Five to the Execuse you So 59 is One 52 equals one So it d be 59 Yeah 18 would be Just three Is it a thousand Yeah a thousand You put ten thousand I have a question Yeah For this one what s the for this one what s the log No well yeah I don t know The log of what I think I understand your question but you first have to figure out the way to read these things Read that part that first because the pronunciation is challenging at first Log base b of x equals y Alright so now read example Well we know example four is three So the log is three So read example four out loud So log three of 27 equals three Good except I want you to say the word base in there Okay log base three of 27 equals three Perfect so I think your question was about examples seven and eight So what s the base Wouldn t the base be one it s just not there It s not there Here s the question the answers the logs came out two for number seven and four for number eight Go back to what you guys were saying about an exponential equation What s equivalent to that Oh if it s not there the base is ten Alright so can you write the equivalent exponential equation for example seven Ten squared equals 100 Ten squared equals 100 Does it still work for that Is that void Mmhm Because it would be ten to the fourth equals But I thought he just said the base was one Well he said the base was one He thought it might be Oh it s not It turns out it s ten Okay So the base if not written is ten I want you to check this two ways Who s our calculator person here Alright so Brandon I want you just to type in the log but just use this button It s next to the seven Just type in log of 100 So if he doesn t use any base it comes out as two Now try it with the log base on the new operating system log base ten of 100 Log base ten of 100 Mmhm See if that still works Two It turns out it s sort of optional If there s no base what is the base Nothing No it s a certain thing So if there s no base written like all of the other ones had a base written Okay If there s no base written it s saying what s the number to raise a certain base to to get 100 And this one came out two So what s the number that you can use as a base squared to get 100 Ten Yeah so if there s no base the base applied is ten And it turns out you can write it or not So what I d like you guys to do is as you re working through these also consider what would be an equivalent exponential equation for each of the ones that you re taught So just do all of the ones at the bottom and then go back and do it again Yeah sure And the one s at the bottom you can t just type into the calculator So you got to kind of think a little bit about what would be the relationship there Then for like any number in there That s a really good insight How come that s the case Because anything to the zero power is one You got it Yeah Except for one number There s one number you can t put there Zero Yeah good job You got it good job Thank you 20 would be 81 I wasn t even close So ten alright so ten to the third would be 1000 For 18 wouldn t it be a thousand supposed to be base is implied to be ten Ten to the third would be 1000 I m not sure For 18 I don t know Alright Alright say it again except this time include the word base Log base of log base of eight Wait log base of eight equals zero Close Log base eight Log base eight of one equals zero That s it exactly yeah Okay So we say base where s the base always on a log equation Under the exponent Yeah its a subscript it s down A subscript So I d like you to pronounce number 12 Log three of one equals zero Close I want you to get the word base in there Log base three of one equals zero Yeah and that way if you re always saying what the base is when you create an equivalent exponential function it s going to be a lot easier So next to each one of these let s do a few together Let s do the top row going one six 11 I want you to write an exponential equation using 5 25 and 2 So it would just be five squared equals 25 Exactly What s the base in that equation It s five Yeah So you did two cubed equals eight Yeah Yeah so now you recognize you guys correctly identified that a log can be summarized as an exponent Yeah that s good Each of these numbers is an exponent What d you notice about the ones that came up zero Would you be able to recognize those and predict Any number works for it Really What do you mean any number works for it For this one Oh I see for that last one You could put any number here other than zero Yes I thought it was one but they had got it One works but so does two So does two three four and five I m wondering about the ones like 12 and 13 How would you predict or recognize in the future that the log is going to be zero If it has a one for the X For the X yeah Mmhm yep I think there s a fancy mathy word called a characteristic for that But we don t use that word very often But yeah you could say the x cause that s how it showed up in our first equation Sure How will you recognize that it s going to come out a negative number If it has a fraction in it Mmhm As the X Okay well said yeah Why does that make sense in terms of what you know about exponents On the green chart whatever is on the left side and whatever s left Yeah Our powers table You re talking about all of our fractions here Yeah How about the ones that came out with one as the log The log was one They have the same base and the same x value And what about this one This is a fraction so Yeah how come it had a negative log Well I know it s because it s a fraction Can you write an equivalent exponential equation Two to the no two to the negative one Mmhm equals it doesn t equal this right Actually it does Two to the negative one equals half Okay Yep Okay so that s correct 
 Right here Okay so is that gonna tell us what one of our asymptotes is Yeah Yes because your asymptote is where this would be undefined right So it s gonna be X equals what Positive two Positive but okay if we put positive two there we have two plus two So it d be negative two Negative two that s why we have an asymptote that X equals negative two okay Now is there another number out here No No so what would that other number be See there is one here but there s not one here So it d just be zero So it d just be zero So does that tell you what your other asymptote is Y equals zero cause f of x stands for that s your y isn t it Okay So you can tell by looking at the function itself what your asymptotes are gonna be Okay tell me what this asymptote s gonna be your x your vertical asymptote Zero Zero X equals zero so you re gonna be drawing your asymptote right there What about your y Remember how we covered this up and you would have y equals what Negative one Negative one y plus negative one So the function itself tells you your asymptotes doesn t it Okay does that help Yeah Okay All right so No but it s like that right here though But see she has negative two Right here Then how did she get the did we write the first one wrong then Cause x equals zero No because she got zero and negative two and that s what I got You wrote it down wrong Where Right here cause zero is supposed to be on top Oh so no never mind you got it right It s the same I just switched these around No but you re right because you know how x is vertical okay so for this one it s going to be the x is going to be negative 2 right Mm hmm Okay I got it So wait the asymptote isn t the same thing as the parent function right No Did you have the graph Did it turn out And how do you know up here Check this thing out Huh So what would the parent function be That s what I was trying to work out for you Did you find the parent function For what It s not x squared is it One over x All of them is going to be one over x Cause you can t just put x She said put a one divided by x That d be the parent function All right How do you know which is the parent function It s the one that s consistent That first one that you put It s the one that s exactly in between the first and third quadrant This is your parent function This is your parent function This one and this one right So blue right there and right there But you totally ruined it Yeah Yeah the colors I used are kind of weird Do you have a red Are you using it This is the graph right So if it s the first one and the third one right Hey wait that first thingy comes out at negative three not negative two Hm This first little line right here comes out negative three not negative two Is the parent function still I mean is the asymptote still negative two I think So how is one negative two You gotta switch it because the one x plus two when you use the calculator you go into a negative so the y would be zero because it s not going to negative How would the y be zero the y is a negative You got em switched all you gotta do is switch em I m not understanding She busy Okay Oh I know why It s because we don t have no y in the equation Like this one it d have a y The y would be negative one And on this one we don t have it so automatically the y would be zero and the x would be negative two That makes more sense All right you got it Yeah I had to think about that So that s how you do it So then the asymptote is the right here Uh huh Which one So then the translation is the down one Wait what The translation is the down one So what is this down Let me plug it in Divide by x parentheses One over divided by x minus one Okay so we don t need no parenthesis No I m almost done You re crossing it that s the y yeah But that s the x This is x and this is y Yes Well look on the sheet It will show you that um I basically used this one as an example It s like the same type of format that the problem is Okay Okay yeah that makes sense So the asymptote is zero It says h equals x Yeah Yeah so zero yeah wait Yeah This is the graph you start with Yeah that makes more sense cause that s how the graph is Okay we got the asymptote X equals is it zero Yeah and then y equals negative one And the translation is one unit down Do you have a value Yeah Uh oh So it d be three units down We would put this on negative three cause that s y So since it s y we would have to put it on negative three and zero Right Cause it s the same as this Yeah And then y equals negative three Yeah x equals zero and y equals negative three Translation three units down Wherever the lines like go the furthest but don t touch Okay Oh you re just marking down the asymptotes Yeah She said she forgot yeah so I guess you can just put up there yellow Okay Are you on number four Yes So on number four it would be five units to the left Number four yeah yeah you re good Okay She just told me she just told I just wrote it wrong I guess then How do you know how to graph it with Like in the calculator In here And it s really not good to graph it here Yeah Okay This seems to be not that hard now that I get it Really Like remember how Grayson thought that it was three I knew she was wrong I mean I didn t think it was wrong You just instinctively knew that it was wrong Is it going to have a vertical shift also Yep up down down Okay up or down Down how many Two On number five Oh three It would be three Three Okay so you re going to have two shifts on number five right Okay Uh huh I haven t plugged it in yet We re going to have a shift here right What would make that undefined If x equals How about positive two Because two minus two is zero I mean the zero is where you needed to be So x equals two right Okay now what are we going to do with this thing out here That s a vertical shift of y equals negative three Y equals negative three So we have two translations okay Two units right and 
 Megan what quadrant am I going to be centered in Quadrant four Good okay so I m gonna go to the right six and down five I know my radius is three root seven Now this may be a little difficult for you because three root seven is kind of a hard number to wrap your mind around Any thoughts on how we can tell which quadrants this goes into I want to know if it goes into quadrant one first Twink what could we do Do you un simplify it so when it gets through the center it d be like square root of 63 and then you like have so it s in between eight nine or I know it s in between seven and eight Okay did you guys follow her on that Yeah Yeah okay so Twink knows that this decimal is going to be between seven and eight because she knows it s the square root of 63 And the square root of 64 is eight So it s just below eight All right So you may be able to picture a decimal in your mind close to eight but not quite so we re armed with that knowledge true or false this circle goes into quadrant one Melissa Agree No Ben Yes it does go into quadrant one Do you have anything to back that up Yeah because it only the center point is down six and if we go up one more than that at least James It s down five and since it s more than seven it s gotta be at least past the two There were a lot of pronouns there What James was saying is we re five units below the x axis the radius is seven point something units long so we re going to top out right around there There s the top of our circle okay Let s speed up this process a little bit here The is it going to go into quadrant three Yes Why Abby Simpson Because it s over six and yeah you count seven the other way Okay Or a little over seven So we re going to be there Oh and now for the great dilemma will this circle go into quadrant two Robert what am I going to have to resort to The distance formula I can t hear you The distance formula Okay give me some more pairs to plug into this formula William Zero sorry zero minus six squared and then zero plus five squared All right Now what is the square root of 61 in simplified radical form Rue Is it just square root of 61 Good maybe that was a trick question Maybe not it s not going to break down any further because 61 is what type of number again Prime Prime okay so we ve got square root of 61 Robert you told me to use distance formula I used distance formula I followed your orders to the T I still don t know if this goes into quadrant two or not It does not The circle doesn t make it to quadrant two No So you re saying it does this Yes Prove it Well if you actually put I don t know Call on someone else please Maddie Since you know that your radius is the square root of 63 and that s a larger number than the square root of 61 it therefore passes the origin and it goes into the opposite quadrant or quadrant two in this case So you re saying it goes like that Correct Is that good enough for your piece of mind The radius is longer than it needs to be to reach And therefore yeah you re right Moral of the story The circle goes through all four quadrants So far we ve kind of been in been there done that land and so now I m going to take you into some new stuff right now The x and y intercepts First the x intercepts of this graph How am I going to find where this circle collides with the x axis Let me ask an intermediate question what do you know about every x intercept in the universe They all have something in common Abby All of their lines like the y equals zero What I m sorry Okay all like the y s equal zero like the y Which variable Y Equals Zero One more time Y equals zero Okay does that makes sense to you guys Yeah Because if you do go up or down to plot your ordered pair I ve got bad news for you you re not on the x axis any more Thus it s not an x intercept All right just one more time Abby I forgot what you had said earlier Y equals zero Okay so how am I going to find my x intercepts here Twink I have a question does it like the circle cross over x like the x axis twice Well we ll find out if it does I mean sometimes doesn t it Yeah So what do you do if it does So this is the first time in your math careers where you might have two x intercepts Colliding once and coming back down and colliding again with the x axis that s good instincts And I ll just warn you right now yeah we re going to have two x intercepts here Maddie how are we going to find these two We use the formula of a circle and we plug in for y zero Okay so let s get the equation up here because I forgot to write it earlier Josh Ah I don t remember Ella May X squared X squared plus or minus six Or no x minus six Okay Squared plus y Plus five Squared equals 63 Okay Maddie now we have our equation and you said to do what to it Since you know you have when you re looking for an x intercept you re always going to have zero for your y Oh Abby told us that Yeah you have your y in that formula equal zero Literally literally Well we ve got to see what x is Ben Well I know but that s it Does it make sense to you Yeah It isn t that hard of a concept and that s why I had Abby repeat it eight times If you get that y literally has to be zero you understand why you literally make y zero and then solve for x We re finding here s one of the ordered pairs right here that we re searching for and I ll be darned if the y is gonna be zero The question is what s the x All right so I ve got x minus six squared Plus I m just going to write five squared equals 63 So according to my calculations we have that right there Mason You forgot that middle term It should be minus 12 x Yeah or something like that You forgot the middle term You forgot like the something x Yeah it d be x squared minus 12 x and then plus 36 Oh so I need to square both those terms Yes no wait what d you say I just wanted to square the x and square the negative six No you didn t you wanted to square the whole thing Okay which means we utilize what process in math What s that called again Twink Foil Foil we had forgotten our oi Ben Where did we get 12 x from Vanessa We squared x minus six so we used factoring We did x minus Now do you see where we get it from Ben Okay thank you Ben What to do with the 63 what to do what to do Mason Do you just combine like subtract 63 from both sides combine all the like terms of the whole numbers and then you have a quadratic equation Okay Well now I have a quadratic trinomial and it s arranged in what What do we call that Kate Ellie Descending order Mm hm Nice so let s try and factor that Michelle you re shaking your head like no way It doesn t work Well all right then I guess we re stuck That s so stupid Don t we have to do the quadratic formula Yes if only I could remember that though It s been such a long time Sing the song You tell me the song I ll actually write the line pertinent to this problem what s the first line Keep going Plus or minus the root of b squared minus 4 a c all over 2a Okay I m going to do some of the math for you and then I m going to have you do some of the math for me because I m more interested in seeing that you can do this So I get 12 plus or minus the square root of 152 over two Now normally normally I would have you guys simplify that and give me exact answers But it s hard on a graph for you guys to see where something like 12 plus root 152 is I mean that s kind of an abstract So we re actually I m going to let you do decimals here So here s what I want to do Kevin s row through Sarah s row I want you guys to find the plus branch so you do plus You two rows find the minus As soon as you get an answer real quietly and quickly check with a neighbor and make sure we have confirmation Let s go to the nearest hundredth Okay if you ve got an answer that corresponds to what your neighbor got regroup Regroup Ellie If you ve got the same answer as your neighbor raise your hand right now over here So Melissa what was the value of x you got 12 2 12 2 what is it to the nearest hundredth Oh 12 16 12 16 All right that sounds about right And then over here my branch with the negative sine in there Ellie Negative 0 16 Okay now let s not lose sight of big picture here Context what the heck s going on Why have we been trying to chase down x and why are we getting two different answers And which one is right and which one s extraneous Help me make sense of all this now that the procedure is done Michelle Neither of them are extraneous because the circle hits the x axis at two points So what are my two x intercepts 12 16 and negative 16 In ordered pair form 12 16 zero and negative 16 zero There s that one right there makes sense And then the 12 16 zero hopefully you have room on your paper I don t have room on the board for that Should be somewhere over here It s a good pit stop moment right here Pull off to the side of the road Stop for a second are you sure this makes sense to you 
 Now what you just did was count how many times you made a successful Eric you made a successful throw and how many times you made a successful catch out of 10 All right we re going to use that information that you just gathered to answer the questions on this form that you ve got You each should have your own reflection sheet all right and I m going to allow you to as a group as a partnership I m going to allow you to talk about the answers together which is just fine because with your partner helping you you might learn something about your throwing ability or catching ability that you might not have picked up on your own All right so Now if you look at the backside if you start here each of you should have your sheet in front of you OK and you should have a pencil or you have and I m going to read this to you to help you best understand it This is a chart to help you gauge your abilities and for your progress from the start of throwing the Frisbee up to this point It s broken up into four categories One you see where I m pointing at here It says Beginning Two Developing Three Proficient and Four Excellent So the question you have to ask yourself is Am I still in beginning stages of throwing Frisbee In other words do I use correct Frisbee throwing form sometimes Two it says Do I use correct form some to most of the time Three proficient Do I use correct form when throwing the Frisbee or catching the Frisbee most of the time And four excellent Do I use correct form all of the time All right So this is what you are going to test yourself on I ll read it to you and as I read it to you I want you to mark the boxes Again you can talk to your partner and make this assessment with your partner if you d like So sitting with your partner you re talking about it I m going to read it as we go Number one movement Do you move to meet the Frisbee s expected location Are you at the beginning stages of that developing stages proficient stages or are you excellent at it Do you always move to meet the Frisbee s location Sometimes most of the time or rarely Give yourself a check in the box of where you think that belongs Body position OK this is how you position yourself to the oncoming Frisbee aside from moving to it this is how you square your body with it Are you in the beginning stages where you rarely do it well are you in the developing stages where you do it sometimes the proficient stages where you do it most of the time or are you in the excellent stage where you do it all of the time Ask yourself that question Feel free to discuss it with your partner All right so you should be checking the boxes You should be checking the boxes That s right there The boxes are already checked Next Hand position When catching the Frisbee do you use proper hand positioning with your palms together fingers opening rarely That makes you in the beginning stage Sometimes That s your developing stage Do you do it most of the time That puts you in the proficient stage Do you do it always That puts you in the excellent stage What do you think What is your target What would you put a grade on Now when it comes to the throwing the same things apply Your stance and your elbow Are you at the beginning And I m not going to go into detail with each one of these now I think you get the idea of how these check Are you at the beginning stage the developing stage the proficient stage or the excellent stage When it comes to your stance and your elbow position When it comes to wrist snap and point OK what stage are you at Are you rarely sometimes mostly or always Again beginning developing proficient or excellent And then lastly when it comes to releasing the Frisbee what stage do you think you re at the beginning the developing the proficient or the excellent So I want you to just think about that reflect on that but I m not grading you on this I m not grading you on your ability Hey Mike would you sit up for me Thanks bud I want you just to reflect on what you have learned and your ability All right Now with your partner I want you to turn the page over and it says Frisbee throw reflections OK and then we have some questions that we need to answer We discussed what angular momentum was we discussed what force absorption was and we discussed what force reduction was With your partner I want you to answer those questions that you see one through seven Number one why is angular momentum important Two describe force reduction Three describe force absorption Four considering You don t have to do this I m just reading them out loud before you do it Considering the fitness components of speed agility endurance and balance to which sports would you compare Ultimate Frisbee If you think about when we were playing Ultimate the game of Ultimate what sports would you compare that to Football No you have do it with your partner And a couple more questions Where can Frisbee be played for fun What are two popular Frisbee activities that you are aware of You already know one that we played in class You might know of another two And then lastly based on the activity you did just before we sat here how many times did you catch your Frisbee out of 10 and how many times did you accurately throw the Frisbee out of 10 OK So go ahead with your partner and go ahead and start answering those questions to the best of your ability You guys should be working off one another and sharing your answers ready set go Do we basically No just rewrite it Force absorption You absorb the force when you Describe force absorption Yeah OK start with that and maybe go a little farther and describe what makes it To learn today We re going to begin a unit on indoor ultimate frisbee and we ve got the indoor soft styrofoam frisbee all right One thing about the frisbee I want you to understand number one it s styrofoam That means you can easily break them All right please don t bend them like I m doing here any more than I just did Obviously tugging on them pulling them poking them is going to harm the frisbee You want it to be intact so just use the frisbee as it s meant to be used and don t play with it in any other way okay So that way we keep the frisbee in good shape Now here is the question we want to answer why do frisbees fly A lot of different reasons and a lot of these reasons have to do with the concept of flight All right like an airplane like a helicopter or a paper airplane okay Now frisbee flight s a little different than some other types of flight Firstly we re going to look at this angular momentum big word but the concept of angular momentum essentially means that frisbees fly one of the reasons why frisbees fly and maintain stability in flight is because they spin So the fact that the frisbees spin is called angular momentum All right and again that s what produces stability in the air You find angular momentum in a lot of things You guys ever use a top a spinning top Yes at home That s an act of a football as a top If I just balance this football it ll fall right It doesn t remain upright But when I spin the football like a top it maintains its upright position That is angular momentum That is why it does not fall down The force of friction will eventually slow down the football and that s why it will topple over and fall but while it s spinning angular momentum is what keeps it up When a frisbee spins the reason why it doesn t wobble in flight and fall from the air is because it s supposed to spin as you can see there and that s what keeps it stable That s also what helps us to throw it accurately Another concept is angular lift Angular lift like an airplane There s different pressures above and below the wing These concepts are really complicated if you look into them in detail but the basic gist of this concept is that there s a low pressure on top and a high pressure on the bottom and when I throw the airplane that pressure difference is what gives it lift and allows it to fly okay Now one thing I m going to do before I throw this airplane is I m going to use force Force production I produce force behind the plane and that allows it to fly In the same way I will produce force behind the frisbee and that will allow it to fly The other end is force absorption which we ll talk about in just a minute So again aerodynamic lift is when the pressure differences allow this airplane to lift and I m going to produce force for that to happen Can I go get it No we ll leave that there all right Now I need one person to demonstrate how to throw the frisbee properly Julia please I ll have you stand here now watch You re going to listen I m going to go over this one time with you and then you re going to use these checklists on the cones to teach one another how to do it properly Now I know a lot of you listen please I know a lot of you would like when you do the frisbee you can throw the frisbee but there s one The difference between really just throwing the frisbee and understanding how to throw the frisbee Understanding the mechanics behind it okay So the mechanics behind throwing a frisbee are just this the mechanics behind a frisbee are this number one I need to know my target Two when throwing a frisbee you step with the same foot Not the opposite foot like when you throw a baseball but rather I step with the same foot I m going to point my elbow at my target I m going to curl my wrist and bring the frisbee across my chest Girls I need you to pay attention If you miss this instruction it s going to be more complicated later So I m going to step towards my target frisbee curled up to my chest and then point my elbow at my target Now when I extend my elbow I m going to snap my wrist That s going to create the spin that gives this one two three Angular momentum Angular momentum And that s what s going to give it stability So I m going to step point the elbow snap the wrist point to my target produce force and on the other end what Julia s going to do once I throw it is she s going to use force absorption She s going to catch it Fundamentals of catching Julia what I d like you to do is square yourself with the frisbee If the frisbee moves to your right I want you to move to your right okay If it moves to your left I want you to move to your left Because you want to meet it and square your body to it And last I want you to put your hands in this position palms together and fingers out All right they don t have to be touching but we re going to try to pancake the frisbee All right hopefully my throw goes well Here we go Step elbow oh wrist snap release One more thing I forgot to mention release it level with the ground If I release it at an angle here it s going to go up or down this way if I release it at an angle here it s going to go up or down this way So release it level one more thing to remember Ready Step nice try Don t laugh don t laugh All right I want you to try the same thing I want you to step with the same foot point your elbow in and when you throw throw it point your finger at me remember to release it level You re ready go Yes It s all right you can grab it with one hand there s no problem with that That frisbee had good spin on it all right She released it did she release it level No No that s why it bounced off the wall One more time step elbow wrist snap point release level Good catch Nice one dude Here you go you got it Perfect Now I could have moved to the side a little bit to catch that frisbee but I did a little reach and that s okay too All right so with your groups of four remember wait wait wait You re going to coach your partner in throwing and catching use the checklist on the cones Ready set grab one frisbee go Can I stand here You and you here You re going to be here You guys are all working together you re going to hold this Wait wait wait There should be two on each cone one person holding the cone Stop where s your partner You re going to coach her throwing You re going to go first and I want you to catch it and then throw it to her and you re going to be catching and every couple tries we re going to switch Okay pick up your cone and coach Pick up your cone You re the instructor he s going to catch right All right You re the instructor you should watch her One two three frisbee Make sure you re reading and helping All right practice a couple times and three stop Stop stop stop Now with the catch with the force absorption okay You re absorbing that throw listen I know that the throws aren t all going to be accurate that s all the more reason why you have to move to where you think the frisbee s going to land and meet the oncoming frisbee okay So with your partner s help coach s help keep practicing and we re going to switch in just a minute Make sure you correct any improper technique 
 What are some other indicators that tell us I m in my target heart rate range Yes By the categories on your RPE chart Okay your RPE Chart you could use that That s exactly right How about within your body What s something that your body can tell you that you re in that target heart rate range Yes young lady Um the way you breath and how you re feeling Okay good your breathing your feeling some of you want to come in here and work out and then talk about how that your legs startin to hurt and your thighs are startin to be sore All those things are physical ways that your body s sayin Hey I m doin a good job in this workout I m within my target heart rate range When we do this today I want you to kind of take a mental picture Let take a mental picture of This is how my body feels when I m in my target heart rate range Whether your lower end or higher end take a mental picture so that when you re out walking or not walking but when you re out running or playing soccer or playing basketball or things like that you can kind of have an idea how you re feelin with those with those things and you can know whether you re close to being in your target heart rate range Now one of the last things is is we filled out that family health history that each of you has there and some of you had some different things on that health history from heart disease to high blood pressure those types of things The cardio workout that we re doin today what areas is that gonna positively impact on that family health history for you Who knows that What are some of those areas Okay Let s get you there Amy It ll help prevent heart disease high blood pressure and diabetes Okay the heart disease that s exactly right Good cardio high blood pressure it s gonna bring the blood pressure down Also diabetes Along with high blood pressure you got high cholesterol All of those areas cardio is going to positively impact those areas Okay The yes What do I need to lose weight Okay to lose weight That s a question I get a lot of time If you want to lose weight ideally you want to be in the upper end of your target heart rate range or about 80 however you do actually at about you do burn more cal fat calories at about 60 but you re gonna burn more calories at 80 because it s a more intense workout okay So really ideally you d want to be within your target heart rate range Typically up towards the higher end will be a little better because if you re gonna be able to burn a few more calories than at the lower end Okay Any other questions on anything All right we re gonna get started here You ve already got your target heart rates there I want you to look here and I want you to send that text to this poll everywhere to where your target heart rate zone is What is your zone And we ll notice this most of you you know we ve all figured it out You ll notice percentage wise where most of you are gonna stand or where most of you are gonna be in the chart We start all the way down at 100 go all the way up to above 176 You ll start to see that that most likely that 151 to 175 that s gonna be our biggest area here that we re gonna fall into You can see right there we re at 75 So most of you in here where s our target heart rate range In between Between 151 and 175 There you go between 151 and 175 That is right on the money for young adults your age If you re at that 176 or higher that s not a problem but that is an area where you know anything over about 185 or so then it just means that you ve got to bring your heart rate up a little bit higher compared to most people So most people though again are gonna be in that 151 to 175 That s a good job Okay go ahead and go to your machines here Lay your clip boards off to the side If you want to listen to your ipod or to your music you can only one ear phone though only one ear piece Make sure you put your cell phones up in the cubby there we ll do something with those a little bit later And where we re gonna start with here is we re gonna start together We re gonna start with a two minute workout On this workout two minute warm up All we re gonna do is get warmed up You need to be out on the bike somewhere around 40 rpms Ellipticals about the same thing 35 to 40 rpms On the treadmills around three speed will be a good good place to start with Is everybody good we ready to go Yes Are we good back there You all set Okay all right here we go Startin on two minutes And start All right so make sure that we got those magnets on there Bump that up to about three or so Just to get warmed up This is just gonna get your heart rate up a little bit Now at the end of this warm up we re gonna check where your heart rate is we re gonna check that and you ll notice it will be a little bit elevated compared to compared to you know what it was for a resting heart rate You most likely will not be though in your target heart rate zone right here after this warm up About halfway through Good job Anytime you work folks you should always do a warm up Now we ve already stretched and done some a little bit of jogging down there in the gym before we came up here So you ve got some warm up but anytime you go to a fitness room you want to make sure that you do a little bit of warm up Don t jump right in to it You re gonna have a tendency to pull some muscles and have a lot more soreness and injury risk for you Good job everybody doin good Yes As we do this I m gonna come along and ask you where you are on your RPE chart periodically Cause I want to know how your body s feeling Just kind of look at that and gauge where ever you are Okay Let s go ahead and get a heart rate check here Real quick put your hands on the sensors let s get that heart rate checked As soon as you get that heart rate check go ahead and stop your machine hop off and we re gonna record that under heart rate one real quick under the warm up Okay stop your machine there Record that heart rate As soon as we get this go ahead lay those back off to the side we re gonna hop back over here and we re gonna start goin through the workout Now the workout s gonna be 10 minutes Again bikes you outta be pumpin out about 80 to 85 of your RPMs there Ellipticals probably somewhere between 70 and 75 We really want to try to push this so at the five minute mark you re within that target heart rate zone Anybody right now in their target heart rate zone No No A little bit elevated from the resting though Yes Okay all right Let s go ahead and start At the five minute mark we will check it again and we will check that heart rate what your heart rate is We won t get off the machines again until the work out s over Caroline Now again on your own once we get into this a couple minutes on your own if you want to kind of gauge where you are and check those sensors you re more than welcome to do that You just don t want to do it the whole time you re working out and that ll kind of give you an idea where you re standing If you need if you re below your lower end of that target heart rate go ahead and bump up the resistance a little bit if that s the case as we continue on through this Are you all doin good Where are we on the chart At 3 That s good You all could do this for an hour huh There you go How you doin over there Where are you on your chart Two That s good Three Three Two I d say around two Two Two Ladies how we doin over here How you feelin on your chart Three Three Yeah You good Russell Yeah Okay Andy how you feelin Where are you on your chart About four How do you feel good Where are you on your chart Doin good Most of you you re all about a two three four range right now Now we re just getting to the start of the work out but here in a few minutes that s probably gonna change Might be changing right now Probably startin to feel a little bit of fatigue breathing s becoming a little bit more difficult We re gonna do a heart rate check in two minutes Again remember I want you mental picture in your mind How is my body feeling when I m in that target heart rate range Doing a good job good job Okay we got one more minute and we re gonna get a heart rate check here If you re feelin like your in that 4 to 6 range you might be able to go ahead and up your up your intensity just a little bit there up your speed maybe up your resistance a little bit Russell did you forget to put your phone on vibrate Yeah That s all right buddy Just don t mess with it while you re on the bike okay I mean while you re on the treadmill Okay Okay hard to do hard to do anything with a phone while you re running All right let s go ahead and get a heart rate check here Get a quick check Remember what this number is This is gonna be heart rate number two on your chart We want to be within that range now If you re not we need to up your resistance If you re at the lower end I want to try to get on up towards the higher end about that 80 mark So if that s the case bump your speed a little bit up your resistance if you need to We re gonna get one more check here in about four and a half minutes About 65 I m in my range Nice nice Where are you on your RPE chart Uh about four About four Four or five Hey anytime you know if you re saying God I just can t get my heart rate up there if you re on the treadmill increase that elevation a little bit Elliptical if you increase the resistance then you ll start to feel it How s Callie back here She s startin to get it right now aren t ya How are you all on your chart Five or six Where are you all on your chart Five Five Six Where are you guys on your chart probably around four Ladies how we doin Where are you on your chart About six Six Yes How are you Russell Six seven How about you Six Six Dale where are you Three four Three four You need to increase your resistance I mean your elevation a little bit How about you Four Four Most of you are comin up on that chart Comin up Okay we re gettin ready to do another check here Good A couple more minutes here Everybody doing okay Yup Are you startin to feel some of the signs we talked about fatigue in the legs Yes I know it s hard to talk right now A little more difficult breathing Startin to feel it a little bit more now aren t you yeah a little bit How s it going back here My legs are like rubber So now you know you just got increase that resistance a little bit and keep it at the same RPMs One mile Kyle Okay in thirty seconds here we re gonna get a heart rate check Then we re going into the cool down You really push it right here You re about to jump off the elliptical aren t you Good Okay let s get a heart rate check here Heart rate check Grab those sensors Remember this number When you get this number when you ve got this go ahead and bring your speed on down We re goin into the cool down phase Make sure you remember what that number was What was your heart rate Uh 170 I m about 169 In your cool down phase now There you go good good Did we get in there in your range in your range Everybody in your range Great good job Did you stay in heart rate range Good Now did anybody on that RPE chart ever feel like you got up to about an eight or a nine Yes You did Yes Up there All right Did ya ll get in your range Yup Did you get within your range Was ya ll on your upper end or towards the lower end Upper end Tried to go up How about you guys Did you get in your range there Yeah Yeah Now here in about 45 more seconds we re gonna get our last check here on the cool down You ll notice how quickly as you do this you ll be able to tell a major difference from the last check that you did during the workout and even after this two minute cool down here the difference between where that heart rate drops to Are ya ll okay Okay let s go ahead and get that last heart rate check 
 Okay so what we re doing is you guys are trying to figure out which one of these invisible tapes yeah is the best So the first thing you gotta do is come up with a nice question for your problem that you want to solve Sharonda you wanna share what you ve come up with Which tape is the strongest Which tape is the strongest okay Now see that s good because you don t like We were discussing earlier you don t wanna say which tape is the best because you really don t know what does the best mean Strongest stickiest longest lasting but I like it which one s the strongest Do you ladies have any ideas I said it was Scotch Well we were gonna hang the same amount of tape up the edge of the table and stick a marble to the other side and see how long it holds the marble for and that s how you can determine which one is the strongest Okay so y all have marbles I have You got some marbles that sounds fine So you re gonna do a sort of a time test which one can last longest okay That might work You might wanna do a little test run tomorrow because if it s something where their gonna sit there the tape s gonna sit there with a marble on it for be able to get that done So you might wanna think about maybe adding marbles to see which one can hold the most or do something to the tape to make it drop the marble I don t know what that might be We re gonna come up with some more creative ideas I was gonna maybe cut like like this tape is cut halfway into it to see how long it will hold with the marble on it Oh once it s been cut Yeah That would be good okay But and again you have to make sure that you cut each tape the same distance You gotta be fair So what about give me a passionate sample hypothesis that y all came up with If the Scotch tape is the strongest then the marble will stay on it longer If the Scotch tape is the strongest then the marble will stick to it longer So in your hypothesis you re mentioning the type of tape and you re mentioning what you re measuring Okay I m having trouble finding the group control experimental manipulator Okay remember think about your variables think about the especially for your manipulated variable what you re changing between the groups The tape Yeah the types of tape I understand Okay I ll come back and we ll discuss the other ones Alright guys Josh Sir since y all have already been working a little bit give me a sample question what you re problem is the question that you guys came up with Our problem it was which paper towel sucks up more water Okay so you Absorbs more water Absorbs more water or sucks up that s fine We re just nice and simple it means the same thing So you guys are going straight for absorbency Yes sir What about a hypothesis Darren If Brawny Bounty and a name brand paper towel are tested then Brawny will absorb the most water Nice and simple nice and simple See you mentioned all the different brands right in the beginning and then you picked one and said exactly what it would do better absorb the most water Okay perfect Now have you got any idea how you re gonna test the absorbency Any ideas about your procedure what kind of method are you gonna follow to figure out which one absorbs the most water We re gonna use water What do you need with water Like water we need water We need water yeah We need water but how are you gonna use the water to test it First we ll get a measurement of how much water we have in a container And then we ll put the towel in the container and see how well it sucks up the water To see if the level drops and we ll measure it from there So you re saying put a known amount of water in some kind of container and we ve got tons of beakers we can use Then put the paper towel in there take it out How long you gonna let it sit in there Like a minute Well you gotta know You gotta come up with the time and it s gotta be right on Cause you don t wanna leave Bounty in there for 10 seconds but Brawny for 40 seconds That s not fair You ve gotta keep it equal But that s the kind of stuff you ve got to think about You ve got to be detailed Alright and then you re gonna measure what liquid is left in the container Yes You can do that Yeah that ll work okay nice and simple So whichever one leaves the least amount of water behind should be the best as far as absorbency Yes Okay For our procedure we re trying to think and like maybe you could put like three of the same stains on one sock and then test it without one You definitely need to use the same stain You don t wanna have Zout going against coffee and Clorox fighting mud That s definitely a good idea so what kind of stains might you use We ll use what kind of we got We can use food coloring Yeah food coloring I actually have some food coloring Or we could use I got some barbecue sauce Barbecue sauce As long as you do not eat it during the lab That s fine I like that Because that s more natural I mean Ketchup And that s already measured for you like in packets that may not be a bad idea Or mustard Maybe yeah now if you re gonna do those kind of liquids we ll have to find a way to measure it We can use hot sauce Or hot sauce Okay that works that is more liquidy that might actually work Because we can pour it out we can use pipes or you can use pipets or beakers or something to measure it out so that each sock gets the same amount You don t wanna again don t wanna put twice as much hot sauce for this to fight than this one that s not fair Yes sir Okay what kind of hypothesis Our hypothesis was if we test all three samples Test all three and then I believe that the Clorox will remove the stain faster So you re picking Clorox why d you pick that Because the Clorox is sponsored by more by more varieties of stain removers and they beat So in other words you ve seen commercials about it Yes sir So you re taking what you know inferences like we talked about talking about what you know and making a prediction This one seems familiar have you heard of Zout No sir Okay most people say they haven t I don t know why I picked the same one because that s the only one I d heard of And the reason why we said Instead of using a marble which I forgot at home and we used weights but they were way too heavy So we put a glue stick on a piece of each tape that was about 10 centimeters long and we made a cut in it that was one centimeter because one half centimeter was too steep or thick And then we recorded it and we found that the first one that dropped was this one which was a second it didn t hold on at all And then this one was 17 seconds and then Scotch proving to be the strongest dropped at 79 seconds 79 seconds alright cool So what does that data then tell you Sharonda You said when you collected it what are you looking at what you found out with your data What does it prove That the Scotch tape is better And it s not even close So I like how you guys have chosen to use a bar graph because I can just look at it I can just look at it and go wow look at that The bar is up so huge compared to the other two Okay so it s very easy to distinguish which one did the best Okay Did you find maybe ladies that you had any kind of error Well yeah the first time I cut into the tape I cut too deep like twice Cut too deep Yea and then we found out the weights just tore right away They were way too heavy They wouldn t even hold on when I let go So you re very careful about making it drop Yeah Alright cool Okay so what kind of data are you collecting Mark I mean what kind of data are you guys trying to put together We trying to figure our which one is stronger which one would last the longest Right now we re seeing which one lasts the longest for how many times we rinse it This is the first time we re rinsing it and then we re trying to wipe it up again Okay and this is still the This is still corn syrup Still the corn syrup Okay cool alright that ll work So how are you gonna organize this I ll chart a graph and we re gonna see how which one tears first on which rinse So you re just going straight up by the numbers before it rips Kind of simple so that gives you that generates you some numbers to use okay Alright Michael did you guys I know you re still kind of in the middle of collecting your data Anything you see that can be done better something maybe you made an error with Something that seems to not be working like you expected Dropping this one Okay That was one That was one alright anything else Maybe that you re noticing with your anything that you re noticing with your procedure that you could to make it This guy could help out a little bit more We could ve put this stuff in a little beaker thing would ve made it easier Put what in the beaker Our solutions and stuff so we could ve put it in there That way we have an exact measurement That s true okay so what what you re saying is that your experiment may have some errors because you don t really know what s left We got measurments but we don t have exact measurements So you think it would ve been better to do that if you were to do it again that s what you might do Okay alright cool Carry on Okay hi Jeff and Keosha Alright so you re right in the middle of collecting your data Do you have a have you come up with a data table yet Designed how you want it to look Not yet how do you think you want to You gotta make it organized when you put your data in How you gonna write it down Any ideas What about a graph Well you re definitely gonna have a graph too But you also need a data table to record it now that you re starting to get some results I don t know to do that like Okay well we ll just think about it then make something up What do you think will be the easiest way to organize Okay let s do this what results are you looking for The best thing stain cleaner Okay based on what I mean what are you using as your rule to say that they clean the best Color change or Yeah Okay How much it took off How much it took off how are you gonna measure how much it took off By by the color Or do we need to use something I don t know this is up to you guys This is your experiment What do you mean by the color Like how dark it went to light From darkest to lightest Okay you do that I mean you could compare it side by side That s a good way like a scale sure You got any other ideas You could do that Alright so let s just say you went straight up we re gonna compare the original color to the new color How can you organize that into a data table What kind of information would you need to put in there The color Yeah the color change Okay so the color changed You definitely have to have the brands you ve gotta know which one did what So how are you gonna write down the color change How could you organize that into a chart That s hard I know I know I think you already told me the answer What would you say you were looking for what did you say you were looking for The color change How were you gonna compare it From darkest to lightest From darkest to lightest okay So isn t this sorta like before and after So maybe you can have a somewhere in your data table a column or a row where you re talking about what the color is before describing it So it s gonna be what kind of data since you re describing it What kind of graph should we use We ll get to that in a second So what kind of data is that where you re just writing down like descriptions and colors That s what we ve been working on We re not using numbers Well we ll get to the graph in a second You know what kind of data it was where we collect descriptions and colors and words It s right there Say it It s You ve got a Quantitative Well that s numbers Qualitative Qualitative so that s what you re doing Now how you gonna put that in a graph From the darker shade to the lighter shade right Decide what goes where Okay that sounds good to me What kind of graph I don t know If you re trying to compare and contrast these Double bar graph Sure That would probably work Okay here so you guys have been working on which paper towel absorbs the most liquid I see y all have a data table that nice and simple Record how much water they Absorb Absorb how much water they absorb And what kind of conclusion Ms Goodwin could you draw for your data For my data I drew that Southern Homes had absorbed the most water And then Brawny absorbed the next absorbed the next most And then it was Bounty was the last Bounty came in last but only barely Only by one So Josh Yes Based on the results that your group got how would you how would that change your thinking In other words how might that change your shopping habits if you had these to choose from Well I would pick Southern Homes more than any of the other brands because it absorbs more And isn t that what it s supposed to do Yeah Okay So Darren looking back at y all s procedure looking back at your entire lab is there anything that maybe if your were to redo this lab right is there something you might would change about it to make it better or more accurate Yes I would use different measurements of water like three of them Three Yes You mean like repeated Like maybe for each paper towel do it three times Yes Okay alright that s actually a pretty good idea because when you do those extra trials it helps to eliminate mistakes Because you could ve found out with these two being so close if you would ve had time to be able to do it two more times you could have found that maybe on average Bounty ended up beating Brawny or vice versa you never know Okay Mia What about what about your hypothesis was it right Did you pick the correct one No I picked Brawny Brawny okay so what kind of new hypothesis based on this Let s say that you guys came up with a whole new idea that was different from what you did this test Like another whole procedure like Darren was saying do it multiple times maybe it s completely different What kind of new hypothesis would you make if you were gonna do a similar experiment with a twist to it I would pick Southern Home Just because it won this one Yeah Okay so based on your results you might choose the same one Anybody think they would choose a different one I d still stay with the same one Which was which one Brawny Why would you still pick Brawny Because it was close it wasn t it was like it wasn t that close but if we would ve made like more if we had tested it more then it would ve probably stayed And so do you think it s possible It is possible that if you did a completely different test than just seeing which one sucked up water maybe if you tested strength Brawny could have won that one Yes I know it could Okay cool I like how y all did the lab it was nice and simple And other then Darren s error did you see anything that anything else you would do differently Anything else that you feel that you could have done better other than just maybe doing it extra times Test to see like how thick it is Test the thickness of the paper towel Yes Are you straight So in other words have a second type of test Okay sure I ll probably change the temperature of the water Change the temperature of it Yeah Oh that s true So you have to add in different variables because maybe one of them works better under Heat or lasts better under higher heat okay Cool awesome Tim It s okay Tim doesn t have to be over here So let s see what kind of chart you have Now explain this chart to me Deontay because all I m seeing is check marks I did mine I just did something simple Okay that s fine I put my name right there and I put if it left a light stain I left a check mark and if it left a dark stain I meant stain I put a check mark Okay so I see some of y all are still working on your graphs and how you wanna display them Alright So why did you choose a bar graph So we can do like the levels of the stains we got like medium Medium Light and dark Let me see So you saying you re doing you re going kind of like a qualitative data light medium dark and you re just sort of shading up to the level you think that it had Okay how could you do that better What might be a more reliable way to gather data I mean the color change is okay I mean the color change is fine because that s what you re looking for right When you buy a stain remover you wanna see that it takes the stain out What might be some more reliable data you could gather if you were to do this differently for the future You need to come up with a creative way to get better data or more data maybe The more data we can get is by looking through the sock up under the sock to see how dark the color went through Okay so compare the levels and how much stain was pushed through the sock Yes sir Alright that ll work What else Or we can tell by if it s a light if it s a ring around a light spot then we can tell if it cleared and if it clears some color off of it So you re talking about maybe the shape of the stain or Yes sir the shape of the stain Okay possibly And if it s a ring around it like this one right here if it s a ring around it it s a light spot and we can tell it isn t t clean enough Alright so how about this Whose opinions did you use to get these scales I used my own for mine Okay Cause they think that one was the best and I think this one was the best So what might be think about this what might be a better way a more reliable way to get more data than just your opinions Ask other people s opinions Ask other people Again if you were to redo it do you think it would be a better idea to maybe ask some other people Yes Like going around the class asking what they think Getting a vote Like a vote like a survey Yeah a survey Or a vote okay Alright last thing Now that you ve finished it what kind of problems did you see Is there something that okay if I did this again I know we could ve had some error during this point like we could ve made a mistake here We saw that if we woulda let the colors and the stain remover sit a little longer that it wouldn t have come out 
 Spanish and you would know if I mean you would know what they re saying because you learn English and you talk you learn English and you know how to talk Spanish I agree with you because like because like if they when you said that they had to read write and speak English like they put something that they put something that s English on your paper you d probably understand it more so that s why I agree with you But when they fill out the application what if the application didn t Well The application is about like where you re from why are you coming here for like they want to know a lot of information about you I think we should I think we should keep it at one because if you fill out the application you ll know more about people and their birthday and stuff like and then they usually bring them a present Okay so it s important to know about somebody Now the citizenship board might not go to their birthday party but it is important to know when their birthday is right Okay what were you saying Ariel I think he must fill out an application because I think you should fill out an application so you can so if you come to America you can If you come to America they ll know when your birthday where did you come from and stuff Yeah it s important to have that information Why do you think we need to know where they came from Because I think they wanted to know where they came from because like if they came from a bad city and they want to come to like a good city and A city or a country A country A country okay If they came from a bad country and they wanted to join a good country then you want to see like they want to see like if they got like If they were bad like where they came from that would be yeah they d have to know that I think I would be because like when they like different countries have different holidays so when they be out like they be out celebrating then nobody won t think nothing s wrong with it because they re celebrating and they don t know that on this day that s when they re celebrating their country I didn t even think about that We need to know about their culture so that we can let them celebrate That s important too Great conversation So we re gonna keep that one or get rid of it We re gonna keep it Okay So let s move onto the next step and see what you think about the next one That you have to live in the US United States for five years I don t believe that you have to live in the United States for five years because like if you re like I m five years if you re married you re going to have to live for three years but then like the reason why you should live in it five years because like you could get used to the country and everything that s what I think I think that you should live in America for five years if you come from somewhere else because like some people they come here and they see that they don t like it and they try to move back to where they came from and when they try to move back somebody already took their house or something and if they go they ain t gonna have no money to come back because they re just gonna be outside homeless I think there will be some changes to live in the US Two years because if you re real old if you re old then they say that you might die in a couple years then if you re staying here if you have to stay here to become a citizen for five years then it takes longer then you wouldn t get the chances to make choices before you die I think you should change you have to live in the US United States for five years because what if if the house is dirty and it s not clean Like if it s like the tub still got stains in it Explain that a little bit more to me So you said that you would change it to how many years To one year To one year becase if you got in a house that was dirty you might want to do what If the walls was still had stains on it Well what would you want to do then Move Okay where would you move Still in the United States or back to your country Still in the United States Okay so you would still be there so would you want to just stay even though you move from place to place I will Do you think you would change the number of years they re gonna be in the United States or just not make them stay in the same place Not make them stay in the same place Okay so we need to make sure that Ariel knows do we have to stay in the same place for all five years No not really No okay I think that if they I think that they should give them at least one year to figure out if they want to stay in that home or go back to where they used to live So I mean if they don t like it on the first day so they won t have to go back again come back to see or come back somebody else at your house At your old house I disagree with you and I agree with you The reason why I disagree with you because they said still living three years just like if you re married and I agree with you because like when you said that they come from the first place I mean the first day they may not like it and they could probably go back where they came from that s why I disagree and agree with you Okay I think we should change it so if they look at their choice to go back to their home country for like two months because then they ll miss their family members then like when a couple days in their country and nobody was doing it in America then they could just go back to their country for like a month or something So maybe you guys need to discuss how many years they should stay here in America and maybe if they could how long they could go to visit their relatives in other countries Although I think those are all good things to keep discussing So maybe make that decision on how many years and then move onto the next one and I ll come back and see you Here but you you trying to become a citizen here but you like want to like you re trying to vote like say if you lived in Germany you re trying to go back to Germany You can t that s not being loyal to the US because you re trying to become a citizen to the US and you re trying to go back if you was living in Germany you re trying to go back to Germany What do you think guys Well because they have to want to say that A if you don t then they won t have to send you back because you have to be community and jobs so they can get you jobs and what to do and I think that we should keep the rule because say if your old country got in a war you would say you tried to take up them and you re already trying to become a citizen of the USA and you take up for your old country that makes you not become a citizen That don t mean if you re born in your like regular country that don t mean like you can go back go back and forth and take up for them and then when we re having a war you want to take up for us you can t do that You can t like if you grew up in Germany you can t take up for Germany because you e trying to be a citizen in the US now You can t take up for Germany even though you were born there You got to take up for the US Do you think that s hard for someone who came to the United States to forget about their old country Woudl that be difficult Yeah In my opinion I think that d be difficullt because like with me I can make a connection because when I went when I had when I used to live with my grandma me and my momma we used to live with my grandma and I couldn t forget about the things that I did at my grandma s house so my grandma and my cousins but we still were around but I couldn t stop I couldn t forget about what the fun things that we did Yeah So what should we put here Well I think we should keep it because like you can t go back to your like regular country to do like like you can t fight for the army the army they re trying to stay here to protect us and you re already trying to become a citizen for the US You can t like go back to Germany Then we should keep that because then so we should learn how to be nice I don t know Like we could put so that if like you grew up in Germany you can t fight for Germany So we re gonna put that Okay You have to be true to the US Be true to the US How about the next one that says Have good moral character Is that one that you would keep or get rid of Get rid of In my opinion I d get rid of that because people like that s like that s like having like you gotta be like nice to people Some people they can t take it Like they can t take that they can t like people like I can make a connection because my cousin she got like ups and downs because when people they just like irritate her and they be aggravating her she can t take it no more she just like she just gotta get mad and stuff Like people they can t take having a moral character Like my cousin she can t do that because people they be like bullying her and stuff and she can t like keep like she can t keep on standing right there and people keep on bullying her Brittany do you think we should keep it or leave it I think we should I think we should get rid of it When I was in the suburbs with my godmother she said that my godbrother was getting picked on in school by a bully and he just felt like beating him up What do you think Adune Well keep it because like why would you let some people get away with most of that stuff You re just gonna let them keep doing the same thing And without the rule Without that rule everybody people would just keep getting beat So what I hear all of you saying is that you don t want people to get beaten but you also said that sometimes it s hard to control your anger so you can t you re not always a good person all the time Sometimes you make bad choices Do you think we could maybe change that rule so that everybody would be happy with it Yes I think we should change it to like like when you re like around like older people like elder like older people and like they re real old you can like like you can show like good moral character around them but then when they like go and stuff like when they re not gone like when we was talking about immigrants on the like they was on the boats you don t know what type of people is on the boats It can be like elder people you never know Like you can have good moral character around them but like when you like when you re like around your mother don t she want you to respect you Don t she want you to respect her But we should change the rule to like sometimes people can just like have a chance to get some people back that really did something really bad to them or caused them to get hurt or something so we should change the rule to like it s kind of like hard for a name but we should think about it I think I have a cause and effect for a good moral character That s why they have like if you have to fill out an application that s why they re trying to like that s why they re trying to like fill out an application to see if you got good moral character or if you re cra 
 Do you know how to make a U shape like this You re gonna make the U shape with this first It s gonna make a U You re making sod homes What are sod homes Tell me what all you know about a sod home There were some homes that were dug out That were built the dugouts were in a hill okay Tell me what else you know about sod home Okay and why did they use sod to make houses Yeah okay so they didn t have trees What kind of land were they on A prairie A prairie and what is a prairie It s a flat kind of land and it never has any trees Okay okay Would you have wanted to live in a sod home I d choose a log cabin where Okay were there any good things about a sod home Um yeah What is something good about a sod home Okay what are the walls like in a sod home Are they thick are they thick walls Okay okay Did they have any furniture in their sod homes They did why didn t they have furniture JD why didn t they have furniture in their sod homes Because they weren t I think Abby do you know why they they didn t have furniture in their sod homes No but Did they bring their furniture with them No because of the wagon It would take up the whole wagon Okay so what did they bring What did they bring Hannah A gun They did they brought a gun And food okay So they didn t bring their furniture with them Why not Why didn t they bring their furniture Cause it was too big and it would take up the whole wagon Okay Okay Didn t they have more than one wagon Yes That s right a wagon train very good Okay I m gonna leave you guys to work and I m gonna be back and check on your sod homes okay It smells very good Okay and I ll help you I see that you have trunks Why do you have a trunk Oh that s very nice to help Eli why do you all have trunks Because um the pioneers had them The pioneers had trunks Why Why did they have trunks For their clothes and stuff And toys And toys Like we re making the doll Okay what were trunks made out of Wood Wood Oh you guys are sharing it s so great Thank you So their trunks were made out of wood What kind of homes did they live in Sod houses and log homes Sod houses and log homes Log cabins And log cabins Okay That s right that s right And so when they traveled when they left their homes what did they travel in A covered wagon A covered wagon Was there just one wagon No They got in a wagon train A wagon train and what was a wagon train It s a bunch of covered wagons Oxen in a wagon train In a wagon train would you have wanted to be at the front or the back of the wagon train Why I have an idea Erase erase erase erase You won t get that dirty You won t get that dirty Why would you not get that dirty at the front Because they can t move their Okay Okay What would happen in the wagon train Would they take care of each other Yeah Okay What if a wheel broke off of a wagon They would have to help each other Okay okay they would help each other Tell me this Eli Where was the wagon where were the wagons going West They were going West Why were they going West Cayden They thought they would settle the land Okay Karev why did the government give them free land Okay they were What did they have to do on that land Build a house Okay build a house that s right That s right so what kind of house did they build A sod house They made a sod house Why did they not make a wood house Because there weren t a lot of trees on the prairie Okay but you said the trunks were made out of wood how did they get trunks made out of wood Because they made it before they left They made it before they left that s correct Can the doll have long hair You re doing a great job You re just gonna have to imagine that That s right they made their trunks before they left Did they just need one trunk No Okay Twice Okay Do you know Eli Can you go show me on the map where the pioneers went on the prairie where the prairie was Okay and what is that The Prairie The prairie and how do you know it s a prairie Because there s no like mountains there How do you know there s no mountains Because these are the mountains Just like regular colors are not Okay and so on the prairie what kind of homes did they build Sod houses Sod houses So where did they build their log houses at Right in this area Okay Very good and why did they build em there What was there Wood A lot of wood Good job You can go sit down Thank you You did a great job Very good job Did they take everything with them on the trip Why did they not take everything with them Okay so when they got there did they have furniture to put into their sod homes No because They just moved in they had just moved in Where there good things about a sod home Eli what was good about a sod home That s right and what made them that way Because the ground is cooler Okay the ground is cooler Were the log homes good as well Yeah Okay but what was one bad thing about a log house compared to a sod house It s not warm in winter And do you remember when we did a Venn Diagram about the sod house and the log house and compared those two Yeah So that was the bad thing about a sod home is the animals could fall through What was the best structure to live in A log cabin A log cabin So that animals couldn t get on top of it and If you lived in a dug out Cayden would you if it came a big rain storm would you rather be at the front of the dug house or the back of the dug out Back Why It s a dryer place isn t it Okay you guys continue to work okay Tell me what you know about a log house Willie tell me something you know about a log house Okay they didn t have any air conditioners Kennedy you guys are making a log house What are you putting in your log house Dolls and some family and some furniture Okay Did they have a lot of furniture for their log house Brody Did they have furniture for their log house Yeah but when they got there they had to have time to gather up some furniture That s right when they first moved there they didn t have any furniture But eventually they built some didn t they I see you re putting a fireplace in there What did they burn in their fireplace They were burning um buffalo chips They are In a log house they re burning buffalo chips That s right in a sod house they re gonna burn buffalo chips Why not wood in a sod house Because in a prairie they would run out of if they had enough wood they would build a wood house build a log house That s exactly right Were there buffalo chips where there were log houses No Why were there not buffalo chips So buffalo cannot run in the forest where the trees were Where did the buffalo live What was it called The prairie The prairie And what is a prairie Open grasslands that s exactly right And what are you making Dillon A quilt Why are you making a quilt Tell me why the pioneers needed quilts for To sit on them what else did they do with them Willie They on them when they were on their way What else Dillon Okay did they not have beds Yes No they didn t Okay That s right Okay they had to sleep on the floor Are you putting a kitchen in your log house No because they Well where did they keep their food at The root cellar Where tell me about a root cellar What s a root cellar It s where they kept their frozen food Okay was it inside the log cabin or was it outside Outside Okay And what was the root cellar like Okay Brody you re exactly right that is great thinking That is great thinking Did they keep any food inside their homes Yes What d they keep inside their homes Flour and sugar Flour and sugar and where would they have kept those In what container What kind of container Were they barrels that they put them in Yeah Yeah they were barrels You guys are doing a great job and you re working together and I m gonna come back and check on you in a little bit all right Look what I made What is that Willie It s what A lantern A lantern why do you have a lantern in your log house Okay and so you can see Yeah That s right cause they didn t have electricity did they Cause they had So they could see to cook Good thinking I need to do my little girl okay I ll do the girl 
 Stationary point Did he move Okay some of the other groups are moving their fingers around sometimes they were releasing from up here and up here so do you think your data might be a little more realistic Yeah Yeah okay so now one thing what type of formation do you guys have Good Put an adjective in front of it Extremely strong Strong A strong positive Do you think every correlation around here is gonna be the same No No Okay so yours is probably going to be one of the strongest ones Remember that correlation coefficient R it went from positive one to negative one or zero Oh yeah What do you think yours would be close to One It d be really close to Then we ll get to that shortly guys later on Okay So you probably would have one that s a decimal 999 or really close Okay so you re trying to find your slope Yeah So what is your slope Two Two okay so over here we re gonna put And now does everyone have the exact same You do Pretty much Oh most groups who are four people are slightly off depending on where you put the line Okay here s the slope So you just told me your slope is two now what am I asking you to do What is your No we re not done yet What is your It s 2 0 Read the question Okay what s the slope of the equation The slope is What did you just tell me Oh two Two Okay now what s the real world meaning of that What does that mean when you say yes those are two Okay now we can go back to that I just want to talk to you about the solution Just on your slope you said it was two That was perfect But now what s the real world meaning So the slope is the more rubber band What are you looking at So it s one and two One Why can t it So you want to put five Okay Ten over Okay so now you re telling me your slope is ten over one Okay well I m asking you what s your slope Now you re saying your slope is 10 That s what the slope is but I want the real world meaning So what were you saying For every one rubber band that drops How do you know How do you know But where are you getting I need a little more detail though It s dropping what So 10 centimeters for every One One rubber band Okay Now what s your y intercept Seven Seven Now is your y intercept directions to get somewhere else or is it telling the exact location What s the y intercept Because a slope isn t that directions to get somewhere else What s the y intercept I want the entire It s zero seven So can you write zero seven down please Write zero seven down And now tell me what the real When I ask you what the y intercept is yes zero seven Now what s the real world meaning subtract out of seven So what s this saying Translate that for me You re saying there s no real world meaning what s that saying So before we put any rubber bands on this already moves seven centimeters What does that mean Going into this lab did I know if the real world meaning was gonna make sense or not There s been a few groups today their y intercept has a real world meaning zero zero But did I know where your line was gonna go No But if it went straight through zero would that make sense Zero rubber band So So what s the real world meaning Well what do you think This y intercept that you had does it have a real world meaning No So yeah it doesn t have a real world meaning What slope did it Okay Once again did I know that coming in Depended on your data Good job Guys you re asking If you plug into this four times three that s 12 But yeah Three two and four I think it says three Okay So what s your equation Y equals 3x plus 12 Okay so let s talk about that No no it s one intercept the y It really doesn t play out with that algorithm It makes no absolute sense whatsoever Yeah but you find air Oh that makes sense But this What are we talking about We got one anyway but really that s it Wait one second backtrack for one second So what did you say here Five thirds What is a five thirds 5 3 Okay so what s the real world meaning Every five inches there is three rubber band Okay So now does the ball go on a rubber band So flip that around so you re saying two rubber bands the figure is going Yes Okay does that have real world meaning Does that have real world meaning Yeah Yeah Okay Now you re saying what your y intercept is can I see your graph paper for a second Yeah Okay So yeah it looks like it s around Does everybody have the same No Do you think everyone s gonna get the exact same line We didn t really have an intercept slope we just looked at We just Yeah which sounds great because you re all gonna draw that line slightly different so go with one then What does that y intercept Is that directions or is that a location It s a location isn t it So can you write the exact location Because you re only counting one What s the order of pairs here You have a pair of zero one so write that down Pair of zero ones You have a pair of zero ones Yeah What s zero represent Zero rubber bands Zero rubber bands So when zero rubber bands were attached how far did that One One inch Does that make sense to you So when there s zero rubber bands attached you figure out one inch Alright let s demonstrate that Let s see Can I see that for one sec please Okay let s go back to before we started Zero rubber bands attached what s happening Okay what s happening right now Zero rubber bands Did he already move one inch No So Does the y intercept come in No No You said Because you just told me it was five inches of three Yeah What are we discussing now The data or the equation for the Okay Now so does this y intercept make sense No Zero rubber bands are removed So does the y intercept have real world meaning No Does the slope have real world meaning Yeah Did I know your y intercept wasn t gonna have real world meaning Yes No because there s some people today that actually have real world meaning What would be a y intercept if it made sense Zero zero Zero zero Zero rubber bands equals Zero inches Zero inches What were you saying your slope was So let s discuss three The slope is three what s the real world meaning How many rubber bands would you need in your description Grabbing one rubber band does that make sense Okay now so now what anout your y intercept would be at 12 Now you gotta figure Let s discuss this right here Now I think you re thinking ahead But this line looks like it s crossing up here to Where is it crossing It s crossing at We re going up three look three six seven Yeah I was looking like around four So let s discuss this You have six That could be perfect but we know the exact way a line likes to go Let s go with Monique six What s that saying Let s go to a pair to the y intercept Zero pair zero six So what does that mean So write that down zero pair zero six for the y intercept And what s that actually mean Zero rubber bands in front of the six equals how many inches So this was the figure Zero rubber bands attached does that make it already move six inches Does that make any sense at all So does the y intercept have real world meaning Could it still have real world meaning You were thinking ahead I think when you drew your line Because what s the only y intercept that makes sense here Zero rubber bands 81 inches But you didn t move But does that mean you can decide I want to make real world meaning and just draw my line down the zero Because what am I looking for The equation for the line of Is yours the equation for the line now Your y intercept makes sense If you knew the equation for the y intercept You plug in 81 inches for X right Did you end up with a negative You re fine You what Minus what Oh minus one I wanna discuss it If you re y intercept is What s the order of pairs Zero negative one so what s the real world meaning What s that mean What s the zero represent Okay so zero rubber bands what s your y interception At zero rubber bands how far does it go now Negative one Did he already go one or did he reach it So does that make sense Zero rubber bands and he s already traveled one Does that make any sense So does the y intercept Does that mean your y intercept just didn t end up happening Yeah When you know how to use this it works With zero rubber bands how fast are you going Zero Zero Okay does that mean your data s all wrong No that s the way your numbers work Could you slope this out instead three What s that mean Three three what Four is still Five is So three Three what Let s go and do number five Distance so what would your distance be Inches So it s like three inches is over one So that makes sense So does your slope have real world meaning Yeah Okay 
 They died because No CO2 Two snails So if add another plant in there is that going to add CO2 or is it going to take away more CO2 Takeaway you could probably try it with the lights off Why do you think that would work Umm Maybe it might give them some more CO2 Okay well why don t you write down your predictions so she said turn the lights off and see what happens So did your snail coordinate with your prediction Yeah but for long Not for long All right Haley so look at your prediction This is your setup Isaiah can you go shut the door for me Okay so number E Stay alive stay alive Not number letter E It lived Okay why do you think But is also in unstable environment I thought plants needed sunlight to live How are they still alive and then they died when when you Because there was no light It was light Tell me what you said I had no idea Wait never mind What do you think It s a miracle It s a miracle Why don t you go back to your prior knoweldge here What did we say You didn t answer some of those but what do you think Obviously something is making CO2 right Cause that started at six right If we hit carbon reset look It starts at six and six we re even If I hit play look what s happening What s happening to the CO2 level It s getting bigger Yeah why is it getting bigger Where s that CO2 coming from Who s making it The plants Okay why are they making it So they can live Okay what s that called Like what process is that when they make CO2 Photosynthesis Photosynthesis makes CO2 I guess No Isn t it cellular res per tation Ms Rutala isn t it that Respiration You know how we talked about this This is photosynthesis right Carbon dioxide plus water in the sun is going to make glucose and oxygen right For respiration they re taking that exact same glucose and that oxygen and they re making three things They re going to make energy to stay alive That s why those plants are still living They re going to make CO2 Which is why They re still living Uh huh And why there s a high number in there and they re also going to make H2O which is water Does that make sense Do you see now why those numbers are going up for CO2 Yeah Cause they re going through Photosynthesis No Cause their going through the energy CO2 Respiration Respiration is the process Do you see that Yeah All right you re welcome All right how are we doing here Good You guys are still ready to predict the second part Okay how are we doing here We just now got to the back That s okay you take your time This is good Take your time as long as you are understanding That s the whole point of this Okay so move on to this one What is a new question you have or an experiment you would want to do The snail one Well what s the snail one What s a question you have based on what you just did Are you curious about something What s a new question or a new experiment you d want to try How come well I just want to know why the snail keeps dying Okay you can put that down Why does the snail keep dying Did it die in every single situaiton though No Everyone we ve done so far You might want to think about why which situations it died in right All right let s see Put your head up All right you guys are still in this one Test tube C2 has plants and snails but resulted in an unstable environment why I thought plants and snails helped each other live Why did they die Because they didn t have that much what s it called oxygen Well when they started the test tube it was at six and six All of them start at six six right So look at test tube C2 To plants two snails The lights are Off The O2 level at the end of the experiment is 12 oh oh It s at what Zero point Zero point zero which means there is no oxygen so does that make sense as to why one of these died The snail was the one The snails died Uh huh and then the CO2 level is at 12 12 did the plants die No Why didn t they die but the snails died Because the snails gave off their CO2 Um hmm And why did that keep the plants alive Because they take in CO2 Uh huh okay But it somehow they didn t give off O2 I guess Why is that somehow Why weren t they able to give off O2 Because the lights weren t on Uh huh and why are the lights so important To produce photosynthesis Yes they need light for photosynthesis Remember this is like a recipe right You have to have all three ingredients to make photosynthesis work You have to have carbon dioxide you have to have water and you have to have sunlight You can t just have one of the three You can t have two of the three You have to have all three Do you see why that works Okay good Um hmm Okay good All right how are we doing here We re passing Let me ask you Yeah I did not She was in the bathroom I went to go blow my nose All right let s go ahead and work over here So let s go ahead and catchup ourselves here What is one new question you have or experiment you would preform So based on what you ve already done is there something you are curious about I just gave you free reign Go ahead do whatever you want Do you have any questions about anything Yeah E Stay here Yeah I ll stay here while you write it down Why do they have to close it up Close the test tubes up Okay so would you be curious about doing the experiment without closing it That s a good question What was your question Every four plants and four snails Would they survive with the lights on or off What do you think I think with the lights off because if they have four plants they will have I mean if they had it on they ll produce a lot of oxygen therefore the snails would die but if you put it off maybe they ll produce the right amount of oxygen They ll produce a lot of oxygen the snails will die Well it s kind of complicated No I want to try it out You re saying that you think that Because it s too much oxygen Too much oxygen In this one container maybe Well who would benefit from all that oxygen The snails Okay So we know the snails would stay alive cause they would have what Oxygen Okay what about the plants Do you think the plants are going to stay alive Nope Why Because they don t have carbon dioxide maybe How s the situation so far Good I think it s bad Probably it won t survive because So in the light it s okay It s balanced One s giving the other one s getting You got that all right So what do you think is going to happen at night They re going to die probably Who s going to die The snails Why do you think the snails are going to die I don t know Because it s going to be too much CO2 Too much CO2 Why is there going to be too much CO2 Because the snails can t get O2 cause there s no light Exactly Go ahead and hit play Whoa whoa Too much CO2 Did that CO2 what did you notice about it And the plants died There was no oxygen There was no oxygen but why did the plants die Plants don t need oxygen Plants need CO2 There was too much They couldn t give off It already was at the max Reached it s max Here s my question Are the snails the only ones making CO2 Who else is making CO2 The plants Do plants make CO2 at night How could you design a little experiment to test that What can you do to design an experiment right now to test that Take all the snails out Okay and what Okay let s see We want to see if plants will go through respiration at night We re looking for the CO2 only What is that A rock Okay so look at your data so far What do you notice They re producing a lot of oxygen I m following Okay so isn t that weird I thought plants made oxygen I mean they re producing a lot of carbon dioxide They are Why are they producing carbon dioxide I thought plants made oxygen Wasn t it through respiration Okay so they can t get sunlight so they re not going through Photosynthesis Photosynthesis but they are going through Respiration Respiration so remember our respiration right They don t have sunlight Does respiration need sunlight to work No it needs energy Nope it doesn t So all they need is what CO2 No what does this stand for Glucose Right so they need glucose and Oxygen Was there oxygen in there before we started No There wasn t Oh wait yes There was look It s even There was oxygen in there There was six cpms of oxygen so then it went through this process and it made energy which kept them alive it made CO2 which you saw because the CO2 levels went Up Up And it also made Water H2O Which you can t really tell It turned yellow And it s probably still inside the cells Does that make sense though Okay good All right how are we doing here Are we almost done you guys Are you getting you re understanding A little Okay well let me ask you something Do plants go through respiration Uh yes How do you know Cause they re color It change colors The plants change colors No the water To what color Dark blue A dark blue Like a darker blue What does dark blue represent Let s go back to the beginning part What does dark blue tell you Dark blue means that there s what Low dark blue means that there s low what Okay and you re telling me that respiration sorry that respiration Plants go through respiration right Uh huh So would there be a low amount of CO2 if it goes through respiration No no It will be Uh huh so should it be blue Yes no no no no It d be yellow Uh huh what kind of experiment did you do to show me that plants go through respiration Tia plants go through respiration If you cut the lights on and cut the lights off and if you cut the lights on then the water turns blue because it s giving off oxygen Cut the lights off they won t go through respiration because they They won t go through respiration No only photosynthesis because there will be no light for them Stop give me my paper Okay Tamara and Kelly O please stop And I have a question Do you want us to do for our predictions do you want us to do why or why not for both of them or just one Even if they re different Maybe one of your predictions your plants lived maybe one of your predictions the plants die Both of them lived Then you can just why do you think both of them lived All right I have a quick question Can you guys look over here for a second Okay Tya over here William over here Okay how may of you guys I want a couple people to share their predictions What helped your when you had the three plants that died right Most of you were surprised You were like Wow how did three plants die with the lights on They had oxygen they had a CO2 and they died Right so you were surprised What was your prediction What did you set up as an experiment to help them survive What did you predict Nacora give me one I put three plants and one snail Okay so she said she put three plants one snail How many of you guys did three plants and one snail Or a combination of plants and snails Okay why did you do that Why did you do a combination of plants and snails William Because the snails will produce the CO2 while the plants would produce the O2 Okay so he said the plants would produce O2 the snails would produce CO2 What s another option What if I said You know what I m gonna take all your snails Good luck keeping those plants alive Keyon If I take away all your snails and I said Haha you have no snails to keep your plants alive Should that be a problem No Okay tell me why that wouldn t be a problem Why would that not be a problem Haley Because all you have to do is put three plants in the dark Okay how is that going to help you How is putting three plants in the dark She said You can just turn off the lights How would that be helpful Because there s more CO2 Okay more CO2 Why is there more CO2 I would say you can just put them in the light and the dark cause when they re in the light they do photosynthesis and when they re in the dark they do respiration Okay she said In the dark they use photosynthesis and in the dark they do respiration Isaiah Wouldn t you just turn the lights off Okay we just said we could turn the lights completely off Here s another question Do plants go through respiration Yes No Okay hold on If you said no why are you saying no they don t go through respiration Because only animals go through respiration and plants go through photosynthesis Okay Brandon I want you to set up an experiment for me Put one plant Put one plant in your test tube and turn the lights off Just one plant in the test tube and turn the lights off How many people know what s going to happen One plant in a test tube with the lights off All right Look at that Okay are the plants alive Yes Is there more oxygen then CO2 No What is there more of CO2 How is there more CO2 in there It started at six and six Why is there more CO2 in there Respiration Because it s not doing photosynthesis Because it s not going through photosynthesis but that means that our O2 shouldn t go up Why is the CO2 going up Why is the CO2 going up Because in the dark the plants breath out CO2 Okay what is that process of them breathing out their getting rid of CO2 What is that process Kaleil you kept saying it over and over Respiration All right respiration Here s another question Do plants go through respiration in the day time No Photosynthesis What does respiration give you as an animal ATP wait ATP and I don t want to look no And oxygen no Carbon dioxide So respiration gives your carbon dioxide If you look up here look Elise respiration gives you carbon dioxide water and energy right Do plants when they re going through photosynthesis do they make energy Do you see energy in the photosynthesis equation No Okay so how do they stay alive during the day Do they die during the day and stay alive at night No Do they stay alive during the day and die at night No How do they stay alive the whole day long They use the sun s energy They use the what The sun s energy Okay and then what do they do with that glucose It just sits there cause glucose isn t energy yet They have to turn into respoiration Oh so do they go through respiration during the day Yes No They have to or they would die So they make their energy They make glucose but the glucose isn t energy Isaiah until they break it down in respiration so do plants have to go through respiration during the day and night Yes Yes do you go through respiration day and night Yes No You don t No Do you die at night every time you go to sleep That would be creepy You reproduce every time you go at night No what No you stay alive all day long You stay alive all day long Tamara Plants stay alive all day long because they go through respiration This is the key Respiration The key Nikera to getting the glucose for respiration is in Photosynthesis Photosynthesis This is what keeps everything alive but to get some of the ingredients for this you need to go through this Do you see why now we depend on each other Ah yes Okay understanding So we don t go through photosynthesis just plants do but plants go through both 
 Well frogs do sink they do It s sinking What do you think caused that to happen what made it sink that time I put it like that and And then it was sinking Alright but now we saw some pictures where the real frogs got on lily pads and didn t sink So what do you think is different It s like stuck to the ground and The lily pad is stuck to the ground Yeah I think there s something inside I think there s something in like dirt you know like that causes the lily pad to grow But with something in the lily pad seed We were looking at this the other day Do you girls remember about that Okay what were you all thinking about that They don t But what were you thinking Andrea You know these eyes right here we don t have eyes like this but frogs But frogs jump really high If they don t jump really the same they probably just almost jump if the momma and daddy frogs turn into get some eggs and the tadpole comes out That tadpole right there he was following it and then he stopped What if they took the flashlight they might move Yeah Like this watch When you take it off I did this in my momma s When you take it off and you turn it this way he looks back at it like this That s what he does How come Because when tadpoles like eat things that glow then when you take it off you put it back on How come why I know they just don t But that s not fair What else did you notice We did the spots What else did you notice Jamal look at it again Frog What body parts do you see Gray polka dots You said the spots The feet The feet what about it Lines on it Some lines on it And what are you saying Nikera You said it had some things on it That white stuff What is that What is that white stuff on it s feet See if I can get a closer look What is that Jamia do you see that The white things on its feet It s his foots It s his feet Do you have that on your feet No They need peace and quiet If they don t have a calm river Look they live in ponds Dude listen listen There are trees right here There s flowers Listen Latan be quiet I m thinking that this is very calm rivers and this is what you call that ooey gooey stuff that Ms Robbie called it That s the lake and that s the pond and there I am frogs They need grass they need flowers they need little trees they need I was thinking Aleha thinking about us living in houses We live in houses because can t breathe water This is my house and like there s dirt under there And there s dirt under there Then under that runs the water the blue water Let s add something to it So what made it work this time It stands upside down The frog floats It doesn t jump on any kind of one it only jumps on the ones that are round Because it needs something facing up to make the walls Because this is facing up so you think maybe the lily pad faces up Right if it does this it needs like a shield so the water won t get in because if the water touches it it will tear and it will sink Did you listen Because they need something on it like rain So you re saying if water touches it what happens if water gets on top of it It ll sink because it ll tear the lily pad up and it ll sink but with the flower on it it does not sink So if it has the flower you think the flower keeps it from sinking Because it s stuck It s stuck and it s so hard it makes it so hard and rainy and it dries up So when you dried the frog off did that make a difference Well it doesn t make a difference Frogs like to be wet Frogs are usually wet That frog is an African swimming frog because look at it s feet It does look like an African dwarf frog It jumps on the water It can run and hop on water Andrea what did you notice about this What did you notice I know that we have It doesn t float Let me show you which one Which one What about this one He was growing legs No this one s growing legs but that s what tadpoles swim in Okay you see them Shine it on it No You see they re moving because they re growing legs If you yell really loud the glass will break and then the tadpoles Frogs The frog s body There s a water snake There s a water snake A water snake What are you talking about over here This thing has a frog in it And he just swam Okay so we re talking over here Ms Robbie look So you re comparing the pond to your house Yeah Alright did you see this that she found out It says the frog is pulling off its skin I wonder why it s doing that Because so it can have different skin Why would it make different skin It might need different skin because of the way it lives The way it lives it has to take off its own skin just like a snake takes off its whole skin Snakes take off their skin Be a new frog The way they take off their skin is they shred it off They don t have any arms Snakes shed their skin off and they don t have no arms Snakes shed their skin Yeah Do you think frogs shed their skin too What do you think Aleha You found the picture tell me what you re thinking Let me hear Aleha When it gets old they have to take it off He has to take it off Why do you think he needs to take his skin off I was thinking Just a moment Daniel let me hear Aleha I can t hear When it gets too rough on him he can take if off Maybe if his skin feels rough Hmm I m wondering about that That s giving me something to wonder about Ms Robbie there s a water beetle Yes but we re still looking at this about this frog coming off She feels like maybe when his skin is rough he takes it off What did the page say It uses a word I m not sure about molt It said frogs molt a few times every year Because it s the way they live It s the way they live But we don t live that way the same way we do We get bigger instead of shredding skin You re right We get What what d you say Say that again We get bigger We get bigger And they shred And they shed their skin That s opposite Hmm I m going to write down that word molt We re going to talk about that a little bit We re going to try to explore that a little bit more The frogs are underground and they hatch out of the eggs and turn into the tadpoles and they re going to grow up a little and they re going to lost their tail and they re going to turn into an adult frog and then they are underground when it s winter When it s winter they re undergound Okay what have you all found out about comparing The frogs protect their babies Do the frogs protect their babies No they don t What about your They wait until they hatch They wait till they hatch Frogs have bigger eyes than us because they have those eyes like that on their heads and we don t And we have eyes that are small And when you were born did your mom or dad take care of you or your grown up Yes I went to my grandma when I m a baby Okay did your grownup take care of you when you were a baby Andreas Yes Yeah well what about the mother frogs No I got a lot of food I love You got a lot of food I eat chicken and rice everything Andreas just think about our tadpoles Is the momma frog in here taking care of those tadpoles No They wait till they hatch Maybe the momma frog missed them Probably if they die after wintertime 
 Brooke what did you choose The cylinder Why Okay five and what about you Ms Leah Cylinder Why Because it has two faces It has two faces and what about you Ms Cecilia The sphere and why you need to

good Who s cutting now Who Who s sliding it Samantha No I didn t slide it down before Samantha didn t So were you right Leila Yeah you did Yes or yes ma am Yes ma am Alright so you can circle your prediction was correct and then was your prediction correct Isaac No you guys said the cylinder went the farthest Was your prediction correct Okay so you circle here your prediction wasn t correct and then was your prediction correct Aspen No and what about you Blake yes Okay so now you guys can go ahead and clean up all of your stuff and then you can get one of the crayon caddies and draw a picture of what happened Blake I want you to help your team clean up before you start drawing your observations Good job team Hey that s mine That s my pencil Wait I m not ready yet I m not ready yet

It does slide on its face What else is special about the cone Cecilia It rolls in a circle Why Because You okay Because it has a flat face Mm hmm and what else makes it roll in that circle Leah It has a point It has the point on it so this is your last one to measure Yes Okay yes or yes ma am Yes ma am Alright good luck You throw that away I ll throw it away So was your prediction correct Hunter Yes Yes so the cylinder went the farthest for you guys Okay so Sierra if the cylinder went the farthest your prediction wasn t right so now you re gonna circle the X Does it matter that you are right No No you re just predicting and that means you re guessing you don t have to be right Circle the X and then go ahead and draw your pictures It s orange So you guys are gonna show the cylinder going the farthest Just do it Do it here Now I don t know what s going the farthest It was probably cylinder Yeah Okay so what shape went the farthest for you guys Um the cylinder The cylinder so was your prediction correct Was yours Was yours Mm no What shape did you predict Um the sphere Sphere but the cylinder went the farthest so were you right No so did you circle the little X on the bottom And then you can do your picture Was your prediction correct Brian Okay so circle the check mark and draw your picture and then you guys can copy the graph from the board on the back so you can show your parents what happened Good work team All right so this team s all set Okay so which one went the furthest for this team The sphere The sphere okay so was your prediction right Cecilia Yeah Okay was yours right Brooke So does it matter if you got it right Not at all Alright so then draw your observations draw what happened and then you can draw the graph on the back Now we have to draw the graph on the back 
 I teach in a second and third grade combination class The students are arranged in grade level specific table groupings This allows students to complete any grade level specific projects together and receive instructions in a manner that s clear to them I also have a guided reading area And a independent reading corner All of the resources the students may need are located around the perimeter of the classroom leaving access to the center of the classroom the large rug area for all of our class discussions to take place As well as collaborative group work Students also have available to them the reading corner area as an area for collaborative group work They have a listening center where they access books on tape and CD We have three computer stations where children word process completed writing projects or they do research on the internet But complete sentence okay for that first part All right and then someone who s taking turns So we re clear on the rubric what my expectation is when we walk around Questions If they make a mistake do you want us to correct their English or You know what what I think is a nice way to correct someone when they misspeak and I do this a lot so you might notice that I restate what someone has said And that s part of being a good listener So being able to recall or restate Something like oh I heard you say and then you restate it in the way that might be more appropriate That s a respectful way of being a listener and also a speaker when you re trying to teach and be a role model I have a different idea I think that is Okay so there s another way I think that is excellent So we re going to just try this out and see how it goes We re going to try this out again and practice those cues Are we the same number as usual Yeah okay so here we go We re going to practice When you get to your pictures this is what I want you to do Right now I have put I have this image of a whale on okay can you have a seat I need everyone sitting next to their partners right now So what I want you to do is looking at this picture I want you to practice right now in your group sharing one or two things that you notice in this picture What do you see So I want you to share exactly physical features and use descriptive language to talk about what you see Question Hold on a second sweetie I just called on Jonathan Just a second Question We re going to describe with our partner So you re going to need to turn to your partner Adam what did you I don t really understand what that thing in black is You know it s just a shadow It s a shadow This one It s just a shadow on the picture It just doesn t look very clear the way it came out It s the shadow on the image okay All right so turn to your partner When I ring the bell number ones share first When I ring the bell number twos share When I ring the bell I m going to take some of your descriptive language Sharing what you see Number twos Okay excellent So I m going to pick a stick I m going to go fishing in my sticks And when I call your name I want you to share either what you saw or what your partner saw okay What was the detail that was shared And I m going to write it up on this sticky note because I m modeling now what you re going to do when you get to your stations Everyone s going to get a stack of sticky notes and you re going to get an opportunity after you share to record some of your ideas of what you see Number 10 Cesar Sorry You want to ask a question For a clarifying question No I was just making a comment Just I don t like it when there s only like one sticky note for everyone Because then the first group who goes there puts like every single little thing that they see And it takes up like maybe three quarters of the whole paper And then the next group has like Okay so we re going to solve that problem because each individual gets a sticky note okay And then you re going to choose where you re going to put it All right so number 10 Cesar Madelaine said that she saw white spots and one on the bottom And she said an Orca and she saw a very long tongue and sharp teeth She actually named the animal which was an Orca She saw white spots on the bottom And what was the part about the teeth and a few sharp teeth Oh sorry and then sharp teeth Okay so I wrote more than one idea on this sticky note But what you re going to do is after we do the conversation after we walk through the stations and see the images and talk about it then you re going to go back and record one idea on the sticky note And put it onto the picture So let s try one more I m going to turn it over So look at the picture and then I m going to ring the bell you re going to share and I ll pick somebody else to share what they see Okay so who s next number 21 Roberto My partner says oh what I said It can be what you said or what your partner said whatever you decide His was good I said that I see a pod of Orca whales and their dorsal fins sticking up out of the water That was great So he has two points that he sees the pod which is how we refer to A group A group excellent use of the vocabulary The Orca whale so he s named the actual type of whale And he starts looking at the dorsal fins which is one of the physical features Not only of the Orca but of what The humpback doesn t The humpback that s right it doesn t have a dorsal fin So which ones have the dorsal fin All the others ones except for that one There s a couple of other ones as well Blue whales don t Blue whales good good good good good Eyes up here Are there any questions on what I want you to do when you go around to the different stations Yes Sarah So how many sticky notes are we going to get Like a couple four or five So first I m going to give you a chance to walk around And then I m going to come around and I m going to give you some sticky notes So you re going to let us look at them and then we re going to pick which one we want and put a sticky note on Yes exactly exactly What s this This one s cool I see some baleen which means it s a baleen whale And it looks like it has a big mouth And the baleen looks like it is some sort of bendy thing And on the bottom of the baleen it s scary And it looks like it has a big mouth which probably means it is a very big baleen whale I see a baleen whale with a lot of crushed thingies And a person s touching it I m not sure if it s a real whale that s alive It might just be an exhibit No Jake And so I don t really think this is something that s underwater It s part of baleen It s like a baleen whale there s baleen but It looks like a Blue Whale because it is very big It also doesn t have any throat looms and it has just a small bump for it s dorsal It also looks like it s swimming very close to the top And that also looks like it s coming up for air I see a whale that a man is touching their teeth I m not exactly sure what type of whale this is but it s a whale I see someone touching part of a whale and it might be part of a baleen I see a whale and I think it s coming to the surface for a breath because they cannot breathe under water I think that that is a baleen whale because it is it is white and it s a little bit gray I see a whale that is going up to the surface of the water and I believe that it s a beluga whale I see the whale I think it s going to jump out the water and then dive I see a big gigantic beluga whale with his skin has a couple like dents and wrinkles And it doesn t have a dorsal fin 
 Okay What objects or pictures do you see I see a flag A flag A sign The sun And the letters A sign Yeah And the birds There are birds over here People carrying bags Okay people carrying bags There s a ship A ship The ladies all have hats Okay The ladies all have hats on They look like they re dressed to go somewhere right Yeah Good All right Do you want us to write it in here You can copy it I have the words spelled up here We have Uncle Sam We have a boat Do you want us to write it I m going to have it up here Yeah Oh We have a flag We have this thing What does this thing look like Kind of like a witch No No Yeah It looks kind of like a witch Something scary anyway right Yeah Broccoli It looks like broccoli Okay Yeah it does It s kind of fluffy on top I agree All right There are people We ve got people We ve got birds Mm hmm So here are our objects Uncle Sam boat American flag I wrote scary devil looking thing If you want to put witch looking thing that s fine I m gonna put both Traveling people and birds I put enough blanks for a few objects but feel free to add more than the number of lines I wrote All right Okay Which of the objects whoops Okay Which of the objects do you see could be symbols The flag All right This is what I want you to do Stop Turn to the person beside you Beside you beside you beside you See if you can think of you already said flag That s a perfect example It is one of them I think four of these are symbols Not every object is going to be a symbol So turn and see if you and your partner can come up with any more Each pair can be that Two different Yeah Oh All right What did we come up with We came up with the top of his hat thing It s the same as the flag It looks exactly like the flag okay So what could Uncle Sam be a symbol of U S Of the United States Good Did you come up with one The traveling people The traveling people What do you think they symbolize They re from other countries Yeah They symbolize people from other countries Good Did you come up with one The scary devil looking thing Okay What is that It s clouds in the sky Okay It looks like clouds but why did the artist draw the clouds as a scary looking thing To get them out To scare them Or maybe it s the rain They re scared of storms Okay Who is the devil looking thing Who is he going after The people The people What are the people running away from From their other countries From their other countries So what could the cloud be a symbol of Bad things Immigrants Yeah They re the immigrants What is the cloud Yeah Their governments from their own countries Oh Is coming back after them or trying to scare them anyway All right Here we go We have these four Uncle Sam the boat the American flag and the devil looking thing I didn t do one for the travelers but you re right They can symbolize immigrants Uncle Sam symbolizes America This is one you didn t say I told you The ark this boat here symbolizes what The Bible The ark from the bible Okay Is anybody familiar with the story of the ark in the bible Yeah What did the ark do It saved It saved Noah his family and who else Animals And the animals Oh yeah Now I remember So what do you think this boat s purpose in this picture is What s the boat going to do Save them Save Okay So knowing that knowing that this is an ark and knowing that this is America what do you think Are these people being stopped or welcomed Welcomed Welcomed And how do we know that He s letting them in He s like come on let s go But how do we know that he s welcoming them and not telling them to stop Because it s the ark Because it says ark okay And we re connecting what we know about the ark to this picture That is called an allusion In English class you talked about allusion Allusion is when you refer to something that is famous Some famous piece of literature Okay The flag stands for freedom The scary devil looking thing is governments from other countries Take a second and copy that down Okay I ll go on to the next question How are the words How do the words in the cartoon tell you what the symbols mean Okay We talked about this already The U S Ark of Refuge are some of the words in the cartoon and they tell us that the boat is a symbol of the United States Okay Identify the cartoon s caption All right In this cartoon there is no caption There is no title at the top or at the bottom but there are some words that help us understand and that s this sign The sign says no oppressive taxes no expensive kings no compulsory military service So this is the promise of the United States to the immigrants To the traveling people Words or phrases used in the cartoon to identify objects or people in the cartoon Okay What words or phrases here can be used to identify I was going to say the ark Yeah The Ark of Refuge And what does it identify The ark It identifies the ark as what in this cartoon What is the ark The boat But what is it a symbol of Welcoming Yeah A symbol of welcoming people right Or a symbol of America itself because once you re in you re in America What words or phrases in the cartoon appear to be the most significant All right Calling the U S a refuge tells us people come here for safety We ll come back to it And here the sign says no taxes or oppressive kings Tell us why people left their countries To get good jobs Yeah To get jobs To have a better life Right What were they running away from From paying taxes From paying taxes From kings Now any guesses about what time period people would have been running away from taxes and kings 1900s 19th Century The 19th Century which would be the periods were very big Kings were a problem in some places in the world No oppressing taxes Even as far back as the revolutions in the 1700s people were dealing with this okay So you can use clues in a cartoon to figure out when the cartoon was written and sometimes things like these signs can help you figure that out All right List adjectives in the cartoon and what they mean What adjectives are in the cartoon It s on this sign for one thing Oh The kings Okay What did they call the kings Wealthy What did they call kings What kind of kings did they have It s kind of hard to read there Okay Here we go We ll do it this way Controlling Yeah More powerful than others Expensive can t see I know I know So oppressive means it s controlling Expensive means they spend too much money Yeah Compulsory means that you have to do something Compulsory military service means everybody has to join the army So some people might be running away from that because not everyone wants to be in the army The army s a fantastic place but not everybody wants to be there You do understand right Yes Okay Anybody not want to be in the army I want to serve my country Yeah Would you want to live in a country where everybody had to do it No I want to have a choice You want to have a choice I want my army to have chosen to be there Right Because I don t want a bunch of people there twiddling their thumbs and not wanting to be there okay Okay Describe the action in the cartoon Action I can t cover those I forgot to put the space bar Okay so what s happening in the cartoon We ve already said this Everybody s coming to Uncle Sam And what s happening The cloud is trying to get them away from Uncle Sam Right All right What is the message of the cartoon It s that we have to welcome the immigrants Correct The message of the cartoon is that the U S is welcoming immigrants who are trying to get away from places they don t like What special interest groups now this one I remembered to put the extra thing in there so you all have to think about it What special interest groups would agree or disagree with this cartoon Stop and take a second Turn to your partner See if you can think of somebody that would like this cartoon and somebody that would not like this cartoon Talk to you partner What is it Okay A special interest group Go ahead keep talking A special interest group is a group that talks to the government to try to get them to make laws for them okay So what kind of group would agree with the cartoon and what kind of group would not agree 
 In my classroom each student has their own individual workbench with a set of hand tools in the drawers where they also may store their art and they ve each made a back splash of art inspirational images In the corner of the room I have a resource area including images of art books and magazines a computer with an internet connection and examples I have a board where I give notes and it has a calendar with the semester at a glance I have a demo table where we meet for discussions and group demonstrations In the corner of the room there s acid etching done safely with rubber gloves and goggles and a rubber apron In front of that there s soldering with a acetylene tanks chained to the cabinet and a good ventilation system above and also eye protection and gloves The sink area includes an emergency eyewash station and soaps In the corner of the room you see a fire extinguisher a buffing machine a hammering area done safely with a stump to limit the percussive nature of each blow and ear protection a drill press done safely with eye protection and gloves an emergency eyewash station and shower and first aid kit In here we have an enamelling area above banks of labeled cabinets with ventilation And in the front we have a bulletin board with notices and class rules and another fire extinguisher This is another reason why people might own jewelry or want to have jewelry Now this isn t jewelry per se You know what these are Coins Coins There s such an interesting iconography of coins I love the patterning that happened when he cast them I mean I just think its You ve got the horse You ve got the man Some sort of a symbol I don t really know what all the symbols are but you could really use a lot of this And do research symbols like for the production project that is coming up And here people have even made jewelry out of the coins And here art is an example of in north Africa a lot of times women traditional women it s probably changing now but I don t really know how much it s changed or not changed This picture is from 1988 or something so it s in the past But they would get a lot of their wealth from their family given to them as jewelry And they d wear it everyday And it might seem ridiculous to us you can do your farming you re going about your business cooking and you re wearing all that craziness but that way it s on them they have it if something happens to their husband nobody can take it away because it s on their body It s protected It s also very obvious If the husband were to steal the money and take it away they would know because she s not wearing it So he would be shamed So it s sort of it s like the dowry the money comes into the family from the woman s parents but it s also to help protect the woman It s not just it s not just to go to the husband So I think it s amusing that they re wearing it I thought they weren t allowed to wear makeup Well it depends in what part of where you are I mean are you thinking who is they I m thinking Iran and stuff and north Africa Right Iran there s different sects of Islam and what people believe as really strict is different In this north Africa Iran s more in the Middle East getting closer I mean does it even even in Asia it might even be Asia No it s not in north Africa It s not in Africa So this is like north Africa there s a lot of tribal groups that were nomads in the desert It s all intermixed And people in southern Africa like in Sudan are predominantly Islamic and they have a different take on it too So maybe in Iran it s frowned upon as vanity but The Muslim culture requires women to cover their faces It s not Muslim religions that only It s Arabian That s very good Chloe Very very astute It s there traditions It s not required by the religion it s a cultural thing That s good That s a good clarification I didn t think of it that way So also this redeemable investment or wealth people like to and they have people over for dinner Golden silverware On the right that was the silverware of Marie Antoinette I ve never heard of gold silverware So gold I know they re eating on gold And it can t be 24 carat because it would be too soft But it s probably a gold alloy And there s also cases of people when times get tough melting down their silverware So they can have the Yeah and you use that as your it s like people nowadays are investing in gold They re buying gold bars because it s like you own something You see it It s not just a piece of paper that says you own something Yeah I think there s commercials about buying gold And this is a chalice through the church The church accumulated a lot of wealth specifically the Catholic church during the Medieval times And they would have it made into these things like the chalice for the blood Okay attraction and beauty This is pretty obvious because where do people usually wear jewelry On their necks and faces and Yeah yeah to draw attention I think to the face usually is a big deal And also this is an example of a Cartier necklace that was a gift from a man to a woman So a lot of times it s with the idea of love or commitment romantic love Here we have Indians from India and these are things that you can buy This is just off of that So this is like the traditional wedding where you ve got kind of an inexpensive version perhaps that you can buy There s all sorts there s all levels of expense that you can buy And here we are again with north Africa Just kind of thinking about the different ideas of what is beautiful and what isn t beautiful I don t know How many of you have tattoos Any of you have a tattoo I wish Okay I mean you re a little bit young Right Do you think you might want a tattoo at some point Yeah my friend has a whole entire paragraph on her back Really Do you like it Yeah it s really pretty but I wouldn t want something like that Yeah I don t remember what it says Something it has to do with swimming I think It s like swimming In some way It s a really good quote though Yeah she looks like that girl from Avatar You know I haven t seen Avatar but as a movie designer James Cameron what do you think he was looking at to get inspiration for the movie Probably If you I mean does anybody like Star Wars That was a popular kind of thing But you know I always wanted the hair braids Mom mom please She s like Your hair isn t long enough That was a movie They had it was a wig I was like Do it Do it I braid my hair put beads in it sometimes There are cultures that wear their hair like that So it s like nothing is sort of new under the sun People are reinventing what s already happened I always wanted it just like Pocahontas that s the entire story The second time I saw it I was like Oh this is really bad One thing they represented it wrong that s like the reason they were there because it was very valuable Oh so you re thinking it could have been a little more creative You know the first time you see it it s so good And then the second time you re like Hey now that I ve seen this So it s good to critique pop culture to determine If you get a job in the movies how would you do it better or differently I d do a different plot I d be more creative Okay yeah we better I m gonna keep moving on All right Okay so here we have ancient Egypt on the left and we have Miss South Carolina 2000 I can t remember 2004 2006 recently Isn t it interesting how similar the eye the eyeliner the long eyebrow the hair coming down the crown You know I mean I think the eyebrows Well she doesn t have the I m trying to create a bead kind of thing Okay Melting the stuff Drew was using for his corset together Oh the screen So you re melting the screen Oh interesting So how will you use that in your I m thinking I can use it in attaching because I think it would look cool if there was something kind of like that not gold and shell ish Okay Okay well do you want to go look at your stuff Or do you want to or you feel like you need to finish that Oh no that s fine There appears to be no blue stuff Oh the pickle It s new Oh It only gets blue from the copper so it it does have pickle in it It s just fresh and new So you could you could see that little yogurt container You can put it in that and that has holes in it and then you can just kind of let that float Just kind of put a little in there Like tip it Yeah that s good Okay yeah let s go look at your Oh should we look at those Would you rather do those or Okay let s go Sorry we re going outside now Okay Oh wow What do you think I like them I really like them as not a shell color because they don t seem Can I touch it Sorry I touched it before I asked you I think once you like as I did just find the shell along the stream Right you re transforming it I really like the shell of the spray paint too because it helps tie it in with the metal It makes well it s metallic spray paint so it seems really metal y yeah Right Cool And it makes it a little bit more blingy You know And I like how it reflects the light all the cracks and stuff Yes it gives it a unifying presence instead of having all that color variation Especially if you think about having one necklace that has many shells on it Then this unifies them It makes them probably a little bit more wearable with people s clothes Do you think About how would you how will you attach are you thinking of using these in one group Or are they more pendants I think they re more like pendants and I was gonna poke a hole Okay Like two holes in them and I was gonna use a bunch of different strings together So it s kind of like and they re right there And maybe bead it a bunch of beaded strings So really this is like one necklace that s or is it many necklaces that people can layer It s just one necklace Okay all right Well let s can we go look at your sketch book too The other thing is next time it would be better I think to drill the hole first before you paint it Okay Because I m afraid the paint might scratch in the process of drilling the hole I was going to just poke a hole with a needle Can you do that I think so I mean they re really a lot more soft than metal Oh okay well try it and see if it works But I have a diamond drill bit It can drill and that s what Drew has been using to drill his glass and stuff Okay and also most of these already have holes Oh yeah because of the creature that eats the muscle Yeah I love the hole that s already in there yeah okay All right let s go look at that These probably need to dry a little more Yes Okay okay let s go in There s only five more minutes on here Okay that s good We ll get this and that ll be okay Oh look at that See that s amazing to me because whenever I find coquinas I guess I find the live coquinas I ve never seen the shells like just the shells But they all have a hole This is a great find I got my back so sunburned gathering all of these on the beach Yes Because they all lay next to each other in the sand And when you I mean now do you have sketches of how these might be transformed into jewelry I m not sure yet because Here I ll come over is this better like this Yeah I could use like I could put them all together on one string on one necklace Sort of like the coral But I don t know I don t think I have enough for that from reproduction Well you have a lot What might be better right because you re right Because then they would nest Right If you just put with cubicle then they don t take up much space What if you made a bunch jump rings with thin wire and then you have a little jump ring that would go through each one And that could put see how you have sort of charms on your chain You could these could also be sort of like charms hanging down and you could layer them maybe with a jump ring could have a little chain And it could hang down to vary the length or or you said that you like to use did you make your necklace that s woven there That s okay you but you know how to sew So could you sew them on something I could yeah I mean I have some leather strip and that would be keeping with natural materials So that might be interesting I don t know I well I think what you need to do is to experiment sew some do some metal through some and then maybe lay some out And you can see how Chloe has hers laid out in that box so that she can keep it I think you d need a box or a tray and you could sort of lay it out so you can start to see the composition of them Yeah Now what are these Those are Oh and these are a dove s feathers They re so elegant Yes Now do you have your sketch book Can we look at the sketch on how you thought you might do this Here I think I got it Here you go I could do this with the shell Oh because that s hanging off And then what is this round ring part I m not sure It could just be like a round golden It could be a soldered ring of metal like brass wire soldered together Is this an earring Yes Okay That may be for these Right That was that s what I was planning to do with the shell For that I could do a bunch of different strings or I could just do one string and put two of these sort of up the string or something Right right asymmetry Okay I like it And then this is the feather These are jump rings and this is the feather 
 Present your position to the other side Make sure that you include the SFI that backs up your position Okay After that three minutes we ll swap sides All right So three minutes pros go right ahead We re talking about how minorities have made a lot of progress since Reconstruction and political things Originally there was no black senators or congressman but after Reconstruction around 1865 there was two black senators and fourteen congressmen and now there s four black senators and I m sure more black congressmen It s like quadruple the representatives And other minorities are representative represented in the House and Senate so they ve made a lot of progress becoming a representative government They didn t have the knowledge of earlier So that s one way Reconstruction positively affected education in the South in America Also these statistics show that even though even though certain states are slightly low on the circulation per capita statistics Virginia is number fifteen which is relatively high for a Southern state Except Florida is number thirty four And not all Northern states were held higher than education held higher than Southern states Like Pennsylvania West Virginia and Delaware which are all Northern states are in relatively low positions on the scale And former slaves were able to kind of give back more to the culture and they influenced technology and science and advances in those And kind of started influencing culture in the South and kind of in all the United States So and it really basically spread freedom through the South and finally gave the former former slaves a voice and a place in the country And finally brought them together Y all have anything else I found The ones they could like progress forward and they could because they have so many African American positions and authors for that for that I think overall it finally gave blacks a place and gave the South a place in the country again where they had been separated for so long Kind of started bringing everybody together again Because after the Civil War the South still thought that We don t have to cooperate with the North All right guys That was pro All right Three minutes let s here the anti Three minutes and then we ll after Listen real quick guys After this three minutes we ll give it another minute okay and one more minute after that for a rebuttal okay For the final statement of the pros okay Go ahead antis 1865 time of Reconstruction and during nothing really got done If you look at the statistics the infant mortality in Mississippi is number one and if you go on to the lifestyle statistics Mississippi is the very has the least number of museums concert halls and observatories in city centers showing the link between Reconstruction and just how it affected the South and how nothing got done after the Civil War Let me I m sorry to interrupt let me ask you this What caused I mean there had to have been something I mean during Reconstruction everything was progressing Something happened to cause that overwhelming shift in numbers that you just pointed out That you know the Southern states the old Confederate states dominated the bottom of that poll Why do you think that is Why would that happen Because the North is trying to punish the South after the Civil War They re more focused on helping themselves and not helping the South Because they re more focused on slavery than actually trying the help the South because they were trying to punish them So they didn t They were trying the free the slaves they weren t trying to help the South because they didn t want them to become stronger also Was there a particular event that really solidified this that really made that come to fruition What is it the time frame of your question 1865 to 1877 Okay so During Reconstruction Right So what happened at the end of Reconstruction Why 1877 What happened in 1877 They took the military out of the South Exactly So if the military was pulled out what do you think caused this result economic constraints imposed by Northern owners and eventual overseas competition hampered development and Birmingham never developed into the world class steel making center that it was supposed to be So yeah it did sort of improve but it just never reached its potential because and it even says hampered by Northern constraints So the North basically said you can t produce more steel because we say so So you can t so Birmingham just couldn t really get any better at that point So the South has more industry now like everything in the South is in the lower twenty eight percent Okay guys listen We re going to give you one more minute You have a one minute period the pros if you want to add a little rebuttal to what you just heard okay After this minute we re going to take two minutes to compile our final position okay like our final little thesis all right that we re going to present then to the class Okay So one minute for a rebuttal from the pros Go ahead Because since the military left everybody revolted so They had no motivation Everything that had been implemented for those years went out the window and But I think it s still a positive way was that it at least it still left kind of some ideas of how to keep order and the South still kind of had gotten a taste from the military on how the Americans wanted things run and how they needed to do to function as America and so I think that mostly the military Reconstruction like that was good because it kind of came in and helped them that way What is the number of African American senators and representatives What does it show What is the difference between Reconstructive Era huge difference All right guys listen up You get two minutes I need each side to compile your final argument okay your final statement This is what you re going to present to the rest of the class Remember you need SFI to back up your position okay That SFI can be census data More importantly it can be book data Okay Just normal normal information from your text So two minutes go ahead and write it out if you want Go Each side comes up with their final points We could go into more detail on the three fifths compromise and we could mention the Ku Klux Klan intimidated even though they got the vote they were still controlled by the white people Yeah the social system still was there OK I ll write that down Could this be applied too Absolutely Remember you have to explain to the class in a way that they can understand it okay They don t have that particular census data in front of them So make sure that you re clear when you present that as SFI in front of the class Tell them how many libraries and Virginia is the only one that s in the top fifty percent Completed out of fifty and so All the Southern states are in the bottom And then this is trying to say what Twenty five right here Oh so the bottom twenty five half Existing at the time which was Should we tell them that these states aren t or should we just not tell them No I would just Most African Americans that were unskilled at the time worked through this program to become more independent workers and to learn to read and write and so I ll go back to my statistics here Virginia and Florida All right guys we re going to go in this order Listen up We re going to go in this order We re going to go economic then social political then educational Okay The pros are going to give their positions first to the class All right Now the chart that you have in front of you what I want you guys to do is while the rest of the groups are presenting their findings their positions I want you to take down three different pieces of information that you hear specific pieces of information that you guys hear from the presenter All right Because you re going to use this when you formulate your own response at the end of class to how you feel about you know the efficacy of Reconstruction based on what you ve heard Okay You re going to make your decision so you need to make sure that you have information down to support that okay to support your idea And make sure you re getting that from their presentations All right So we re going to go with economic first Economic pro you have two minutes Camille you it Yeah All right Everybody listen to Camille Okay So we came up with a thesis and it was Reconstruction positively affected America economically by bringing a broader selection of products to the South and North And the North was trying to find ways to help the South with the 13th and Alabama and Mississippi and everyone they started mining for coal and iron and everything and so that helped their economies because they were able to make more money with that instead of just cotton And the North put a few restrictions on that but that still helped their economy for more products And the North manufactured more like grain And we talked about other things that weren t really economic That was about it that we could come up with Okay Thank you All right Anti Who is our speaker today Okay Grant go ahead All right So you mentioned the steel and iron and coal industries and yes those did help But at the same time the North industries the North s economy was growing and it was growing faster than the South And there was the whole economic deals with inflation where So the South basically was making more like a higher number of dollars but it essentially was the same work as before the war 
 Look I can be a serk Now my whole house is great I can do anything good I like my school I like anything I like my dad I like my cousins I like my aunts I like my Allisons I like my mom I like my sister I like my dad I like my hair I like my hair cuts I like my pajamas I like my stuff I like my room I like my whole house My whole house is great I can do anything good Yeah yeah yeah I can do anything good Better then anyone Okay Ok what cha learn from the video She can do anything Ok what else She likes to sing Be positive She likes to sing be positive What else What else did you learn about the video Believe in yourself Believe in yourself Okay now how is this going to be related to our yearbook class Stay positive about it People get a what s gonna what the outcome s gonna be Okay and the outcome is something that we wanna be able to serve the entire school Okay what else How is this also related to yearbook and what we re trying to accomplish We shouldn t blame ourselves I m sorry We shouldn t blame ourselves Okay good good Okay so what we re going to do after this this is a good start I think for the work that we re gonna be having to do this afternoon We re gonna have to work on our ladder And I know that we ve spent some time on it we ve had to make some considerable changes But I think that the compromise the agreement that we all talked about yesterday I think it can be implemented today So what we re gonna try to do is based on These are the signatures that we have allocated One signature for elementary school One signature for middle school And five signatures for the high school I think let s try to fit it in Let s try to stay within the seven signatures Don t forget we have ads also Okay so I think Tanisha and Dustin and Jazz will be on team one And Sammy Emily and Colleen will be on team two Let s work together What are the rules of getting the teamwork going When we re trying to discuss What are the things that I want you to think about Everyone has a voice Okay everyone has a voice What else We all have to agree to a middle ground Okay And it s not just for the high school seniors Okay so it s for the entire school The elementary school middle school and high school So let s be fair and try to get everybody involved What else Discussion wise among yourselves What would I like you to be working on Collaborative work Compromise Okay let s go ahead and start You have the books there you have copies of the previous ladder Let s get it good Yeah I understand elementary school middle school high school In what order It s up to you honey If you want to start with the middle school elementary school high school I don t know maybe just cause I m a senior I kinda like that plan It just seems weird starting at the elementary school I think it s just that they re not as important just that Cause it s always started at high school It starts with the seniors and it s like this is what for Okay now remember just because it s always done before I know but If we started with the elementary school We d be starting with the fourth grade And that s really our Kind of an awkward place to start Okay now remember with your signature you were gonna start with Student Life correct With the High School So you could start with that I mean look at it and you can see And then we re gonna start it with like the introduction Um like um Pictures Student life candid shots Right And then we re going to the seniors and all the senior stuff and our classes And then the sports and night clubs Yes We re not gonna have a class class division page anymore Cause all of the classes are scrambled Are we still thinking like doing division pages Like how it was worded originally Except not for the classes Because all the classes were split up Yeah now it makes it easier to do your me right Don t forget what s our theme Me Okay so keep that it mind when you re creating your signatures And I think now that solicited more allocated the sections are allocated Your division pages maybe more adaptable They ll fit in there more Yeah They ll fit in there more Don t ya think I guess So should we just do one like just high school division page then middle school Yes try it and see See Now you might still need a division page for sports you might still need a division page But you don t need as many I think We definitely won t have one for the classes Cause they re all split up They re already split up And I think this is what helped save us pages Remember you re getting eight signatures Um Question Yeah The yearbook two pages and ads is under the high school Only because I just put that as just to remind you that we need to have ads at the very end Okay So whatever is your last section you have to have ads We have to start selling ads And again if you have any questions on the photographs Sammy is here she can help you with what ever photograph you want Show the blood drive scales And then But their only sport is the seventh grade basketball Everything else is going into high school Does it make sense Yeah yeah They all happened right there together Are we still gonna do straight lines and single lines like they did I think we might just do a big column Yeah We can still do that and then after our seniors we can explore all the classes in line And it makes sense If you have that quote Yeah We are gonna do Student Life seniors all the senior stuff And then classes Make sure that you have your page counts Are doing school division pages or are we doing section division pages I guess we could do school and then We would have to have the division pages that we thought of the spread division page with all the things It could just be different little division pages Yeah okay so Or like have the title at the top of the page Don t forget she has control of the photographs So you need to consult with her okay You can ask her Okay um So are we going to do a senior opening page I think we could just have an opening page on the division page I thought we were going to do the top Instead of doing a collage how they put in their like the song and all that on the second page Around all the photos we should put Cause in our theme or whatever it s just a strip Of pictures Blended in the big picture So we re have written around it to add in these So I think that we should put these on the first opening page Now remember we did this only because we had no choice I like well I like the happenings that we decided not to do for the opening page for the seniors Because it s new life Since our theme it s just one strip We could arrange it like this I think that we should put on that page we should put these Oh definitely Yeah good idea Well what happened is the reason why I placed it and you placed it here because when you sort it all originally it was so empty and it didn t mean anything so we went ahead and did that I think it would have been better to do that from the beginning And then we can have Alex start doing the onward for two others Do we want to put favorites before the formal I think we should put favorites So we re talking this one right These are the formals you want before the favorites No we want our favorites before our formals Oh Okay And then we re combining formal and baby pictures in quotes right Yeah Well you know what do you think Well I like combining it Can you pull up the other ladder Do you still have that one If we have that picture and then another picture and then another This one Is this the ladder you want to see Which section do you want to pull Student life I think it s on that Right here Yeah Let me know Because then I can go back and let her know So you want to start off with that So it ll be like The formal then the baby and then the quote Can you tell Emily what she missed yesterday About the quotes No were you present When you said that a lot of seniors who didn t have quotes last year They would rather have a big list of them and just have them pick and cross it off If they can come up with their own And I have a quote book Somewhere and we can start deciding We can go from very funny to very serious So the kids can have a good choice Did you want me to go back to the other one How are you deciding the order Is it just from serious to funny or Well it s more funner stuff the memories into the more serious stuff And you re ending it with the grauduation Yeah You rather repeat our homecoming But that s spirit week There s another one That s what homecoming fills This is the problem On the other ladder that we had the only high school Student Life we had was Holten Hemming and Spirit Week That s the same thing Yeah Hemming and Spirit Week Like one spread and then the awards honors Well that doesn t make up for all the signatures Oh then we had prom You had the prom and then you had how about the senior the um Sports Banquet Sports Banquet should award everybody Not just seniors Yeah it s got uh Do you want to put that under student I don t What if we You cut the prom down to one page but maybe we could put it back to two pages we could show like the planning of prom and setting it up Okay but Cause I m on the prom committee Okay so and you have your committee meeting start taking pictures Guys remember we have seven cameras So take cameras with you when you re having little meetings Just make sure you re flexible enough just in case we don t have enough pictures you can flip back to one page instead of the signature I mean instead of a spread Well I don t know how we re gonna fill up the signature then Well you don t have to have we can move everything up And then we move seniors up into another half of the signature and that half would have to be colored Because it s the senior signature Um Do you have a section for committee We had those in with the clubs With like all of their what they do in the community Okay if you want you can bring it up a little more Just the overall community that doesn t have a club And use up that space Like the blood drive The blood drive is not part of the school Rotary does that Rotary yes but that s the interact is with Rotary yes Yeah we help with that We help Rotary But you also do the Victorian Classic Yes You don t have enough space You need to put the blood drive up I mean how much space breaks A spread Oh Interact has a spread Yeah we ve covered this three times now Okay sorry Yes but we ve changed it three times So Find other community things Well if you want do you want to talk about the tax bill Well that s not really student life It s going to affect your life Yeah but 
 One eighth plus one eighth is Oh one eighth okay Is she adding one eighth together a bunch of times Where do you see that Can you come up and show us You have to get seven of them Okay Katriana could you add that number sentence up above your picture also So I like how you re all thinking while she s writing this There s a couple different ways we can represent this I think Anielli and lots a groups had their hand up were right that she did I can see she took seven pizzas and divided it into eight pieces for eight people And I also see where and when I talk to Katriana she said Well I got one eighth plus one eighth and one eighth and one eighth and one eighth How much is that gonna add up to equal She s got one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth Seven eighths Seven eighths okay And that s how much pizza she told us What about seven divided by eight A bunch a groups kept their hand down after Anielli shared that number sentence But it s not a complete number sentence until we can finish that equation What would seven divided by eight come out to equal do you think Talk at your group for just a minute again I think we re just a little bit unsure What are you thinkin for seven divided by eight Let s come talk it over with this group You check with this group I ll check with this group What are ya ll thinkin up here Well what do you see in her representation You see how many pizza s Okay seven pizzas Eight people And eight people Did she divide those seven pizzas into eight groups Okay so we ve just gotta figure out how much then that s gonna come out to equal I m not sure Talk about it as a group You can draw it on the back Okay Yes thank you ma am Okay thank you so much for talkin with your group What did you or someone at your group think again If we ve got seven pizzas divided by eight people Katia We ve got 56 divided by eight because there s 56 pieces and it s kinda Okay so you noticed there s and it s cut into Eight Eight slices So you were thinking something a little bit differently Savannah We I thought the same way except I thought that it was gonna be 56 Divided by seven because Each one of them is shaded in and they re all going to eight people Okay Let me ask us all this I love that we re relating this back thinking about some of our math facts and how that can tie in and help us But what did Katriana start with here What do you think the first thing she did was What did she do Steven Drew seven or eight pizzas Did she draw seven pizzas or eight pizzas Seven Seven pizzas Is that what she did first Okay She drew out her seven pizzas So we wanna know or we need to know that that s what she started with What did she divide those pizzas into Into eighths Into eight We see she cut em into eight pizzas Brennan I did I was thinking either 700 or seven tenths Okay So we re thinking back to fractions I think since we don t have a definite answer we don t need to yet Let s leave this kinda open ended but I m gonna circle it so that we remember to come back to it So we ve gotta a great number sentence that one thing Katriana did was add up one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth and she got seven eighths and we re gonna keep thinking about I saw a bit of agreement that seven pizzas she divided by eight people But we need to figure out ladies how much that would mean each person gets So put a big arrow So as we continue let s keep that in our mind Okay thank you Can I have The person who put this one up in black Faith was that you Will you come tell us what you did and what you think the answer might be here How much pizza each person got Well I knew there was eight soccer players so there were seven pizzas so I did seven pizzas Then I divided six of em up in to fourths and then I numbered em all And then when I got to eight I started one two three back over again when I got to another eight I did it again but then I realized that there wasn t enough or more so I split the last pizza up into eighths and that equals up to eight people Okay and that equaled up to eight people So how much pizza do you think each person gets Well I think that each person would get at least one fourth and Okay so let s write this up here So you said each person gets let s put it up in black How much Like let s say person number 1 How much pizza do they get Will you show us They would get one two three They would get three fourths Okay And then one eighth Three fourths and one eighth Like this Okay do you know how much that is all together That would That would equal up to four Okay So let s think about this one for a minute Do you have any questions for Faith about how she figured this out Okay I think she did a great job explaining her picture So she showed us where each person gets three fourths plus one eighth Will you talk at your group How much is that How much is that total Thank you if you wanna join a group Good explanation Okay group what do we think Four twelfths You agree with her four twelfths How did you come up with four twelfths By adding those two together How did you add them together Three plus one would equal four and then four would be the numerator because you added the two top numbers And if you added the two bottom numbers it would equal twelve for the denominator Okay so is there a picture or is there a way that we could show this with pictures that that would come out to equal four twelfths See on the back of your paper once will you draw a representation of four twelfths How come Because I thought that if the denominators were different we couldn t add them up directly Oh So we tried to get the denominators the same What do we call that Equal to fractions I like that your thinking back to remember your vocabulary I tried to tell Katia that if it has a different number on the bottom then we re supposed to add the on the bottom to I don t know Have we learned to do that before Well no but I just thought about it and I ve been practicing Okay So if we haven t learned it yet we ve gotta think about how are we gonna figure it out right Okay so keep thinking It s okay that we re debating between a couple different answers just tryin to explain to each other why you re thinking four twelfths and why you re thinking something different I thought it was because Whenever you add it up And the denominator Okay So I understand where you got the four slices But what size are those slices Would be my next question Because we wanna make sure every soccer player gets the same amount cause I would be upset if I didn t get as much pizza as you did I like pizza Okay Okay well it says four twelfths so we re shading four Do you have 12 pieces there We have one two three Okay If I can have your attention back I know some of you are still discussing and doing a great job But I wanna make sure that we ve got time to get through the rest of our solutions before we re out of time for the day Hailey if I can have you close the door again for us And can I hear what a couple of your groups came up with I heard three or four different things as I was going around Three fourths Hannah said each person gets three fourths of a pizza and one eighth Faith said How much is that Yes I m sorry Faith said since ya ll sat next to each other I still mess that up Three fourths and one eighth How much did you or your group think that came out to be Nathan We came up with seven eighths Seven eighths Because when you take three fourths and then you take another circle that shows one eighth then you divide the three fourths into eighths then add the the ones that used to be three fourths and that equals seven eighths Can you come up and show that to us I think I think I followed in my head but did you all have trouble making that picture in your head Yes A little bit yeah Can you show us You can draw it here or over here we ve got lots of room Nathan you re right Shhh Okay let s see what he does Okay can you step to the step to the side so everybody in the class can see you There you go And then if you divide that into eighths then you add one of the eighths then you add this over here It comes out to be seven eighths Can I just get in agreement or disagreement somebody who had shared with us What do you think about what he just did I saw him draw three eighths at one pizza and one or three fourths of one pizza and one eighth of the next And then I saw him cut this one into eighths How many eighths was three fourths When you cut it Six eighths And then he put one more eighth over and seven eighths What are you thinkin about that Brazy I agree with him Why Because our group said that we know that four eighths is equal to twelve fourths is equivalent to seven eighths and his picture we can see that it s two and when he was workin it out we could see that it was right and so I agree with him Okay Brennan I agree with him but I have a different explanation Okay One fourth is equal to two eighths but then you take Oh I m sorry Let me write this as you re saying it so we can follow it So you said One fourth is equal to two eighths Okay So We multiplied the three and the numerator with three fourths Okay By two which comes from the two eighths and it would equal up to six eighths plus that one extra eighth it would be seven eighths Okay so you said three fourths is equivalent to Six eighths Six eighths okay And then just add the other one seven eighths Okay so then you did six eighths plus one eighth equals seven eighths like that Okay can I just see a quick on your remotes do you agree or disagree with Nathan and Brennan So A is I agree B I disagree or I m confused What s confused We ll just do A and B A is I agree I understand or B is I disagree or I m confused How are you feeling right now about what Brennan and Nathan just said They re two different explanations I just wanna see right now do you agree or disagree with what Brennan and Nathan just said And again they were saying that three fourths plus one eighth is gonna come out to equal seven eighths And they each kinda explained it a different way One with words and one with a picture Need a couple more people to vote if they agree or disagree Number three number eleven we need a vote from you please Where is remote number three There it comes Okay What do we what do we know by looking at this graph What do we know by looking at this graph Thomas 
 So just leave your clicker on your table guys I mean you can put one in front of you just don t turn it on yet they re not activated Please don t play with them because then the batteries can stay charged through the day Thank you for the help Excellent thanks All right guys so let s get started with our discussion here Set the clicker down please don t play with it just leave it on the table thank you I asked you today to get our thinking going to answer this question Danny DeVito is between 4 9 and 5 1 tall So i m 5 10 so Danny DeVito is either between this tall or about this tall We re not sure on his height His wife Rhea Perlman is 5 0 tall How tall do you think their sons and daughters will be and why All right so please raise your hand to share your answer and I m going to ask you why you think like you do So I m going to start back there with Alex So turn this way so that I can hear you okay Okay I think their kids would be around 5 because their mom is 5 tall and their dad his middle height is 5 Okay so you re looking at the middle estimated height of Danny DeVito and his wife s height is 5 so you think together then all their children will be 5 boys and girls Mm hm Okay Great thank you What else do you think J R I said 5 too I said 5 as well because that s about how tall they are so their kid would be around that Okay so you re looking at kind of his average height and her height so you think the kids will be around that Okay anything different or you want to explain it further Michael I just said that you get your height from your parents so whatever the parents were right around 5 the kids will be about 5 Okay you get your height from your parents So since the parents are about 5 the kids will be 5 Boys and girls Yeah Okay great What do you think Well I think the daughter could be 4 9 and the sons would be around 5 2 because both of the parents are shorter and so they could be a little bit taller or even a little bit shorter than one of their parents Okay so even though the parents are shorter they could be taller or shorter than the parents and you said that the daughters could be about 4 9 and the sons might be about 5 2 Yes Is there a reason why you think the boys would end up being taller than the girls It s just kind of a normal thing Normally boys are taller than girls Okay so a normal thing boys are usually taller than girls Okay great Any other ideas on the height of their children Adam what do you think Well what do you think about I think that they ll be around I think boys and girls will both be around 5 because it s right inbetween the parents Okay good What about me and my family I m 5 10 So I m tall What do you think about my family members How tall do you think they are I m 5 10 how tall do you think my mom is How tall do you think my dad is What s your estimation What do you think Raise your hands everybody let s participate Mackenzie what do you think I think your dad would be around 6 2 and I think your mom would be around 5 11 or 5 9 Okay so my mom is between 5 9 and 5 11 so close to my height and my dad would be taller about 6 2 Brian what do you think I said that I think your dad would be taller than you but then your mom would be around the same height So my mom is about the same height and my dad is taller Yeah Anybody think anything Pardon me Or like around 6 My dad would be around 6 Yeah What if I tell you my little brother my little baby brother is 6 4 And he is This is true he is 6 4 So he s a tall guy Does that change your ideas about the heights of my parents You guys are nodding yes What do you think now Travis Maybe your dad is like 6 4 and your mom is like 5 8 or 5 9 or something Okay so Mom is about here Dad is taller or 6 4 like my little brother Michael what do you think Both of them are about 6 Both of them are about 6 Okay great what do you think Well I know that a lot of people get their traits from their dad from dads So that your dad is taller around 6 5 and then your mom is shorter like 5 8 So you see my height and my mom is about 5 8 and my dad is 6 5 so for my brother and I you re figuring about our traits What do you mean That you get your traits from your dad So my dad s genes are coming through Why do you think that Why do you think I have only traits from my dad Because I know a lot of people who get their traits from their dad and more than their mom So more traits from dad than from mom Do you think that s pretty much general Yeah Okay great Do you guys have anything to comment on that What do you think I think your dad s probably like 6 2 because my brothers are both taller than my dad already and they re still in high school Oh interesting Well I ll tell you my mom was 5 11 at her tallest Now she s shrinking she s like 5 9 You know how that happens as you get older and my dad he s only 6 tall So my little brother is the tallest in the family and my other brother he s 6 1 So height does come from both sides but my dad s not as tall you guy s might ve thought Let s talk about Danny DeVito again Here he is our favorite actor right Notice his lack of hair he s bald The question on here says Danny DeVito is bald What do you think his son s hair or lack of will look like when he s older and why His son Danny DeVitto has a son What do you think about his hair Nice and loud so I can hear you Matthew It said that their son would have bald hair on the top but some on the sides Some will be bald on the top but he ll have some hair around the sides Why do you think that Because usually if somebody s dad s bald they re not always bald If somebody s dad is bald they are not always bald I ve seen that You ve seen that That s a good observation Matt What do you think Well the mom has a lot of hair and the dad is bald so I thought he will still have a lot more hair than his dad He wouldn t be completely bald but bald on top Okay so mom has a lot of hair dad s bald So you think the son will have hair but just bald on top Yeah So when you see the traits being passed down how do you see it I m not really sure what you mean by that question You re kind of saying that he ll have this trait but he ll also have this trait So how do you see that happening Did he get all of his traits from one or all his traits from another the son or do you think I think they were combined They were combined The traits are combined Good Sean I thought he would have like a blackish brown hair because that s what the mom s hair color is Okay He probably wouldn t be bald but he d have a receding hairline Okay so he would have a receding hairline and for those of us that don t know what that means that means when a person starts to lose their hair and it kind of inches back and they re losing their hair That s what a receding hairline is So the hair falls out as it moves back Are you ready to see what Danny Devito s kids look like Here they are for our predictions We have his son in the middle standing taller than everyone else in the family He s about 5 5 So he s taller than both mom and dad This is Danny Devito s wife Danny Devito and his son Here s his daughters This daughter is about the height of the mom but she has big shoes on The other daughter is taller But notice their hair what do you notice about their hair Ryan tell me what you notice about all three kids Well they all have hair they re not bald They all have hair they re not bald How would you describe their hair Curly Curly hair What color Black Black or dark brown yes very good All right so we see that Now when we think about these bunnies another question I asked you is this look at the picture If they had ten offspring what do you think the coats for each bunny would look like The fur in what respect that was the question Nathan what do you think 25 would be white 25 would be black the remainder would be gray with a little white So part of them will be black and part of them will be white So half of them will be gray Okay so here s what we have I m going to use abbreviations and 50 will be gray Nathan says that because one parent is white one s black they ll combine to form a gray color just like mixing paint in art class Any other predictions What else are you thinking Let s hear from somebody new What else do you think Omar I think 40 of the bunnies are going to be black are going to be half black and half white like a black bunny with white dots or a white bunny with black dots All right So you re saying 40 black 40 white You will see both colors We ll see black and we ll see white Why did you choose 40 40 and 20 Because I think that it s rare for bunnies to have dots It might be rare for them to have dots Okay so you see that a solid colored bunny more likely the probability is higher for a solid color So that s why you chose 20 Great great thinking Great explanation Sean what do you think I had 20 white and the rest are gray I would have said 25 but you can t have two and a half babies being white Okay All right so you would ve said 25 So you were thinking similarly Yeah Why do you say 20 20 and 60 Because most of them would be a mixture of the two but a few of them would have to have more of one of the parent rabbit s traits Okay so because they have offspring the majority will be a mixture of both of their traits So mom and dad will blend together to create gray but some of them will look just like the father some will look just like the mother so some will be black some will be white Great One more idea Kasey what do you think I know in health that everyone has a dominant feature I think white is so that the majority so like 40 would be white and 20 would be black and then the rest would be gray 40 white 20 black and 20 gray And you said because in health you were learning about dominant features and you believe That s only 80 Oh what did you say for the last one I said the rest Wow well thanks for paying attention Good check there guys It would be 40 60 we need 40 Did you say 40 I said the rest I was just making up too many different numbers Well I m so happy that you guys are paying attention I m going to tell your math teacher good job Okay 40 white but here s what Kasey said that was really good She said that 40 will be white because white is dominant You used that word You talked about that in health a little bit So let s talk about dominant and what that means What does it mean What do you think dominant means And be nice and loud for us John Most of Most of Good What do you think Sam Main Main Sean The majority The majority Alex Beat out all others Beat out all others Nice What do you think Sean Strongest Okay Let me show you a little example here So where do we get our traits first of all Where do we get traits From parents From where Parents Your parents Okay it s passed down Traits are passed down and some come from each parent right Dominant recessive some come from both mom and dad If you received a dominant trait See I labeled this cup dominant and colored it pink and you received a recessive trait So half and half mom and dad They come together which trait do you see The dominant one or the recessive one The dominant one The dominant one What if I put it this way Which trait do you see The dominant one What if I put two recessive traits together The recessive The recessive okay Either way I pair them mom or dad dad or mom If I have two dominant traits that go together what do I see Dominant Dominant okay So if the dominant trait is present then finish the sentence If the dominant trait is present in your genes then what It will show It will show Kasey says That s right if the dominant trait is present it will show Are you guys remembering this from yesterdays little intro Okay let s check this then real quick Yesterday you filled out this concept map Let s make sure that your answers are correct Jsut take a look So read this with me Genetics is the study of heredity the passing of traits from parent to offspring and if the offspring has the same alleles we call that Purebred And if they have different alleles Hybrid What that means allele that word say that allele Allele It s the fun word to say during our genetics unit That s the form of the gene so is it a dominant or is it a recessive Okay so let s go back here Genetics is the study of Heredity The passing of Traits I don t hear everybody Controlled by Genes Made of Alleles Say it again Alleles Alleles So genes made of Alleles Shows when present We call that Dominant And can be masked Recessive Recessive all right very good Any questions on the concept map Any corrections if you need to make them please do so All right Well let s get going with our lab Are you guys ready Okay please take out your lab paper We re going to go back to some of those reflection questions later on Notice the top of the paper It says Problem This is what we re trying to solve This is the point of our scientific investigation Are traits controlled by dominant alleles more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles I d like you on the lines to create your own hypothesis or your prediction for this Are traits controlled by dominant alleles more common that s the question are they more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles So write down what you think write down your prediction If you can write it in the if then format of how we do hypotheses that s preferred but if that confuses you at this point just write what you think is going to happen Are dominant alleles more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles Whatever you think it s your thinking We will talk about our hypotheses in just a moment So once you ve written down your hypothesis reread it and make sure that it answers the question Then we re going to get to work using our clickers which i ll explain in just a moment I d like to hear you share some hypotheses before we begin The question again Are traits controlled by dominant alleles more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles Please share your prediction your hypothesis Ronnie I said yes because dominant alleles it shows over recessive alleles So you believe dominant will be more common because they show over recessive alleles Okay great Girls one of you share your hypothesis for me Who would like to share Everyones looking at you Kate What do you have on your paper I said that I thought the dominant alleles were more common You believe the dominant alleles will be more common Okay great thank you Another one Alex I agreed with it I said that I believe that dominant traits were more common than recessive because there s more combinations to get dominant one s over recessive You believe dominant traits are more common than the recessive because there s more combinations To get that To get to that To get the dominant traits to show Good One more Matthew I said that the dominant traits are less common because in the picture with Danny DeVito His son and daughters didn t look much like him Okay so you believe that the dominant traits are less common because in the example of Danny DeVito his kids didn t look much like him Yeah and how your younger brother is 6 4 And how my younger brother is 6 4 but he s taller than the rest of my family Okay so you re making connections to our earlier conversation good We re going to revisit our hypotheses after we do this lab 
 A prediction on the weather temperatures Okay so maybe they can predict something that s going to happen Yes Okay So based on the information that you collected is there any information let s say you could go out the next day What do you think based on what you saw what do you think might happen the next day It might go back down into the 30s or the 20s Okay and what makes you say that Because there s more 30s and 20s then there are 50s and 40s And then there was a large spike so Okay so it got warmer But you re saying because most of them were cooler it might get cooler again Yes Okay so you re making a conclusion You re using your data to support that Shaun what are you thinking I was thinking that maybe they might want to track it because maybe weather can not evolve over time but how much it s changing and predict what s gonna happen Okay so you re thinking like a meteorologist or a scientist might make a forecast make a prediction so you re thinking sort of like Hava And were your temperatures similar to her or were they very different because you might have been at two different stations What do you think might happen on the next day I think it will drop down to the 30s because I see that it s dropping down it s going up and then it s dropping down I think it s gonna go up and then drop down again Okay and it does look like you had kind of a trend here So what do you think if you had a day that went down do you think it might go up again Mhm Might peak up again Okay Is there anybody else who s looking at their data thinking of what else might happen with that temperature change Madison are you looking at something Yeah what do you think Well with the wind speed and it would be like 8 5 for quite a few times a day Sort of shot up into So what do you think that was indicating That it was a very windy day A very windy day okay So you guys some of you look at your charts if you were Madison was in Group A and can you make a connection or H Madison can you make a connection to your wind speed really spiked On that same day did you have any difference or did you have something happen in your temperature Well the temperature was about 20 degrees and because of the wind was making it cooler Okay so you re saying that you think that the wind also has an effect on the temperature Mhm Okay so was there anybody else in Group H that recorded that sort of thing You had a big windy gust you had a very windy day your temperatures went down Did you have a similar thing happen to you Hava Yes Yes okay So you guys why would we want to track something like not only temperature but also the wind speed Jada So that they can know what tomorrow s gonna be like or what another day s gonna be like Or for them to know if it s gonna rain or Okay What the temperature is gonna do So they want to think maybe more you guys now your thinking Jada you re even putting together precipitation So maybe there s a consequence of precipitation No with low temperature and maybe heat can evaporate some water and then the next day it can get dropped down and get colder Okay so maybe a connection with the precipitation temperature those sorts of things Okay Katie O What are you thinking I would think that they wouldn t just want to track the temperature but they d also do the wind speed because wind speed can change how what the temperature is and how it changes So why do you think wind speed makes a difference with temperature What are you making the connection with What s your evidence Well wind speed I think would change like it wouldn t make it warmer it would make the temperature feel colder Okay So why do you think that Because the wind Well you go out to the playground a lot right Yeah And when you guys are on the playground and it s really windy is it warm No Okay so maybe are you thinking like when you go out there and it s really windy and you don t have a coat does it feel cooler to you Yes Does it on sometimes Yeah Alright so maybe they re maybe a prediction And so you were saying they so are you thinking scientists and meteorologists are trying to put those two together those phenomenons Yeah Okay so Katie O let me ask you if this was a hypothesis that you were saying if it s windier then it may be cooler You guys agree as a class Okay thumps up thumbs down what do you guys think Yes no maybe a little bit there Alright Josh what are you thinking I was saying that if people are always looking at the temperature so we know what s gonna happen when it s gonna happen what we can expect what we need to do Okay So we re taking that forecast even further maybe So let me kind of pose another question real quick before I keep going you guys Let me ask you you guys remember when you went on the computer and you watched the hurricanes And you tracked the hurricanes So was that data indicating the speed or the movement of the hurricane Yes Yes So does a meteorologist even track something like that to be able to maybe help people Yes Okay So do you guys remember when the meteorologist came to visit us You guys remember that And he really talked to us a lot about tornadoes didn t he But he was also giving us situations of how we know a tornado might be forming right So yeah does that make sense that that might be another reason that they start tracking So think and talk to your shoulder partner Besides a hurricane what else might they track to like Josh was saying to prepare us for to let us know So talk to your shoulder partner The weather because some people can know what to like my hands Yeah or like tornadoes Yeah or maybe even thunderstorms Or the normal weather Very intense temperatures we can already know Maybe even like snow because that can be a really heavy and or kind of get everywhere like snowbound us Or it could like be rain snow hail So what do you think Emily what else can we determine Snow storm Or a tornado Or a earthquake So what were you thinking first Alexis and then we ll come back to Nick I was thinking either a tornado or blizzard snowstorm Okay So what kind of weather do you think they re tracking in order for us to be prepared about weather What do we Wind Wind maybe And temperature Snow Okay so if we re looking for just a tornado maybe temperature maybe the wind Yeah what kind of wind is it is it cold or hot yeah Okay hot and cold fronts And then we were thinking about what else Nick I would say a flood because maybe maybe the clouds are coming and there s going to be a bunch of rain Like you said that we could get a flash flood Okay So and are you making that connection to maybe our area that had a fire and so we have to think about would there be because it can t absorb the moisture Okay so that s another idea So how would meteorologist or scientists how would they Austin how would they predict maybe a flood happening What do you think they d use What kind of information would they be looking at Well if a rainstorm was coming because that rain would cause a flood Okay so a large amount of rain that would make sense yes Or snow Or even if we had a lot of snow So if we had large amounts of snow what could we possibly be warning people of if that was the case Alexis what do you think Stay inside or wear warm clothes if you go somewhere or something so they don t get so cold Okay so would you guys say would one of you formulate some sort of a hypothesis about snow coming if there was If there was enough cold air And some times when it s raining it starts to hail and then it starts to sometimes it starts to snow So if there s cold weather and clouds then we might have consequences Snow or rain or yeah of hail or heavy snow Yeah Okay so we d wanna keep that in mind And does that seem to happen in our areas Sometimes Sometimes And sometimes when we make that forecast and then maybe it doesn t come That happened on Saturday Okay so if it does come what happened on Saturday Austin I think it was really humid out at first Mhm And then it started to rain and then a lot of times usually rain starts out as ice and then it melts And it started to get colder and then it started to hail So then we have the consequences of a hailstorm Didn t last Saturday did it start out really nice first Yeah Yeah and then also happened yesterday too because when I got picked up it was nice and warm and everything And then when I got to my house it was all windy and then it started raining So I was like I thought it was supposed to be hot today Right So is it possible to use forecasting information and still be wrong Yes Well in the weather book it explains the rating of tornadoes So I m thinking tornadoes or something to track like the wind speed if it s gets too crazy it get like wind miles per hour and how bad it is Like if the wind speed s really high then it can cause a tornado Like the scale So they use that information We were just talking and showing the things that they might be using for information that they re collecting to do what now To give to the what They re doing it to give us warnings They can t tell us that a tornado s happening prior to it Right So they have to warn us about them And so I think they collect the data from that to do that Okay and then Reagan what were you connecting that with I was connecting it with a blizzard or snow storm because if there s a delay and you need to go somewhere you can know that there might be delays And if you re gonna go outside you need to wear a coat a heavy coat Okay so how do we respond how do we react to it good Okay you guys I was going around and I heard some excellent conversations And so I think you guys made strong connections with your data And probably with your meteorologist visit what they were telling you and how you were putting that information together So I want you guys to go ahead and pick up your pencils And write underneath your graphs I want you to answer this question What does your data tell you So write there on underneath your graph or write on your graph you could even write right in the middle of your graph I want you to write what is your graph actually telling you So is it telling you that you had a series of cold days Make your prediction So go ahead and take a minute or two write down what your data tells you and then what changes did you observe What was the most significant change that you observed If at all possible while you re writing that you can come up with a hypothesis about your data It could either be your wind speed or it could be your temperature Write down what it is that actually took place Yeah you want to answer the question what does your data tell you What changes did you observe On either graph or you can even write a sentence that combines the two of them together So mine says I added a little more It says it is telling me all about my wind speed and how it s going high or low or high What does your say Austin Mine is it had cold and hot days And it went from 44 degrees Fahrenheit to 20 degrees Fahrenheit So go ahead just like Alexis and Austin shared go ahead and share with your face partner this time so that you change who you re talking to So Emily and Madison you can also share what you wrote It tells me that some times it can be hot and then go down to a little bit colder and then it goes back into hot Yeah that s what I was kinda saying when I told the wind speed because it s not always wind speed Yeah it s not always wind speed but most of the time when we took it it was mostly in the winter so it would mostly go down Like it was 40 then it was 25 then it was 20 and then it was 30 and then it was 30 and then it was 40 and then it was 50 So that s what So John what did you figure out from your data I figured out that it was colder the week we were doing this Okay And the wind speed was not very high Okay oh yeah yeah So you were in an area that maybe was more protected by the wind do you think Yeah we were behind the building Oh okay so that might of had an effect too Yeah Okay did you draw any conclusions from that I forgot to do that Okay great Braden tell us a little bit about what you observed from your data Well I observed that I did not get much wind speed Okay so where was your station Were you at a protected area as well Yes Okay so that definitely had an effect didn t it Yes So as a meteorologist would you want to be able to put your anemometers somewhere where you know you re gonna catch the wind Yep Okay so that was a really important lesson right there too So what about your thermometer readings since those weren t dependent necessarily on being protected from the wind What can you observe from your thermometer reading Well that it was and then on Tuesday and Wednesday it got colder Okay so it got colder on Tuesday and Wednesday So if you were making a prediction what do you think would happen on this day based on your data Do you think it s gonna change stay the same what do you think Stay the same Seems like it s gonna stay the same because you have that pretty consistently Yeah Okay alright Tariq what do you find from your data What did you discover observing I noticed that for my temperature I had up and down weather So your temperature was would you say it was fluctuating Yeah Okay why do you think that was happening Because well it was cold on the days we went out but where we were the sun was kind of coming towards us at the times we went out So do you think that had an effect on your thermometer as well Yeah Hm okay so then that s another thing as a meteorologist you might want to think about where your thermometer is right Are you just getting straight sun Okay was there something else you were gonna say about your wind speed Well my wind speed On Monday we got a lot And on Thursday we got a lot On the other two days we didn t get any wind Not too much okay Then Then I also had Go ahead All three of us were in the same group You were in the same group alright So there you go And I also had to say that my wind speed was never below 20 degrees You to pull out your sheet right there that you have about your temperature on the moon I want to ask you one more question And I want you to think about your temperature on the moon Now did you actually go to the moon to get your data No No but let s look at the scientists who recorded that data Why was it important for them to find out the temperature on the moon And as you look at it did it change very much So why was it important and did it change very much Okay Jaime I thought that on one of the missions that it was different temperatures Like it would be and then it dropped down to about 200 Okay and so you re specifically talking about the day Yeah Okay And so you re saying is it pretty similar Is that you re saying Pretty similar but not very Okay so The main thing is that it didn t stay the same Okay it didn t seem to stay the same No Okay And then we had not only day temperature but was the other temperature that we looked at on the moon Night Nighttime okay So what were you thinking about that Shaun I kind of had the same data as Jamie did Okay Because it switched every single mission So on mission 11 it was well 200 and about 13 degrees Okay And it just kept on going down and up each mission So it changed significantly each mission 
 Let s talk about the advantages and disadvantages of each company Let s start with T Shirts R Us Okay who can explain to me what s going on with T Shirts R Us Devon You have to pay a 50 dollar copay and you have to pay six dollars per shirt Okay so you ve got to pay And then what do you pay per shirt Six Six dollars per shirt Okay what are the advantages of that How is this one in some way better than top of the line Allegra what s better about this company You only have to pay six dollars per shirt You only have to pay six dollars per shirt So you re telling me six dollars per shirt is definitely better than eight dollars per shirt Right Okay what s the disadvantage to this plan Who can tell me the disadvantage to this one Sarah You have to pay 50 dollars first You have to pay 50 dollars up front okay So if I were going to buy a lot of shirts let s say I was going to buy 200 shirts which company do you think would be the best for 200 shirts Taylor I think the T Shirts R Us would be better because you only have to pay 50 dollars and the shirts are only six dollars per shirt Yeah for this one the more shirts you buy the better deal it becomes right But for this one if you re not going to buy if we were only going to buy for say 10 people would we want to pay that 50 dollars up front Are we probably going to buy enough shirts to make up that difference Probably not okay So for top of the line tees our initial charge the nice thing about top of the line what s the advantage of top of the line They re eight dollars That it raise you hand Kevin They re only eight dollars They re already eight dollars but is that their advantage Yes No Patrick says no Patrick is their advantage that they re eight dollars per shirt What s the advantage for top of the line Isn t it because the design is free Is free so do we have to pay anything up front No No so if Cameron if you and I were the only people that wanted to get shirts that would probably be a good place to go right because for eight plus eight we pay 16 dollars but up here two shirts is going to be expensive right Right Yeah Yeah it would be over 60 dollars right 62 That s not a very good price for shirts okay Brett I kind of brought this kind of up in my group even though it like wasn t really part of the data Okay Another thing I kind of thought whenever I was working on this last night was if they re charging money for the graphic couldn t it possibly be like a better graphic but It could be It doesn t necessarily mean that it is and I think for this we would probably be assuming that the quality would be at least comparable maybe not identical but at least close okay All right So let s look at a couple of different things okay Let s start with these tables You guys have had a minute to look at these tables What the first question says which of the following tables represents T Shirts R Us With this being our given information which one of these tables is T Shirts R Us Tell me how you know Amanda The first one because the cost starts at 50 before you even buy any shirts Okay so Amanda says that this one is T Shirts R Us and how did you know that You explained that in a really interesting way How did you say that Because the costs are 50 before you buy any of the shirts Yeah Amanda says this one has to be T Shirts R Us because you can see in the table the initial charge of 50 dollars Do you guys agree that you can see the initial charge of 50 dollars Yes Okay that s one way to say it Is there another way Lindsay you had something interesting on your paper What s the other way that we can tell whether or not that s T Shirts R Us I divided 30 divided by five equals six Can you tell me where you got the number 30 and five In t shirts there were a five dollar difference The t shirts goes up by five Yeah so this one goes up And the cost up by 30 And I just divided the two numbers and it told me which of the companies sells the shirts for six dollars So she said that she found that the cost was going up 30 every time the shirts went up five So then to figure out how much each shirt was she divided the 30 by six and figured out Oh no not by six 30 by five and figured out that each shirt was six dollars per shirt So one way to figure it out is look at the rate of change right and another way to figure it out is to look at the initial cost Like what is it that you have to pay up front So in this problem can we see both Can we look at this table and see here s what you have to pay up front and then here s what you have to pay per shirt Can you see that Yes Okay Write that down All right so look at the table and let s talk about the original question that we asked The original question that I asked you and this was just a pick Which company did you think would be the better option for our 25 students T Shirts R Us What did you find out when you really really investigated Casey They re both 200 each You really find out for exactly 25 students they both cost 200 dollars 200 dollars So if we were just buying t shirts for our class would it matter which company we chose No No What if we decided we wanted to do all of my math students If we decided we wanted to do all of my math students which one of these tables would favor the option of buying it for all 100 Bree what do you think If we were going to buy t shirts for all 100 students because at 25 the cost is the same right Which one of these is going up more quickly The one on the left The one on the left s going up more quickly What do you think Nahla says she disagrees Nahla The one on the right is going up more quickly because it s going up by 40 Yeah this one s going up how much every five shirts 40 Yeah this one s going up 40 and at that same time this one s only going up 30 30 right Bree So Bree which one s going up faster The right one Yeah so they re the same here Do you guys see they re the same here You see that Bree But if this one s going up faster if I m going to buy a whole if I m going to buy a lot more shirts what s going to eventually happen with this one It will increase It s going to get increasingly more expensive okay So somebody summarize this for me What did we just figure out about tables What did we just explain about tables What can you find on tables Sierra tell me what we can find by looking at a table Y intercept We can definitely find the Y intercept Can you tell me how we can find the Y intercept When the X value is zero When the X value is zero that s going to be our Y intercept That was an excellent explanation Guys what else can we find from the graph We can find the Y intercept what else can we find Samantha We can find the slope We can find the slope and can you summarize how we found the slope We found the differences between the y column and the x column and then we put in the rise over run Yeah we found the differences between the y column and the x column and then wrote them as the ratio rise over run Excellent job okay So that s tables Cameron question Is it okay on the table where it says like t shirts in the columns is it okay to put x and y over them Cameron if that helps you understand it then yes that s completely fine But you need to understand that x and y represent something Right It s okay for you to think about it as x and y but just keep in mind that x represents the number of t shirts and y represents cost okay That s a good question All right now let s look at the graph Okay suppose these two graphs were given to you Okay look at the graph Is everything on the graph the same in terms of the way the graph s set up Does the scale set look the same Yeah The x axis is identical and the y axis is identical So let s talk about the graph for a second Look at the graph Adam can you look at that graph and tell me which thing which one of these two graphs do you think is top of the line The one on the right The one on the right Can you tell me why because top of the line keep in mind the initial charge was zero and the cost per shirt was eight dollars per shirt How did you pick this one to be top of the line Because it started at zero Okay so one of the things that s important was that you realized it started at zero So he looked at this and recognized that my he said starts at zero Okay That s important How else could we figure out that that was how else could we figure that out Allegra I said that since it was five times eight well that s the first coordinate it would be Oh okay so the first coordinate was five 40 so you said five times eight is 40 40 okay what about this one That is 80 10 times eight is 80 Okay is that an interesting way of thinking about it Yes And does that also work Does that make sense with this problem Starts at zero and every shirt costs eight dollars so she said five times eight 10 times eight and that pattern would work all the way up Is there other ways that I could identify that this is top of the line Amanda I went down there on the table that the rate of the pulse goes up faster Uh Huh so like when you said how Did you guys here the word she used to describe that She said she recognized that this rate is going up faster than this rate Do you guys agree with that The line s more steep Yeah the line has greater steepness is the word you used steep right Yeah so this one not only does it start at zero so we can recognize it that way but we also recognize that it s going up more quickly This one s going up eight dollars each shirt and this one s only going up six dollars each shirt because let s look at the rate of change for this one If we went from zero to five that went over five right And then from 50 up to 80 is what 30 That s from 50 to 80 is 30 30 and so 30 over five gives me how much Six Six per shirt okay Nahla you had your hand up Yeah Go ahead I was gonna say that I understand that it started at 50 So that would be T Shirts R Us So if that was T Shirts R Us then the other one had to be top of the line Guys did you hear what Nahla said Nahla said she looked at this graph and noticed that this one started at 50 so because that one started at 50 it had to be what T Shirts R Us T Shirts R Us okay So so what re we talking about We re talking about looking at a graph and finding two things What are the two things that we need to be able to find from our graph Greg tell me one Slope We need to do our final slope Emanuel tell me the other one The Y We need to be able to find the slope and the y intercept okay Emanuel can you summarize for me how to find the y intercept How do you look at a graph and find the y intercept Where the line crosses the y axis Where the line crosses the y axis So Sierra told us when we re on our table we re looking for where the x is zero The x is zero but on the graph that means that it crosses the y axis Okay nice Can somebody tell me from a graph how to find slope Stella I haven t heard from you for a minute How do we find slope from a graph You use the slope triangle You use the slope triangle Uh huh Then it leads your eyes for example can we talk about this one It doesn t matter you pick whichever one you d like So it will be the rise and speed it s going up Yeah so this is our rise okay And the run is how far it s going out And the run is how far it s going out It s rise over run And then you write it as a ratio rise to run okay Excellent Guys I have one final question on the graph So we picked these we did our slope triangles from those blue ones that are drawn right And for this one we got 30 over five and figured out that that was six right Would it matter if I did went too far I think Would it matter if I did that No I heard no Can someone raise your hand and explain to me why that s no So why does it not matter Sydney Because it s the same shape it s just larger It s a similar figure So I guess if you were finding rise over run and once you simplify it it would be the same Did you guys hear what Sydney said Sydney used the word similar or used the phrase similar figures What do similar figures mean What does that mean Greg Like two figures that have the like they re they don t exactly have to be the same size It s like basically a dilation of the other It s essentially a dilation Okay so the first one we did went up 30 over five Right Well what about the red one The red one went from five to 20 How much did it go over if it went from five to 20 Cameron 15 It went over 15 So if this one goes over 15 you sort of used that word dilation right What s the scale factor from five to 15 Positive 3 That s times by positive 3 right So likewise what should this be If my run was 15 what should my rise be Raise your hand if you know Jaylynn 90 It should be 90 Okay so let s check and see if it is So we went from five so that went 15 and then we went from 80 up to 170 Now what s the difference from 80 to 170 80 to what 80 to 170 I don t know That s okay What s the difference Who can tell me the difference from 80 to 170 Sierra 90 The difference is 90 So if I looked at those two ratios so if I looked at those two ratios one would give me 90 over 15 and the other one would give me 30 over five Are those equal Yep Yes that is let s check it Are each of those giving you six dollars per shirt Yes Yeah so how do we find slope from a graph Taylor said we make the slope triangle and does it matter which triangle you pick Nope No because they should be proportional They should be dilations of one another Okay it be a good reference to something that we learned Can you show us how to start out like the first one Or the first few pages So the question was do you have to start out at the first one No Sydney why no Because if the pretense is that the initial charge is 50 dollars then you don t have to Unlike the other one it started at zero Mm hm Are you talking about the final slope Nahla Yes Okay Nahla you can start at the first point but you don t have to because if it s linear should the pattern ever change No So if the pattern never changes does it matter which two points you pick No Any two exact points you pick should still give you the same rate of change That was a great question Okay all right So now this is a different one So on the last one I gave you the verbal Right I did I said T Shirts R Us and gave you the verbal expression This time I m not giving you that This time we ve got a third t shirt company The third t shirt company Tee Time they explain to us this is their function cost Cost is equal to 4 50x plus 25 My question is what does that mean Who can tell me what it means to do 4 5x plus 25 Samantha start me We would charge and 4 50 per each t shirt Okay so what do we have to pay no matter what Patrick what is the one thing we have to pay If we ordered a shirt what s the one thing they re going to charge us For the design They re going to charge us that 25 dollars for the design right But then Each time Huh Each time Well that s a great question Do they charge us 25 dollars every time That s a great great great great great question No why not What s the 25 dollars for It s for the design on every shirt It s for the design and that is the design that we re going to use for all of our shirts So that s an important question Does the y intercept explain anything about change Will the y intercept change Will it move up or down No the initial cost is whatever the initial cost is okay That was a great question Who can tell me a little bit about what this graph would look like What would the graph look like It looks like a zero but I think it d start at 25 here It would start at 25 So it s go to start somewhere right in here okay And I m not sure why those numbers are on the table but they shouldn t be there Okay but that s okay We can move forward from it We can do this What should the cost be initially 25 The cost should initially be 25 dollars okay Then if we buy five shirts how can we figure that out Who can tell me how to figure that out Ah You can plug in the value of five in the equation thing You can plug into the equation Ooh I know what we can use Oh we can use I heard somebody say this earlier We can use a calculator right Where would I put this information in the calculator Y equals I d go to y equals excellent Okay and I put it in there my function Right so I ve got 4 50x plus 25 And then you press second Yeah what am I trying to look at I m trying to look at my table Let s go back for just a second Look at the table that s already given to us What do they do in their table It increases by five They increase their x values by five So do I want to set mine up to go by fives Yes Yeah so how do didn t I how do I set up a table Where do I do that It s a second and it s on top of a window Yeah it s second and it s on top of a window we ve got a table set up Where do we want to start our table What s the first number we need Five Okay because we already know zero right And then how much do we want to increase each time Five We want to increase each time by fives okay Are we okay with that Now where do I go to actually have the calculator give me the information Sydney where do I go You press second and then you press the graph button Second graph which will give me the table So I will give you a minute to make sure that your table is still being corrected because I m going to need you to help me with mine I don t know why I put the wrong table up there Okay we good All right so we used the calculator to help us get our table What was it in fives Who can help me with this Help me with this Cameron real quick 47 5 That s 47 5 or 47 50 right What about tens 70 
 confusing for people to understand but we re looking at density today We re looking at how much stuff is packed in a certain area So if you flip over to the back of your paper you ve got that little box at the top And it tells you one of the reasons some of the objects float while the other objects sank is because of their density If you could write down the definition of density in your box I would appreciate that The amount of matter when I say stuff like when we were learning about solids liquids and gases at the beginning of the year stuff is matter So the amount of matter that s in a certain area is an object s density It s not its mass it s its density So the marble is more dense than the Styrofoam ball Okay So now that we know the word density we re going to start using the word density for the next part The amount of stuff packed in a certain area or the amount of matter The marble had more matter in that small area than the Styrofoam ball The Styrofoam ball is spread out and have all those air holes making that matter more spread out less dense Krayla Yes right now Okay All right So that was simple I want you to go ahead and put a C over your 10 at the top of this if you haven t And I want you to take a look at the part one on your paper Yesterday we looked at how pressure could effect the mantle but now we need to look at something different I want you to answer number one and two first and then we ll talk about it This is just what you know before you come in my room to get you into the lesson So number one wants to know list a few things that you have seen float before Number two wants to know what do you think might cause these things to float So first just make a little list of two three things that you ve seen floating before and then tell me on number two if it s a hypothesis you may not know for sure that s fine but what do you think causes them to float Nathan Are we allowed to write both Yeah Yeah so right now you re just going to make a little list on number one and then number two you re going to tell me what do you think actually causes these things that you wrote down to be able to float We re going to start with that first This is just to get us thinking about what we re doing today One and two please What do you think causes them to float You might not be sure of the answer to number two but I still want you to make a hypothesis You don t have to write I think because but you can tell me what you think causes that Number two s going to be harder than number one Yeah Let s take four things tell me four things that you ve seen float before We ll take four because we can probably sit here and name like 100 Cole give me one Ice cubes Ice cubes Sadie Boat A boat Alex Shoes Shoes And Emily Dog toy Dog toys okay Now we know things can float and that s great But what do you think causes these things to float Why do you think dog toys and a boat and ice cubes and things like that why are they are going to be able to float Ebony what do you think The air in them The amount of air that s in them Anybody else Dylan They are less dense Okay Sean Surface tension Surface tension Little air pockets that are in them Okay air pockets I was thinking like the less density inside of it Okay alright we re going to take a look at that today So you ve got a kind of idea we re going to look at what causes something to sink and what effects if something floats Alright we have two parts that we are going to be going to our last stations for So let s take a look at part two last station observation You have two setups at your lab station You have a black tray that has three objects in it You ve got a bouncy ball a marble and a styrofoam ball alright You also have a setup at your lab station that has liquids in cups This is for part three Alright I don t want you touching this stuff yet We re going to come back later and you re going to look at that stuff I don t want any of the cups knocked over I don t want any of the objects put into the cups okay These two things are separate your black tray and the piece of paper with the cups are separate What you re going to do first is use the black tray and the objects in it You re going to tell me with the marble the bouncy ball and the styrofoam ball if we were to put these in water which we are going to test them but if we were to put these in water do you think these objects would sink or float So you just go through and if you want you can just write an F or an S You re going to say what you think and I want you to wait until you get to your lab stations so you can pick them up feel them to see that might make a difference in your guess Then I also want you to tell me why While you are at your lab station float or sink in water and why You re not going to do the did it actually float because we re going to look at that when we come back These are our results So you re going to do the first two columns float or sink why float or sink why float or sink why Then we are going to come to that And we are going to come back and we re going to do an observation together So these two columns have got to be filled out before you get back to your seats Got it Let s go Marble sink Rubber float Rubber float Styrofoam float The marble will probably sink it s heavy It has no air in it Bouncy ball The bouncy ball probably can float Yeah I mean it s not light It s gonna float Bouncy ball same thing Bouncy ball heavy Marble heavy with no air pockets No This one will definitely float because it s lightweight and it has these little pores This bounces a lot his bounces a little bit and this bounces not at all Yeah but this one but this one If this one can float then why not think that one could float Okay If you don t go with your group that s okay but you still need to a connection If you are finished before the timer goes off you need to come back to your seat This will float This will fall Fail If you finish you need to come back to your seats You guys all finished I want to go ahead and take a look before we see the results Before we look at the results and test this I want to see what we think So first off let s start with the marble since it s at the top Raise your hand if you think the marble will float Okay so we re all together on this one it s not going to float Who can tell me why they re thinking it s not going to float We ll take like three guesses three explanations JC It s heavy with no air pockets Heavy with no air pockets good Frayla It can t capture air it can t float Can t capture air can t float Alright and Emma Heavy and solid Heavy and solid Alright now what about the bouncy ball Raise your hand if you think this is going to float Alright there s a mix What that s heavier than the marble Well let s hear Somebody give me an explanation for why it would float If you guessed float tell me why you thought that Sean Because there s air inside Okay there s air inside Alex I dropped it in the pond and it still floated Bouncy ball floated in the pond when you did it before Ali I ve seen it happen Okay you ve seen it happen Now some of us said it would sink Why did you say it would sink Matt Weaver Because it s heavy It s heavy Frayla Okay Jared Okay so prior experience Now last one is our styrofoam ball Float raise your hand Alright somebody give me a reason why it s going to float We re all together on this one too We all agree the marble is going to sink we all agree the styrofoam ball is going to float Matt Cook It s light and has air pockets It s light and has air pockets Alex You re talking alot of things the pond was last time okay Frayla It s very lightweight Okay alright let s test it out We re just going to test it out upfront here so I m just going to use this big beaker What do we want to see first Marble Bouncy ball Alright record sink for your actual I guess we ll do bouncy ball we ll just go in order Alright bouncy ball ready The moment of truth And styrofoam ball Yeah A different bouncy ball didn t float But you saw the bouncy ball I was using right Yeah So it was fair right Yeah Very simple but let s take a look at what s going on For number four I d like you to tell me I want you to answer first and then we ll discuss What I d like you to tell me why do you think some of these objects were able to float while others were able to sink And I want you to be specific At the beginning I asked you the same question on number two in prior knowledge Why do you think some of these things float I want you to revisit that question again So why do you think the marble and the bouncy ball sank and the styrofoam ball was floating I want you to be specific on number four I want you to answer first on your paper and then we re going to share okay What kinds of things did we say for number four Now that we ve looked at this in a different way Before I just asked you to think of things in your past that you ve seen float Now we ve looked at our marble our bouncy ball and our styrofoam ball What did you say Nick Bouncy ball didn t have enough air to keep it up and it was too heavy Okay anybody else say anything Nick said bouncy ball didn t have enough air to keep it up so it sank Anybody say something different Ebony Density and buoyancy All right what do you mean density and buoyancy Okay Frayla I said that some objects had air holes and some were just solid Okay Now let s think of this in a different way We ve got this really small marble and we ve got a much larger styrofoam ball So normally if something s smaller you think it s going to be lighter it should float Something heavier this is much larger but it didn t sink If I have one book if I m carrying one book versus carrying five books that s different because five books are bigger than one book So what is going on with the amount of stuff in the marble and the amount of stuff in the styrofoam ball Is it the same amount of stuff in the same amount of space Does the marble have the same amount of stuff in the same amount of space that the styrofoam ball does Which one has more stuff more matter in a smaller space I want you to talk with the person sitting next to you for one minute Okay so we ve done this before Okay so marble s number one styrofoam ball two Which object has more stuff more matter packed in a smaller space On the count of three right here marble one styrofoam ball two One two three Marble Good marble So let s write that down This is pretty much what number five is asking you So when comparing the marble to the styrofoam ball which one has more mass more matter more stuff in a smaller amount of space which we call volume That would be the marble alright People today if you flip over to the next part I ve heard the word density a couple times and density is kind of 
 Dan do you have any background knowledge about density Like if someone says It s dense out Yeah Then it would be kinda wet So if something s really like if there was a dense fog yeah it d be So if there was a dense fog what does that mean to you That there s a lot There s a lot of it okay So you re in San Francisco and they re like Hey there s a really dense fog You might expect that there s a lot of fog Alright what would be the opposite of a dense fog A not dense fog No fog or like a really thin fog Okay Jackson do you have any background information Well I thought that isn t it like how close the molecules are together How close the what The molecules are together How closely they are okay Yeah Like say you re trying to go through a screen door And like they aren t really very close together because they res holes Okay And say you re trying to go through a brick wall Okay And they re really close together so it will be harder to go through Would you say then which one would be densest the brick wall or the screen door The brick wall The brick wall and you would say that because Because the molecules are closer together The molecules are closer together Okay anybody else have any ideas about density Yes ma am Isn t it like how compact something is Okay so give me an example Like um don t know how to say this kinda going back to the container thing If we could have luggage and you fill it up so much the luggage case is like so filled up it s so dense Okay so let me take that to the next level So let s pretend we re going on vacation Okay we re going on vacation Raise your hand if you have a place you want to go Or maybe you re going there next week I d be so jealous if you said Hawaii Oh yeah I could be Reese where are you going Or where would you want to go Uuh Mexico You re going to Mexico Well not this break in the in the summer In the summer Alright so let s build this scenario He s got one of those big huge rolling bags that you re gonna put all of your swimsuits in To go to Mexico because you don t need other clothes Flip flops swimsuits and a t shirt and that s it Okay so you got your huge luggage we re gonna pile all this stuff in there I m gonna zip it up What does that have to do with density If it s absolutely packed full what does that mean for the luggage Yeah That the particles are so close together that it s leaving them in Is the volume of the luggage changing if it keeps its shape Or is the mass of the luggage changing because you re adding more stuff to it The mass So you change the mass because the luggage is staying the same Okay your mom says You can only bring one swimsuit one flip flop a pair of flip flops and one t shirt So I take everything out now did I change the volume by it or did I change the mass of the luggage The mass I just changed the amount of matter right So then the luggage with tons of stuff in it we said was what dense or not dense Dense And dense and so the luggage with a little bit of stuff in it was Less dense What changed the density of the luggage What are the other conclusions to what changed the density of the luggage Peter what changed the density of the luggage Less amount Less amount and in science which word do we use Umm Volume or mass on that one Umm mass Less mass less stuff less matter in the luggage Awesome we re gonna do this little scenario with a demonstration so you guys need your clickers it s gonna be an A or a B type answer on this one So get your clicker ready and I m gonna show you a couple of clips Cheese Ooooh Cheese Can we eat it when some people in here don t like it I know well more for me right What What Alright so this is cheese This morning I went to Safeway and I purchased this cheese that is extremely difficult to open And I bought certain kinds of cheese Can I have some Alright So Do we get to eat the cheese You do not Aww dang it Sorry Why can t we eat it So here s your question This is cheese A okay Anybody know what kind of cheese that it is Grayson what s cheese A Umm Swiss Swiss what s your observation that led you to the inference that this is Swiss cheese That is has the little holes in it The little holes in it Okay this is regular old Cheddar Raise your hand Yeah Dan know what it is Cheddar or This is a Cheddar cheese Okay So this is cheese A and this is cheese B I want to know which cheese is denser Okay so with your clicker I m gonna put this up on the screen I want to know cheese A the Swiss cheese or cheese B Are they supposed to be numbers Well it s gonna be an A or a B Right so cheese A or cheese B Alright and if you need to see the cheese again walk around In the meantime I ll put this question up I want to know is cheese A the densest Or is cheese B the densest Okay so this is multiple choice A or B There we go go ahead and click it And let s see what you guys think about which cheese is the densest So the Cheddar is B So A is the Swiss B is the Cheddar That doesn t make a lot of sense A is the Swiss Are we each going to be able to get a piece Please don t talk while we re doing this My clicker isn t working It s not working Which number are you 83 Is it on Yeah Are you pressing the right button Send Oh there it goes Okay good It probably didn t power Alright make sure you clicked in please And then let s look at what we think Okay 92 of you said that the cheddar was the densest So we had another 8 so two people said that this was the densest So here s what I want you to do I want you to pull a partner who s just the person next to you So you guys are gonna be partners you guys are partners you guys are partners and you re gonna be a group of three Partner partner partner Mattie and Grayson and you guys will partner Sydney and Jackson and it s kinda gonna go crossways here So you guys will be a partner You guys are a partner and you guys are a partner Right you re going to turn to your partner tell your partner which cheese you thought was the densest and then I want you to come up with a conclusion that you could say Cheese A was the densest because or Cheese B was the densest because So take 30 seconds to talk Less mass Cheddar So what is the definition of density from here to the cheese Which one is denser the one with more stuff or less stuff More So which of these has more stuff Ooh Nice of you guys and you re not very nice Okay that was 30 seconds Okay choose which person in your group is gonna be Swiss cheese and which person gonna be Cheddar Swiss Cheddar Swiss Cheeses raise your hand please Woo Swiss cheese And I need a conclusion from you so make a statement for me We thought cheese A was the densest because so Erica We thought cheese B was the densest because it didn t have any holes Because it didn t have any holes okay Does anybody have a different explanation why they thought cheese B was the densest Matt Well because cheese A had holes the holes don t take in the part of the technical isn t part of the cheese Okay So So the inside of the holes what are the holes actually made up of Air So there s air in there but it s not part of the cheese So then what s true about the Swiss cheese then Reily It has the less cheese Less cheese compared to its what Compared to has all of it So it s all cheese and this is part cheese What can we say now about their volumes Umm they re pretty much the same Okay so the volume is the same Jackson what can we say about the mass of the Swiss compared to the mass of this guy The Swiss has less mass than the Cheddar cheese So the Swiss has less mass then the Cheddar But they have the same volume can we figure out then which one s the densest Which one s the densest What s both alright You had a chance to talk about it let s vote again Do you think cheese A is the densest or cheese B is the densest After our little discussion Cheese A or cheese B A is the Swiss B is the Cheddar So we want to know who s more dense More dense yep Which one is more dense More dense Is A more dense or is B more dense Let s see if we get an agreement on our inference here about which one s denser Look at that we were able to change two people s minds just through discussion That s pretty awesome I thought it would be eight people Well we went all the way to 100 here So that s good That means that everybody agreed at least in terms of the cheese So as a demonstration What Well I need a snack this is really hard work being a teacher It s hard to be a student That s true Okay ready for demo number two Yeah So cheese number one number two first we need to talk about what sinking floating and suspending means I know it So in order to talk about this I have these fun objects I don t know has anybody stayed up late enough to see David Letterman Yes Oh gosh I lost an animal has anybody on David Letterman ever seen the game show he plays called Will it float Yeah I ve seen it happen Have you Wyatt What does he do Do you know what he does Well I saw it a while ago so I don t relaly remember So you re not really sure Anybody wanna guess what he does on the show He throws stuff in water He takes some stuff then he puts it in water to sees if it floats or not That s pretty much the gist of the game show So I have for your viewing pleasure recreated a game show So I have objects we re gonna play a game called Will it float And the first object you re going to predict this through the clicker Is I wanna know if our little dolphin friend is it going to float okay sink or the third option which is tricky you might not know this word suspend And suspends means hang out kinda in the middle of the water So you have three options alright We re gonna vote on this with the clickers Do you have a question before we do that When you put it to the test can I move forward Absolutely so if you can t see you can either stand up or you can squeeze up into an aisle yeah absolutely Yes sir Which one is it A B or C Oh I m gonna tell you right now okay So we re gonna see if the dolphin floats sinks or suspends And if you can t see when I do it we ll count and you can stand up and watch So A is gonna be sink so do you think it s gonna sink B answer B will be float C will be suspend Okay so sink float suspend which means hang out in the middle of the water Okay so this is an A through C option Okay A sink B float or C suspend Well that was fast Yeah that was really fast So let s see everyone oooo object is going to sink If it sinks what will you observe If it sinks what will you observe How fast It falling into the water Well he s going to fall into the water one way or another but where will he end up On the bottom At the bottom of that okay Some of you one person said that it s gonna float Okay so raise your hand if you re the person who thinks it s gonna float Okay thank you for taking a risk that s okay You don t know yet right it s for fun So if its floating what will that mean what will you observe That s she right When I put this in the water what will it look like when it s floating Like I don t know Will it will be sitting on the bottom No Where will it be located Floating on the Floating right on the top okay And then we had oooooh three whole people said it would suspend right in the middle Raise your hand if you think it s gonna suspend Oh yeah Okay Leia why do you think it s gonna go right in the middle I think it s too light for it to totally sink and I think it s took heavy for it to float so thought it would be right in the middle Okay so you re making the hypothesis it has something to do with its weight Okay alright so that s one idea Too light to stay at the top But too heavy would go to the bottom Is that what you said Okay yes So does suspend mean it stays in the middle Yeah suspend means it literally hangs out right here Yeah Okay that s not true Okay are you guys ready Yes So stand up if you need to be able to see Here s the game show there s a little song that goes with it like Will it float will it float Okay there s my game show you ready Alright it s very suspenseful Can you see Okay here it goes Yes Aww yeah So it sank So go back and have a seat please Now raise your hand if you have any explanation for me why that sank It did sink oh no We ve all been down to the bottom of the pool Why do you think it sank I thought it wasn t flat enough or didn t have enough space enough to float up So now we ve got two different ideas about sinking and foating So Leia brought up the idea of heaviness you brought up the idea of surface area See if I were to put something that has a bigger surface area is it gonna float No Yes Maybe did you tell me that if it had bigger surface on top of the water Okay should we try this Yeah It s gonna sink Oooh Okay so maybe Aaaaw It got swamped Now it floated for a little while right So maybe the shape does have something to do with it and maybe weight has something to do with it Or what it s made out of might have something to do with it So we have all kinds of ideas now about sinking and floating Yes sir Is it because it s denser than water So here s another idea it has something to do with the density of the object It s denser than water So here s a tough question so think about this one What is the difference between how dense something is and how heavy something is If Leia talked about heaviness now we ve got density and now we ve got shape and what it s made of and all these different things so I just want to know this one thing What s the difference between the weight of an object and the density of an object This is a really hard question take a second I want you to rotate back to your partner talk to them about what you think the difference between density and weight is Okay when we talked about number of particles it s later than mass Mass Mass so the relationship between mass compared to the object Okay Okay who spoke last time cause I need a cheddar Oh yeah A cheddar who s willing to talk Emily what did you guys come up with So density is like how much mass or how many particles are in the object And weight is how much gravity is pulling down Okay So would that mean that something That s heavier automatically sink Hang on one sec And then we ll try to work through this one If something is heavier than something else will it automatically sink Are ships heavy Do ships sink Occasionally right Especially if you re on that cruise ship like last week did you hear about that It depends on the Okay now we re talking about depends what it s in So now we ve got all these different ideas working Holy cow Yes ma am anything else to add I was gonna say I don t know why I m just gonna hook on this whole list of things but like a tin can will float if it s empty because of the air that s stuck inside of it holds the object up So if that was hollow I m guessing that it would most likely float So the ships are hollow in the bottom the air that keeps it up but the bottom how part of the ship goes in water is because part of it isn t hollow That part sinks but the air in the boat will keep it up and that s how things float 
 First are your group activity your group creations Now you all created in your group Sorry You created in your groups eight counts of dance that incorporated in some form or fashion the time step I don t want don t grade right now just look just watch the first one What are you noticing Good right So I was telling you that these are the piece of bread and these were a piece of bread and I could have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on white bread or I can have a peanut butter and jelly on wheat bread We re going to keep the white bread for right now Pop push Then this made me laugh Think about this as the heel of the bread I don t get it I m glad to know that you re like I don t get it There s a piece of bread and there s a heel of the bread Oh The butt of the bread Yeah Oh that s why Because you call it the butt of the bread Oh But it s the heel of the bread Ok so not so funny So we have pop push step as our ingredient and then as our butt of the bread good flap step dig right So today we re going to do pop push step good flap step dig as a review on the right and on the left And then we re going to do pop push flap we re going to add another ingredient flap step dig Okay Flap step dig Now remember this is important why It s the ingredient barely comes up think about it Good flap because when you step flap means that it s two sounds to Boo ya Remember it s two sounds and that s why you say Good flap and to get it up she said real high Alright everybody up spread out Pop push Pop push again is spank kick It s exactly what we did as warm up the one across the board Put your right heel out I need a good pop push Ready and I need a good step As we step what do we do What happens to the body We swing right We sure did pick up that foot Good flap step dig Alright do it one more time Let s do an echo Let me do it I ll do pop push step you do Pop push step I do good flap step dig You do Good flap step dig Right right And I go Okay I go Better Ok by now our muscle memory is either going I got it I ve worked it out or I don t got it and we need to correct it before it becomes muscle memory So here s what I want you to do Say Pop push step Pop push step Good flap step dig Good flap step dig Pop push step Pop push step Good flap step dig Good flap step dig Pop push step Pop push step Good flap step dig Good flap step dig Right foot out Six here you go You take Pop push step Good flap step dig Pop push step Good flap step dig You can do a shuffle Pop push step Good flap step dig You want to Okay Not too bad Look at y all keep on going just like wonderful kids Now let me take a dip What I need you to do real quick bunch up right here Bunch up Do me a favor and bunch up right there Do you body roll Not really Yeah you do No Sure you do Ok well I got it wrong You don t body roll but you will You rock you rock knee right No Come on right hand Flap step dig See you re doing this really well Alright point your leg listen We re going flap step dig Flap step dig Ready And right foot step flap step dig Yes How is this group doing Okay everybody look everybody look Here we go Five six oh you precious thing Are you ready Deep breaths You need your right foot out Six ready and pop push step Good flap step dig Almost left foot Pop push step Left foot good flap step dig Okay let me tell you why You re doing a shuffle We do pop push step lift your foot up good flap step dig on left foot Pop push step Good flap step dig These were all two things Okay body roll Do a body roll Now you can t do a body roll back here Hold my hand Here we go Pop push Step Shift it over Good flap step dig right here Good flap step dig Did you get all this Again the right foot Flex your toes Good flap step dig Good flap step dig bring it in Oh no you gotta body roll Bring it in Good flap step dig That s better And since the problem is your weight distribution it s back here and it s hard to do it like this So you gotta do like this Yeah Okay Alright let me see the middle group Middle group Right foot out Ready oh sorry I got all excited You were ready Six ready and pop push step Yes okay Let s go pop push step hold for a second good flap step dig Ready Right foot And pop push step hold for a second good flap step dig Yes Left foot left foot left foot Six ready and pop push step good flap step dig Almost almost I saw it on the right do it on the left real quick Left foot and pop push push your heel down Base Let me hear some base do it again Pop push step pick up that foot good flap step dig Good flap step dig Left foot good flap come on baby With the lift With the lift Oh sorry my bad my bad to the right Good flap step dig That s it Show some love very nice Alright this group come on Right foot out Six ready and pop push step Oh I got overachievers I love it This time with the hold punched in it Now let me see the hold Six ready and pop push step hold for a second good flag step dig Left foot Pop push step hold for a sec good flap

you find okay I do mines in the kitchen You do yours in the kitchen Does your mom yell at you No Be careful Like when you sit down on the desk in class and you just sit there all year Okay so Jasline do your teachers get on to you when you practice in class No cause I m quiet Because you re quiet Well number one I m super proud of you for practicing everywhere And do you find that you do it all the time In the store in the school So it s not just something that you re going to do in class You see this And what you re going to find is odd a lot of former students come back and they go Oh well I continue to do this and I m not even taking tapping I wish I could go find and tap more Okay when that s gonna happen because it is going to happen to you it s like a bug it s like a virus you just get all excited and all that Go to Youtube for me and on Youtube there are lots of how to videos Do you know you could look up how to do this time step on the Youtube video Now is it going to be your standard buck and wing arc buck times step No No it may not be because remember the sandwiches it may be a different kind of sandwich a different kind of time step So if you re ever curious and you want to continue this through like because you re gonna Do you have to have tap shoes by the way No No What do you have to have Hard floor Tammy sit up for me You what A shoe with a hard bottom Yeah Look I m in heels right That s all you have to do Now one of the things that I wanted to point out to you as we re about to evaluate yourselves and evaluate your peers I want you to look at weight distribution Say weight distribution Weight distribution What is weight distribution Can I use an example Yes Like when we re doing the good flap ball change you have to move your body up for the good flap and you move it back down for the step beat Okay so great Jasline said that you have to move your body forward on the good flap and then back and sit it back down for the step dig Anybody had something to add Shift your weight Yes you re right you shift your weight which way Opposite of which way you switch your knee Oh opposite of which way of whatever foot I m using because if I have this foot up I ve got right Does my body have to turn No No but it kind of does don t it Got some hip action going on right here Alright anybody else see any weight distribution We can do the sink you re kind of down a little bit Okay I was going to say I was trying to get to you The weight distribution doesn t necessarily have to go right to left right Or front to back It can go up and down What is the reason we want out weight distribution kind of lowered So we can move Move To have to have a better base for what Okay so we can keep the rhythm Because if the rate of speed speeds up then our rhythm has to stay with it right Tell me how different how important is weight distribution as opposed to females and males Anybody know the difference We covered this one Where s the woman s center of gravity In her glut You are absolutely correct In her glut right through here and that s where women tend to put on weight right gravity centers her center of gravity around her belly the baby belly and around Idk Oh Idk alright you don t know So where is the men s center of gravity Where do they tend to Torso Torso Right their diaphragm and that s where we get that spare tire from A man s center of gravity and this is what it means are we here There we are Here s what it means As the woman s center of gravity if your body can be forward and your bottom is still back and you re fine and dandy A man if this is him he s going forward He s going to fall He s not going to be able to keep his weight So it makes a difference in your body posture and your weight distribution Yes Let s look really quickly Oh how many of you have taught your significant adult You taught a significant adult and you taught the time step What did you see anybody Sometimes your parents got the rhythm has lost If your parents are a little older than most average parents let s say like 40s to 50s Good good Their rhythm has kind lost it It takes a longer time to teach them They have to be concentrated because they re like Uh uh do that again do that again Okay Jasline that is awesome I m going to put you on hold for a minute because I have heard from you several times Let me hear from somebody new Come on Audrey I found that I really got my skills from my mom My fast learning skills You got your fast learning skills from your mom awesome She learned real fast She picked it up good Alright who else Instead of teaching a significant adult I taught my whole family to tap You taught your whole family Rock on I found out that my youngest brother learned faster than even my mother So why do you think your youngest brother learned faster than your mom I think she slowed down over the years Over the years okay Okay let me hear from somebody up here because I haven t heard anything from up here While I was teaching my mama my daddy got excited and he wanted to so I taught both of them and they decided upon themselves who was going to learn it the quickest and Right competition And my mama she actually learned it faster but although it took my daddy more time once he got it he could do it over and over again He actually got pretty good like speed wise See Tap is for all ages guys It ll keep you in good health it s something fun it ll keep you active You don t have to learn a certain you know we learned a step and I hate to teach a step but that s the beautiful thing about tapping it s you can come up with all kinds of stuff And you know Hey look here I want you to hear How many of you like step step dancing Oh all around the room Oh we love the step dancing right Step and tap are similar do you see the correlations You re making rhythms there are prescribed movements So we need to really think about the ways that they intersect and it may become the next big thing You just never know You might have tap groups all around Let s go ahead and do some peer evaluation real quick I want you to watch the screen Now what I want you to watch 
 Like the chocolate one with the strawberries that we looked at that is going to serve approximately 24 people So if you multiple that by two that s approximately 48 that you should charge if you re going to charge for your cakes Now it s going to depend on did you really put that much time energy and effort into it and do you feel like you really need to charge that That s going to have a little bit of basis to how much you are going to charge but that will kind of give you an idea what to charge for your cakes Think about it too serving sizes for cakes are typically two inches square They re small so when you are thinking But that s a little cake well serving size is tiny It s not that you are going to serve them a whole meal out of cake It s just for them to get a taste Sculpted cakes like the catfish cake that we looked at 100 plus When I looked these up specifically for something as big as that catfish cake because it was a pretty good size catfish cake We tried to make it as realistic as possible and it was about this tall So probably somewhere at 150 200 level had we bought that at a bakery The wedding cake like Jessie s wedding cake that we ve seen somewhere in the neighborhood of 600 because it was a seven tiered masterpiece as well Who has a question Come on somebody has got a question I wanna make a 3D cake Okay when do you wanna make one I don t know They re fun So if you were going to make a 3D cake what would you make Catfish Okay Britney s making a catfish Okay Erica s making a dinosaur Oh my favorite Piggies butterflies what else What would you like to try Penguin duck basketball panda bear would be cute A tire Brandi I wanna see your tire cake when you get that done A monkey would be fun That would be really cute So you guys are starting to think 3D We need to be thinking about your roses too Because we gotta work on those roses and get that technique down Let s go over to our table and I ll show you about making those roses Okay so when we get our snow day tomorrow I expect you to go home and practice practice practice practice practice If it s snow we probably will get out Watch Facebook Brandi Or listen to the news That s how we ll find out I always post it to my Facebook whenever they tell us You guys already know about fixing your pastry bags and this one is already fixed and it s all ready to go You know me I like wrapping it up One of my just little tricks I like to use for this if it starts getting sticky on the outside Which actually I know you have struggled with this these are not my friends These are my friends That s my first tip My second tip is if you re going to use a plastic bag take a paper towel and just turn it into your handle And the other thing is don t fill your bag so full It really only needs to be filled to about halfway maybe a little bit more than halfway okay Then what you ll do is you ll start rolling it down As you re rolling it down typically what I do first is I fold it in kind of at a triangle Then I start rolling it down The reason for that is so when I start putting pressure on it s got both those folds and then another fold to keep it from escaping Other people like to do the toothpaste thing and twist It s totally up to you how you want to do that Either one is totally acceptable Just feel what works best for you okay Then I make my little handle out of my paper towel Remember on the tips You will notice on the tips especially the Wilton tips has a number That number is representative of how big the hole is The larger the number the larger the hole That works on the writing tips Someone tell me what number is on that one Okay tell me what number is on that one Erica It s on the outside Okay yours is a number 12 Five You ve got a number five It says a 230 Okay a 230 One Okay and why A one what A one M that means one monster No I don t know what the M stands for What is the difference though between this tip and this tip They re pretty much the same thing What would you use this one for For big cakes Or for Wait don t I got this You ve got it okay come on Ashley What would you use it for Borders Borders Yes great answer Absolutely I m telling you by the time you have finished your masterpiece and you re ready to do the borders get the big ones cause you re ready to be done with it If you pick one of these little teeny tiny ones by that time you re sick of working with frosting and you re ready to do something else But this one s just a number 16 See how tiny that is Okay rose tips The bigger the number the bigger the holes Also on your rose tip make sure that the large opening end is going down If this is awkward for you all you have to do to adjust your tip loosen it and then twist it around and then tighten your tip You don t want to tighten it so much that it s gonna take a pair of pliers to get it loose okay Let s see if I can get this back in business Okay you ve got your rose nails You re just going to put a little squirt of frosting and it doesn t have to be very big and I m making a big mess now Hold it down Lay it straight down on your waxed paper and now you ve got your basis for your rose This is what we re gonna build the roses on We have to make a pyramid of frosting to start out with Remember that on the Power Point The first one I m gonna do is I m gonna rotate this counter clockwise and make my little pyramid See that little circle in the middle That s going to be the very inside of the rosebud Actually you could pull these off after you let them set up Stick them on a plate or on a cookie sheet stick them in the freezer and you could have lots of little rosebuds to set on your cake Just add your little leaves add your little vines and make you a really pretty little rosebush out of that If you want it a little bit bigger you just squeeze and rotate all at the same time It s about pressure and release So if you wanted a little rose you would pull it off right about now If you want a little bit bigger we re gonna build it up My frosting is getting warm but that s okay There s a little bit bigger one It s starting to flop over on me because it s getting really warm in here The more petals you add to the outside the bigger your rose is going to be Did you see that It just about flew onto the floor Could you tell me what this would be used for Yes That one is actually to decorate cupcakes So if we had a whole bunch of cupcakes this is so you can do some really delicate work inside the very delicate areas Like if you have them all lined up and you re trying to do them really fast you can just do that Usually what they will do that for is you know the little curly things that look like a little snake on the top Have you seen them They just go shhhhh That s what they use that for It kind of is fun One other way that you can do your frosting pyramid is just go straight down and squeeze and just bring it straight up So now we ve got our cute little middle of our cute little rose going Yeah it sticks straight up and we re just gonna wrap our little petals around it There we go See how cute that is It looks just like one that you just picked right off my little rosebush Some of my white roses at home look like that That one is cute that one s a good one Let s see if I can finish this off We ll do this one tiny The smaller you want to make them you just add a smidge of pressure instead of a lot of pressure If you add a lot of pressure you re gonna make a big rose It is it s getting really warm Who has a question about making these cute little roses Okay and I know you guys are masters at using your little star tips for shell borders All right so lets see what you can do I think you got your tables set Who would like to use this tip Simone Do you need a rose tip Okay I ll come around and check on you and see how you re doing I want to see your masterpieces I wanna see a couple of good roses from each of you Kimberly do you all need a rose tip over here Do you need that Okay Sorry let me get out of your way Do we just do one or two I want you to practice your borders and I want you to practice your rose tips So if you have a rose tip at your table you ll probably have to share I ll come around and check on you and see how it s going and if you have any problems or questions let me know I have a question That is a good question It should be but it s not Don t use this one This works best if you take your bag and just snip it and just drop it straight back in the bag Because this coupler is not designed to fit on this particular one I ll get you a different one you can try Brandi have you used the super star one that makes have you used the leaf tip yet No Let s try leaves The big giant one This will not fit on here with your coupler You ll have to use a different frosting bag Most everything else that s out you can use This one actually you might have fun with this one This one makes swirlies Cool it just makes lines you just zigzag it All the star tips are right here Err not the star but the rose No I think all of them are out You guys will have to wait and trade out with each other Yep they re all out I just suck at this No you don t Let me see Start with this Christina Hold your handle Handles are our friends Ooh it looks like a square rose It does look like a square rose that s cool Okay Britney make sure the big end goes to the bottom The small end goes to the top Remember your angles too 45 and these to Brandi and I ll be right back Brandi Here How do I make this one work Oh this one is kind of fun This one quite literally is something you d finish off like if you re making grass you just kind of swirl it around You can do it like this Yeah there are two lines Like if you wanted to do ziggy zags You can do circles You know like that It s all about your pressure Oh What happened What happened They re laughing at my rose What s wrong with it That s a good start Keep building on it Now remember Leticia this big part right here on this side that goes down There you go If it s not in the right location You may want to unscrew this and realign this Try that see if that works better for ya Then remember you re twisting all at the same time You re making like upside down U s remember Oh you did miss that part of the lesson too didn t you All right let me show you and then I ll let you do one okay What you re gonna do this big one always goes down You re making like an upside down U Just like that You re gonna U and turn it all at the same time so that it s a slow turn and this motion all at the same time okay Then when you re done you just set that aside and do another one Show me what you re doing There you go Hold it just like that That s good Hey you re getting there You re making a pyramid of frosting and you can do it one of two ways You can either do it this way or straight up and down Just make a big glob of frosting and turn this all at the same time There you go just like that Pull your frosting off there you go Okay now that s a good start and now you re gonna start making your upside down U s Usually you have three on your bottom layer There you go You re turning it all at the same time It s all about the hand motion there you go just like that Just make little tiny ones all around There ya go that looks good There ya go See you can do this Leticia There oh look how beautiful that is It is Oh my gosh That s a perfect rosebud Thank you That s it That s all you have to do The bigger you wanna make your rose the more levels you put around the outside edge okay If that s all you want then pull it off set it aside and do some more That s it All right you ve got the techniques and you know what to do I ll come back and check on you Yes Yes yes yes Oh come on show me Show me show me At least it s better than theirs Hey you re getting there I think you re doing the same thing that Leticia was doing See this big piece You ve got it back It needs to go down If this is awkward for you and you need to twist this part of it Just unscrew and re navigate Britney that looks good Wait it is on bottom now It is now because I just turned it When you were doing it it wasn t See how these are heavy on top That s the reason It ll be okay Do you need some more Is there anymore cut out things No but there s stuff to do it All right I ll come back and check on you Sierra I m gonna leave you in charge over here If they need some help let me know okay Okay Good job Where are you over here Yes Yes yes yes Star borders deluxe Okay so how are you doing You re doing really good on those leaf tips Have you tried any standing up So you know how to do that Literally you start here and you pull straight up on it at a 90 degree angle What Just like that Like that sometimes they roll over The stiffer your frosting is the stiffer they are See how you can get them to stand up Just like that or if you want them to lay on the side If you go slow they stay up faster Yeah and it has to do with the consistency of your frosting too Remember what you put in it to make it a little bit thicker Powdered sugar Or you can do what There you go Sarah Sarah I have never seen Don t look A big no no Oh man that s good frosting Okay all right yell at me I stuck my thumb in it I had to lick it off It s really good by the way It is Don t do as I do do as I say That s kind of like momma s say Ya know I m your school momma It s not monkey see monkey do It s monkey do what monkey say I m telling ya today it s Ms Morris is doing something silly All right so Sarah show me another one Show me some shell borders cause I know you ve practiced those She will she ll be I ll be back That s cute That s very stylish Now the tip that Ashley has the one that looks like the little grass that s got the two holes at the same time If you re gonna do something real fancy if you ll do this one white and then put a colored one in there and do it back and forth it will kinda look like this Holly try it again Try again Where s the leaf Leddy s got one of them Do you guys have one Okay show her what to do It s pressure and release Pressure and release That one actually turned out really good That one is a very good leaf When you re working on your leaves for your cake this is what you want it to look like If they start breaking off like this you ll probably want to scrape them off It s just a matter of the pressure and release thing But those are looking really really good I know I m gonna sneeze too Okay maybe I m not Bless you Hey Mariah Show me what you can do Oh come on Those are good ones Those are cute That s a cute border Samantha you re doing a really good job on that too Kailyn that is awesome So have you practiced at home yet No Why not I figured you would be I figured you would be practicing every chance you got No I don t have time What do you mean you don t have time Yeah Drew told me you re working on your scrapbook Good job Brandi All right show me something that you can do I wanna see somebody make a rose I showed you how now I wanna see them Yes I wanna see you make a rose Make another one Oh Let me You can use my frosting I ll bring you some Look you did it So what is the rule 
 Ah okay Okay Suri does this only happens in vinegar or can it happen in water Try it tomorrow We re going to experiment more with this okay This is can I have your attention up here again I m just trying to help you by sharing observations I hear when I go around the room Somebody had a question and I love questions They said does this happen when you put it in water the same way that it happens if you put it in vinegar because I have told you all it s vinegar If you have questions like that could you please write them on the side so that I know what investigations you d like to do in the future So we can because we re going to be continuing this Now once you ve made all of your observations you still have that column like we ve had from every little activity today that says what could be happening So let me be more specific I want you to tell me again the title of the lab is where s the matter I want you to tell me where that tablet went I want you to look at your observations I want you to be specific And I want you to tell me where s the matter What happened to the tablet Okay in that last column you should only have one box to fill in Please discuss it with your lab group and write down where it went What happened to it And then we ll all discuss it together It can do both can t it So you think it turned into a gas You think it dissolved and turned into a gas okay so you can absolutely write both Next thing we re going to talk about is how we prove that So if any of you guys have a really quick idea think about how you can do an experiment Okay so keep thinking along those lines because you re going to design your experiment for it okay I have balloons I see the word dissolves I saw the word fizzy and escape Okay Alright I m going to write down some of these words that I m seeing I saw dissolved I know I saw escaped Fizzy was in the same sentence as escaped but thank you for reminding me Did you have fizzy separately Yeah Oh okay On your observation sight or what could happen Yeah what could happen What could happen okay Blended okay I had gas You had chemical reaction Bubbles Did I pretty much get the kinds of things you think may have happened Any any totally different ideas that you think happened You think it was still It became carbon dioxide Okay alright Alright focus up here then Good I see the same mixture When I did the first demonstration first thing you said was magic Then someone said chemical reaction Dissolved disappeared changed neutralized I see the same combination of words Dissolved escaped fizzy blended vanished chemical reaction magic I just see a little different priority okay Now I m a scientist I can t really test magic Can t really test if something was magic What I can test are the science type words I can test chemical reaction I can test blended I can sort of test fizzy Escaped dissolved These I can test I can try to figure out a way to determine whether the tablet dissolved or escaped Or a combination of both I can figure out if it being fizzy had something to do with it I can figure out if it was blended in I can figure out if it was a chemical reaction or I can let you do this And that s what I m going to do On your other half sheet you should have another half sheet on your table First thing I need you to do is in your group I need you to come to a consensus That means you guys have got to agree The first question on there says okay where s the disappearing matter But I asked you to think about it in terms of everything you ve seen today I magically changed clear liquid into pink liquid and then pink liquid back into clear liquid again You saw a candle magically get shorter and the wick magically disappearing and some black stuff come out of nowhere and you saw an alka seltzer tablet vanish Okay So your group needs to agree on an overall theory Where s the disappearing matter I want you to discuss it and I want you all to write the exact same sentence for where s the disappearing matter at the top of your paper Okay so you have to agree There was a small piece that I put in right now and the alka seltzer went up So you know that it goes to the bottom not to the top Okay That s a great observation because its very specific I like it So you all need to talk about Okay so in every single experiment it turned into a gas So the pink liquid turned into a gas And the white liquid turned into a gas And when the clear liquid went pink liquid the wax turned into a gas I didn t even see it disappear Oh when you blew it out you saw smoke so when you blew it out the amount of smoke that went off do you think it was equal to the amount of candle that s missing Oh the liquid was a solid this is a gas so Tell me about the liquid again Because I only saw liquid so I keep If the pink was less dense than the white If the density explained it have you ever seen liquids that have different densities combined Have you ever seen oil in water Okay so what does it look like when you have two different density liquids Did you see layers with the Where d the pink stuff go Disappeared by itself Okay So these are the things you guys have to talk about You can t just take one person s you guys gotta make sure you all agree and it has to be an explanation that explains all three events that we saw today So when I say where s the disappearing matter you tell me it turned into a gas I m going to say okay then the pink liquid turned into a gas I didn t see bubbles Okay So it has to be a sentence that explains it all You guys aren t talking here Okay The disappearing matter is in the liquid So you still think the alka seltzer tablet is in there Okay so you think it s in there but it s now bubbles Okay It s in there but it s now bubbles so it changed in to bubbles and then what about the pink liquid and the clear liquid You think it s all still in there Okay but that time no bubbles but it s still in there Okay so candle Where did the rest of the wick go Is it still there Okay so you were good for two out of three but you can t say it s still in there for the candle so change your sentence Talk about it Change your sentence just a little bit I get that you re saying that Right But change your sentence a little bit so it applies to all three events Okay What s your sentence that everyone has agreed on That matter turns into So you had bubbles in your candle No Oh this is supposed to be to explain all three events we saw today Okay This is a good start but it has to be more general Where is the disappearing matter in general today Dissolved is good for this one Is this one dissolved Nope Okay so can you think of something dissolved and melted have in common so you can make it one sentence to explain everything Okay doesn t show up anymore does that mean it s gone Okay that s where you have to agree You have to agree whether it is gone or not Okay Okay stop for just one second I talked to a couple of really good groups but a couple of groups are very stuck because they disagree I told you you all had to agree and you had to explain all three things It s like the most difficult thing you can possibly do He won t listen to you I hear you Okay I m listening Here s the thing In the disagreements I ve seen the disagreement is is it gone or is it not gone Does that make sense Okay Did it go away Did it disappear or is it still in there That s the disagreement Now I have an idea What if we let s pick one experiment okay I think for this class the easiest experiment to deal with would be the tablet The alka seltzer and the vinegar okay Write that down on that half sheet as the experiment we chose The experiment we chose the alka seltzer We re going to choose that as a class What are the materials we put in The tablet and the vinegar Write those down on that left side It says materials we put in Do we put in anything else I didn t trick you I swear Okay so we had vinegar and we had a tablet What did you see come out Bubbles We ve got bubbles so write those on the right hand side We ve got bubbles Fizz He thinks he s saying he thinks the fizz is carbon dioxide That s fine We can call it whatever you want and what some kind of guess and what else Are you left with anything else You re still left with some liquid right Okay so write that down You re left with you ve got bubbles and you re left with bubbly liquid Here s what I think we need to prove We need to prove if what we put in is the same as what we got out How we can tell if something s there if we can t see it in science Okay you ve got bubbles What do you think Nick We weigh the vinegar and the alka seltzer tablet we add the numbers up and then weigh it afterwards and see of the number s the same 
 Three four five six We have six friends at the table And let s see I have one uh leave it there please Eulet Christmas Two Christmas Uh it s a little bit like Christmas you re right Three Oh I have

purple yellow purple yellow purple yellow purple yellow Yay And we know that you took turns because the colors changed every time It s clean up time You guys did a great job And you re right it is we are finished We learned how to take turns with a partner and we put beads on a string and made a color pattern because we took turns Yes It was all good and I think you all get to ring the good job bell Good job taking turns Eulet Good job taking 
 How do you know Because my dad works Oh okay See I want us to think about that because that was something that came up yesterday Sometimes we think Oh that s only stuff men do or That s only stuff women do But especially mechanics working on engines and stuff like that we think That s a man s job But you said your dad works with a lot of women and Kyle your dad s a kind of a mechanic too and he works with a lot of women too So girls think about that kind of thing Okay thank you very good All right now Carter come up please Carter All right Carter Tell us about the job works on people when they are injured firefighters work on burning equipment and carrying test hydrants and inspect businesses Okay so your job is Say it real loud so they can hear you A firefighter and a paramedic Okay and what are the skills that that job uses Math reading writing computer technology There it is Be proactive begin with the end in mind first thing s first think win win synergize Great okay So all of the seven habits right Okay interesting who s next And are there women firefighters Yes and paramedics Absolutely Good job Carter Okay Taylor Taylor Green All right Taylor tell us the job A machinist And tell us a little bit about what they do Repair and turbine engines for helicopters and tanks Helicopters and tanks and they use what Math technology be proactive Okay very good Do you think women can do that kind of job Yes Absolutely Okay so we said math technology are big ones there working on the helicopters tanks things like that Okay next let s have Lexi Lexi Wilson All right Lexi All right tell us about your job Furniture showroom manager I assist customers with furniture purchases inventory the furniture we have on hand update customers orders All right and we use what skills Math science Oh I wasn t watching you That s okay not so much science Reading writing computer technology Be proactive put first things first think win win and synergize Okay now I m gonna ask you a hard question Science the person with that job indicated they use science in a furniture showroom management position How do you think they use science Maybe they make the furniture The materials maybe they use and stuff like that Good good job all right thank you Okay so we can see that all of the skills that we re learning in school right now especially technology skills computer skills reading math even science our parents are using those jobs uh skills in their jobs right now in real life So someday you re gonna be using exactly what you re doing right now in a job as well as our personal skills our seven habit skills being in charge of ourselves thinking about things ahead of time planning ahead putting first things first good job All right now we re gonna take our group cards and on the cards you have a job listed one of the jobs that you re looking at in your group and a skill that goes along with that job What I want you to do is as a group discuss how can we show the use of that skill in our job that we have okay So look at your cards figure out how you re gonna use the skill listed on the skill card and then we re gonna role model to the rest of the class the use of our skill and show how we use that skill in the job that s on that card okay So start discussing and then in a few minutes I m gonna call you back and we re gonna start showing the rest of the class our skills We re the paralegal We could do well for reading skills we could do filing or we could prepare bills for clients But to prepare bills for clients we d have to read you know who they are and then for filing we d have to read whose bill it was Class when your children get ready for heading where they go down to gym for the program this morning we are right now in the process of calling kindergarten we re gonna get them to head down the hallway to the gym first and then we re going to have second grade come on down third grade fourth grade and fifth grade Okay so Payton is gonna lay on the floor and then I m gonna get to do a knee surgery on him First I ll like get a pencil pretend I m cutting the knee open and pulling it and then cutting the muscle and replacing the broken parts of the knee bone with Like using our skills we can measure the wire right here And we could measure how long it could be for the house electricity circuits and we can measure how long the wire is and somebody could be in the house and we could measure how long the wire is So let s do the thing we did yesterday When you re laying on the floor and I m trying to put the breath back in you and then I ask Carly what happened okay So you two are doing it Do you think maybe a table and chairs and maybe a couch Yeah a sofa and then you ll get over behind the table and everything and then I can say what day and what time And that s writing down what Writing skills Writing skills Very good very good We re gonna show like you you would be like typing on the computer and you would be and I would come up and ask what you re doing and so the other people would know what you re doing on the computer I would come up and ask what you re doing and you would say I m making a blueprint Like cause if we did use set up machines for production and we use synergize we d have to work together to do it and how do we do that Miss Kimberly Yes ma am How do we act out setting up for productions setting up machines Well since you re act you want to show synergizing now what does synergizing mean Working together Okay so you need to involve Working together Yeah okay And certainly with being a mechanic you re working on what Machines Machines and so what you wanna try to demonstrate is everybody working together To build a machine Possibly that would be a good one I think All right we re going to go ahead and start our demonstrations So I m gonna ask Morgan Landon and Abby s group to show us their skill And tell us what your job is tell us what s your job A paralegal A paralegal and your skill is Reading Okay Let s see how they re using reading Second grade and third grade please come on down to the gym thank you Okay great that s good Now what were they doing Filing reading Filing exactly very good good job Okay let s have Luke Destiny Payton and where do you guys wanna go Up here All right Tell us your job Certified surgical tech Wonderful and your skill Put first things first First things first okay Clear Okay great So what were some Luke what was the first thing you did The first thing first I had to gently cut his knee open and pull it apart And then Cut his muscle and pull it open and then get a mini saw and cut the pieces of the knee bone and replace it Okay and then what would be the last thing that a surgeon does Stitch the knee back together Okay all right good job Clear Good job first thing s first Okay all right now we wanna see Reagan Mackenzie and Logan let s see y all And where do you wanna go In the middle Okay that s fine And tell us your job Electrician that uses math skills Okay electrician Come in It s over here He s measuring how long the wire is 3 feet Okay okay Now what were they doing Measuring the wire Electrician and you were say it again Say what you were We were measuring the wires Measuring Measuring okay so and measuring is part of Math Math very good All right good job good job Okay all right let s have let s see it ll be Josh Alyssa and Taylor G Our job is maintenance mechanic 
 The corners The corners that s fine How do you get exactly one painted face Which one of these have just one color on them The middle Yeah just the ones in the middle on each face And how many of them are there Six So that s 6 out of 27 So that s fine And realize that if you did it right those are all your options Each of these cubes has either zero colors up to three colors Nothing has four colors So that means all your probabilities should add up to what 27 27 out of 27 Does it No No so what s the issue One of these numbers at least has to be off So figure out which one that is See if you could figure what one So keep in mind these look right But realize these are all probabilities because you re picking them out of that hat So these should all be out of 27 Right because there s 27 cubes you re picking from Right And if you did it right and these are all the cubes then they should add up to what 27 Right does it Yeah it does 27 okay so fine Good So when you do the next one it should all be out of We can figure that out You can figure that out Isn t it 16 times 4 so 64 So where are you getting these numbers from My mind Okay so I get no painted faces There s just the one cube that s right in the middle So that s one out of Because you re picking them out 1 out of 27 You gotta do a probability right But then how many have one painted face How d you get six Which six The middle ones Sure the middle ones And there s six faces so it makes sense 6 out of 27 How do you get three painted faces I didn t do that one Okay The corners So that should be eight And then realize if you did this right it should all at up to what 27 27 out of 27 So how do you figure out how many have two painted faces Just add these together and subtract them Yeah you could do that Now there is a pattern to the two just like the other ones But you can also subtract and figure that out So yeah good Oh that brings up a good point Everybody for your first cube For your very first cube everything should be out of what number 27 27 All your probabilities should be out of 27 Is it possible you can reduce the fractions when you figure it out Yes Yes I m gonna tell you don t reduce them Leave it out of 27 Even if it s 3 out of 27 don t reduce it to one ninth Just leave it at 3 out of 27 it ll help you down the line So those look good And you know One of the ways you could check if you did this right is all four of these should add up to what 27 27 And does it Yeah It adds up to 27 out of 27 So you got all your bases covered So that s good Okay good keep going How many have no painted faces Four Why four which four The four is right over here inside and then there s four Okay but let me ask you this there s these four But you said go inside a layer And then you re right there s four underneath But then there s another layer underneath that So there s eight So there should be eight And one of the ways you know you re right about this besides just hoping that you re thinking about it the right way How do you know there s three painted faces Which eight are you talking about The corners The corners So you know you re right with the eight but these should all add up to what And they do so you re okay Okay good So keep going and you re good it s all out of 64 So that s a good start Will this still have one painted face Well there is a pattern to it just like the other ones But it s fine if you can t figure that out yet Just keep going you ve got the right number So see if you can figure it out now for the 4x4x4 How are we doing on the front side Everything good So let me ask you this about this stuff I assume you all have the same answers Yeah So you said one painted face there s six of them Which six Just one color painted Sure the center of each of the six faces And there s six faces so six times one is six That s fine No we got 8 out of 27 for three Because which ones are you looking at The corners No painted faces there s just one in the middle If you added all these up what should they equal But what does it equal up to Not 27 So what s the issue What s the deal there No idea Where is there something going wrong Because you know that one has to be eight You know there s exactly one because it s the center one in each of the six sides So you know that has to be six The issue is with the two painted faces It s not eight Now you can figure it out by subtracting and just figuring out what adds up to 27 Or you could go back and just look at those how many of those have the two painted faces Where are you getting eight from Which cubes here have two painted faces These ones So that s four on this front side There s four on the back side That s eight Two on this side 10 12 12 Does that make sense And that adds up to 27 then when you add all those up So now do the same thing for the one out of 64 Okay Good How we doing These should add up to 64 shouldn t they They should add up to 64 How do you get no painted faces How do you get the four with no painted faces The center pieces So over here let s say these four in the middle But you re not looking at those Those have one painted face but you look a layer below that And that s four right there But you can go a layer below that So that should be eight So does that mess up something else I don t know how you got the other numbers So the equation for this it d be distance divided by two to get three Does that work up here You re on the right track You re thinking the right way Minus two Does that work I mean once you get this I would try to do a 5x5x5 cube Even though I didn t write it down there See if it holds up Yeah because there d be 27 in the middle That seems to make sense And that ll help you on the back side when you get there So these look fine Let s talk about this one for a second If you add these up you have 24 24 18 4 If you add all those up what do you get Do you 60 60 Right now you have 60 out of 64 So there s four squares you haven t counted yet Where did they go And you kinda know you re right with the three colored cubes because you know which ones they are Which ones are those So would we add it to the non painted faces Why You can t randomly What s the pattern Which ones have no painted faces The ones on the top So basically you have these four right here but a layer below right But there s also another layer below that Oh so it s eight So that s where there s eight Does that make sense Oh yeah I see that So that s where that s coming from So now it adds up to 64 It looks like you re probably good Why don t you try doing it for a 5x5x5 cube before you go to the back side so at least you have some patterns you can detect It ll make the back side easier But it should be a breeze now to get the 5x5x5 cube Wow Chris You re on a roll Smart idea making a graph And that should be eight over what Over here how many squares do we have We have 27 And you got that because it s Three cubed Three cubed And the other one is four cubed If you do the 5x5x5 it would be five cubed So if you have an nxnxn what is that n cubed So everything should be out of n cubed on the back And you re right that it s eight out of n cube for the three painted Why don t you try the no painted That s probably the next one to get But what there s the one middle How do you figure that out And this is where you gotta go back and look at the pattern you got for no painted faces How did you figure that out And maybe the numbers help but maybe just look at the picture and figure out how did we know how many had no painted faces Right What do those numbers have in common Okay How we doing Well you re definitely right with eight over n cubed That makes sense right Because always the corners in the cube It s always the same How did you get 6n here And you got it over here You guys have 6n in different places Well see I thought I got a brain blast What But it didn t work out I mean I felt really smart for two seconds But I was thinking that since there s six sides it has to be six times something Okay Okay that s not a bad way to think You know the answer here was 12 Yeah That was with the 3x3x3 cube Does that work If n is three you would get 18 But that s not what you got on the front side So there s some discrepancy Okay But that s not a bad way to think Some of these things have to do with six faces Like there s some multiplying by six involved You know the corner ones are gonna be eight no matter what That has nothing to do with six faces Right Right that s just the corners How do you do this Go back a second Sorry a lot of flipping You feel confident about these two sets of numbers Yeah So why don t you try doing it 5x5x5 cube even though I didn t ask for it But see what numbers you get for that because it ll make the back page a little better Because now you ll have more numbers to use and try to find a pattern You guys have different numbers Why is that What do you mean On the front side What do you mean Sarah has 8 out of 64 here You have 4 out of 64 here Oh blood Oh my god Do you need to go Go go Go to the bathroom I don t care I care go Do you have band aids now I don t know I don t think I do Go to the bathroom Things still happen So you have eight out of eight cubed That s fine We know the three painted faces are going to be which ones The corners The corners And there s always gonna be eight So that s fine Eight out of n cubed How do you figure out how many have zero painted faces It s always the ones in the middle Yes always the ones in the middle So when you had a 3x3x3 cube what was in the middle One And what s the dimensions of that cube 1x1x1 When it was a 4x4x4 cube what were the dimensions of the middle That you couldn t see 4x4x4 Well 4x4x4 is the whole cube 2x2x2 2x2x2 If it was a 5x5x5 cube what would be the middle 3x3x3 3x3x3 If its an nxnxn cube what s the middle You kinda have it If it s 6x6x6 what s the middle I don t know I m kinda lost Okay go back for a second You lost me at the 5x5x5 one Okay you know its 3x3x3 And the center was 1x1x1 That s the ones you couldn t see any color 4x4x4 cube what s the center 2x2x2 If it s a 5x5x5 cube let s say What would the center be 3x3x3 3x3x3 If it s a 6x6x6 cube 4x4x4 If it s an nxnxn cube n minus two Times n minus two times n minus two So what s the pattern for no painted faces n minus two cubed Exactly That s the sort of pattern you need to find for those first two now How are you figuring these out when you actually have a concrete 5x5x5 cube Is this what you re supposed to do Because it s saying that n is the number of small cubes so you can t just say it s a 4x4x4 n is representing the whole 125 cubes right Right So is this the correct equation for one painted sides For one painted side Yeah For one painted side Well how are you finding the one painted face Or how many painted cubes did you have here I had six Six which six It s basically the one in the center but there s six faces so we multiplied by six So I get where this is coming from The multiply by six So n represents the 125 n represents how many across you have Oh I thought n represented the whole No I mean 
 boys and girls for the last week we have been looking at videos about Dr Martin Luther King We ve been reading books about Dr Martin Luther King to get a feel for who he was why people loved him so much why laws were changed because of things that he said and things that he did So today we are going to watch another clip of Dr Martin Luther King This is probably one of the most famous speeches he ever gave It was his I Have a Dream speech I don t want you to so much listen to his words today as I want you to think about what else he does as he speaks or while he s speaking that makes him such a great speaker How does he capture his audience How does he get people to want to listen to him Alright So I want you to pay close attention It s just a short clip Then you ll turn to your partners So let s see Let me go ahead and get this started I have a dream that one day down in Alabama with its vicious racists with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers I have a dream today I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted and every hill and mountain shall be made low the rough places will be made plain and the crooked places will be made straight and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together This is our hope This is our hope and this is the faith that I go back to the South with With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope With this faith we will be able to Okay I m going to stop it there And I want you to tell me first of all what are some things that you notice that he did to capture his audience I want you to think about it for a minute I see lots of hands up What I want you to do is turn to your share partner first Talk to your partner about what you saw Okay Let me have your attention back up here I m going to write Dr King in the middle of this web What I want you all to do is to tell me what are some things that you and your partner discussed about what you saw that made people want to listen and to focus and pay attention to what Dr King had to say Sara He had hand motions He had hand motions But there was no hand motions in that clip Yeah there was I m glad that you all saw that I almost said something You could kind of see this hand go up but it was so close The video was so close That s why I picked that particular segment because I saw his arm and I thought Oh I hope they get that because I couldn t find a better clip Zachary The way he said a few words at a time Okay He said words at a time and stopped Very good He spaced his words for lack of something a better term to use Zachary said he would say a few words and then he would stop so that people could absorb almost what he was saying and then he could go on Annie Okay Emma He spoke in a very low voice so it was really easy to hear him Okay So his tone of voice right We ll put tone of voice So it was easy to hear him Yeah And then he didn t mumble He spoke up really loud He spoke loudly He did not mumble she said He spoke loudly He spoke very serious Yes He spoke very serious Jesenya He shook his head He shook his head didn t he He nodded Very good That was my idea He shook his head Or nodded Dalen He was looking at the audience Very good He was looking at the audience We call that eye contact He had notes in front of him but he didn t do this did he No He looked up constantly He might have looked down to see where he was in his speech but he always looked back at his audience Lenare He said nice words that the people knew Okay The words that he spoke he had a good message didn t he If you have a good message people are willing to listen to you too He was a good good man One more Kalen He even had a gooder life a better life Very good And that goes kind of along with the words that he spoke the good message about having a better life All right So you guys came up with some really good points right here What I want you to think about when you do your readers theater I want you to think about how you can incorporate what Dr Martin Luther King incorporated into his speeches to get people to listen to him so that you re believable in your part that people can understand what you re saying So what we re going to do is we re going to create a rubric together that s going to help you So it s called Rubric For Speaking Out for Justice Dr Martin Luther King Jr a readers theater play grade two because you guys are second graders Now let s take a look at what I ve written listening speaking viewing There s a three a two and a one Let s do listening first okay Now if three is the highest how do you think you can get a three Sayid By getting a one plus two Okay But don t think about math right this moment Oh I want you to think about if I were grading you you were grading yourself or your peers were grading you how would you give yourself a three or someone else a three Emma We start with listening You wouldn t be just fumbling through your pages of your book and just traveling around You d be listening to the other people because you have to know when your part is You have to be ready Very good You have to know where your part is Part of doing readers theater is listening to the people that are reading before you because that is going to give you your cue of when it s your turn to speak okay So I was a good listener Let s look at number two How do you think you would get a two How would you score a two for listening If the best is that you were a good listener what would two be Annie Looking at your paper and then like doing something else Looking at your paper but doing something else Maybe looking away maybe fidgeting So maybe you tried to listen most of the time but you had difficulty with it So we could say I tried to listen most of the time Most of the time So what about a one Kennedy I didn t listen at all Very good Like purposefully not paying attention I forgot to listen Yeah you don t decide to do that on purpose Whitney Now the next thing you re going to be scored on is speaking So how could you get a three for speaking Sara Don t speak like just normal like how the actor would speak Speak how the actor would speak Good Lenore Let s do a body check please I need you all on the carpet You re supposed to like listen to what he said Okay Annie Like speak a little louder When you speak loudly then I spoke loudly enough for people to hear I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character I have a dream that one day the state of Alabama will Will be Will be transformed into a situation where little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers My dad and I have that dream too When we let freedom ring we will let it rumble We will let it ring from every village and every hamlet and every state in every city We will be able to see that day when all of God s children black men and white men Jews and Gentiles Protestants and Catholics will join hands and sing the words of the old Negro spirit Free at last Free at last Thank God almighty We are free at last Dad when I listen to Reverend King I know that he s right I know that things are going to change I think you re right Act IV It is now spring of 1963 The speech of Reverend King has continued to lead people and speak out their He has met with another president Lyndon B Johnson and has seen changes sweep across the country May Billy please come in here I have some news What is it Mom Reverend King is dead He was shot in Memphis Tennessee No Mom That s not fair He was helping all of us I agree Billy It isn t fair But remember Reverend King lives on in us Every time we remember the words every time we speak out against things that are unfair we are giving remembrance Okay So go find the people that had your card and have your conversations get your feedback about how you did Miss Walters I got all three too Great Great Did you see me I had nine points You were a good listener Very good Great feedback 
 We haven t talked about some things that we do when we are what Sad Sad Not sad He s ma Mad Mad He is really really mad He s got that mad face going Rrrr He is so ugly He is so ugly He is mad And it says sometimes I get mad Is it okay if we re mad Yeah Yeah What is No If somebody eat people I bet that way too That must have been Ow Ow Ow If someone s biting they probably would get in trouble because we don t want to hurt our friends Ow No No we don t want to hurt our friends Ow Ow Ow or push them out of the chair Or push them out of the chair you re right that would hurt our friends too That s a man And we don t want to do that yes sir look up there Alright what are some things that make you mad Nick When somebody hurt on fingers When someone hurt your fingers that makes you mad That can make me mad too Jakiah what s something that makes you mad People bite me If someone bit you who bit you Deion Your brother I d be mad too cause that hurts our friends doesn t it Kendrel what s something that makes you mad My sister beat me off the chair and my sister threw my toys When she kicked your chair and threw your toys And broke my TV And broke your TV Oh I d be mad about that too Alright this page You don t got a sister Yes he has a sister this says I do when I get mad sometimes I I hit I Throw those toys throw our toys I Bite somebody I may bite or I may Yell Yell Are those good things to do No Why not Someone might cry In trouble because Nick said some might cry maybe it would hurt them And get in trouble They would but we don t want to hurt our friends do we And pull our hair or if someone yeah we don t want to pull our friends hair either cause the would hurt our friends Or pull somebody s braids Or pull somebodies braids that would hurt and that is not a good not a is it My uncle had braids Did he I do This said this is not a good idea that is a those are what those green choices or red choices Red choices Those are red choices Things we do not want to do Alright let s see what our next page says It says When I am mad it is a good idea too who remembers something that we can do who remembers something we can do when we re mad that s okay to do I know I know What If somebody get mad Then what can you do Kick somebody and punch somebody in the face Is that a green choice or a red choice Red choice Punching someone would be a red choice What s a green choice we could make Do you remember one Yeah that be good What is a good choice That maybe share with toys Maybe we could share our toys that would be a good choice here Criss cross please I m by myself criss cross please Kendrel said maybe we can share our toys Yeah Alright last time we talked about some other things We can do what Talk to some buddies Talk to our friends good Nick and what do we tell our friends Um If they took a toy from us what could we tell them Sorry Sorry No not sorry If we took a toy from our friends we could tell them sorry but if they took a toy from you and you got really really mad what words could you use Say give it back to me You could say give it back If they were doing something that you didn t like what could you say Give it back to me You could tell them to Sorry To st To stop If they re bothering you or doing something you don t like you can tell them to stop or leave me alone We can talk to who To our friends To the Teacher Teacher And what could you tell me To give back our toys Maybe that someone took my toy and I want it back and they wont give it to me Toys You re absolutely right good for you Jakiah Because you want your toys Yep or

 Okay let s get busy So before we change the car we have two more times Okay let s look Jacob let s help It s 9 3 What is 9 three 93 93 Is there a way that we can maybe change to other things here to make it go further Like the car Yeah How Maybe the height How about you guys discuss Oh try it Put that way back like that It might need help for you holding the ramp how bout you do you think that s a good idea I m gonna roll it back Alright Oh Is it gonna stay you think Yeah I bet Awesome Let s see how far it went Watch your foot 105 What is 105 105 I love the way that you re making sure that that goes nice and smooth on the way in So let s take a look Jacob let s look over here Let s look at our data we have the roll one with just the normal way we had 101 inches And then the roll two which was again the same way at 93 inches And roll three at 105 inches Which way went the furthest 103 roll three Roll three Why do you think that is Because it s 101 that one is 101 and that ones 105 Well why do you think roll one is different from roll three Because ones higher then the other higher then the other Because ones higher then the other Okay so do you want to try to add in or take away something from this vehicle I think we should What do you think we should pick Take away the girl Take away the girl Nothing What do you guys think about Hailey s idea What did she say Jacob S Hold on what did Hailey say Say it again We shouldn t even try Okay Okay so how about Jacob since Jacob was trying to make the other car how bout Jacob tries to put on bigger wheels We should see what happens then Here Jacob Well look at this look at which one would we need bigger wheels on That one That one Okay So that car Go farther that one will go farther Probably will go farther you think with bigger wheels Yeah Cause the bigger the wheel the easier it has balance Did you hear what he said Bigger wheels have balance The bigger the wheels the more balanced it is I m saying like let s say you re Is that gonna work Is there anything else you guys want to do to this car Or do you just want to change one thing I just change one thing Okay it s your car So what about your ramp Ashley what about your ramp how do you want your ramp to be Maybe we can take this off and do it in the normal way Okay 76 You want to try that way Alright That s true Whoa That wasn t go far Alright let s measure It goes a little bit She needs a little bit of help 72 72 We re gonna put this vehicle Alright so we re not going to change the car but what could we do 32 Whoa look Student Guys this is going to be affecting weight okay That box could stay here instead of Alright you guys try it You guys got it now 91 times 2 Well that s up to your group Can I make my car now No not yet That s not weight three yet Split weight right now so How you guys doing Did you guys try to move the weight in different ways Ok Alright back Let s do it together 56 Look at that let s see what happened No it s 67 Where s your data at Put the data over here so we re all in the same place 83 Okay let s take a look What do you have here 67 This will be so much fun Okay you roll it Ashley can I work on it can I have it Should we take something away first No No 42 I think we should put a little one Gimme that You think we should I m not sure Cause the blue one Wow Cool Oh Oh my gosh Here I ll Yeah And without these wheels Now Are you ready Go Here here we go Ouchie hold the end I ll hold it 77 No it s 67 Jacob 67 Might be 77 What is 77 We did it for two ways so they can do it last way That was way more Yeah but How many inches was that second roll Look Three feet so 3 F So what three feet equals 36 inches We re going to be focused on the inches so we don t get confused So hold on wait a second When we had that ramp the first way what did you do with it the same way as the first way No we did this way Just that Yeah We haven t done it like that I know just re adjust this Yeah So when did it go when you did just that 30 seconds no it went that What is that 73 73 So then we moved it to make it which way did we do it the second way Higher We did it this way what happened to the numbers It went lower It went lower So if we go it lower it goes higher I don t know let s try So what s another ramp that we can make Have you tried that way before Nope Alright let s see Hold on a second David we have to measure Nope your group can help you measure Let s see 35 Ooh that s seven Okay let s take a look again let s make sure What s that There we go So roll three let s try Now let s take a look at our data hold on That s not gonna work You don t think so Well let s first take a look here and then we can see if that will work It s probably gonna fall What happened with roll three where s the data Look at roll three what is it 35 And what s roll two I don t know 36 So what do you think happened whenever we made the ramp a little bit higher I mean a little bit lower I m sorry It changed It changed What happened when it changed The number I see let s focus It goes more faster It might go more faster There s not another roll four but you made a very interesting ramp and you guys wanna try that Yeah Okay let s see let s see what happens Taylor What happened It fell I knew it would my box Well how about you hold that so we can try it again Try it again Oh no Fix em and let s see if it does that every time do you think it ll do it every time Yes Yes Let s try again I ll measure this time You ll measure Yeah Oh Oh We have to do it again Taylor you can go on the carpet This time I made it lower Oh So he just said something what did he say He made it lower He made it lower So what s happening every time he makes it a little bit lower It falls off When it falls off it still can roll I mean just keep it rolling when it falls off Uh oh I ll measure it Okay We don t have enough space to measure that one how about we change the car and try again But what did you guys notice every time the ramp changed What happened when it was super high It fell apart It didn t work so well can you imagine if you were in a real car and you were going down something that steep Yeah No That would be kinda scary wouldn t it But as it kept going down what happened It didn t go off It didn t fall apart you re right Alright go back and try to make a different car Okay go back and try to make it be careful your gonna make me nervous Alright let s see Jacob what do you have Come on over Nope Jacob come on over What in the world did you make That looks like a Mack Truck Girls do you see this Yeah Tractors throwing in something Now take a look roll it and see if that one feels good to you Big Girls are you watching Look at how that rolled Girls you next Okay This was all my idea That was your idea I love it Could we try it this way We could keep a hold of that you might want to try it Let s see Well we should be working on Correctamundo See I got a good review What do we got Jacob 93 93 So what can we do to change it I guess we could maybe We re learning something We are learning something what did we learning We learned the car the littler it is the harder for it to fall That is true It s your turn Is that what you re finding out the smaller the car Yeah The smaller the car the more it picks up Picks up Cars go over Oh were we going over No I It s your turn Preston Oh did you guys hear him Let s take a second and listen He was talking about yesterday s experiment what did we do yesterday We tried rolling little cars on the carpet Why didn t it work out so well Jacob Little cars on the carpet Because the wheels stopped them Why did they stop you think Because the carpets too rough Because the carpet s too rough Did you guys find that too So what are you finding about today That the bigger the wheels the on hard surfaces It s faster on smoother and hard surfaces it goes further So what are you finding out about the ramp That You guys are finding that How about you decide that for this last one you tried one way with the ramp And now we re going to try two more ways with this ramp and I want to see if guys can figure out how this works better with a ramp 
 Like a long A Not long A Long O No I ll give you a hint There s some letters up on the front What is the sound Er It s er Er Everybody say er Er Okay What we re going to do If you remember last week

 What part of soccer you really want to know What about the measuring or even the measure That s what you ve got to figure out Or how long you can Okay I mean how many like times you can do it Okay so you could sit there and count how many bounces kicks or you could sit here with the timing How much you can do it and how much time you need Okay how many per minute So you ve got lots of ideas You re going to have to choose that Do you need a little more time to bounce it off each other Yeah Okay so I think you have both come up with all four of you You guys come up with an experiment to support each other and you two come up with one And you ll collect your data and you ll collect your data and then present it as a company How about that soccer team or company Alright Alright you ve got a good name Alright that s part of it It works Catch your attention I know Stephanie We re having trouble Because we barely decided on it We didn t do the friction one but the one where you drop the marble in the the shampoo bottle The little car that you pull back and see how far it goes Okay And the parachute one so I thought of the parachute one What do you think Yeah You re a team on it okay So what are you going to measure with a parachute Pardon Yeah you re going to use metric which is centimeters Stephanie s got control of the metrics So can you tell me what your experiment is going to look like with these parachutes Well we don t know how far Because we know we can t throw it out the window Oh no It s too far Okay but you know what Maybe on the counter You guys are coordinated I would let you stand on this counter and you could kind of measure different heights How high you could You could do some test runs right Yeah Don t you think scientists would do test trials before they make a real decision Okay Yeah And you know what If you d like if we have time I want you to do test runs in here but we could do a final drop off the balcony and get it clear That s what I was thinking Okay but I do want you to do test runs in here first and then we could do a final But make your hypothesis what you re thinking because I think you re on a roll here It s going to be good I don t like his interview So how far In this experiment can we put like some sort of weight on the parachute to see how fast or something Okay I think you re making another experiment right So what s your first experiment Just how fast it would drop by itself How fast from one distance Yeah Okay so one distance you re going to see how fast it ll drop And then you re going to compare that to from that distance Adding weights to it Okay alright Well I wondered how far will the parachute go from different heights Okay so she s got one experiment and you ve got another one Do you want to do two in one and kind of combine it together You do yours and you do yours Because you only can change one variable at a time right Yeah So what s your variable you re going to measure I m going to measure the distance how far How high different distances And what are you going to do And you re going to time it right Yeah Okay and you re going to do what s your variable that you re going to change The weight Okay But you re going to see how fast it drops Yeah Alright so I think you re going to need another paper Okay Because you ve got two experiments going Are you going to support each other in each one Yeah That s pretty cool double points How are you guys doing Oh I like it Okay tell me about this one Okay so we re going to get two or three different size basketballs like a really small one and maybe a medium one and then Yeah And then we re going to like have two meters or a meter and like drop it from there So like how high it bounces depending on its size Oh so the size of the balls to see how High it bounces Okay If it bounces higher What do you think I think the small one will bounce higher Because there s less material to like have to drop from there Like when in gym class when they have the huge balls for exercising if you drop a bigger one usually it doesn t go up as high and the smaller ones do bounce higher So based on your observations You re a good observer So your large ball went the highest and you thought the small one would Whoa are these your averages Yeah they re my averages Wow okay Good So how are you guys going to present it as a team She s probably going to do like what we thought would happen And I m probably going to do the results of what actually happens Are you comfortable with that Uh huh Okay to make it really clear what you did Yeah yeah Okay I think that ll be really good because this is great this is great to show and then you re writing your conclusion with numbers in it I like that And then you told yours was rejected right Yeah Okay now does that mean you re a failure No Do you guys mind going first Sure Because if they see that yours is rejected and yet you still could write up a scientific experiment I think that might give them some confidence and it ll take the pressure off them because they don t really want to go first Okay so let s go Aqui tenemos que cambiar la friccion sobre dos Tenemos que cambiar Oh wow the graph looks good And your data chart looks good So Jenni will you shows yours On the first dictation thing when we have to go up there do we have to go up by step like show everything What do you think Or just show our graph What do you think would be the best I say showing the graph Should we show like our question and then should we show the whole thing What do you think I don t know I think so Showing both Okay But it s probably the most important thing to convince them I d definitely show your data Okay we ll show his because it s better than mine Okay very good And let s see yes it looks professional So these numbers How many times did you do this experiment Three times wait four three twelve 100 I don t know Because there s five and there s three Okay We ve got one two three four five trials here Is that correct No we went up three but he wrote trials for these Oh okay So we can fix that Que dibujaste No tienes que poner esto Tienes que poner esto It s very neat So you added one two three and divided by By three Okay alright that s how you got the average Yeah Okay and who figured out the answer Me Jenni Wow Jenni We did was it highest to lowest Yeah Highest minus lowest divided by two Awesome You definitely should show this And then this would be uncertainty Yeah And these are the mounted distance with different kinds of What are these five things The shoes Okay The shoes It gets tiring when you have to do it three times Right Now my question is if you didn t have the shoes how did you get the data for it I did it at my house You did them at your house Okay And then what s this one right over here The socks Okay and that s one you definitely did at school Yeah we did it here and we also did the Vans here And the Vans Alright so that s good Would you explain that to the class Yeah That these you did at home and these you did here and so would you have any sources of error Yeah because of the surface Like at his house it would have been not like floor it would be carpet or something like that Yeah what s your floor like where you did it Well I had to do it like outside during the rain Oh my goodness Okay so you ve got to explain that and then do you think that would affect your experiment any Yeah Okay maybe it would And so what would a scientist do in the next time Would have done it in a dry place Yeah do it in a dry place Yeah I like that Okay so you ll tell that for the next time Yeah But I really liked how you guys didn t give up How you actually did the socks compared to your Vans And you know how you pull those out what are research we could have done your boot Oh yeah my boot Yeah I could have Want to do my boot No I m good No My legs are tired Okay I m sure they are Well did you accept or reject your hypothesis Accept We accepted it And tell us why Because You ve got the evidence right there don t you The experiment like that one question we had it goes with the real world or something like that Could you repeat this experiment The whole thing Yeah or could anybody do this experiment Yeah it s easy It is Did you write your procedure so it s easy It s hard to write a procedure because it Okay and if you had to do this experiment over again would you do it any differently or not No Would you test for anything else Good point How much pressure right Okay alright any other questions Nice job Thanks Jenni s team Sorry to rush you guys but we got the idea What was your experiment Our experiment was to find out what types of shoes would work to do the moon walk uses four different pairs of shoes like Adidas Converse or Vans The Adidas would go the farthest The Vans No just show the data You were correct And you were correct because the Adidas were here and the first time it went like 112 centimeters and the second trial it went 118 centimeters and the final was like 12 and then it was like 116 6 centimeters We accepted our hypothesis Jenni continue this Why me Because you re professional Well we were going to do an interview but we forgot to So what do we do It s really bad Why do you think it s bad Jenni I don t know Esta bien esta bien Well here s the amount of distance and here s the kind of and I marked them as the average they all went So we can see that the Adidas went more than the Vans did because the Vans were like the lowest Will you tell us about your source of error because that was interesting Because you had a good way to solve it if you did your project over again Oh yeah Well it s because Jose did half of the experiment he did it at home and the other part of it we did here and I think it did it different because he did it in the rain and we did it like on dry So I think that affected the experiment There s probably different traction on shoes Si Simon What kind of shoe would you try next time A boot Oh like my major walking boot Si Alright What would you hypothesize would happen if you tried my boot If you look at the Well because it s soft so I think it ll go farther Possibly go farther Okay alright That would be interesting to try out Does everybody see how this can apply to real life Tienen preguntas Hablan en ingles no espanol Can you explain how this would apply to real life if you aren t just moon walking Jose Jenni Don t look at me I don t know Go on the actual moon Gym class Yeah gym class Does anybody change out of their shoes for gym class Sometimes Okay some people do I don t You don t Yeah like these shoes they slide a lot like in the gym Okay so it might be different shoes for different jobs Yeah Okay well thank you Nice job Good we have time for our last presentation Thank you Alright sorry to rush everybody I know you could talk more about it Thanks for being a good audience Hello class how are we doing today Good So our title was dirty water versus clean water Thank you Our experiment had to do with a sailboat in four different types of water 
 Alright Anne Carol what s your job How much sugar are you putting in Two tablespoons Two tablespoons There you go fill it all the way up to the top Thomason That s okay Thomas can you show her There you go That s okay You ll get it we re gonna make a mess today There you go Caleb way to open the bag for her Go ahead Anne Carol Why don t you pull it There you go One half cup of milk Good job Anne Carol One more We need more Need more That s good that s good There you go Alright good job baby girl What did we put in it Milk You can do it One whole cup One whole cup Hang on it s leaking Milk Milk spills Okay we ll get it You re good Alright Help them put it in there That was exactly one cup Exactly one cup Next is the milk That s okay There you go Okay now I need this Anne Carol Oh okay I need the other side Careful vanilla is really expensive I got it Vanilla How much did you put in A half Half a teaspoon Alright we re almost ready That was cool Whose turn is it Uh my turn It looks like chocolate milk A half cup Half cup Alright Anne Carol how ya doin over there Good It does look like pudding A liquid It s a liquid Do you think that s a solid Anne Carol No What is it Smells like it That s okay it ll get all over That s okay Sure no problem Yeah get it up to the top There you go Okay now Look good Yeah Alright Can we seal it Is that one of your directions Is that the next one Did we get everything in Yes Did we get sugar Yep Did we get our milk Yep Our vanilla Yes And our regular and our condensed milk Yes Alright Make sure it s sealed really really good We need the other bag Give me that bag sweetie Here you go Yep it s closed That s good we have two bags Oh what you got in there Thomas It s ice and rocks Is it sealed really really good Alright hold on we re gonna put this in first Hold on Alright what s in here Rock salt and ice Rock salt and ice Now what is this Liquid You think it s gonna freeze it Turn it to ice cream Let s find out Alright this one s gotta be sealed first Go ahead Thomas Seal it really really good You don t want it to leak Alright Yeah no cracks cause we don t want it to leak Think it s good Alright and then do this one Ready Anne Carol Uh huh We still got one more thing to do Four bags Isn t that right Ms Moore That s right Caleb Only two more There s like one bag and then three in there Let s see you make some ice cream Shake it and eat it Yeah About 30 seconds of shaking Yeah it looks cool Why you think we put rock salt in ice It makes the flavor Oh it s so cold It keeps ice from melting It does keep the ice from melting Very good Is it cold Anne Carol What happened to that We have like this ice cream maker and we like put in it and then we turn it on and it makes good My turn Alright I m gonna get this My hands are gonna cold I m gonna try to get the bag in the center Why you think I m rubbing my hands so they can get warm Do you think it s a solid yet Rub your hands Rub your hands Your turn It s gonna take a little while Yeah you can warm your hands up Because what s gonna happen if our hands are warmer It makes more warm Yeah it s gonna make it easier isn t it Alright you keep making that ice cream I m gonna go check on the other group okay Help each other Help each other Pass it on to Thomas Hey Thomas It s on the side we have to get it in the middle And the other kind needs to get cold Oh Oh it s so cold Caleb My turn please My turn No you already did it My turn It s my turn now It s starting to look like it It s mixed together Oh my goodness Whoa that s cold You think it s gonna turn into a solid Is that what s gonna happen Solid and liquid A solid and liquid Yeah because it melts Oh if it melts it s gonna be a Liquid Do you think that is a gas Anne Carol No What do you think it is A solid A solid It could turn into a liquid Do you think that an ice cube Hold on Amy s got a good question What did you say Maybe sometimes it could turn into a gas state How would you turn it into a gas Boil it You boil it Very good It could melt too and turn into a It could turn into one as it melts My house is a solid Your house is a solid Anne Carol Good job It s so cold Shake it shake it Give it a good shake Alright I ll be right back guys Try not to squeeze it then it might pop Ms Moore Yes ma am Will you do it please You want me to help you Okay Let s re check it and see Have to open a lot of bags What is it still Liquid So we re get it right in the middle You wanna feel it Whoa It s still a liquid Is it getting colder Yes It did mix together didn t it We re gettin there It does look like that now doesn t it That s okay Alright ready guys We re gonna get it more in there There s like 50 pieces of ice in there There is a lot of them Alright here goes your turn Kevin Getting colder Getting colder Hey look What you need sweetie Aw thank you darling Keeping your hands warm there Thomas Ready to go Do you think it s easier to go to the store or make it To the store Make it Is it more fun to make it Yeah Yes ma am That s okay You can make up your own flavor Alright if it s not your turn what I want you to do is you re gonna start to filling out these questions okay Yep you can start filling those out Alright you start filling those out You can help each other with these So what did you make Ice cream One thing was solid what was that Kayla Sugar Ice Ice and sugar Oh we did use ice We did use ice So three What else is in here though What else is in here Rock salt There you go Guys we re almost done Look look at it Keep going Yes It shows what were the solids you used Good you have one of them on there Salt Yep We used salt It s gonna be vanilla ice cream 
 We gotta work quiet It s three and a half inches long and is it Seven centimeters Keep going gotta keep going Wait wait wait wait wait It s probably about one pound Okay yeah let s go I don t know how You measure it with this inches then centimeters One inch That s one inch One inch Yeah then do it across We need one inch one and a half One and a half Three and a half You got it It s a bone got a bone Pick it up It d be easier if we could pick it up Here s a bone There s one yeah You all let s put it in the middle We gotta tear it apart now We don t have to tear it apart even more It s a bone It s part of that Wait hold on hold on and feathers You all start pulling those ones It s on my finger There s a ball It s a bird it s a bird No look at this claw It s a bird it s a bird It s a birdy bird Look there s its wait where s its There s its teeth and there s its It s a skull You all be careful with those little ones Just broke it Oh my god I found something You guys are being mean A skull I found a skull right there How many skulls did you all predict would be in your owl pellet I put one One How many have you found so far Was it right We found a couple bones What about skulls how many skulls It s tiny Alright how can you determine what kind of animal it is How much did it weigh Ten grams Ten grams Do you think do you think its weight has anything to do with how many skulls inside Why would that have anything to do with Because the skull might weigh about two grams maybe I think here s another skull It s got a lot of bones in it Okay see if you can determine what animal it is Looks kind of like a teacup This is a rat skull because I can see its teeth right here I know Jake found another skull I think This is a skull This is so cool Let s get playing boys and girls You all I think this is what we got No that is a bone No look look Where s the claw And look at this claw I think it s the same And then look Look let s see Oh that s a skeleton Oh that is a skeleton Ooh my touching it A whale Ooh yay we found a skeleton Look at the skeleton Chloe It s a skull It s a skull Ew ew ew ew ew Put the feathers and stuff over here Or whatever it is Yeah we need to the feathers Look this is soft It s not soft it has something There s a little baby bone It looks like a squirrel Look I got a baby bone No seriously What animal did you predict you would find in your owl pellet A bird A bird a gopher and a rat So what have you have you decided what it is A bird How did you determine it was a bird We found like big claws like this How can you be sure that it s a bird claw Because these are usually as hard and like sharper We put this Oh we got the skull and we got a skull How many animals how many skulls have you found We only found like two This is what I was thinking You know how it has sharp stuff up there What s a way that you can determine what it is I think we got a bird we got some more claws However much bones you find Compare the bones that you found to the bones on the chart I found another skeleton Keep working It has to be a bone this might be something right there Let me get that out because I haven t got anything out yet We got two skulls I found something I found this Another skull Yeah I think Found another bone You did Yep We found all sorts of here s another this is a claw It s a bird Is this a bird claw or I don t know I think that s a Where s the bird skull Found something What is it Wait hold on wait I think we ll find another skull What do you think this is Daniel What do you think this is I don t know Know what that is I bet that s probably something I think this bone might be something found in its arm You all look what I found I think this is a skull right here because We got them two don t worry We got a bone we got a bone We got the same skeleton Have you determined what your animal is No we don t know I think this is an eyeball We got a bunch of eyeballs Here let me see that Look look look It s a tooth Eyeball Let me see Look I found this This is the part of the eyeball Look look I found the Ew I found the pelvis I found the pelvis The owls are on this chart I think that might be something wait With the tweezers Here s an eye socket Over there somewhere This is this I think We need to get the hair out of it Oh my word I think we got Look I got the head See how sharp these are 
 I see lots of different levels of tennis I see some balancing levels Blake why do you choose to balance this Who wants to share Keeping that ball controlled Back to back Catching placement find a partner and standing with equipment on the ground I ve got two groups ready equipment s on the ground You re looking for somebody you may have not worked with already You should have found a partner If not you guys will start Thank you for placing the equipment down on the ground Lost and found Lost and found always come to the start very good When I say go you re going to turn to your partner I want you to talk to them about what is a lifetime activity What I have on the board over here and I also have it on my screen Lifetime activity what does it mean to have a lifetime activity What does the word lifetime mean Go Bryan soccer baseball Maybe not Soccer Maybe one of those yeah maybe it could be yeah soccer Volleyball Yeah volleyball And five four three two and one My partner and I Zachary had some really good examples of what lifetime means so I m gonna use his Zachary said that lifetime means you do it now as a third grader but we could do it later in life as an adult Raise your hand if that s what you and your partner kinda said It s something you should be able to do later in life Very good And then we gave each other an idea of what some activities could be that we could do now and later in life Zachary said two cool ones tennis Anybody else say tennis Awesome pat yourself on the back And he also said bowling and the reason those two are really good examples for having now as a third grader and later in life is that they re pretty good on your body You can still do em they re not gonna injure your body too much It s gonna make you strong and healthy We have an organ in our body that really needs to be worked out We ve talked about aerobic capacity And tennis will make your heart beat faster You have to find something that s gonna make the heart beat faster So now turn to your partner talk about what you re gonna choose to make your heart beat faster Go And five four three two one Pat yourself on your back for your lifetime activity that you re gonna choose nice job When I say go you are your partner are now gonna travel back to any open area and stand back in face off position So this is where my partner and I came and we put our equipment down Then we ll turn and look at the board Ready Go Looking for an open spot with a partner Thank you for carrying your equipment quickly and quietly Now we re transitioning now to talk about working with a partner and doing some tennis challenges So far we ve worked by ourselves to be responsible learners Brian are you looking for your partner He s right here So now we can work with a partner and be responsible learners On the screen is one of the challenges we did with the balloons yesterday Zachary and Ms Rock will show you an example of what you could practice We re gonna actually skip this level today but you could choose it if you said Hey you know what let s go back to this other level So Zachary and Ms Rock both have our rackets we re gonna practice underhand striking keep up Raise your hand if you remember that Awesome Alright here it is I tick step tock and he s gonna strike back or he can catch it and then I m gonna keep striking We re gonna keep our paddles low go ahead Alright I m gonna wait til it gets low so I can strike he s gonna also wait til it gets low to strike Keeping that paddle low We re trying to keep it up as long as we can Awesome So that was the first level Striking keep up with the balloon Now we re gonna move to bean bag challenges with a partner Super duper cool It looks like this Only one person will need a bean bag Since I m closest to the wall I m the person to have the bean bag first I m going to be the underhand thrower Zachary go ahead and pick up your racket Create a flat surface I m going to underhand throw he s going to catch it on his racket Take a step tock Good try You might have to reach out and get under it Now he s gonna leave it on his racket and he s gonna underhand throw it back from his racket to my hands Go ahead Take a step tock I catch alright He needs to have three tries with the racket then it s my turn to have three tries with the racket Thumbs up if you understand Down if you got a question Alright Person closest to the wall you will pick up your partners ball and switch out one bean bag Bring it back and place it in your racket Go Quickly quickly and five four three two one You should have one bean bag back on your tennis racket Raise your hand if you have a question So partner with the beanbag go ahead and pick it up You re the tosser first with your hands You only need the beanbag You only have the beanbag Grab your place on your side Thank you Christopher for being safe We re gonna move through these challenges fairly quickly We re gonna see how far we get We re gonna be responsible if the beanbag is not working so well you can go back to a Balloon Balloon Alright let s practice Go One catching on their racket one catching on their hand I hear good communication with a partner You have to help each other One person is underhand throwing one person is catching Awesome if you haven t switched jobs go ahead and switch jobs at this time If you haven t switched jobs See how many good catches you can get Give yourself a point for each catch Hands or racket Are you using the opposite foot to step back with Both partners pick up rackets Both partners pick up rackets Look at the board now you re gonna see the toss from racket to racket challenge Count how many you can get Go There you go Zach Excellent One And freeze Alright from here I m going to now make you and your partner be responsible learners We have learned to use a bean bag with a partner We re gonna now learn how to use both a foam ball and a large tennis trainer Both of these offer different challenges The first one is a foam ball As you can see on the screen they now have a foam ball Zachary picks up his racket We are doing an underhand strike back and forth But like we did with the tennis ball we can also catch it on our tennis racket at any time we need to So Zachary do you think if I tossed this to you you could try catching it Alright let s see Nice He had to figure out how to keep that balance on here He s gonna do the same thing back to me This is just working on looking for that ball getting our feet to it and keeping a flat surface We can do the catching with the ball now we re ready for the tap offs Remember what we did with the balloon We re gonna try to keep the foam ball up This is what it looks like Tap tap good try It went away a little bit stop it we come back I tick step tock Good We re keeping a flat surface coming back slanted out The lower the racket the better control we will have I want the racket to stay at a slant to partner Can you say that Slant to partner So that s the foam ball challenge Some of you may just stay with the foam ball But if you re like I wanna challenge myself and my partner I say Zachary we can now use the tennis trainer And it s going to bounce strike bounce strike The bouncing is gonna bounce here before I hit it then it will bounce in the middle then my partner will strike Okay Ready Zachary So it s a bounce strike bounce strike Excellent And I would come back and start it over again if I need to Bounce strike bounce strike bounce strike bounce strike Catch when needed Were we controlled Yeah When it got out of control we caught it So from here on out you now have balloon to challenge yourself and a partner with bean bag What came next Foam Ball And then Tennis trainer Excellent See how far you get with the partner you re working with This uses communication and cooperation Say that Communication and cooperation Excellent This is how it would look Zachary what piece of equipment would you like for us to use Or you think you re ready The The foam ball Or the balloon What did you say The end one The end He said he wanted to use the tennis trainer W for Wilson it s the brand I said Oh you know what Zachary I don t feel like I m ready for this one Can we go back to a foam ball first And he said yes I m all phew thank you We just had communication and cooperation I know that I can practice with this one for a little longer I ll probably be ready for the challenge Alright ready go Are you able to keep your paddles low Keeping that balloon or that piece of equipment nice and controlled Are you using an underhand strike Alright ready Zachary Bounce strike bounce strike let it bounce one time Bounce strike bounce strike good Bounce strike bounce strike bounce strike bounce strike Now I m going to give you a challenge so I can go around the room and see if anyone needs help You ll just work on tap ups you can use any equipment that you need okay Tap ups or tap downs If you and your partner need a little help you can always raise your hand and I can come over Try to review those cues with you Underhand strike Okay bounce strike bounce strike bounce strike Okay say that bounce strike Okay and if it s not working then you and your partner need to say We need to go back to the Be responsible try it again though Bounce strike bounce strike Ooh this is where Aiyah did she step with her opposite foot Did you step when you strike No so it s key to step when you strike You gotta step Try it again Keeping those paddles low If you and your partner have to move off of your self space a lot that s a reflection you should say Ooh we A need help or B let s go to a different level Responsible word I hear Which piece of equipment are you going to have the most success with And freeze Equipment should be back on our rackets Now I see students at all different levels So that shares with me that we have some very responsible learners in the class which is excellent But now we re gonna see if you can switch it up a bit and give yourself a challenge You should be able to work with anybody So what I m gonna have you do is let s see here Ellie Ellie is gonna step over here come jogging down all the way down to where Zachary is Yay Ellie Ellie is gonna slide down one and that s gonna make everyone in this row slide down to a new partner Where you going Very good Zachary And then you go one down yep there you go Now wave to your new partner Excellent Same thing here Harrison come on down And slide on down Wave to your new partner Now you all of a sudden have to have more communication because you don t know where this partner is at Ready Go Talk which one are you gonna do 
 Yeah I have a question It says how does the Skip predictions Move on Yeah Olympic athletes how does your data compare to Olympic athletes How does your data compare to the class average Yeah Do we do the predictions It does help to have somebody look at it with you Sometimes it s not as obvious as you think Scott we re going to stay on task right Good We re not doing predictions right No So take a look at patterns What you want to do for this question is look at patterns Do you see any patterns there Okay good It s not necessarily worse by the way It s definitely different It s worse Skye if you re like dead If we re talking about heart rate and yours is worse So we still have a little bit to learn how that affects you if you are inactive or not So let s look at the pattern there You see that That s kind of what I was thinking You just missed that one Again one of the things we can talk about then is data collection Exactly Come on let s go It s not the same numbers It s the same pattern Right Good Any patterns that you guys are seeing back there Yeah A little bit What might that be This is science be more specific Are there any patterns for number four You guys skipped it It s okay Yeah Four You don t have to do predictions You compare to athletes Don t do it for predictions but do it for your class data and athletes Okay Now that s a perfect simple question Now we take that information and put it into number six Hopefully you re going to make the mental jump that we need here What does heart rate have to do with homeostasis If we challenged our body with a little bit of exercise you know how heart rates work now the question is why How does that keep us alive There you go Good How much more time do we need Did you get this one right If you guys did then you understand the process hands down congratulations Make sure you share your answers Make it quick I don t want people in and out We good How about a drink Here you go We got it It s good No I ve got it covered okay Two more minutes remain in your seats Number six there you go You re good Good job Scott You re very subtle and very helpful Thank you Remember we ve got a mic that s on there All right got two more Thirty more seconds right Then you re back in your own seats If you can do six you re the best Ten seconds or so Get in your own seats for the next ten seconds Two things are going to happen we re going to start off with simple answers then we re going build upon them and then hopefully we ll get to the more creative ones at the end This class we have enough time to do that So let s do that right off the bat Question one Daryl can you read it or would you prefer to have somebody else read it I can read it Okay Good What is the hypothesis being tested Okay So let s talk about it In our experiment we were looking to get something measured What is a valid hypothesis for this experiment Scott we ve got and then Alicia Alicia let s go How does exercise affect your heart rate Good Now that s a step in the right direction The hypothesis has got to include the concept Alicia and anybody in her group want to help her out it s got to include the concept of homeostasis So can we do that Can we tale a look at our aim a look at our model hypothesis how does exercise affect heart rate That s a good start Anybody else have something else different that would support our understanding of homeostasis You re yawning You okay All right Let s sit up Thank you Little bit more Good Good Like you re playing third base okay Matt Good Let s sit back now There you go Got it Anybody else Go ahead If we do exercise then our heart rate will change Okay So that s kind of what Alicia said Go ahead It should keep going up and then when you re not it goes down Again a great great hypothesis if we were at a third or fourth grade level that s something we want to do But we re not at third or fourth grade It s a tenth grade class here I want you to get out of your seventh grade minds and add this concept of regulation You want to try How does homeostasis affect your heart rate How does homeostasis affect your heart rate Think about that okay You want to reword that Which causes which Oh how does your heart rate affect homeostasis Good But now we ve got to remember We combined exercise in this Kevin How does your heart rate change to meet the needs of your muscles and cells in the body You didn t use the word homeostasis but How does your heart change to meet the needs of your cells and your heart in your body Excellent I don t need you to write that I just need you to understand that s the direction we re going You want to try now I had almost the same thing I put Heart rate changing throughout exercise to the needs of homeostasis Homeostasis Now you guys are closer on it So this is about how does your body adapt itself even when stress with exercise to maintain balance to maintain homeostasis In the beginning of this unit you guys remember I had the balance board up here How many of you got on it I forget One person Two people That s it Three people Do you remember how hard that was to do Did we throw things at the people Yeah Was that easier or harder to stay balanced when that was happening Harder No I thought it was like easier What s the room for error How easy is it for one of the sides to touch or how not easy is it It s very easy Same with homeostasis That margin of error we re in a small range here If I take your temperature Dustin and it s healthy Not healthy Okay 98 6 No But what if you re 102 What if you re that tell you You want to try So 98 6 is normal But what if somebody takes your temperature and you re at 100 degrees or It s not normal You want to give me a word for that Sick You would be sick You d have a fever Something would be wrong with you You would be not normal right Good That s a small number 98 6 and if you have 101 you ve got to see a doctor or something You ve got to get rest You ve got to get medicine You ve got to do something to help your body heal All right Number one done Number two and three Daryl you did a good job reading the first one Richie can I ask you to read the second one Sure What are the controls in the experiment Okay So controls another word for controls anybody real quick Independent variables No Not at all Constants Things that don t change So above the word controls can you guys write the word constants Things that stay the same So Savannah good good opportunity for you to learn okay So when we say controls we re talking about the exact opposite of a variable which is a thing that changes Everything stays the same or constant What are some the examples of the constants that you have in this experiment the controls Go ahead The three categories The three categories We mentioned everybody in the same three categories Okay Go ahead The amount of time you re giving us And how much time was that Do you remember Two minutes Two minutes two minutes two minutes The amount of time was the same The temperature Temperature in the Stairway Good Because if you were going to talk about your own temperature actually that changes Again that s a whole other topic about homeostasis that when we exercise we start sweating right So you re talking about the temperature in the exact place Okay Anybody else Go ahead Where we exercise and then the height of the stairs like if one stair was higher than the other then it would be harder Right All the steps are the same Now here s a control one kid said in my last class and the other kids disagreed with him He said the exercise was the control that we all did the same thing No Do you remember what we did We walked the stairs Did we all walk the stairs the same way No Well some of you kids hustled right Like two minutes you were like bunnies like gerbils on the stairway You were just going crazy Others were just walking and it was okay Good Let s move on Three independent and dependent variables That would be helpful Thank you for your hand up We only need one answer of the two and somebody else will give the other one So dependent or independent whatever you want Heart rate is the dependent variable upstairs Okay one second One second So tell me a little bit more though Daryl Is it heart rate and how do we measure the heart rate Take a look at your graph Your dependent variable is going to be very well described on your graph Help me out Go ahead Okay You re looking at it Somebody want to help him out What is the dependent variable of this He s close but he s not close enough to be right Savannah Number of heart beats per minute Per minute You had to have the per minute on that okay That s the standard that we use in science Independent variable Kelsey would you like to try I m not sure I know it Okay That s okay What did we introduce in this experiment to affect our heart rate to see if we could stay balanced Exercise Bingo So your independent variable Exercise Exercise Two minutes of exercise is what we did Very good Your back group you have another one or it s all up here Okay Four how does your data compare to the Olympic athletes How does your personal data compare to the class Now remember we re scientists So you just can t say It went up and then it went down or whatever You can say that but it s got to be justified with some sort of specific numbers Richie had his hand up first okay Justine Okay Go ahead My heart rate predictions were very low because I didn t have any idea and then my actual heart rate was higher than the Olympic athletes because they re used to running a lot Okay Here s a good example of what I m talking about First of all what you did with predictions is great We didn t actually have to even do that one for this question but that s great Richie when you say they were higher what do you mean Your resting rate was higher Your post exercise rate was higher Your recovery rate was higher All of them Okay You ve got to include them in your answer You have to include that in your answer You ve got to be specific Go ahead Matt Margaret you re next okay Yeah Go ahead My prediction I had low numbers but after doing the experiment only one of my numbers was lower than the Olympic athletes Okay So again what was that one number Post exercise Post exercise was lower Wow That s rare by the way Did you see the class data compared to you then We weren t supposed to do the prediction but I m getting so many hits here How many of you to a look at your prediction compared to other people Quite a few people You guys when you were doing this you asked me What s the normal range And I didn t tell you I wonder what you would say your prediction is after I gave you a range I purposely didn t just to let you see just like you said Mine was off because I didn t know any better Good All right Five super important question here oh I m so sorry does anyone else want to contribute to the Olympic athletes I m so sorry Go ahead My actual heart rate was higher than the Olympic athletes but for the exercise one it was only seven heart beats lower Okay So what does that mean to you How close to an Olympic athlete are you is what I m asking I guess it could be exercise Like with the Olympic athletes I know it wouldn t be like anything for them For me to be like that far off is kind of like impressive Right And how would you know that Didn t you say you had like a cousin who Does crew Does crew at the Olympic level or just does crew She does crew at an Olympic level Wow a premiere athlete then Fantastic What s crew Crew is when you row a shell or row a boat There s singles doubles and quads Oh yeah Fantastic Anybody else before we move on Christina and then Scott I noticed that we re just like like I realized we re all like the same because when the Olympic athletes went up class average went up and ours went up so I noticed it was the same pattern just like depending on what we were doing it was different than the Olympics and all that stuff That s the big picture I want everybody to see here Take a look at your graphs one more time Do you agree with what Christina just said Forget about your prediction number Did you see that there s a pattern here No matter who you are as an individual in this class or as a class average or as Olympic athletes when we exposed our body to exercise what happened in all cases It went up So we would say it increased Okay What happened when we rested post exercise Yes It decreased It decreased Right So there is a general pattern Excellent job Christina Go ahead Scott Make it quick I had the same thing as her Okay Good All right Key question if we can answer six we ve got this lesson down pat When muscles are active cells use nutrients and oxygen at a higher rate and produce waste chemicals and heat more rapidly What does heart rate how does heart rate demonstrate regulation homeostasis in the body I ve got three hands up I didn t see the order I m sorry So I m going to go four or five hands up I got one maybe two I don t know Gabby three go ahead Richie if someone leaves something out it s yours When you re exercising like you re using more nutrients and oxygen so the blood has to carry more nutrients at a faster rate so your muscles get it It does that to maintain homeostasis So it s like using it constantly Okay Daryl She did a good job I m going to change the question for you What if your body didn t do that What if you re running up and down the stairs Daryl and your heart rate didn t increase It would have a hard time maintaining homeostasis Okay Excellent And what would happen What do you think You d be dehydrated and wouldn t sweat or anything Well I don t know if you d be dehydrated You wouldn t get as much oxygen because it wouldn t be working as fast and you wouldn t be like So it might get stuck in there while you re running up and down 
 All right so we re going to need someone from all the groups to kind of summarize for us Grace Guys raise your hands So I figured okay you guys should All right I need everybody on the floor and you two groups sit right here okay Everybody s on the floor criss cross applesauce in five Five four three two and one Okay I need you to stay where you are and just turn around and I ll just have the people come talk to me and they ll talk to you all right We re going to start with let s see We re going to start with group one all right People from group one raise your hand Okay Will you girls come up and tell me what you guys talked about And I m going to listen Our question was select three characteristics that you think is most important for school and tell why So we had our score card and it said stuff So then the first one we did was my manners because if you re nice that means that you re polite and then you get more friends All right Next Following directions because you won t have good behavior and you won t do good on a test if you don t follow directions and you don t do like your study guide or study then you won t do good on a test And our last one is behavior in class is because behavior is sort of like not listening because then you probably won t listen if you re just doing like All right Thank you Now tell us everybody we re doing this and everybody can answer So how do you think that relates to a job Behavior Yes If you have good behavior then you ll get somebody to hire you because you can work good If you have good behavior most likely you ll get hired because you Anybody else Nobody else Yes ma am Um it s sort of like what they said but if you have good behavior when you re working your job you won t get fired Okay You won t get fired And you know good behavior is one of those things such as coming to work on time okay If there s nobody there to work your position then your teammates have to pick up the work or the work doesn t get done Okay group two let s see Lauren go ahead come up and read your question and answer please What is a non traditional career for a male and a female And um Go ahead We wrote for a male a fashion and a nail designer That s right And then for a female a pilot and a car designer Good good Can someone thank you Can someone give me some more ideas about some things let s see I m going to call I m looking at colors I m going to pick somebody with this color on And you can take your jacket off and I m still going to call your color if it s your color red Give me a job that you think might be a non traditional career One for a woman What did you I mean you can use the video as an example You want to think about it Construction worker A construction worker as a woman My color s red Yes sir For a woman or a male It could be for a male or female Or you can it doesn t even matter Skyler For a girl maybe a football coach For a female definitely a football coach If you guys watch Glee you see the football coach is a male a female And so yeah But now Sakwan we re going to go with you last and then I m going to go to group three Um for a male probably a teacher A male as a teacher Exactly So let s have Grace not Grace Alex Alex Mallory Mallory do you have a V under your name Yes You re from group three So let s let me read yours and you guys answer You can stay there Let me read it and you guys answer So group three was using what you have learned about non traditional careers what would you say to someone when they say that a boy can t do a job or a girl can t And I will just let you guys read I would say that it doesn t matter if you re a male or a female as long as you like your job and you can do your job well Nobody can tell you that you can t do something just because you re a boy or a girl Good Does anybody disagree with that one No Does anybody agree with that statement Okay All right Sakwan come up do you guys are going to do number four and we re going to move to the next activity Our question is what plans do we have for being successful in schoolwork We wrote do your homework follow directions paying attention being respectful good grades and not shouting loud And the oh yeah And don t have some like yelling or like stealing things like Report cards Yeah but no Yes Well we did a couple like Writing is a little challenging Reading easy some books Okay So they went with the idea of you know not too easy not too hard Good Thank you Now what we re going to do now is we re going to do some research on non traditional careers Now some of you will be where the purple papers are Some of you will be where the white ones are And it s just so that you guys will be able to talk about this later and say okay this is what I experienced on a policy job and this is what I experienced on the other one So everybody point your attention to the front and I m going to go through one of the worksheets with you I m going to go through the harder worksheet with you okay Just point your attention to the front And I m going to go through this one with you because this one is the hardest one and then all the other ones are the easier ones Okay the worksheet that we re going to do today is going to tie in what you guys talked about with careers subjects When do you all get report cards We got it yesterday You got them yesterday What I want you to do is I want you to think about your report card your favorite subject whether it be English math science social studies whether it be PE art whatever it is and I want you to pick from this site You see this site It says www bls gov k12 okay I want you to pick from that site your what subject you did the best in or what your best interest is There are some of you I know somebody here likes nature They will pick nature and in that job if it s a boy he s going to pick a job that he thinks mostly females have Who thinks they can give me an idea of what job mostly females have Molly Maybe a veterinarian A veterinarian Most veterinarians I ve seen have been female So I would go there And if I was a boy I would read through this sheet On this sheet it has some questions It says how to get ready You ll find that tab and you ll give me a summary of how they get ready for this job It says what is this job like You read that and you ll give me a one or two sentence summary of what the job is like And it says are there other jobs like this That s to the bottom And you can write those jobs down Another one says what about the future And you ll write a one or two minute summary of that section Also we have some reflection questions at the bottom of this worksheet and the reflection question is one is what did I learn about careers The other one is what s a non traditional career and the last one is what did I learn about myself So make sure you answer all those questions in the worksheet Now if I was a girl and I went to nature what job do you think I would pick Alea What job do you think most boys have that s over here for nature Zookeeper Maybe a zookeeper So the object of this is to do research in the area that you find most interesting Is this what I have to be when I grow up Mr Nealy No You just have to do research in that area So the big important part is to have research done in that area just so that you can explore different jobs And I think was it group three that had that question Yeah Group four that had the question about what would you tell somebody Who had that question Us Group three had that question and I think you guys gave a pretty convincing argument Okay I m going to tell you who s going to sit at the purple stations If you re sitting at a purple station you re going to click yes you want sound And your worksheet is already there And I want us to compare and contrast the different information you get from the two worksheets Okay purple station Skyler go to a purple station Mr Y 
 Clipart Okay You show me well if we wanted to insert a Clipart picture where do you think would be the best place to go Click on insert And then where is Clipart Here you go And I bet you we re going to find some really cool spider pictures Click on spi type in spiders and see what you come up with Hold on I ll be right over Yes Wow look at all those spiders You have tons Oh your project s gonna be neat cause you have all kinds of neat pictures Um I think something in our computer is off Okay Let s turn this off These computers sometimes get a little fussy and it s making bad choices When I get em I just keep pressing enter Well it s sort of like hitting an elevator button But you can t really make it go any faster but you feel a little better about click click click click click So go ahead and look over here Hopefully that will come up a little faster Sometimes it just is a little slow Start with there you go You know what to do Okay there s a big picture That s a huge picture That s a neat spider I think that ll be a neat one for your for your project Yeah Okay Um well when we when we clicked on the uh and it asked if we wanna include pictures from all the ones before Yeah We did want to do that We did And we clicked no Okay So that s probably why Okay So let s go onto Clipart office online and you re going to be able to find some really neat pictures here too This is the same thing Type in squirrel Let s see what we find Make sure you spell it correctly Q U I R R E It s a hard word I R R E And then the color Can I put S Doesn t matter Hit scroll or anything Okay And see what you can find Look at all those squirrels You should pick that one a moving one Yeah Okay So you copy it to your clipboard Now here s the problem You need to accept the service agreement and you ll have to do it again Yes Okay Now click on your scroll and add it to your clipboard Three times I I know Did you copy it to the clipboard Did you click on it Okay Then go back to PowerPoint Let s see if it works Uh You know how to copy and paste things so go ahead and paste it in there Yay He ll move but not right now When you go to make him a little bigger though I would say Make him fat Now you can check to see how he s doing If you wanna go to your slideshow and from the beginning and see if he ll move for you There he goes Yay See Now you know he worked Yay Good job We are entertaining using second person stories Last time we were together we started a story here today called Aliens in the Library You saw that I put my name up here on the line and it says Aliens in the Library The introduction page is the part where I underlined those you s Did you notice how these you s are underlined over and over again The reason is because we don t typically write like this This is kind of unfamiliar for us We had fun making the beginning of this story We only wrote half of the story using this graphic organizer Do we remember why we only wrote half of the story Why did we only write this side of the story Because that was like the one story Right There are two main things that you can choose from If you look up here at the board everybody should be looking up here you can see that there are two choices for each one You have your introduction and you have your two choices We only did this half of the story so right now we re going to hide the other half because we re not even thinking about it yet So the story was that you re in the library you hear a noise like what did we say rats in a blender And so you go out to investigate what the story was Now that s the coolest part about this project guys The reason we are making our own stories rather than me grabbing the book from a shelf and copying it on here is because we want to use information in our own way What s that called when you take someone else s information and put it on a piece of paper What s that called Who can remember what that s called What s that called Copyright infringement Copyright infringement or there s another big p word too that we talked about That s a tough one do you remember what that one is Plagiarism Plagiarism And if you take a story of someone else s and stick it on there it s a problem And so when you have a story in your mind you want to make sure that it is your story and your story alone The best way for me to describe this is right now for reading team we designed our own t shirts for a t shirt contest Maybe your t shirt isn t the winning entry and the team doesn t make your shirt on their shirt But you go to the competition and another team from another school district has your shirt design on the front of it How would you feel about that How would you feel if someone took your idea and walked around with your shirt on Your idea that you came up with your in your own brain How would that make you feel Kind of angry It would make me feel angry How about you Sad Sad is another really good word for it I would be furious if we used our exciting words for our writing But I would also be really disappointed Maybe kind of flattered that someone liked my idea so much they put it on their own shirt but it s the same thing Is it wrong to steal someone s bicycle Yes You think it s wrong Why is it wrong to steal someone s bicycle Because that was just like stealing You steal without even asking Right And that would hurt someone s feelings and it s illegal Is it wrong to steal someone s pencil Is it wrong to steal someone s pencil Is it wrong to steal someone s pencil Why is wrong to steal someone s pencil Because it s their property Because it s their property and it s not yours So stealing someone s ideas is the same idea So when you go to write your stories boys and girls and the reason we re writing our own stories is because we re making this our own We re making this our own design And I think that s really important for us to remember because the more that you use your own ideas the better it is for you You have all these ideas in your heads and I know you all have wonderful creativity so we re writing our own stories We re not taking the story of a TV show you saw last night like SpongeBob and you re not making a SpongeBob story I want this to be your own idea So we have Aliens in the Library and we have our half here You re a librarian you hear a strange noise it sounds like screeching rats in a blender what should you do We decided our two choices were open the door or hide under your desk If you open the door you see the cutest little alien standing in the doorway I think we had a majority of people here I don t know if everyone here likes the cutest little alien idea but this is our story and we re sticking with it It has a big pink bow in her hair antennae and a pink polka dot dress What do you do You could either invite her in or slam the door in fright You invite her in She surprisingly speaks your language She explains that her name is Lott and she became stranded when her spacecraft crashed She asks if she can come home with you What do you do You have two choices here You can either take her home or find another place for her to stay Lott is a great house guest she even helps with the dishes You re glad you decided to take a chance on making a new intergalactic friend You guys have seen this before We made this story and I m not going to go over this story again and again but I wanted to review with you what we talked about because over here I m going to show you what the final product is going to look like This is what the story is going to be made We did PowerPoint together You re familiar with PowerPoint We ve done dozens of PowerPoints by now at least And so on our screen here I m going to open up my document that I made while you were gone and it is what the PowerPoint is going to look like when you re finished It is a choose your own adventure PowerPoint And this is showing that you ve mastered the skill of being able to use PowerPoint You need to show me that you understand how to use this This is kind of like our I would say our final exam for PowerPoint so we know we can move onto the next thing or the next project the next exciting idea that we re going to do So while this is loading you re going to see that there are hyperlinks and we re going to work on those as well which will take you to different parts of your document So up here we have Aliens in the Library by Mrs Albright I chose pictures that are graphics from PowerPoint or from Clipart The reason I did that is because we own those I did not take them from the internet and drag them here What happens if you take them from the internet and drag them here They re someone else s ideas remember They re someone else s pictures Yes You have to put the date and you have the put the website We have to what do we call it Cite those But we re not even going to do the citation because this is more about the writing of the project So we re going to do that instead My Aliens in the Library I m going to show you the start of this and then you re going to go start writing your own story So here s my Aliens in the Library story Now the best one from this class the one that we find or two that we like the best we re going to put on my website so the younger students can access these from home which I think is a really great idea These are not going to be graphic or bloody You can have some things happen but you can t have guts falling out and eyeballs popping out of heads Okay Because this is for a young you have to remember your audience This is for first and second graders to use in the library when they come So we are not going to make a big bloody messy gory story Okay We re going to make cute little alien stories apparently This is what we made last time together All right You are a librarian You stay late one night working on your computer and you hear strange noises coming from the hallway It sounds like rats in a blender What should you do We chose to do open the door So when I click on the button that says open the door it should take me to that page Ta da You open a door and you see the cutest little alien standing in the doorway She has a big pink bow in her hair and antennae and a purple polka dot dress What do you do next We re going to invite her in If we invite her in she actually speaks your language She explains that her name is Lott and she became stranded on Earth when her spaceship crashed She asks if she can come home with you What do you do I want to see what you guys pick for this one Who wants to pick one Who wants to pick a direction What are we going to do take her home or find her another place to stay Find her another place Find her another place Let s see what we decided for that part of the story You hear her shuffle down the hallway You may have missed the chance of a lifetime to meet an alien but at least you are safe The end Now notice my ends always go back to the beginning So this is PowerPoint that you re familiar with used in a different way Are there any questions about what we did here Yes How do you get the green buttons That s what we re going to talk about and that s a new part of the skill that we re working on but right now we re going to just be making these I m handing out these You re going to be in your groups and we re going to start writing our stories After you re checked and over there you ll make your PowerPoints and I ll help you with your hyperlinks individually in your tables Does it I m sorry she s talking Does it have to be Aliens in the Library No no No no no That s a great question It can be anything you want Any kind of story that you re interested in As long as it is not Bloody or gory Bloody or gory or Violent Violent or what s the other thing that we just talked about Inappropriate Inappropriate or guts you guys are really stuck on the guts Copyright Copyrighted by somebody else I wanted to show you a couple other ones that you can choose when you come for book exchange One of them looks like this This is actually a non fiction choose your own adventure about George Washington crossing the Delaware and it s about you changing history which I think is a really neat idea If you re not much of a reader but you still wanted to read some books this one is very similar to actually what we re making here in PowerPoint It has graphics it s called a graphic novel and there are different pieces that look almost like comic books I have several of these also I have the newer versions of the old ones that I showed you and read out loud The ones from 1986 remember I told you how I liked them when I was a kid a few years ago This one just has new covers on it so if you re looking for those And then this last one this is a brand new series that I m hoping to get more on it s called The Golden Path and it s the same idea just different characters and a different set of authors that made those So if you re looking for a choose your own adventure story and you go to type it in the library catalog you can type in choose your own adventure The problem with that is you need to know how to spell adventure A D V E N T U R E That s exactly right Thanks I wasn t even expecting that The other thing to remember when we re keeping in mind I m going to be coming around to help you with your PowerPoints Remember we have to use that rubric that rubric Show me that you know what I m talking about Which rubric am I talking about Show me Show me your papers Yes This is the one that you need to do Also you can put that down This other one that I want you to remember the other thing to keep in mind is we color coded these and we numbered them The slides need to go in the order that you need it to be This is a review of PowerPoint so this shouldn t be anything new that you haven t seen before This is kind of our graduation project for PowerPoint so that we can move on to the next project next time So we re working with PowerPoint Who remembers how to insert a text box What were the directions We went over this before and we went over it a couple different times How do we insert a text box You go to insert you go over under the text box click on it and then you ll drag it and there it is There it is And how do you make it change color Does anyone remember how we make it change color How do we make it change color We re on insert and text box And make sure you make one down here Yep And then you can type in it and then you do what with it That s not wanting to cooperate is it That s okay Let s work on this one together If you click on text box you make the text box and you start typing in it Who remembers how we change the color of the text box That s what we re going to need to be able to do for our buttons and our hyperlinks that we talked about Who remembers You double click on the box and it will show up Right You double click on the box or sometimes even triple click until you get those three a s at the top then you can change your color I ll be around to help you Are there any questions about this right now Anyone have anything that they want to talk about before we get started Every slide has to have a picture What happens if you do not have a picture that you like from Clipart What do you do I want you I m encouraging you to use Clipart because it s something that s already there and we don t have to worry about where the source came from But what do we do if you want to find a different picture somewhere else What do we do Find your picture You can find your picture under Google images Then what do we do Then you copy it and then you put it back and then we copy the source You have to have the source Very good Very very good Okay If you would like to have a whole separate slide with sources you can do that And we ve done that before And the date And the date is very important I m glad that you remembered that Okay so I ll be around to help you go ahead and get started back again on your project Make sure the slides are in order Do you want to format your designs You go under design you two can agree on a color scheme Do you like that one That s good Let s look back at your thing Let me see which one was number two That was number three Click on number two And it should be exactly boys look at how you did that You put the words at the top now I did check the word vial on yours and it s spelled wrong V I A L Maybe my writing is hard to read And then you have the two text boxes here at the bottom If something gets stuck can I have you guys be the experts and go over and help them Sure Okay great Thanks Yes Can you help us Sure What s the problem We can get Well this one we want to get rid of Remember when you go to do the insert and you insert a new slide you want to make sure that the layout is the title only Remember how we talked about that one So you want to insert the text box You show me what do we do Right And then what do we do Okay so you drag it What are you typing in there Okay So you need how many text boxes then Exactly All right so you go ahead and type in there so you can show me you know what to do with that Can you click on it and then use typing Upstairs Okay now you want to how do we make sure you pull that up There you go Are you okay with all the pink I don t care Good Make sure everyone s input is added though Maybe he can help with the graphics Everyone needs to be able to do something We have to make sure this is fair for everybody You re working the mouse you re working the keyboard and he s holding the paper Let s maybe switch it up a little bit closer okay So everyone has a turn 
 Work of art in front of the class using the smart board We have to Continue working please We have to finish the whole thing today You should have enough time if y all aren t drawing on the artwork that much But y all been working hard and a little bit of playing but working pretty well After you get finished with the analysis go ahead and flip over and start on your interpretation What you think is going on or what the artist is trying to portray in the work of art All right so y all are on interpretation Yeah What do y all think of the work of art Kaitlin what do you think of the work of art Well it makes us feel like calm It made me feel calm It made y all feel calm No it made me feel calm It made me feel calm Okay Now have any of y all been out west Huh Out west like Colorado Wyoming places like that Yeah Yeah Well sometimes in the mountains they have places where the snow has melted and there are actually small lakes or ponds up inside the mountains So you could actually either be looking at a lake where you could drive up to or something that s hidden in the mountains So if you re calm that s a pretty good idea All right guys what are y all working on now We re on judging the building I keep working on one Okay Can you tell me what you have about interpretation I think of this art as a rainy day The sky is a dull gray I like the bright colors on the doors It s like a mixture of happiness and boredom Since it looks like it s raining the dark clouds at the top of the painting when it goes from white to dark Like from light and it s going to dark that s when you can tell it s about to rain Okay gotcha gotcha Sounds good That sir is my interpretation Okay and with judgment what are y all think about the work of art right now My judgment of the art is that it s kind of a boring day It s slightly dull but you don t know what s about to happen Sounds good so far Keep working Y all doing all right over here Yeah we re doing I wrote my opinion Now he s gonna write his opinion Yeah And then Brody will write his opinion Sounds great All right Y all on interpretation What y all had Oh y all are each doing interpretation Yes sir We were going to do that for judgment and interpretation Sounds great And what are y all looking at now for interpretation with the subway painting We re doing what it makes you feel Okay what do you have so far Well he wrote most of them Okay so he can read it Okay actually it makes me feel like traveling Okay since they re on a train And that s pretty much it All right Who would like to tell me what they are thinking of for interpretation on valley flowers I don t know I mean it s a good painting but it s not really my favorite Okay It s not very exciting So that would be for judgment You don t find it exciting Okay kind of boring What do you think of the work of art I think it s a bit dull because there s not really any colors or anything like that and it s got the same colors where each Right here is green and right here is orange and blues back there You know if I was using my imagination I would think of maybe The Incredibles in where the mole men came up at the end and were taking over the Earth So these could be tunnel boring machines Start using the principles of design okay So you look at the packet for the principles of design With the principles of design you gonna be telling me what you see in the work of art So instead of shapes you may be telling me what s something you see in your work of art You ve got Gold Is Where You Find It What s one thing you see in the work of art Gold You see gold what else do you see The miner Miner and what is the miner doing Drilling Drilling okay so those would be all stuff that you see in the work of art So go ahead and start on the second part with analysis if you re ready to start on that Alright are we doin alright here Yeah we don t get how was the work created Okay you may have actually answered that when you were up here If you look at the packet right here and the title of the work of art is The Sky Pond read the rest for me Who it was who created it Kauvar Kauvar yeah close enough Smith Smith Born Cape Ugh this is hard If you can t pronounce it just do the best you can Giradeau Missouri Missouri 1893 Died Denver Colorado 1977 Oil on canvas Uh What did you say Oil on canvas Is how it was created and it was about this size right here okay So that tells you how the work of art was created Later on you re gonna look at why the work of art was created and what purpose it served Yes What do I say how I know what we do It says if they draw it in three dimensional Okay And they take some kind of colored pencil or painting and then sketch it like you do and then they go from dark to light Yeah And then they make the texture from the sun is over here and there s a little bit of shade because this would be covering all this There would be a shade right here So it s over here it would be lighting everything on this side of the tree Yeah and this side of the house roof and that side of the house And you ve got are these shapes back here Or are those somethin else These are shapes Okay are shapes flat or three dimensional Three dimensional Shape forms are three dimensional alright Oh yeah Yeah So those are forms So those are forms yeah But you were right about everything You were right about the sun you were right about the texture the shading everything that s really good So you can tell a little about this on how you think the work was made and also relate it to playing with your pen on your finger and also oil on canvas Continue working please Alright so y all are on analysis now And what work of art do y all have Y all have got Subway Alright so what are y all lookin at in the Subway for analysis so far It s something asymmetrical balance It s asymmetrical balance Yeah There are three types You ve got symmetrical balance when everything is exactly the same you ve got asymmetrical balance when it s weighted the same So there s the same amount of weight visually It s not exactly the same And then you ve got radial symmetry which is a project we did a little bit earlier Okay Good So is it saying that shapes especially right here these shapes are more rounded versus straight and flat Cause these are more 3 D than these These kind of have shadows and are free So we were saying how that makes the consistence more complex than the simpleness of the outside factors I guess Yes mm hmm Good Keep going Alright Would this be water That is possibly water right there Yes it is And what part are y all on Y all are on the analysis right now Okay And y all are lookin at the Valley Farms by Rose Dickinson Okay cool So what do y all have so far for analysis Colors from the scene go together it can show Could you speak a little louder Sorry Colors from the scene go together It can show a straight web is going along the farm with the bridge in there A small fire is going on with smoke coming from the flames Smoke is coming from the mountains Sounds good keep going Alright let s check in over here How are y all doin Good Okay wow y all have got a lot for an analysis Alright what else do you have So y all are about ready to start on analysis Yes sir Okay so let s look here Now tell me how all the answers from the description you just made are related to each other i e how the effects were organized complement one another or create harmony or distress This step can often be the most confusing because it is very similar to the first and can easily overlap A good suggestion is think about all the principles of art movement rhythm variety portion emphasis and balance and contrast work together okay So think about how they work together to create this work of art and tell me everything you see in the work of art but not by shape and colors Alright The shapes and colors of the background create a texture that will What A texture What The The shapes and colors of the background create a texture that will Like he is actually drilling near a cave Creative Now would you say these warm colors or cool colors Warm Warm way warm Warm Now why would you say they re warm colors Cause they re darker They re darker Okay It shows that the colors of the background Yeah Now something else Does it look like he blends into the background No He doesn t Yeah uh huh Okay so think about that too If he stood out he would look like he maybe didn t belong but it kind of looks like he belongs there I like what you said keep working I ll be back in a minute to check on you Alright Guys Turn around Alright what are y all workin on now Analysis Analysis What do y all have for analysis so far Patrick I didn t get that I got one for variety and balances Okay so something is different from this picture Can you just read to me what you have so far please Something s different from this top picture because the floor is green beneath the room because it s different because I thought I thought the floor s just one color so that s why it s different Okay that s good and it s also different from up here You could say that there s a contrast Let s look for the definition of contrast in here Do you all know what the definition of contrast is or what contrast is Two things are very different from I was on balance I m on balance now Okay so contrast is what One more time I m sorry Two things that are very different and have a large contrast Okay so would you say cool colors and warm colors have a strong contrast Yeah because they re bright colors and they give out perspective What about the two Cs Okay two C s so Keep going Alright what part are y all on now Analysis And y all have got The Subway okay So can you read to me what you have or tell me something that you haven t added but you were about to Jaymen s adding that Okay I wanna add it has radial balance because you can kinda see where the center print is and then you can kind of see all these people all these stuff Okay now I have a question Have y all seen that there s a commercial on a few months ago It s a radio commercial Yeah The TV where she s sitting in the train and she s watching the TV someone s reading the newspaper and she s watching the TV And she steps out and it looks like they may have gotten the idea from that ad from this work of art cause there s lots of people on the train car they re reading newspapers and she steps into the future by actually reading her s on a Samsung Galaxy or something like that So that d be a good connection to popular culture okay Hello I was just Which one we were talkin about earlier Okay sounds good What s up Okay Alright what ya on Okay what added or what have y all gotten to since I was last over here We see the ocean behind the mountains green grass is covering the farmland and the lines on the mountains are curved not pointed The mountains are curved Okay The houses are spread apart the sky is a light green blue Sounds good and it sounds like y all are just about finished with analysis so are y all gonna be moving on to interpretation next Okay Yeah Active listening right hand Active listening left hand Ladies and gentlemen a lot of people are having really great and meaningful discussions in the groups but please remember that we are all doing different works of art studying them and we re also discussing them together So that everybody s able to work without yelling across can we take it down just a notch a little bit please Keep it a little bit lower I m not telling you to whisper and I m not telling you to stop what you re doing cause your doing a great job Just let us take it down a notch please Keep working please Alright how are y all doin over here We re doing really good Okay what can you tell me about your analysis on this work of art It said that for the first question well the first thing we said the artist Douglass Crockwell is using repetit well is repeating shapes and colors to create a visual image of the painting And right now we re writing how classes are organized And how it s saying what we introduced for description Okay now with Paper Workers Now let s look at the workers The workers do they look like they stand out from the industry and from the industrial aspects of this work of art No They kind of look like they blend in So could they actually be considered to be parts of the machinery Mhmm Okay so that s something you may wanna think about when you re working on analysis or when you switch over to interpretation in just a little bit Can you go touch the keyboard to bring the Smart Board back on please Alright what are y all workin on now I don t know You don t know okay You don t know what principles you ve covered or you don t know what aspect of the painting you re working on right now We re working on analysts and so far we ve covered how the miner and the vat ground relate to each other We covered what colors they have and how they can relate We re about to work on shapes Shapes are in there So let s think about texture some Yeah we are Look at the definitions okay And let s look at I wouldn t look at space or balance variety and you may wanna look at the definitions of proportion okay Okay we are completely totally and absolutely confused of analysis I m not You re just Analysis okay I m not I m completely finished She s going all haywire Okay what s wrong with analysis here I don t know Nothing Nothing s wrong with the analysis Nothing s wrong with analysis She s going haywire I do not understand what art is Active listening right hand please Active listening left hand Table four please Ladies and gentlemen when we stopped a moment ago because we had gotten too loud let s take it down to a whisper now That way everybody can hear themselves without getting too loud So right now let s take it to a whisper for our discussions please Alright with analysis what you re doing is you re looking at the principles of design Don t worry about balance Let s flip to the beginning Now let s look at texture Do you have a texture in here Yeah And what kind of texture do you have Well it s really bumpy but some of it is smoother like a snow Okay so that s what you could talk about in the analysis Also in the analysis with balance is it asymmetrical symmetrical or radial Now symmetrical is when things are the same on both sides Radial is when it s radiating out from a point like a rim or a pizza Is it either one of those So I d look a little bit at asymmetrical balance and then variety I look at the definition and then determine what variety you see in here and after that go ahead and move over to interpretation okay That way if you re being frustrated you don t have to get bogged down and worry about it you can move to the next step You might find that easier okay Keep going thanks Alright so y all are on interpretation now Yep Okay what are y all about to do for interpretation Can someone read me the interpretation part Basically how does the painting make you feel What does it make you think of Don t say you think a painting sucks artwork sucks That said that goes in the next step What do you think What do you think the artist is trying to communicate to you as a viewer Okay so let s bring the painting back over here so you can see it while you re working on the questions and think about telling me a story or what s going on Now does this look like you re in a cafeteria No Does it look like you re in a school Oh yeah No It looks like a barber shop Okay and what does it look like is going on in the barber shop He s shaving cutting someone s hair Now what about over here These guys are probably waiting for their turn Okay that s what you need to tell me in interpretation What all is going on or everything the artist had within the work of art that tells a story We re talking about the story that s created in the work of art Alright what part are y all on interpretation Yeah Okay so It kind of makes me feel like It makes me feel sad It was when I think of it before and it really doesn t make me feel sad I m not really sure how it makes me feel but I kind of think that maybe he was trying to say it went from cause this is kind of simple Okay And I keep going back to the simple and complex for some reason But I think he was trying to say that maybe things were simpler and it kind of got more modern I like that I like that And also one thing that this makes me think of is earlier this year we studied the artist Jacob Lawrence and one of his was a work of art of a guy on a train controlling that with only industry in the background With the big cog or wheel here it kind of looks like a train over here with industry in the background But I like what you re saying about the calmer times and the more difficult times and I think that would be a great thing to have in your interpretation It doesn t look like a train though Yeah Alright how are y all doing Y all doin alright Hey what part are y all workin on now Y all got Valley Farm Yeah Yeah Interpretation Okay what do y all have so far for interpretation This painting makes us feel bright but kind of boring The smoke from the mountains make us wonder who is making it We also wonder Why is there a fire with nobody there Okay sounds good Ah can you put your stool back up on two legs One more time Thanks Alright what are y all on right now Analysis and y all have moved on to interpretation Mhmm Sounds good Active listening right hand Active listening left hand Right in here we have about seven minutes left This should give enough time for most everybody to finish their interpretation and start on their judgment today After you get finished with your interpretation one thing I would like you to focus on is why you think the work of art was created Think about the time period in which it was created and why the artists were creating works of art Think about your work of art particularly and you ll be able to have a space on your paper to answer that so continue working on what you re working on We have about seven minutes Next time you come in what we re gonna be doing is we re gonna be working on presenting So those groups that have enjoyed this will be able to look at the Smithsonian packet find their information add that to what they ve been doing today and then present on their findings regarding what they thought about the work of art along with what the historians thought about 
 Just take it in but take your tube off first Before you pull it out before you pull the needle out take your vacutainer tube off and this is Pull it out again Yeah Use your two by two remember Oh yeah There you go Good job Faye And guys it just takes a while This is not something you re going to learn overnight This is a skill that it takes a little while to learn You ve got to get hand movements down you ve got to figure out what works best for you You know if you need things placed in a different position But after this you all can start sticking the arms when you re not doing your book work Then whenever you feel like you got all your hand movements down you feel like you re proficient then I ll watch you which I ll watch you doing then you all will stick me So what do you think Cassie Hmm What do you think Is it easier than you thought or harder than you thought Easier Yay Faye Those arms are a little harder to get Those veins are not as easy to feel as That s okay She s doing a fine job Two by two Sorry You to draw blood from them Pop your tourniquet Engage your safety Good job From down there Yeah They say not to use these and you can use hand veins but remember first choice second choice last choice and then hand veins If you re going to do hand veins you all have been through a lot of the book work already if you re going to use hand veins what kind of needle are you going to use Butterfly Butterfly Okay I know you all have seen them use butterfly in the clinic You guys will actually rotate through the clinic lab We ll do it at Dr Maderis clinic so that you all can get more sticks there Is there some people who draw only from around here Not usually Now there are some people they ll come in and they ll say You can t get blood from anywhere from me except here What that one lady told you is right here right I m better at popping it out Remember I couldn t get it in Good It will be something that after you get these hand movements down it ll just happen Because when I m not talking while I m doing it I mean it just flows Because I have done it for several years but for some reason after you get older it s hard to talk and do something at the same time That s what we re going to do today is you all are going to learn how to draw blood You re going to learn how to actually stick the fake arms that we have or the phlebotomy learning aids is actually what they re called And each one of you have gotten to a certain point in either phlebotomy or medical assisting where you re ready to start drawing blood And I know that Wanda has gotten a little further but it never hurts to refresh on the procedures because guys when you get out there in the clinical area a lot of people don t follow a lot of the steps that you need to do as far as blood draws Guys that are medical assisting you are not going to have to do as many venipunctures and the phlebotomy students but you may be responsible for drawing blood in a doctor s office When you re there in the doctor s office it s just you and the person So you quickly develop really good phlebotomy skills because if you don t get it then you have to send them to outpatient hospital to be able to get that blood drawn The first things I want to talk about is your vein choice And I printed off your veins And the median cubital is your vein of choice and the median cubital runs right here in the middle You can see this one better Yeah you see that one better Your median cubital runs right in the middle and then your basilic is the one you want to stay away from That s the one that runs little finger side And then your cephalic is on the thumb side So this little finger side toward the inside of the elbow is the one you really want to stay away from And the reason that this is your last choice vein is there s quite a few nerves that are right underneath it So if you go too deep or you move the needle around too much you can actually cause nerve damage And I will leave this on the table as y all are practicing with your phlebotomy arms so that you can look at your vein choice Nerve damage is a very real possibility and some nerve damage is permanent so be very careful when you re choosing your vein You can only advance or withdraw the needle only You cannot go sideways I know those of you who s already been in the clinical site you ve seen them go sideways you ve seen them come out and go back in And guys that could be a liability for you and you re the only one that can protect your patient and you I ve got the materials set up Whenever we repeat this you all will set your materials up so take notice of what we ve got here because you ll need this every time you practice on the phlebotomy arms When you go to clean your arm you re going to clean in a circular motion So I m going to go ahead and get started First thing you re going to do I don t need your gloves just the two hands First thing you re going to do is put on your gloves I just washed my hands but I m going to put on my gloves And why do I want to do that Jim So I don t get infected Yeah I don t want to come into contact with someone s blood Now who could protect me from coming into contact with someone s blood Yourself I m the only one that can do that And I can tell you from having my blood drawn people have drawn my blood without gloves on though they didn t know me from Adam And one person in particular got quite a bit of my blood on them So I am the only one that can protect me If I see you practicing without your gloves on it is an automatic grade ding for that practice day If I see you drawing in the clinical area without gloves on then we re going to have a big talk okay Because you ve got to protect you I have a question With some people that you draw blood on do you have to wear a mask Like an eyeshield type thing If they are on precautions then yes you would And you ve seen at the hospital on the doors where they have contact and respiratory isolation If you were to go into one of those rooms yes you would In the ER when you draw blood you usually have on that splash mask Now usually with a venipuncture you re not going to have that much pressure It s not going to shoot the blood back out at you like an arterial would but still it s better to err on the side of safety But also if there s nothing wrong with me except I need a CBC to have a surgery and you come at me with a mask and a shield I m going to think Oh my gosh Why is she doing that You know So make sure that it s appropriate If you re in a trauma area then yes definitely If you re in an outpatient clinic unless that patient tells you My veins squirt blood really bad A patient will tell you One time I was doing a finger stick and it squirted and I had on my glasses but I turned my head It hit me in the hair So sometimes the venous flow will do that Good question Cathy All right so got my gloves on first I m going to do is I m going to put the tourniquet on And guys the tourniquet can be kind of tricky the first time or two you do it And you re going to put it underneath the arm You need to make sure it s tight so your vein will pop up but not so tight you re going to cut off the blood flow and not so tight you re going to cause petechiae which is little red patches on the arm I m going to cross my hands over What I do is I put my left hand in position I take my right hand get ahold of the tail of this pull it and then I stick it underneath with my little finger You always want your tails up toward the top so they re not in your area where you re going to clean and draw When I m going to clean well let me show you how to feel first Well it s not going to cooperate today You can use my arm That way they can see better Can you move the Sharps container I m going to stick it underneath there And now it should stay on there Now to locate a vein I m going to take my index finger and I m going to feel back and forth And guys you all can do this on each other Jim s excellent to feel veins on and he s a real good volunteer Bounce back and forth It feels like a gummy worm or something soft underneath there If it feels really hard like I have one that I ll let you all feel that is very sclerotic or hard you re not going to get blood out of it It s got to be it s got to bounce So when you go across and you find it then you re going to find which way it travels So you re going to go up it and down it so you know which way to put your needle in Some veins will go off to the side and some remain very straight So I found my vein Now the tourniquet can only stay on for one minute Has my tourniquet been on about a minute Probably so so I need to take the tourniquet off give this patient s arm a rest and then I can talk to them about the weather I can go ahead and line up my tubes at that time and then I m ready to draw blood now So I come in here I put my tourniquet on and guys when you put this tourniquet on you got to be ready to go because you only have one minute And I m going to clean I m going to clean in a circular motion and then if you re having trouble with the alcohol you re not able to fan it you can t blow on it and you can take one very clean 2 by 2 go straight down dry it off and then many of you already did that This part of the needle this part with the rubber on it has the needle on it You screw that in take the end off this is a safety needle You anchor and then you stick in the bevel of the needle that is the pointy part the bevel goes up and then the pointy part goes into the skin I pull my thumb away as I m going in I take one of these Vacutainer tubes thank you Jim and I push it in And guys when I push in with my thumb I m pulling back with my fingers And you re not able to see but there is and I don t do this in the clinical side but there is blood coming in there You let it fill until it stops Now it s stopped flowing I m going to wrap my fingers around it and push because the more still you keep the needle the less it s going to hurt the patient Pop my tourniquet and I m going to take a different 2 by 2 than what I cleaned with Fold it lay it on the arm and guys I m just going to kind of hover there until I bring the needle out and push down If I push down while the needle is in the arm it hurts really bad And I m going to hold here and I m going to hold until it quits bleeding And you can peek Now if the blood oh sticky needle engaged It s hard to talk and do stuff at the same time isn t it Sharps And you toss that in the sharps Now if this patient is on blood thinners I ve got to hold longer A lot of clinics will just put a 2 by 2 or a cotton ball on there put a CoBand on them and send them on their way If they bleed out outside of the lab you re liable And again you re the only one that can protect you So I make sure that they ve stopped bleeding And now how hard is that going to be when there is a lobby full You guys have been observing Can we ask them to hold it Well you can But what if they don t hold it tight enough What if there s a whole lobby full Jim what have you seen them do in the past and check Yeah You need to check it If there s a whole lobby full sitting out there then you ll get to them when you get to them because you ve got to protect your phlebotomy certificate You re the only that can do that A lot of places they will put a 2 by 2 or a cotton ball on there tell the patient to hold their arm up That breaks platelets that s going to make a huge bruise and it doesn t really help with the clotting that much just kind of bruises So we re going to look here Okay this patient has quit bleeding so I am good to go here Now another lesson I will teach you about writing on the vials the blood draw vials and what information needs to be on there So before you all draw let me ask you a few questions What s your first choice vein Median Median Okay And why do we avoid the basilic Nicole Nerves and tendons Nerves Okay What can happen if I powder on the shirt What can happen if I dig around in there and I do injure somebody What can they do They can bleed or they can have their nerve damage Right And they can come and say This phlebotomist drew here And then guys if you re ever in a setting where you have to go to court they re going to call somebody that s a phlebotomist like you are and they re going to ask them What s your first choice vein And they re going to say The median and they re going to say What s your next choice What s your last choice So you re going to have somebody there that knows You really don t want to draw from that one unless it is your last choice Okay what can happen if the patient s on blood thinners Cassie what s the most important thing to remember about the patient that s on blood thinners To keep pressure To keep pressure Okay How do you clean your site Martika In a circular outward motion Circular you don t ever go back over And how long do you leave the tourniquet on Faye One minute One minute Good job Okay You all get your First thing you do is what Gloves Get your gloves on So you all are going to draw With drawing blood are you supposed to record where you drew at and everything just like a nurse is supposed to I would if I were you because that just protects you So you can write median You can write an MC median cubital and that way you may actually you could put it on where you put your initials where you draw And that way they know that you drew from the median That you didn t draw from basilic I need another needle Okay Anybody else need another needle Thank you You re welcome I m going to send tourniquets home with you all and you can practice on everybody Feel their veins feel all the different types of veins Some people have garden hoses is what I call them Some people have very large veins And feel for your vein The tourniquet pinched my thumb The gloves are hard to you trading them out It s this arm Jim I think because I had trouble getting it When I was doing it too Okay Just make it a little tighter with your Oh Did you stick yourself Mm mm Okay I screwed the wrong part I think she s bleeding and I haven t even done anything yet Oh yeah hand me another one There it goes again Okay Casey Let me see what I can do for you Good job Martika Want to just chill how s the weather blah blah blah blah Is it not come undone now You might want to pull your tail just pull it in there with one of the smaller tails It ll stay down Okay It s moving again You re kidding See Okay Just keep going Okay Just keep going It s easier on a person That s my stomach Jim It s hungry Sorry Yeah this one Jim knows which ones stay better Okay you got to anchor your vein with your non dominant with your non dominant hand you anchor your vein I have to stand I can t see you take your thumb and you pull down here Anchor your vein There you go Casey are you left handed too Mm mm I thought you said non dominant hand Non dominant hand to anchor Back it out Put it in this hand Are you right handed Mm hmm Put non dominant hand thumb there anchor Okay Now did you clean it Yep Okay Then go in Uh oh It s okay It s okay Well that s okay Put that on Start over A lot of this is hand movement A lot of this is prac 
 I think we need the policeman because he s the only one with a weapon He s the only one with a weapon though What if he goes crazy He s the only one with a gun Exactly that s a good thing though Wait a sec why is that a good thing Are you saying he d shoot us I didn t say it s a good thing if someone could shoot us No I didn t say that You said it s a good thing Explain why you think it s a good thing It s a good thing because we could stock the food Drake OK so he said two things But he might shoot us because we might be starving and he might start to shoot us We could take him he wouldn t shoot us Where you at Riley it looks like you re sweating I m trying to think between you two So you write down what you said you d do and you worry about everybody here Who do you think is the most important Eileen says the policeman does everybody agree with that or not Yeah Why Because if someone gets hurt He can respond to medical stuff yeah they re First Responders It s a good idea Anybody else Can you write down reasons why you should keep somebody Would anybody that you know that works here already That s good he s too old his life would be long So the old sir will be able to be productive to society Think about that Anything else about the male professor that you maybe thought about in support of communism Do you want that in your society or not No Why not Because Okay so freedoms are important to you Mr Malls Yes ma am Send Kyle to the office for a minute please He s in Miss Crane s room right now What core are y all in Because I told Mr Wayward where he was supposed to be and he said he was with you Uh he we re actually in 2nd he s with Miss Crane All right thank you OK you can resume Folks we re about I don t know Hey why should we keep the male professor What s the issue you have OK now this is just a question guys If someone s not fit does that mean they have no potential to be helpful to society Nah they could be really smart OK they could be really smart But she s nine She s nine She s nine so are you looking for right now or are you looking for the long run We re talking about the long run The long run so you got time So just consider all aspects just because maybe just because she has does she have anything to offer Let the group decide it sounds like some people are really for and some maybe are against it If you want a male farmer say aye Aye If you want the male professional say aye Aye If you want the female scientist say aye Aye If you want the male preacher say aye Aye Definitely female nurse We already have a nurse We already have a nurse Who cares I do In case he dies But the female med student s only in second year she hasn t even been to the hospital It might go for four years Exactly We got the scientist and the nurse to help her Plus she d be off breeding Excuse me No offence You know we only got like thirty minutes We only have fifteen so Hey we re about 5 or 10 more minutes and then I m gonna stop you in groups and you ll listen If you have not managed to already make your decisions here s the key point here s the key point Still got a group talking you need to listen About five or ten more minutes you need to come down to your five you need to have the reasons why you chose the five and we re gonna share those and reasons why you did not choose the five you didn t choose Keep in mind Edna keep in mind that five are going with you to start this new civilization that s gonna hopefully flourish and I hope you re all taking people with uh that you know will make it But there s also you gotta keep in mind there s five people you re leaving behind that most likely is not gonna make it But you you re concentrating on who you need to start this new productive society OK OK start closing up in the next five or ten minutes about who you re choosing who you re not choosing Those radiation levels are getting high very high Over here especially I know really I kinda changed my mind about that Because she s cute You can t change times and down I m agreeing with that Say aye again if you want Aye Finally They wanna take cripple girl and I m saying He s still overruled I posed this question just a minute ago So this is so we can look at mass So we can look at it two ways one you re looking at She can t do anything she s gonna be hard to keep because someone will have to do it second way of looking at it she And she doesn t have her doctor Uh is that true Once she had a doctor OK and then what else Have you ever heard anything about Yup So what if this person could be maybe a scientist or a It didn t say that But again you re not saying that she is you can combine that OK continue on You need to start choosing maybe 3 or 4 of your 5 And why you re gonna take or why you re not gonna take em OK male professor too old He s too old Five minutes I m giving you five minutes Start making decisions But why do we need a policeman if we got a lot of money Hey I wanna share some of the tips that some of you were talking about And one person said well she has the potential to become any of these things here she has the potential to be any of those so it might something to consider We need extra little kids and she won t help us with no extra little kids Somebody s ready to go just about so you need to make sure you get your five choices 
 Okay guys I see we ll be looking at investigating fraction multiplication Okay so can you read the objective with me please So I I will be able to do fraction multiplication Okay I ve also put it in Spanish just in case that helps you Okay so the first thing I want to discuss with you today is what do you think about that Do you agree or disagree And then why So one half does one half equal one half Why or why not And then give me some examples Okay Raul It s becuase it is one half They re the same Okay Abraham It s like you cut a pear in half it s gonna be in equal parts Okay so you guys are saying it s equal Yes Okay What do you think Eddie believes he thinks the same thing Taleah what do you think I think it s the same You think it s the same Does everyone think it s the same I do Until you think why wouldn t it be the same Okay so Jose is saying why wouldn t they be the same Okay so one thing Jose says is he s trying to think of are there any examples why it wouldn t be the same Joe It s not the same because No that s just the board point Is there a times Nope it s just one over two equals one over two I was thinking it was a half times a half Okay so sounds to me like you guys all agree that it s the same Right Yeah So now how do you explain to me why you think it s the same Why you think it s the same Joe Because they have equal parts Okay Equal parts What do you mean by equal parts They have the same fraction Okay Jose They re both practically the same thing What do you mean by practically the same thing That once you cut a square in half you have equal parts and they re gonna be the same thing Okay Who is someone we haven t heard from Madeline what do you think So I heard you say they are the same right Yeah So why do you think they are the same Cause they re both equal parts and the same cause half equals a half Okay Antonio what do you think Think it s the same So sounds like we re all thinking it s the same okay Abraham what do you think I think they equal the same thing Equals the same thing Okay so now let s take a look at maybe cause it sounds like we re all on the same path here So let s take a look at something else Are they really the same Is that half of a Cookie Cookie Half of a cookie Half a Pizza Are they the same No Yes One at a time cause I m hearing a lot of good stuff but you guys are all saying it at the same time Okay Miguel They re the same cause if they weren t the same is just half So I m hearing they re the same but one s bigger than the other one cause one s a pizza and one s a cookie Yeah Tina you re kind of shaking your head What do you think about that I think they re both the same cause they re still one half they are just different size Victoria what do you think Same or not the same Same cause it s still half Okay so let me ask you this I m hearing a couple things and it s kind of contradicting itself Meaning you re saying one thing but you re also saying the opposite Like I heard it s the same because it s one half but it s different because it s Different sizes different sizes You just told me it s the same but now you re telling me it s different sizes They are both fattening Oh cookies and pizza are both fattening Okay Felice Why I think they re still the same is because a half is a half no matter whether it s big or small because it s still chopped in half Okay So if a half of a half so would you rather have half of 10 or half of 100 Half of a 100 Why Because it s bigger Because it s bigger But I thought it was the same No No cause it s the same thing It s still half but you re commenting half of a hundred It has to be the same thing Like the pizza a whole pizza and you cut it in half Okay you say it has to be the same thing for what to happen For it to be half For it to be half But here it s not the same thing You re saying to me that it is equal So which is it So now you re saying you don t think they re the same No You get more pieces than a cookie They re still the same They re still half Okay so who still agrees that the one half equals one half Raise your hand Okay Alright now who says that one half maybe sometimes doesn t equal one half Okay So we got a couple Alright So Delphina what s your thinking I haven t heard from you What s your thinking I think it depends on what you are looking at So in case you didn t hear her Delphina said it depends okay Hear what she said It depends on what you re looking at Cause she said with the money example that you guys well all of you unanimously chose half of a hundred that s 50 as opposed to 5 half of 10 So it does matter So now we just go back to the question does one half equal one half Okay Raul I think one half equals one half I think it s still the same It s not talking about how big it is it s just talking about a half But it didn t say in the question what it was I think the question is supposed to say what it was to say if it s the same or not Okay so what Dallas is saying what Dallas is saying that it needs to tell you what one half is Cause she s saying here the previous question just had the number one over two one over two Equal Alright here she s saying well all of a sudden yeah the numbers are gone but you have half of a pizza and a half of a cookie So now it s not the same But it s the same question What Dallas is saying in the question it should tell you what is it It s actually like 10 fives five tenths and and one half So what do you think What s your final thought as far as one half equals one half What s your final thought They re still the same it s a half It s still the same because it s half Okay It s the same and different It s the same and different Miguel and they tell you it s different Okay so good question Good question I like the look of that Yes If they are are they the same They re the same it s one half or something One is bigger than the other one Okay Rodrigo What about you bud What s your thoughts on this I m still thinking You re still thinking Or are you still will you compete I m still basically undecided Okay You think they re basically the same So you added that basically Why don t you just put they re the same Why did you put basically Because one s bigger than the other It will obviously still be different Where we re going with this is you have to understand that it depends on what your unit is Your whole unit Okay Alright So that s why sometimes you have to be careful what it s asking you to do Okay Let s go on to the next one Okay so what does one half look like to you So just think right now in your head when you think of one half okay What do you see Half a dollar Half of a dollar Half a fifty Half a fifty Half a gallon of juice Half a gallon of juice Half a body Half of a body Half of a cake Half of a cake Okay Guadalupe what do you see Half a paper Half a paper okay So let me take it to the next step So what if we said the half a paper times half of a juice Does it make sense No Does it make sense No It doesn t make sense So we have to make sure that we know what You have to make sense Well it makes sense but how is it gonna make sense It s what If they re the same If they re the same But what s the same The object The object or the whole unit right Like what is it we re talking about We talking about pizza We talking about cookies Paper Paper Juice People People Eggs Alright so the other thing I wanna talk to you about is does multiplication always make things larger Bigger Yes No So I heard yes yes yes and then No So now then what Cause sometimes it makes it smaller If you do nine times one it s gonna be nine and if you do nine times zero it makes it zero Jessie Did you hear her example No Okay so what she said was cause it s important I want you to make sure you understood She said that no because nine times one is nine Then when you go nine times zero it s zero So it actually made it less right What do you think though When you multiply in general when you multiply does it make things larger When you multiply two things together Yes Okay Abraham It gets bigger because like six times two it s 12 and it gets bigger Okay Raul what do you think Raul V When you multiply does it always get bigger It depends on the number What It depends on the number It depends on the number so give me an example Zero times 8100 is gonna be zero Okay So can we so I m hearing kind of like a lot of you are saying yes it makes it larger But there s still like some of you who are like saying maybe not always Like if we go back to if we go back to that one half if we go back to that one half and that dollar Gino what s 100 times one half Times one half is a hundred and a half A hundred and a half 50 50 I got 150 150 Taylor do you agree One hundred times one half is 150 Raul B 500 Five hundred How d you get five hundred I thought it was half of a thousand A hundred though No more thousand one hundred One hundred times one half Is it 110 Half of 10 is five Half of 10 is five So what is your answer The one hundred times one half Five hundred Five hundred Okay so one hundred times one half is five hundred Tina We don t know because we don t know what one half equals Okay so Tina s saying now you don t know what the one half is What if we re just talking about numbers One hundred times one half what would that be One hundred times one half Let s say it s money A hundred dollars times one half It could be five or 50 If we re talking about 100 then it s gonna be one half of 100 is 35 Okay so 45 there was a lot of people talking so you couldn t hear but Louis is saying it depends but if you re talking about money if it was hundred dollars times one half it d be half of 100 which is 50 Let s take that example One hundred times one half is 50 So then when we multiply that did it get larger No Yeah It got smaller Didn t it You start with a hundred and you multiply and you got 50 which is less So what do you think now Do you think it always makes things bigger No Sometimes it makes it smaller So let s can you give me another example then That s just make sure we prove it Is there another example you can give me that makes it smaller then Like five times four Five times four We start with five times four you get what 20 It s a bigger number Okay so that s if you multiply it times a half right Ten times one half Ten times one half would be Five Raise your hand if you think it doesn t always make it bigger It depends on what you multiply it by Alright Very good So we re gonna use the area model to show one half times one half That s a whole One half times one half Abraham says it s a whole but let s go ahead and let s take a look I m gonna go ahead and shade in one half okay And then we ll take a look to see what it actually equals Here s a half There s a half How many squares are shaded both colors One Two One out of how many total Four One fourth So one half times one half is one fourth Is one fourth smaller than one half Yes That s another proof that when you multiply it doesn t always get bigger You could make it into money Like one fourth is 25 cents Alright very good A hundred divided by So let s take a look at another example If we re to use an area models for this what would that look like Three fourth It d be one half right We d see one half times one fourth So what do you think Half of a fourth One eighth Half of a fourth which is one eighth he said One half of one fourth is one eighth do you agree Yeah Okay 
 These colors What color is this Yellow oh my gosh did you find a lot of leaves that match this color No You forgot to do it Well let s do it right now Alright go ahead and put it there What other ones are yellow Mmm That s a yellow one Is that yellow Okay put it right there Let s see If we put these two together do they match in color no No so you might not want to put that one in Okay wow So put it here you ve already given it a check So now what I want you to do by looking at the sheet I want you to sort by size What does size mean If something is bigger If something is bigger or smaller Now which measurement which size are you going to sort by Big or little Big Okay so all your big leaves put them in the middle Okay You decide how you want to sort them So if you want to use both baggies that s okay If you want to just use one that s okay too Okay that s okay that s okay too I noticed that you haven t started sorting yet So which one do you want to sort by Or do you want to make up your own I like to do this Yeah color Color Okay so ok what color are you going to choose I m gonna choose brown Jennifer is that ok You have to ask your partner Sort by brown So put all the leaves that match the brown in your work space Ok let s see what s going on over here Ok well let me see this Let me see that please Ok we are going to work with partners I know sometimes it can be hard to work with partners because you re trying to make a choice and maybe one person wants to do one thing and maybe one person wants to do another so we re gonna work together to figure this out Well let s get working She s laughing How do you want to sort your leaves now Let s get our workspace in the middle I notice you already sorted by color so now how do you want to sort By shape Ask your partner if that s ok Ask your partner if that s ok Ok is this the shape you want to sort by Oh this is pretty tricky See if you have any more leaves that match this shape How can you describe this shape How can you describe that shape So you re going to look for ones that have little points So you re actually sorting by points Yes am I hearing that right So look at your leaves and look for ones that have teeny tiny points Look at your leaves so look at your leaves here Ones that have teeny tiny points It has points its very tiny Does it have points No no side points Yes does it have some side points Do you think that belongs here Oh really I loved how you used your magnifying glass to find those little details Keep on looking through yours Jennifer because I have a feeling that you are going to find some more Take a look at these points and take a look at these points You re sorting by points right Are those little points or big points Little or big Little Are they little like this Are you sure So you think this belongs here Okay Don t worry about your name for right now I ve noticed that you ve sorted by every way Now are you ready for the challenge Can you make up your own way to sort Something that we didn t talk about on Friday Oh I bet you could Yeah well let s think a little bit more Now I want you to look very very closely at these leaves What s something that s the same about some of them That s the question that you should be asking yourself What s the same about some of these leaves They have dots Really they have dots Remember we had colors up here Andrew just said something Some of these had dots Do you see dots on some of your leaves Yes do you think that s a good way to sort So wow see I thought you said you couldn t figure out another way So I want you to put all of the leaves with dots on your workspace Okay how are we sorting here That s okay The way you re doing it is perfect All you need to shoot for is to keep count of what you ve done so far So let me come to you I ve noticed that you had sorted by color so far Which one is next which one would you like to do next Okay which one do you want to do It s up to you Do you want to sort by big leaves Is that okay Monica Okay so look at your leaves and sort by size Now find all of your leaves that are big Uh oh does this one belong there Does this one belong there Okay wow Amazing I like how you re really looking at your leaves Absolutely that one s very big nice job I really love how children stopped working They put their hands up Friends can I share something that I noticed Is that okay When I was walking around I noticed children using their eyes and sometimes their hands to explore their leaves Some of you figured out new ways to sort your leaves And I can t wait for those kids to share their ways Some of you went ahead and you looked at what we talked about on Friday Which was also a really great way to use a resource in our room to help us sort I just want to remind everybody that your job right now is not to touch your leaves Your job right now is not to touch your leaves Your leaves are down Because it s important for scientists to stop what they re doing and share what they have noticed Let s take a peek This is a graph does anybody recognize this graph Does it look like something we already do What is it raise your hand if you want to share It kind of looks like you use something it s something we do every almost every day Brian Um the calendar Yes And what in our calendar sweetheart looks like that The weather Oh I love how you re thinking Absolutely right our weather calendar looks like this Today friends we re going to share how you sorted And then I m going to go ahead I m going to color in boxes and then at the end we re gonna see What was the most popular way to sort What was maybe not the most popular way and if anyone had a different way to sort Okay So just give me a thumbs up if you sorted by size Look at your sheet look at your sheet And give me a thumbs up if you sorted by size today Let s see And actually I m only going to ask one partner to put their thumb up Because I m only counting partners So one group two groups three groups four groups five groups six seven eight groups nine groups ten groups eleven groups twelve groups Uh oh Do I have enough spaces No Oh my gosh I ll have to add them Eleven twelve so there were twelve groups There s thirteen that wanted that sorted by this kind Mrs you forgot mine Okay anybody sort by shape today Anybody sort by shape today Okay keep your thumbs up One two okay One two three four five six seven eight nine ten Wow ten groups sorted by shape Mrs you keep forgetting mine Mrs you keep forgetting mine Okay friends before we continue going on with that did you sort by another way today Did you sort by another way that wasn t something we talked about on Friday Emma did you sort by a different way today Oh sorry you re two Joel and Emma I ll come to you What s another way you sorted Okay did someone sort by a completely different way that s not on your chart Andrew Dots Dots did anybody sort by dots today Yeah okay What s another way you sorted your leaves Catherine Counting the points Okay now that was a way that we sorted on our sheet but that s okay How s it different So you were looking for nine points okay So friends there s so many different ways you can sort and I just want you to put your hands down Because there s so many different ways you can sort and there s many more ways than just what we practiced today As scientists and mathematicians we re gonna continue sorting and looking for similarities things that are the same things and things that are different Give yourself a pat on the back Thank you so much friends for doing your best job today 
 Guys ready Yes Okay number one start give your idea Read the word give your idea of the definition Okay what s your word Soldier okay and okay you re gonna give your idea What s your idea of soldier

Okay But before you check over what you need to make sure you do All of it Get it completed right Okay awesome So your goal would be to Get homework completed Wonderful Okay Excellent Okay Now I brought some extra markers and stuff here because I know you re a visual learner that you do a good job remembering things that you figured out on your learning styles test So this is for you to do You can choose any colors to make it look however you want Okay So you ve got your goal and then we need to figure out why is that goal important So your goal is to Get all homework done Excellent And why is that important Because when you re in fourth grade you don t get all your homework done and you on fence and when you get on the fence I ve been there a couple of times and is not very fun and for the good achievement you get to go to Hot Wheels hmm So if you don t do your homework You re on a boring fence Okay You have to stand by the fence at recess And if you do do your homework you go to Hotshots Homework Hotshots And that is What do you have to do to qualify for Homework Hotshots Do all your homework for all the Oh Wow So All your homework throughout the nine weeks and then you get to go get to be a Homework Hotshot which means you go to Hot Wheels and enjoy the day skating Excellent Okay So you just brought up a good point umm So this goal is important because not only do you not want to stand by the fence and you want to be a Homework Hero What s going to happen if you do your homework You go to Hot Wheels You go to Hot Wheels and what do you think What effect is that going to have on your report card here If you re doing all your homework what s going to happen to those grades You get all the grades go up like the 100 200 That s right Very good All right So go ahead write that down Why you think homework is important Excellent So this goal is important because you can always get good grades and homework is a way that teachers help the students reinforce the things that they are learning in class So that s an excellent way to get good grades Okay So we know our goal and we know why it s important So let s think about what kind of rewards we re going to get for reaching that goal You get achievement awards You go in a limo with the principal And you go out to eat and Hot Wheels too right So those are some long term goals over the next nine weeks You get to complete your homework the next nine weeks You get to go to Hot Wheels and might even be on the principal s honor roll to take the limo ride Pretty cool huh Okay So that s here We ve got Don t forget one thing that you get to drink soda while you re going You do I didn t know that I ve never been in there I ve never been in the limo but I heard Oh my goodness Well that certainly is a nice incentive something to motivate huh Good So that s kind of a long term motivation We ve got to work hard all these nine weeks to accomplish that right Okay So we ve got here When I meet my goal for the quarter Quarter is another way of saying the nine week time period you will what What do you get to do if you do all your homework over the nine weeks I will go in a limo Well that s for principal s honor roll which is definitely an option What s specific for homework umm When I meet my goal for the quarter I will go to Hot Wheels Go to Hot Wheels Awesome Excellent So the nine weeks sometimes it can feel like long way away can t it Okay Because nine weeks is not easy They are not easy to do your homework Because it s a long time before you go to Hot Wheels and we only have eighteen weeks in school So it s easier sometimes to stay motivated and work towards a goal if you have some incentives that come on more of a short term basis Meaning that instead of waiting all nine weeks to go to Hot Wheels which you will get to do if you meet your goal Let s think of something that we can do maybe once a week That would be a good incentive for you Study Okay Well studying is part of your homework plan Let s say that you study and you turn all your you do all your homework and at the end of the week when I check in with you when I check in with Miss Butler and I check in with your granny and I d say So how did Annamarie do Did she get all her homework done mm hmm And they say Yes she did What do you think might be something that you re willing to work towards here at school that would be a reward once a week I will come to you and I will help you You d like to help me All right So could we agree that let s say I check in on Fridays with your teacher and your granny and you to find out did she do her homework What are they going to tell me Yes Yes And then on Fridays you get to come and help me mm hmm That d be wonderful Now I teach a first grade class every day at 12 10 I know you do a really good job helping out at home with your niece But she I do not get to see her Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday But on Friday I do Because my mom My mom watches her And sometimes when my sister and I and the baby s not here we actually look at photos of her because we really miss her and we talk to her on phone Awesome She s lucky to have an aunty like you Awesome Well I know because you do such a good job caring for her that you d be an excellent helper for me and my first graders Will that be a good goal for you Okay So our next section here Can you read this When I meet my goal for the week I will get to go to go to Hot Wheels I think Well Hot Wheels is for the whole nine weeks But each week Remember our What we re working towards on Friday that you get to come Help you Right So you get to come help Miss Charles on Fridays Okay You have very nice handwriting Thank you Okay So do you Thanks Okay So this goal is something that you re in charge of right You re in control of achieving this goal But you re not in it alone Because there s of a lot of people who want to see you reach that goal and to see you doing an awesome job at school So who are some of the people the adults in your life who are on your team who can be helpers for you as you reach this goal My grandma my aunty my uncle my mom and my sister Wonderful You have a lot of people So these are people at home that can help you reach your goal all right So let s go ahead and put those down for supporters at home Awesome All right So you ve got a lot of people supporting you at home I ve got five And how about here at school Who s on your team Miss Butler and Miss Charles You ve got it girl I can t wait to support you on this goal Okay So the people who can help me at school is Miss Charles Is it okay if I put in Miss Ficker my assistance teacher because she helps too Definitely That s a great person to add And so are you Thank you Okay I just realized something What s that All these teachers name has a R in it Miss Charles Miss Butler Miss Ficker It s a good attention to detail you have there Okay So we know that our goal is to get all my homework completed Okay And it s important because you can always get good grades Excellent Now on the short term if you re doing a great job getting your homework done every week Each week you will get to come help come help Miss Charles on Friday Excellent And I will know that you re doing a great job because you can ask Miss Butler my grandma and me That s right Okay And over the whole nine weeks when you do a good job getting all that homework done what s your reward I get to go to Hot Wheels Awesome And then although you re the one in charge of this goal there s a lot of people on your team Who are those people on your team from home My Mama my granny my sister my Uncle TJ and my aunty People on you re side All right And then when you re here at school who s on your team Miss Charles Miss Butler Miss Ficker Awesome All right So what do you think How s the school going to go It s going to be great because I will follow all of these Good and I m here to help okay All right Well I think the first step towards achieving this goal is to make sure that we manage our time really well And I know we talked a little bit before about kind of your month We looked at the month of February and figured out what big things you have coming up What portions of the day you spend here at school or at Church and what you do how you help out taking care of your niece So that s the month of February So what we re going to do today is really focus on this week and make a plan So what I ve done here is based on the information you told me before we ve got this week starting with today Monday February 7th and you will notice I ve the time of day all the way from 6 in the morning throughout the day till Yeah 10 at night So I have these spaces blocked off So what are you usually doing Monday Wednesday Friday from 7 to 4 Come to school You re at school right So this whole area Is school Is school That s right You re here at school Will you write school Sure Sometimes it s easy for me if I just draw a line

Keep your hands to yourself Hands are still Okay so let s do our checklist We said eyes watching Let me see those beautiful eyes I don t see Layla s I need you to turn your body Very good Next ears listening Does everyone have their ears listening Next lips are Closed Unless I call on you just like I did with all of our helpers hands are Still Still So Catherine I ll tie that shoe in just a minute You put your hands still in your lap Perfect And our feet are Quiet Oh I love it Are we ready to view our video Yes Perfect Okay I want to be sure you can see before we begin because we re going to turn out our lights All right what do we want to find out I want you to watch for what type of weather you see What are we watching for What type of weather Weather And what tools are the children using to observe that weather So the second thing we need to watch for Tools Listen and watch for the tools And have we had an experience like that So let me see those beautiful eyes Let me see them Face forward Lights helper Where s my lights helper Claire Claire would you mind turning out our lights Okay Do we know what we re listening Yeah and watching for Okay Eyes forward I m going to be seeing who s doing their job Ready The wind is blowing my hair but then it s very strong today We decided to blow bubbles They re blowing away That s Oliver blowing bubbles too Oh Amy s bubble just blew away It was so windy the wind is making the bubbles The wind s pushing out the bubbles and then the bubble comes out We didn t even do anything All we did is hold up the bubble wand Whoa You can t see the wind but you can see what it s doing That looks like fun What are they doing My dad gave us some old sheets to tear up so we could make some streamers Is he having fun That s Oliver and the streamer just went in his face What are they doing Let s see what they re doing Let s watch I was pretending the streamers were the hair of this pig because the little knot is really shaped like a head and the rest of the stick is their body And if they have branches growing on them that s to me their hands and their legs or something All right It was very short Well did you enjoy that Yeah I want to see that again Good Go turn on our lights Again Now Oh we might watch it again later So let me see if you were listening and viewing our video I m going to check by answering these questions Now if you know the answer what are you going to do Raise your hand Raise your hand What weather did you see Let me see someone I haven t heard from Emily what type of weather did we see Blowing It was blowing what Bubbles Wind Wind Blowing wind What tools were the children using to observe the weather Bubbles Bubbles And what did they do They ripped the paper They ripped them and they put them on the stick Have we had a similar experience Yeah Yeah for the bubbles Yeah let me see who s let me see who I haven t heard from Clara what did we do We blowed bubbles We blew bubbles Did we have to go like this No Did we have to do that No What happened when we put it in the bubble solution and put it up What happened The wind blew it The bubbles blowed out All right So now we re going to do a think Pair share I want you to turn to your partner that you talked to yesterday Okay I want you to share how you observed the wind We had a lot of windy weather yesterday Talk to your partner about where you observed the wind Emily she ll be right back You be thinking Jacob what did you see yesterday Wind How did you see it What did it blow The trees It blew the bubbles the other day Collin what did you see Perfect I like that You used the tools we made in school Marcus Are you back All right we just got through watching our video talking about our wind observations Now I want you to tell me what effective speakers do I m going to call on some people I haven t heard from yet Marshall tell me one thing an effective speaker does Speaks slowly Speaks slowly All right let s see what else effective speakers do They keep their eyes on the audience Eyes on the audience just like mine are on you right now Bronwen show that you re listening Raven Show your work I want to see that beautiful work Who else has read Who can tell me another one Who have I not heard from today Who have I not heard from today You haven t Wesley Wesley what else should a good speaker do Volume up Huh Volume up Volume up We want to hear what you have to say All right Clara tell me something else Be still All right Oh you need to stand still Should you sway back and forth when you re presenting your work No No Okay Have we covered it all Yes Let s see Let s remind ourselves Look at your Audience Speak Slowly Stand Still Volume Up Show your Work Okay Now remember don t hold up your thumbs up sign until I ask if that person did these jobs My first speaker is Holland Holland will you please come up Okay Okay go ahead I can see the wind blow a horse s Huh Horse s what Tail Okay Did Holland look at the audience when she presented her work Yes What do you think Good Hold up those thumbs up signs We want to give her good feedback Put your thumbs up sign down Thank you Holland My next speaker is Alice Alice Thank you for choosing a safe path Come on Good All right Let s watch our speaker Remember I can see the wind blow grass All right Did Alice speak slowly Yes Thumbs up sign Awesome Put your thumbs up sign down My next speaker Yes Fran What do you want Wesley please come up Cathy just look through your window I know we re close today I can see the wind blow the roofs Did Wesley stand still Yes Yes Good job All right Thumbs up sign if he yeah if he stood still Good Our next speaker Sofia Sofia come up Okay let s start out like this Loudly I can see the wind blow Did Sofia have her volume up Yeah She did a much better job Let s give her those thumbs up signs Good job Oh I don t see everyone s Thank you Adam Good Thumbs up sign down Matthew Bashir I can Oh hold on Are your friends listening to you Let me see if you re remembering if your eyes are watching and your ears are listening Christopher we want to see you look at the speaker Turn your body this way please Thank you I can see the wind blow kites Very good Show your work Oh they ve already got those thumbs up signs Friends do you believe that he showed his work Is he showing everyone Good Why thank you Matthew What does that say Hmm Why is the What is that His kite is in the shape of a Star Star Isn t that beautiful I love those details Catherine your turn I can Oh hold on one second I m sorry to interrupt Eyes forward Eyes forward Good job I can see the wind blow my star I can see the wind blow leaves She wrote two sentences Show your work Very good Did Catherine look at her audience when she presented her work Yes Good Thumbs up signs Christopher Romley Emily we want to see your eyes up here Thank you Aiden Aiden All right Aiden we re going to do a quick check May I please have this It s okay Accidents do happen I just didn t want you to get hurt What get hurt Because you re holding it we want to be safe with our materials Criss cross Very good Aiden I love the details in your picture I can see the wind blow Down down the tree Show your work Nice Oh thumbs up signs He spoke very slowly 
 So who can tell me in this group who can remind me what is our objective What are we discovering today in science I d like to see a lot of volunteers Lindsey We re seeing what soil holds water better and We re seeing which soil holds water better What s the term for that Holds water Chris It s absorbing the water What s absorbing the water The clay and the sand absorb the water Very good So we re trying to figure out which absorbs more water Clay or sand today Very good Who can tell me what was the first step that you did in this project Cameron First we poured in the sand What did you pour the sand into We poured it into a funnel Okay What s that thing on the funnel It s a coffee filter It s a coffee filter Why do we need a coffee filter on the funnel Because when it s on the funnel it makes it so that the sand doesn t run through the funnel Okay All right What s the second step Can somebody tell me what the second step is Cameron said you dump the soil sample whether it was clay or sand into your funnel What s the second step Caleb The second second step is to pour in the water The second step was to pour in the water Who can tell me what the third step is What s the third step Chris You record how long it took for it to drip every last drop into the cup of water What s it The water The water Good You re recording how long it took for all of the water what s that word called What did that water do to get from here to the surface to the bottom of the cup Cameron It drained It drained Very good What are you measuring in Are you measuring in seconds Are you measuring in minutes In hours Lindsey Measuring in minutes with the seconds You re measuring in minutes with seconds Okay Can you tell me how long your clay is up to for draining out the water Two minutes and a half Two and a half minutes Good Can you tell me Cameron how long it took for your water to drain through your sand It took 28 seconds Twenty eight seconds Good job Keep up the good work I really like all the diagrams that I m seeing Lindsey you did an excellent job at paying very close attention and following the steps in step by step order You can give yourself a point for science Good job Ladies can you tell me did your sand hold water Yes It did hold water How did you know that Because it absorbs some of the water I poured it in here and it had into the water so the sand holds 11 milliliters of water Good So you re saying that the sand held 11 milliliters of water You said that when you poured the water in through the sand then you dumped something in this graduated cylinder What did you dump in this graduated cylinder We dumped all the water that was in there What s there In the cup So you dumped all the water that was in the cup after what What did the water do in order to get in the cup It drained through the funnel through the sand down into the cup So it drained through the funnel through the sand down into the cup So then you took your water and you poured it in your graduated cylinder Luana you said you did 40 minus 29 to get 11 milliliters Why did you do 40 minus 29 Because that s how you find out how much the sand is holding That s how you find out how much the sand is holding How did you know to start with 40 Because we poured 40 milliliters of water in the cup to start Oh To start you poured 40 milliliters of water in You took the water that you had to start and took away the amount that was left which you got 11 milliliters Very good Excellent Gentlemen what are you noticing about sand and water We re noticing about the sand this time it took us two minutes and eight seconds for it to stop dripping We started out with 40 milliliters and What did you do with that 40 milliliters of water We poured it into the strainer to drain it down into the cup and when we poured into the cylinder we had 28 and a half milliliters Very good How do you figure out how much water is in the sand What subtraction sentence would you do Forty minus 30 So you re rounding up You said you had to 30 Yes That s a very good choice You re going to do 40 minus 30 so that tells you how much water is in the sand which is One 10 Ten what Milliliters Ten milliliters Very good Do you think some of that water s still in the funnel Because this funnel is still dry This funnel feels wet Do you think some of that 10 milliliters of water is in this not funnel in this filter Yes Do you think so Why do you think that Because it s soaked and some of the water might have stopped in there because it was so thick and sandy And now it s a little bit thinner Keep up the great work Sam and Madison what are you noticing about water with your sand and water with your clay The sand drains the water faster than the clay The sand drains the water faster than the clay Have you figured out yet which one holds more water Clay The clay holds more water If you were a gardener and if you were planting a garden what would you rather garden with Would you rather garden with sand or would you rather garden with clay Sand Why s that Because it drains water better and the drainage would get to the plants faster Okay So the drainage would get to the plants faster Where do the plants need the water Roots At the roots What do you think Madison I would do a mixture of sand clay and humus because mixed together it s loamy and loamy soil is good for the plants Great observation That s wonderful So you said you d mix all of them together because that would make a loamy mixture which would allow the gardeners to get the best soil for the plants to grow Very good Nice job What are you three noticing about water and sand and water and clay Water and sand it can absorb through the sand the water And through the clay it soaks and at four minutes You re almost at four minutes for your clay Wow What do you think this shows you about what happens on a rainy day whether it s outside in our soccer field Or what happens on a rainy day in your backyard Does anybody want to tell me what happens The clay it gets very muddy because the water is pouring down on it It might make a puddle because some of the soil on the ground can t hold itself so it might make a puddle Good So Matthew when you poured your water into your clay did you have a puddle at the top of your clay Yeah we had a puddle at the top of our clay because it was leaking little drops and it stayed on top of the clay We had to wait a long time till we could pour more water What stayed for a long time on top of the clay The water did because it didn t have small particle sizes so it was hard for the water to get through Oh so the clay has small particle sizes so it s hard for the water to get through Wow Good job What does that mean about the particle size for the sand It means that the particle for sand is bigger and it has more space for the water to drain through Good Excellent Did any of you draw diagrams of what your experiment set up looked like What it looked like I think you have a diagram on the previous page Did you draw a diagram Yes Okay What did your diagram show My diagram for sand shows that the water is going right through the funnel and it s pouring to the bottom And for my clay it s little drops because the clay is stuck together once it has water Good I can easily tell in your diagram which one s sand and which one s clay One suggestion that I can make to you though is I would like a few more labels If I were to never see this experiment before how would I know that this is sand and that this is clay So if you could label those for me and tell me what these drops are I don t know if they re water or or milk If you could do a little bit more labelling for me that would be excellent Good job Nice work Very impressive How long are you guys up to for your water being through your filter through your clay Five minutes and 45 seconds Five minutes and 45 seconds I can tell that both of you are working very hard And Xavier you re doing excellent job at staying in your seat the whole time You can give yourself a point right now for being on task Nice job Good What are you noticing about sand clay and water I noticed that the clay held less water than the sand and I was really surprised by that because I thought that water can go through sand fast So you were really surprised because you didn t think water would go through sand that fast And how much water did your sand hold Our sand held 11 milliliters Eleven milliliters Good And how much did your clay hold do you know Five Held five milliliters Wow What number sentence did you do in order to figure out how many milliliters were in the clay and how many milliliters were in the sand We did 40 minus however the milliliters were left in the cup Okay And why did you do that Because we had 40 to begin with and we needed to find out how many were left and I forgot You forgot Kendall can you help her out We got 29 in this and it began with 40 So we had to do 40 minus 29 Forty minus 29 is 11 millimeters Milliliters Good Remember millimeters is when we re using rulers and milliliters is when we re measuring water Okay Excellent job Which soil would you rather garden with Would you rather garden with sand or would you rather garden with clay I would garden with both of them so I could get a loamy soil and loamy soils are better for the flowers Okay So you would mix them together so that you could get a loamy mixture What about you Kendall I would do sand because water can get through it easily So water can get through it easily Why would that matter Because the soil and everything else and the grass and everything needs water but if you use clay it just stays on top and it can t get water Very good Excellent Looks like you girls are ready to move on to your graphing What are we going to graph What are we graphing today How much water is in the 
 Welcome to Mrs Dunford s first grade classroom Here you see a Word Work center where students are working to build words All around the room student work is proudly displayed along with anchor charts to anchor student learning At Computer Center students are working on differentiated computer programs based on needs At Listening Center students listen to stories to build their fluency Above them is our Word Wall which displays our sight words Our Center Chart The students are working on the Smart Board to integrate technology into reading Here we have students at Read To Someone where they are enjoying reading books to each other Around the back of our room books are separated into book bins for genres and they have their book boxes At Read To Self area students read independently and enjoy reading in our tent In the back we have our marble jar for compliments and our How Was Your Day board along with our Helper Chart And last we have My Table where I work with small groups based on needs Thank you for joining our classroom Okay boys and girls we just read the biography by Maurice Sendak Can you tell me what is a biography Let s see Cassandra A real story A real story you re right Kiss your brain What is it a real story about Christopher It was a real story about Maurice Sendak It s a real story about Maurice Sendak A real story about a real what A real author A real author Could it be about something other than an author Yes Yes as long as it s about a person right A biography tells us about a person We re going to fill in this graphic organizer about Maurice Sendak It has different sections in it The first section says Childhood Can you read that with me Childhood The middle section says Life What does it say Life And that last section says Books What does it say Books Good And we re going to fill things in from down here to tell about his childhood what happened in his life and some books that he wrote Can you help me fill those things in If you re ready to help me can I see your hands up Good Put your hands in your lap We re going to read this one first Worked at a toy store Can you read it with me Worked at a toy store Hmm where would that go Childhood Life or Books Andrea what do you think Life Life Why do you think that Because Because What did he do He wrote stories about He wrote stories but he worked at a toy store and that happened during his what Life It happened during his life you re right Go ahead and move this to where it says Life Good job We re going to give her a McDonald s cheer ready Ba da da da da I m loving it Good job Let s read this one Where The Wild Things Are Can you read with me Where The Wild Things Are Hmm where does that one go Grace Books Why do you think that it goes in Books He wrote it He wrote it you re right Can you move it where it goes We ll move it just a little bit closer There you go Good job We are going to give her the Truck Driver ready Good job there buddy Oh but this one down here Born in Brooklyn Can you read it with me Born in Brooklyn Where would that one go Stephanie Life It could go in his life Why do you think that it goes in his life Because he was born in Brooklyn Because he was born in Brooklyn that s a fact about his life Where else could it go When you re born you re a what Baby You re a baby So where else could that go Childhood It could go in Childhood you re right Good job We re going to give her a Fantastic ready You re fantastic Good Let s look at this one Won Caldecott Medal Can you read it with me Won Caldecott Medal Hmm when did that happen Houston In his life In his life Why do you think that it happened in his life Because he wrote a book and he got it for his book You re right Exactly right He wrote a book and he won it about a book Would you put in Life You re right it went in Life Perfect Good job Let s give him the Piano ready Dun dun dun dun You did a good job So Kenny s Window Can you read it with me Kenny s Window Where would Kenny s Window go Dylan Life Is Kenny s WIndow something that happened in his life You can change your answer Um Where do you think Kenny s Window would go Books You re exactly right Dylan Why would it go in Books I don t know Okay let s talk about it Kenny s Window Was that a book that he wrote Yes Yes So would that go in Books for that reason Yes Yes So can you move Kenny s Window to Books Yep You ve got to touch it a little bit harder I got it Okay good job Right there Dylan is good Thank you Dylan It s good there I ll move it up a little bit further There now it s out of the way Can I do this Okay you want to do the disco ball That s the way uh huh uh huh I like it uh huh uh huh That s the way uh huh uh huh I like it uh huh uh huh Good Let s look at the last one Liked bedtime stories Can you read it with me Liked bedtime stories Where would that one go Let s see Cassandra Childhood Childhood Why do you think that it would go in Childhood Because his grandpa and grandma read him some stories Because they read him stories didn t they Good job That completes our graphic organizer on Maurice Sendak Now I have your own biographies for you to read Everyone should know where they go And your own shoe biography for you to fill out because remember we re going to do a display in our hallway that s called Famous Footwear and have our shoes displayed for everyone else to see Alright right now I want you to stand up I want you to glue cotton on your shoes Stick some marshmallows in your mouth and go to your area to read your biography Alright I want you to sit a little more in a circle and then I want you to read two pages and then I want you to fill it out okay Can you read the title Can we read the title together Ready Joseph Burcheck Good Who s Joseph Burcheck Him Yep that s right Open up to page two Dalton There you go Stephanie can you start for us Joseph Burcheck grandma and grandpa There were lots of beautiful plants and hills where they live Grandma had many books she liked to read and so did Joseph Good Stop there and look at your graphic organizer Look at your shoe Is there a part of that shoe that you can fill out Yes Which part do you think You think Family And you think Childhood Dalton Let s start with Family What part do you think would go in Family Grandma and grandpa Grandma and grandpa That he did what with Grandma and Grandpa Read books He read books with them What else did he do with them Can you re read this part There were a lot of beautiful plants and hills where they lived They lived What do you think that means That he what with his Grandma and Grandpa Lived He lived with them that s right So can you write that in Family Put that in Ideas And then let Dalton tell you what he thinks goes in Childhood okay Got it What do you guys filling in How do you spell lived L No lived L I V E D Who does his live with He cheated Grandma and Grandpa His Grandma and Grandpa Is that what you were going to add to the graphic organizer You re exactly right You re doing a good job Jenn I think she needs the marker There you go Keep it up Keep up the good work H E R A N Her family was quick to hang up her work Your turn Her family was quick to hang up her work Nice job And we have a Family section on here so what do you think Dylan What did her family do Put her pictures up That s exactly right they hung up her work Good job Dylan I m going to show you where Right here T H E Do you know why they re putting that in Family Can you tell me Because her family did what What did her family like to do Put pictures up Hang up her pictures that s exactly why they re adding it to Family Go ahead and finish what you need to write You ve got to finish it Dylan You re doing a great job There you go her work Why is this a biography Because it tells by a girl and she s writing books And she was reading books and writing You re right it s a biography A biography is a story about a real person and that s exactly what she was Can you read me one of these When Amy was little she liked to read Good And why does that belong in Childhood Because she was doing it as a child She was doing it when she was little You re right You re exactly right Now who s going to fill in the ideas Who knows where did she get her ideas from Do you know where she got her ideas from From the books From the books Well actually where did she get the ideas for the books Can you read this part for me Amy liked about a lot of books Things people say help Amy What helps Amy Things people say Things people say So where does she get her ideas from People People and the things that they tell her right Things that they say Can you write that in the Ideas part Yes Good job The things that people say are what help her and give her ideas Houston can you help her direct that That would be great You guys are doing a fantastic job Oh you wrote the wrong stuff You re writing on the wrong side You re writing on the wrong side She s writing that whole section Why Can someone tell me why she s writing that in Childhood Clint do you know Why is she writing that in Childhood Why is she writing that Joseph did things with his Grandpa in Childhood Because he used to watch him play guitar and go in the woods with him and talk nice Did he do that when he was an adult or when he was a child Child Right so is that why it would go in Childhood Yes Jeffrey can you tell me what is this story about It tells real stuff It tells real stuff about what Joseph Burcheck Joseph Burcheck yep That s what it does It tells real things about him You guys are doing great Keep up the good work 
 I don t want a straight line No I like curves Yeah a lot Because the friction in the air Yeah Pushes it and the gravity going on the next turn I think it s because there s like a big wall and that s a small little plane and everything has gravity You need to pull on the string And the reason why it s not going that way is because that wall will stray them away The wings get cool What was your longest throw How long was it Oh it was It was mine and it was probably one two three four five six Five No it s six One two three four five six Into the six but not before the six Oh yes into the six Alright Go over there check that out 38 Four hundred 538 centimeters Yeah Let s put how many meters Five meters Write 538 But why did because fliers don t go into the wall Because Everything has a little bit of gravity There s not a whole lot of gravity where it would just go Yeah and then that doesn t have a lot of gravity but I mean I can see that but he threw it high and it went up to the wall right there But it kind of did like that But it didn t really smash I mean it didn t go and stick Yeah it didn t go Gravity pulled it but it wasn t going to hold it there Yeah It s got more force on it Yeah I think there s more gravity up there than right here because that s higher and it s closer It s like it has a lot more gravity What has more gravity Up there Had more pull I think the reason why the sticks were going and the straw was going this way is because everything has a little bit of gravity And the wall And the wall it like a lot bigger than that stick and it s gravity that s pulling it there but it doesn t have enough gravity where it will just be like It s not like this Okay so if everything has a little bit of gravity what is the major gravity pull though that is bringing it down The Earth The Earth because That s why like if we threw this that s why That s why it chops Okay this one went it went three meters This one covered straw with paper and this one glides It s a lot bigger So when it went like here it went all the way down to the Yeah it s faster because it s bigger and this one s smaller and it doesn t go far Glider the other one s probably bigger This one s also flat so it s got a better chance to glide Yeah That one s like round and bigger and it doesn t flop on the and it doesn t go like far When you throw it it doesn t like when it goes it doesn t go far but this one like it ll go far What do you think would happen if we put a paperclip on either the front or the back It would help It would lay it a little bit down It would go a little bit down because it s it has more weight it ll go down If you put a paperclip on it like a paperclip s not that heavy but it would make it like when we fly it it goes up in the air and then comes back down and floats down That s why they re so short What makes it come down Gravity Okay And like you put a paperclip on it it ll come down Because the paperclip is heavier than the straw What if you put it on the back It would it would It would kind of slow it It would be like that Okay can you think of What about this one What if we put the paperclip on this one It would It wouldn t feel It would get worse If we put the paperclip on here then it would get all messed up because if it s flat and it s trying to It has weight it will just go Uh huh right That one when you fly it before we got the paperclip it goes high before it comes down But when we put the paperclip on it it goes straight down like that And like without the paperclip without the paperclip on it it will go like it will go like an ocean With the paperclip on there it would go farther It would go farther and then it ll fall just down like that but not go like that This one let s try this one See that one goes a lot farther And it probably goes farther because I put a lot of force on it If you even put a lot of force on this one it will go down because it flies like I threw it like that and it just flies off because it s the gravity And you throw that one it goes farther Okay so gravity makes it come down faster than the glider It makes it go down because if you just throw it without the paperclip it won t it will just come down because of gravity _ Yeah the straw one is going like that And then it just goes like see how it flips down But with the paperclip it ll go farther Like that Tyler what were you saying about the air Do you think that has a do you think that makes a difference in what Mary Morgan is saying this one kind of floats and then comes down Go talk about that See the air The air feels like windy in here It would push it and then it would It would go like this Yeah like that And it would just push It would just push it towards like where everything was Yeah and this one with the paperclip goes really far And that paperclip the reason it went far without the paperclip is because air pushed it and force What is that force called When you push it Remember it s called The thrust The thrust that s right So the thrust when you push the plane made a difference is that what you said Could you change the one with the straw is there any changes that you could make that you think would make it fly further Talk about that as a group Put two paperclips One on the front and one on the back Put the lighter one on the back Let s try that I bet it will It might go farther too Okay now push We have a paperclip on it and we re going to see if it goes farther the second time I think I bet it will go I bet it goes a lot longer That s fine Well It went to 10 It went to 10 Okay so I want you to discuss in this group I want you to discuss what you found when you threw when you tested this with the paperclip on it Just talk about that together Well So when there s air I think when they closed the air up it went in and back out But but but tied together So if you like flip off The paper clip The air like if you could do this and turn off the air it would go further But if you take off of it I mean if you it won t make it that far It will just be like The paper clip the straw it does help Yeah about the same as this one without I wonder what that one s like with paperclips Me too I want to try it This is my prediction I think it s on an angle I think that s going to go further I don t know because they don t have no air stream to hold it I think it will go farther I don t See Well you didn t put a lot of force on that one Well we all have to try But I still think it went the farthest but I think I think it s going to go farther Nope Well it went farther than you It went But I mean it didn t go You all tried it with this didn t you all Let me try it this way I tried it with that I tried it with that side It all went to the yellow but But it didn t Strong enough So what did we find out back here That it puts more weight on it so it goes What puts more weight This little paperclip The paperclip puts more weight to that one and it s not going to nose dive But I was standing right here and mine hit that wall And that s without the paperclip And then you put the paperclip on there it doesn t go near as far Why did that make a difference Was your throws the same Did you use the same amount of force What happened Mine felt like I was using the same force I think it s just because that since there isn t any air space on that one What do you mean airspace I mean like the air can t go through this Yeah like that s a straw it has a hole It s just putting more weight on that one so that s just going to go boop If you use this one and put the paperclip right here it s going to cut off the air coming in right here And that s going to go further Oh you re took off the air of the straw And that makes it go further Why does that Because the air in the straw is pulling it down because it s like Do you know what that s called Gravity Well the gravity but what about the air when the air is coming in Friction Oh friction Friction the air is causing friction Okay The air s slowing it down And also the air Okay now I want you to think about if you change this plane in any way what changes could you make to it to make it fly further We could cut it up Wrap around and then have that like this Yeah I think that s set to have the same throw Because actually having That one can go farther but the paperclips on it it won t fly further But if you put paperclips on this one it d probably go farther Put some paperclips on there Because paperclips add more weight Yeah and it lets it go further Here Tyler you want to throw That went two 
 So how would you describe that Can you find the exact spot where that is in the text where you can find those So you basically have found two character traits to describe to me right You guys have discovered that he can be what What was one of them again Jealous Sad Jealous Or sad So I want you to find that evidence If you want to make those claims any of those are great ideas But now you have to dig a little bit deeper into the text and see if you can find this Can you find examples and see OK Keep sharing You re doing a great job Toby wanted to play Because Toby was kinda jealous because Bouncer was outside by himself Didn t want to Nobody didn t and a little kid wanted to go outside the house Well I think he s thinking this himself Because he was thinking about what the other That s Toby So he s kinda jealous because he s talking to the other little dog and every single time he wants to play ball with him But he doesn t want to And the thing is the lady said it in the story it made it sadder than it usually would be sad That sometimes the stories make it seem so sad so good that that can feel So here where it says Why does Andy need a new dog Oh wait Why does Andy need a new dog wondered Toby He already has me Toby sighed and laid down Beside the dog Maybe Andy doesn t love me anymore They had to make it so that what happened and actually it s sad what happened It s not that it s sad but it s not so so sad but they make it like sad Toby wanted Toby wanted to play ball and he got a new dog and forgot I was about to Well he didn t really forget about Toby because he still bought Toby his food I know Toby wanted to play ball but when Andy came he got a new dog And then for the rest of the day Andy was playing with his new dog And Toby felt left out I say we put left out somewhere He s so sad jealous and left out So Toby wanted to play ball with Andy but when Andy How do you spell Andy A N D Y Andy Andy Where do you see Oh yeah When Andy told him he wanted to play ball Where are you Andy Andy Toby wanted to play ball but when Andy came he had a new dog And you spelled with a silent I think with the Andy Another dog A new Like this one Another dog No it s not Well whatever Who wants to Just write Just write I put Toby was jealous because of Bouncer Maybe we can put because he wanted more attention That s how my sister is She wants more attention We re not talking about your sister We re talking about Toby So Toby was jealous Toby was jealous because a dog s there Because Toby was a dog and Bouncer just came along and he didn t like him He s jealous No We have to write a reason why he s jealous I know Then we have to do part of the test Part of the test Did you guys agree on a character trait that he was at the beginning Jealous Jealous Jealous Do you have at least one example and maybe two Do you have an example Joaquin I m going to put Toby wanted more attention but Bouncer got more attention Do you have an example of why he wanted more attention I have one Can you find it Oscar When he was like maybe Bouncer doesn t love him anymore I only said that Can you find that So when you write it when you explain it can you find that part and maybe quote it There s another reason When they came through the driveway he got all And then when he came back he lay So that s like too many things Toby was jealous cuz Toby was jealous cuz Bouncer got more attention instead of Toby No Yeah Oh right here In the middle Toby since nobody What paragraph is that Paragraph nine He wondered if Andy had forgotten all about him Do you know why he paid more attention to Bouncer Because he s a little puppy And little puppies need more attention than big puppies Because little puppies don t know what to do I know And they re not even trained They have to train them more For like three months Yes That s why he needs more attention than Bouncer yeah Toby needed Because Toby really knows how to And he knows that s an old dog And you can see all the wrinkles That s how the dogs are Yeah those dogs have wrinkles when they re big already But they re still young OK Toby was jealous because Bouncer What did you write So I have In the beginning was Toby When Andy had a puppy he liked Bouncer more than Toby Maybe And in the beginning Andy was showing the puppy opening Opening the puppy and showing it to Toby Yes That s how he was like nervous Jealous Yeah jealous And selfish Yeah That s what I put in the beginning And then Toby Remember the part when he got the little ball Right Yeah and he was being jealous Yeah Bouncer Because he was a new one And the old one was Toby And the part when Andy closed the door in Toby s face and he let him outside Then he felt loner I believe that Toby was getting Bouncer Because they would stay together and they slept the whole night together So they were being friendly Yeah like starting to Yeah Another thing that Bouncer was new And another thing Toby was old So Andy was used to Bouncer And Bouncer and Toby And that s I think what Toby about It s Bouncer You know how the fence went to Bouncer They get a kinda middle something Yeah That s what I think When they started to get Toby showed Bouncer how to catch the ball that s when they started to become friends And the climax is when Andy he throw the rubber ball and told Bouncer to go and fetch it but he just sit there and then yeah Then Andy called Toby to go and show him how to pitch the ball Okay Oh almost part of the end is when the puppy that is Bouncer becomes crying and then Andy took the puppy to Toby Yeah in the beginning I was getting like selfish May I interrupt for a second so you guys it looks like you ve developed the beginning pretty well and you found examples right Have you talked about the ending yet and how he was at the end I see you re on the back page How does Toby change at the end Have you guys talked about that part yet What s his character trait at the end of the story We talked about the Okay so who was working on that part Was somebody working on that part Yeah was there a trait that you picked for him at the end When the little puppy Bouncer started crying and Andy took the little puppy Bouncer when Toby How did Toby change then How do we describe Toby then Happy Happy yeah can you give an example of now that he s happy He s happy why Because he just thinks anymore that Ohhh Can you come up with another reason maybe together if you guys can look for another example as to why at the end of the story Toby is happy Can you look and see if you can find one I think that Toby in the ending is kind Is kind Okay can you come up with an example and share it with them in the scene And then maybe you guys can come up with a consensus on one that you agree Or you can write two different things right You don t all have to write the same thing One of you can write he s kind and one of you can write he s happy as long as you have what as long as you have what Your reason Your reason absolutely So share that other example Share that other example too I think I ve got he s kind Maybe because he s going to be kind to Bouncer because he s still like a little puppy and he doesn t know how to do stuff I think Yeah in the end when he said for me at the end he was getting kind of happy because Andy told Bouncer to Andy told Toby to to get the yellow ball You know the yellow ball Yeah And Bouncer was kind of tired and everything because he s he s small and Toby he catched it and they were playing yeah and they were getting happy and Toby in the end at that part he was used to liking Bouncer now Mm hm At the climax At the climax it was when It was when Toby When Andy told Toby to show Bouncer how to fetch the ball and then started fetching the ball and then he started to play and Bouncer and Bouncer danced on his bed Bouncer tried Okay 
 Okay Now when we sang that music scale we were We were actually stepping up We were going from low to high And if you ll look over at this you can tell these were the notes that we were singing from low to high The first note was a line note Let s speak it together Line note space note Line note space note Line note space note Line note space note Good job Those notes were stepping And if you ll notice here I ve got carpet squares and I have them with line note and space note Line note space note Line note space note Line note space note Good job That s what we sang when we sang our scale and that s the notes that you re seeing up there are those line notes and those space notes All right I d like for us Will you please come and find one of those carpet squares and sit behind it Sit behind the carpet square of your choice And let s go ahead and sit up tall on our knees Sit nice and tall on your knees And the next person come in and find a carpet square sit behind it behind that hand chimes And I don t think we ll need We ll need one more person The next person What about me Five Good job All right Now everyone even if you re sitting in your chairs you need to practice with me because we re all going to be playing the hand chimes today Do not touch your hand chime just yet Let s all just practice Start off with your hand up Put your hand chime down a second We re going to just practice with our arm only And it s going to be important that you do a good wrist action because that s going to make a difference in the way that it sounds All right watching me Hold and again Hold Hold Asanti Hold Hold Okay stop Now people down here pick up your hand chime and let s see if we can get that technique going Get ready One more time Good Now let s Just place your fingers there under the bottom to get it to stop Good Now when I point to each person by yourself you will play the music scale So do not play until I point to you Looking at me we begin Start with the low C Good job Let s do it again That s the scale And these notes are stepping because it s line note space note line note space note Any time you ve got two notes beside of each other that s a stepping melody One more time starting with the lowest C Good job Now put your hand chime down a second We just heard a stepping melody Any time that you have a line note and a space note beside of each other two neighbors playing that s a stepping melody I want you to stand up please and I d like for you to stand up Take your hand chime hold it and That melody Someone raise your hand and tell me What did it do Logan Skipping Actually It leaped You re exactly right It leaped Because look at all these lines and these spaces that did not get to play That s a leaping melody Good job London do you remember what the difference was between leaping and stepping I mean leaping and skipping Can somebody help us What s the difference between a leap and a skip If you leap it s more than a skip All right The leaping is more than the skipping Skipping All right You sit down Put the hand chime down And you stand up You keep remaining standing Take your hand chime and you play That was a skip You are exactly right That s a skip when you just skip over one place one person All right Have a seat You have a seat And I d like for Ashley you stand up And what I want her to do is for four times I d like you to play your hand chime watching me I m going to let her try Someone raise your hand What was that James what was that Repeating You re exactly right That was a repeating note The one person that one pitch played four times All right Sit down please Now will you please stand You stand and you stand Watching me All right Raise your hand please Tell me what was that Devon Stepping A stepping pattern And it went from high to low You re exactly right Have a seat Now last week I gave you a piece of paper and it was something that I wanted you to do to see if you understood about leaping stepping and repeating on the music scale If you ll look over at the Smartboard there is some notes there on Number 1 some notes on Number 1 And you were last week going to circle an S if it was a stepping pattern You were going to circle an R if it was a repeating pattern Raise your hand if you know what those notes on Number 1 were doing Christian put your hand chime down and you can come up and circle whether those notes in the Number 1 if they were stepping or if they were repeating You re exactly right Christian How did you know that It was staying on the same note Staying on the same note very good And thank you for walking around behind those hand chimes Number 2 Akrista can you walk around that other way and come right here And why don t you show us Put the hand chime down please Show us what the notes in Number 2 are doing Let s see if it s doing a space note and then a what Line note Line note and then a space note And she is exactly right Those notes were stepping what Down Down And Number 3 Thank you ma am Come this way right around here And she s looking at those music notes and she s going to be able to tell They re right here Number 3 All right Let s say it with her Line note Space note Line note space note Line note Right here Are they staying all the same No They staying all the same What are those notes doing They re stepping You re exactly right They re stepping up Thank you ma am And tiptoe back to your seat Very good job Now I would like for the last two people B and C If you ll tiptoe to your seat I m going to call you back up here in a few minutes The rest of the folks you ve got to be sitting up nice and tall sit up tall on your knees Let s see if they can play a very familiar tune I want you looking at the very first note the The very first note Keiani You have that low C And what do you notice about C C Keiani what s your note going to be doing What s the word when you have the same pitch Re peating Thank you He has a repeating note And G Christian what are you going to be doing Repeating Repeating Adam what are you going to be doing Repeating Repeating So we have a lot of repeating notes in this song Sit up tall on your knees Sit up tall Pick your hand chime up We re going to see if we can play this familiar tune Waiting One two ready sound Very good That was Twinkle Twinkle Little Star It was Twinkle Twinkle Little Star You recognized it All right Put your hand chime down a second I was listening You heard the melody All right Now let me see Sitting tall I m going to get someone that s sitting back there in a chair to help us out a little bit I think I would like for Christopher Will you come and point to three people that will be able to show us a stepping melody Oh don t raise your hand We ll let Christian choose Three people that would be able to play Christopher Oh yeah Christopher Or you can call him Chris That s Christian All right Tell me which three people Just point to them All right He s pointing to you Stand up with your hand chime We re talking about stepping now Stepping All right Okay Chris has pointed to these three tapped them on the shoulder Let s see If you think he picked out three folks that did play a stepping pattern will you just gives a thumbs up silently You re exactly right he did pick He did it He did pick three All right Put your hand chime down and sit down I d like to call on Harmony Will you pick two people that can show us a leaping melody Leaping So you can step behind them and just tap them on the shoulder Leaping Leaping Leaping Okay Now these two people are side by side There s a line note and a space note and they re neighbors Someone raise your hand and tell me what would they play What would they be playing if they re neighbors That would be a stepping And I wanted a leap like a frog leaps over a whole lot So come and see if you can fix it Real quick Somebody needs to sit down Who do you want to sit down All right Sit down And pick somebody that will be a leaping melody Like a frog leaping leaps over a whole lot All right He stands Take your hand chime Play Now she leaped over a space note and a line note Give a thumbs up if you think she did it correctly Yes that is a leaping melody Good All right Sit down Hand chimes still on the floor I d like for you to tiptoe very quietly back to your chair What we did in that song we had several times that there was repeating notes We had a few times where we had some stepping side by side And we had some leaping melodies When we played the hand chimes it took several of us to be able to play those melodies the melody If you re playing a xylophone though you could do it right by yourself I can I would like Keiani will you step around behind here And Sheridan you come over and sit behind the xylophone that you choose And Dev Devuan Devuan walk around here Walk this way And he s going to be the teacher I want you to choose Sit down on your knees so that they can see what you want them to do Choose something that you want them to play and let them see it Turn it so that they can see it All right What do you want them to play Step Play a stepping melody All right Good and stop Now someone Both of them did do a stepping melody But he was playing right here Can somebody help him out as to what might make it sound better A hit in the middle He says Hit it in the middle Hit where the music notes are those steps Let s try it again Play em soft Great job That is stepping All right Choose another one Oh now he wants a leap Good job What do you want Devon Devuan Devuan Repeat Good job All right thank you Put your mallet right there on the instrument Lay it on the top That will be quicker for today And tiptoe back to your seat walking around the instruments I d like for Wes H to step around and find yourself a xylophone Step around over here Akrista Sit down tall on your knees And what do you want them to play Tell them She wants you to play a repeating note Now those were both kind of high repeating notes very high Do you think you could play a low one Good job Now how did you know that was going to be low Akrista Cause the little ones are higher Bigger ones are low You are exactly right What else do you want them to do She d like a what 
 Oh water or more I guess And what gets thrown into the pond The pebble Is there a pebble Oh that s so cute okay So wait what order these do these rings show up What order Yeah like what s the procedure when this was like like this and then this one or then this one They start small and bigger and bigger So drop your pebble in the pond there you go And it gets bigger as it goes up Okay and so now maybe talk through Maybe talk through what is the given what s the constant rate of change where you re looking for it and how would that be seen visually So the rate is increasing constantly at one foot per second Per second The ADT is two pi R BR the first Which one are you guys on Number one okay good In order for you to find for QR may define the ADT We need to find the ADT of different orbs What The ADT concentrating with them So it s like four for DR Okay so What did you do with your sand Show me what happened here Okay air is gonna come into the clear hole and then right into You picked the sand problem tell me about your sand problem It s talking about sand quality to a how to apply it at a rate to be permanent Okay And out of the following the diameter of the base in it Is It s going to make the shape of a cone when you pour it in one spot that s the idea And the shape of the cone will be approximately three times however high the sand is being poured from Okay so our cone has been smooshed but you see how it s still kinda narrow a little mountain in sort of the shape of a cone Right And what s the unknown what are we looking for here We re trying to find the rate of the height of the pile Oh you can do it We said that s possible Okay so Kathy you re able would that be DVDT DHDT DRDT all these DTs we can kinda run together Just blow it up Can we do AHDT Sure AHDT because you re looking for a rate of change for the height Now you re actually on the hardest problem This is the trickiest problem and you have correctly chosen the cards for these But here s what makes it tricky I want you to read through this slowly and let s figure out the unknown and if they give us what other rates they give us Now you actually just told me what the unknown is right DHDT DHDT Okay what other variables do we have on this card besides DHDT and the rate of change AR ARDT ARDT and DVDT Okay now you read it again while y all are listening and see if you can pick out maybe do DVDT or DRDT What was that For both At a sand and gravel plant sand is falling off the conveyor and onto a conical pile at a rate of Plus What information did you just get You can say it again if you need to Sand is falling off a conveyor and onto the conical pile at a rate of 10 cubic feet per minute Okay Good that s DVDT cause it s the amount the volume changes and the label kinda gets screwy too right Okay so now we re listening for DRDT We hope we hear DRDT because we need that also right The diameter of the base of the cone is approximately three times the altitude So Okay so it s giving us information about radius compared to altitude but it doesn t seem to be giving us DRDT right Which means we don t have DRDT And the radius is two feet And the radius is two feet So what s the height again It s the height of DT So we need to find how fast the radius is changing So this right here is the decision Nice The DVDT equals four pi R squared to the DRDT So this is the hardest when you get to the math What we need to find is DRDT when the radius equals two feet Okay All right Okay I guess the next one we can figure out right now How many cubes we got Three Three okay All the edges of the cube are expanding at a rate of three centimeters per second How fast is the volume changing if each edge is one centimeter We have you doing the edges of a cube the radius of an aired balloon So the radius one 370 370 370 So D DS over DT is three Right Plug that we can just plug that in cause it s not a constant Tell me a little bit about the problem you re on Does it have three cubes in your problem Like why does it have three cubes in the box We started with that this other one Okay And it shows after a second it would be that big And then after another second it would be that big Oh good okay so it s showing that it s the same cube and it s getting bigger It s like three stages in an environment Very good very good Correct interpretation Yes And It also shows the volume of the Now what does this question ask you for at the very end What are you gonna be trying to find How fast the volume changes when it enters from Yes I have a question for you here s a think about it question Cause you re finding DVDT when it is exactly one centimeter right that s what the question s asking Do you think DVDT would be greater or smaller when it s past one centimeter Do you think the rate of change of volume will be getting bigger faster or will it slow down Slow down Slow down Slow down My challenge to you is after you do the math problem and you have your equation to work with try two centimeters and see if you were right Yeah so go above and beyond the question Was your conjecture right or were you like oh no we were backwards Kay Okay The base is gonna be point oh eight with the ball at a descending rate And it is asking how fast the pouch is moving to the wall in the last part Oh you look great D two So okay let s pour the sand again So what five So it s pouring at 10 cubic feet per minute Talking about the change in output So what s constant Its cubic feet per minute So that s the The sand being poured in it So that s the volume I don t know Okay We have choices as to who can t I have four And zero to bring it down Yeah I m just gonna bring it down Problem number what Problem one Okay next problem Are we agreed A ladder 25 feet long is leaning against the wall of a house The base of the ladder is pulled away from the wall at a rate of two feet per second How fast is the top moving down the wall when the base of the ladder is 24 feet from the wall So then You definitely got the demonstration item perfect that s right that s exactly what s happening All right Okay You guys are gonna get this one It s what s supposed to be a Length And what made you pick that one It s the Pythagorean theorem And then why would you wanna use the Pythagorean theorem Because it s a three sided it s equal to the right triangle Yeah exactly uh huh All right Okay now I ve got a question for ya Is there any part of that equation that will always give confirmation we want to that you would actually be able to substitute a number in at the very beginning Okay good good All right What would that mean about your derivative card What would you know for sure If you put 25 right there Get a constant rate of one foot per second Anything special for this derivative card DZ over DT equals Well if the original if your ladder is 25 right here where would the 25 originally be put In the Z In the Z okay I that would say that X squared plus Y squared equals 25 Now take the derivative of this with respect to time Would it look exactly like this or a little bit different One we re at a constant rate Right And so when you do your math you can go ahead and put that as zero and then just work with those Good That s good So What s the The balloon s increasing Yeah Following the radius It s the what s the radius it s four feet The radius yeah you have to find what the radius is at four feet and Find the radius when it s at four feet Which one are you on P two When the radius is four feet at what rate is the total area of the disturbed water treatment area So you would define the area Wait which are you on Okay so you have three balloons Right And you could use those three balloons if they are different sizes to show what Okay Okay The rate of change So if you have one balloon and put one back into it and then that s when you have Okay let s see what they look like So let s see if we can have different stages of our balloon here You look like you must be at the last stage cause that looks pretty big Okay that must be the beginning That looks like the beginning too Can one of em get middle stage I think you ve got the baby balloon though I think that s the biggest that guy s getting I didn t know they were different sizes Yeah they are actually different sizes One more Do it And you let some out maybe you got it Oh perfect okay Tell me about what s going on with this balloon What s goin on Oh increase Four cubic feet and they Oh what are they I think I m thinking of the wrong one Like it s not Like it s not measuring each breath it s something No you are thinking right This is is this like what we had Two days ago Yeah a couple days ago Like is what was constant a couple days ago in our activity Air is being continuous air pulled away by the rate of Yes So like the volume the rate of change of volume is constant Is that true on this or is that a different problem Okay and so what is the unknown that you are trying to figure out The change of the radius How the radius is And what do you predict will happen with the rate of change of radius with the larger the radius gets It ll stretch out That I m sorry It ll slow down Yeah I think that s a good conjecture That would be like what happened the other day when we looked at it slowed down quite a bit the bigger the radius got Sounds good And it is because it was what The volume Cause the volume Yeah F four for that that ll go on the left F four and D six Have you gotten to the balloon part yet Let s talk about the other one okay One Okay the other balloon problem was about surface area Is that right Have you done this one yet Yes Okay how many blow up the balloon and let s see what s happening in that balloon Kevin what was happening on this balloon It s the rate of the The puddle B a formula problem Okay so how is Jesse gonna show us the surface area of DVDT Okay so let s demo that Causing ripples Thank you nice demonstration What is constant on this problem The area and then Yeah the radius 
 So can you record two on that It s harder to write two Remember here you can use your number line if you need it to help you Do you want me to turn it So there s the two Can you try to write it I did it Awesome That looks like a two So was this awesome all right or super bad Super bad Super bad Why do you think it was super bad Because it s not heavy Because it s not heavy Okay Julia what s our second problem Ow The styrofoam ball The styrofoam ball Can you find the styrofoam ball Yes that one We can first we re gonna make This one is bigger How does it feel though Is it round It does We re gonna be answering questions over here Julia can you let make his prediction Which one did you pick That one You picked all right Why did you pick all right Because it s little How does it feel Feel it No it s not heavy What do you think Is there anything that you re wondering about that What s next What do you think All right again You think all right too Mark them all right You think awesome You think it s gonna go 15 or more Okay let s see Are you ready Can you pick up the tape and do it again Gonna get the tape You re supposed to do it again Because there s another space Yep we re gonna actually do it again after we do all of them one time Okay Put it this way Ivan s gonna put it in is everyone ready Oh wait you have to keep it upside down so it can push Okay Can you try it over Ivan are you ready Let s try one more time I m gonna put this cup right in front One more time Well feel it Is it heavy That s okay I m gonna be right back Has anything surprised you so far What happened The orange ball So what kind of push was it An awesome An awesome push So did that surprise you You didn t think it was gonna go so far I though it was gonna go like Is that where the tape went So you guys can pick up the tape Should we do the green ball The green ball Which ball so far A zero A zero And it didn t move at all Yes Why do you think it didn t move Because it s so tiny It s so tiny But does it weigh a lot No No it didn t Do you think that s why it didn t go far And it s so tiny And it doesn t have more mass Ahh I see So should we do this again Yeah The super bad is actually this one right here Oh it s so tiny So feel it How does it feel Let Luka feel it How does it feel So Jacob why don t you make your prediction From all right to super bad What do you think Sofia What did you put Why did you put all right So right there How far do you think it s gonna go What did you put Sofia Sofia picked Luka what do you think Which one do you think What s it gonna be Awesome all right or super bad Good pick all right So we re gonna do it down here on this one All right Are you ready Make your prediction And then we re gonna put it on the ground What do you think Awesome all right or super bad Who picked awesome Sofia right Do you guys have anything that you re Remember when we were I do remember when we were trying to What did we find out What is it What do you think for the second ball You think a rock is inside Maybe If they were rocks then they would be so hard That s true is it really hard A little A little bit hard What do you think is inside Can we find out We can open one of these probably Let s put it down first Everybody write it Jacob are you the recorder What are you The counselor Are you the starter Okay guys is everyone ready You know what We re gonna do it one more time so that it knocks over the cup We can move the tape now Sofia we need you to count Move the cup over How far did it go One two three four five six seven eight nine 10 Will you count again with me Ready One two three four five six seven eight nine 10 Jacob this went 10 Can you write 10 down No For the super bad it went 10 Yep It s super awesome So what do you think Where did it go Was it awesome all right or super bad Awesome All right It was all right Why was it all right And is 10 more or less than 15 Less than 15 So that s why it s all right Okay guys I m gonna go to the next group Now what you re gonna do is trial two You re gonna do every ball one more time Okay Yep We re gonna do it one more time Okay I will be right back How s it going over here Has anything surprised you What surprised you Which ball didn t push it very far Wait how far did it actually push So that means that the cup didn t move at all Why do you think the cup didn t move Because it s so light Which one moved the farthest so far Which ball The orange one Is the orange ball really light How does the orange one feel Like it has more mass Is there anything you guys are wondering about If they re bouncy Let s put this ball back Does that one bounce I wonder why not Okay so what are we putting next on your sheet What should you do Are you putting the rubber ball Yeah Are you guys all putting that you think it s gonna be an awesome push Ready Put tape here Alexandra are you the taper It s on the wrong side No she got it she did it So move the cup over Now Nicholas is gonna count One two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 Can you help write in 13 Yeah this one right here has a one and a three Can you try writing that It s gonna have one more It s gonna have one more So if the styrofoam ball went zero and the orange ball went 13 which one is more 13 How do you know that You just know that When you count does it come higher Yes it does Okay Ivan s ball is next We need to do a trial shoot of which one Okay You have a red Yeah mine What do you guys think about this ball It s awesome It s awesome Why is it awesome It s awesome because it s red and it s the Cardinals color Well I would love for you to come Should we see how far it goes All right let s check it It knocked the cup over Let s try one more time It knocked it over again We re gonna put the tape here Do you think that was farther than the rubber ball But when the ball goes farther Seven eight nine 10 11 What Can you find it on the number line Where s 11 Uh huh that s what it looks like Is 11 more or less than 13 Is it more than 13 or less Which one Is what More than Is more than 11 If you look on the number line So you re right 13 is more Yeah Yeah Okay you guys can start putting the balls away 
 How do you know How do you think it might be different Okay maybe Ethan goes here Measure yours and let s see And which one do you think you re going under I don t know Okay all right Okay well you all listen to him listen to him You all talk about it You talk to them I m gonna walk around It s my turn EJ Okay let him do the writing Why are you taking them out of that one Okay and what are you trying to make it do Balance Okay balance Let s see you trying to make it balance Okay We need to put it right there Okay Did you balance it now Okay so what do put in that point I m going to scoot this just a little it And then you write it down good How did you know it was balanced Good You said which one was heavier here Okay why did you say Think you can do that one How did you know it was balanced Is it balanced What about that At first which one was balanced Because why It was heavy okay Okay so how many of those are I think it was one more Okay you re put it in You ll put what in this one And the number of crayons you all used You had another object that was moving Look right here You think their eraser didn t move What you all gonna test next Did you even measure that one And I ll come back Alright what are you all doing here Do you think if you did the scissors and Matthew did the scissors do you think it would measure the same Let s do it Okay Let s do it one at a time What s happening You guys can t measure try this one Here s my question If Matthew blows the paper clip is it gonna get the same distance as if you blow the paper clip What do you think You don t think so Why not Matthew you blow Okay all right so remember that okay Now Weslee I want you to test it You said you thought it would go different See if you can make a difference Yeah why did it do something different What s that that you re blowing out Air Air and what is it Gas Gas good All right you all can go ahead and finish measuring I saw Ella trying Now if you and Ella both try to blow on that do you think it s going to move Why don t you think it s going to move You think it s too heavy And you don t have enough breath Try it and see See if you all both do it if you can get it to move You re going red in the face and it s going away Did you all think it was going to move You all didn t think it was How did you find this What d you do Counted Okay counted and what are you working on right now The colors Okay which one do you have to count now Which one do you have there This one and what is that one What is that one A solid a liquid or the gas Solid A solid how are you going to find out What are you gonna do Look at this You re going to look at those can you count those I m gonna come back and see if you counted and made your graph okay You re doing good Okay Okay can you come over here and count You might have to get out of your chair you have lots of them One two three four five six seven eight Eight Five six seven eight Check your numbers and you checked to make sure All right whatcha going to do now Tally Tally them okay think you all can do that Okay you need help putting it on remember which one is the total How did you know that so quick I heard you started counting and then what did you do You found it quickly You remembered from that okay How else could have known that fast Go down there Go down there okay good 
 So these two are gonna combine and make six X squared Yes Okay and then what about this guy Just bring him down Alright what about her You can bring her down Okay That s a four X to the fourth not four X squared Ah thank you Four X to the fourth And is this term positive or negative Positive And what about this term Positive And what do we call this guy Rock on okay good good good Alright easy one you ready Three X times X squared plus four X minus two And this time we re multiplying what kind of monomial is that Linear Linear good Times a quadratic what Trinomial Trinomial awesome Go ahead and distribute that and see what you get When you think you have an answer do you wanna show it to the person next to you and see if you agree or disagree with each other Alright alrighty So Any exciting disagreements No Nothing No one differs from anyone else No Larry Thayer He just forgot to write his down Okay but now you re cool So everybody either feels like they got the same thing or they fixed what thought they had Alright that s boring Okay so what do get when you your first product done Three X cubed Alright and then 12 X squared And then Six X And then Nothing it s simplified It s done Okay So we ended up with a cubic trinomial Now here s what I wanna show you Somethin a little different because what s the raise your hand if you can tell me the verb we did here Cubic We been talkin the verb Distributed We distributed and we also what Simplified Which one s right They re both we simplified and we used distributing in order to simplify Okay so I m gonna put a verb up here And I ll even put distribute because that s specifically what we did Now here s what I m gonna do I m gonna give you a different thing I m gonna give you this I m gonna give you four A cubed plus two A squared minus 10 A And I m gonna spice this up just a little bit I m sorry about that change that 10 A to a 40 A Alright It s already simplified It s already simplified okay So I can t give you simplify for a verb I m gonna give you a different verb Now there s a better word than what I m about to put up here This isn t really a math word we re gonna replace it with a better one very shortly And here s a clue Undistributed How do you undistribute Let s shove this expression that you said s already simplified in a time machine Imagine you got like a have you guys ever seen like fast feed photography where there s a seed And it s like they speed up the footage and you see the seed germinate and you see the little stem grow and it s kind of all jerky and everything Okay can you imagine playing that backwards and you have a little sprout and it goes back in and it ends up as a little seed Right Imagine that this was on the page as a final answer and we put it in backwards to see how it might have started as a math problem Do you use the You can do that Do you use like the factor tree Say that a little louder Alec Do you use the factor trees Alec that s interesting that you asked Alec is asking about our warm up problem today which was a throw back to when you guys were in elementary school and you talked about things called factor trees And with factor trees we talk about how you can take a number and use a sledgehammer and kind of bust it up into it s what To it s factors To its factors and we keep goin until we can t do it anymore right Huh The deal with that is you have to figure out what was originally inside and outside of the parentheses You just gotta kinda ignore the A I guess Even ignoring the A like I don t know if putting it in a facts tree you really put it into parentheses Cause you don t really have a whole lot to work with there to put it back into parentheses I don t know It s kinda going against every fiber of my being and Like why would you make a math problem out of a perfectly nice number Yeah Okay that s interesting we ll come back to that cuz that s a really good point Why would you take like a 12 and turn it into a math problem what good does that do Yeah what good is that We ll come back to that that s an excellent question With big answers Yes sir what do you think I forgot what I was gonna say Ya sure Lauren what d ya think Isn t this kinda like checking it Lauren just said something interesting She said Isn t it kinda like checking it So when you check an equation for example what do you do Put it back in So when you solve an equation it s kinda like tying a knot And then when you put it in put in the solution and you check it it s kinda like untying the knot to see if comes out the same way But we don t have an equation to plug those into You re right Carolyn what were you gonna say Okay so you know how yesterday I know this is kind of off subject but I That s okay You know how yesterday like you showed us this problem on our worksheet and it was like three times the binomial or whatever When you said we were gonna do those today Can you be specific with the problem so I know what exactly It was number 50 on Oh oh you mean the problems that look like this Yeah the ones that we said we ve already done but we really haven t Like this And you guys wanted to make this what did you wanna make this X squared oh it feels so right doesn t it We ll come back to that in a second That is sort of related to this What were you gonna say Zach and then we ll take a closer look I was just gonna say couldn t there be different like when you unsimplify that couldn t there be different answers Or is there only one correct answer Can someone restate what he s sayin here Or what do you think he means by that Sam what do you think he means by that I think he means that when like you unsimplify it it can be with the two parentheses or it can be with one parentheses and the term in front of it So you re sayin maybe it s like this and there s something here Or maybe it s like this Yeah Cause this looks I ll tell you this looks an awful lot like the answer we got here And this didn t start off with a number that was distributed necessarily like this one It started off like this didn t it How do you figure out how to throw it backwards Cause that s just like You know what let s start with the easier one Which one of those is less complicated the blue one or the orange one The blue one I d agree let s start with this way and then maybe we can go up to the orange So if I wanted to again this is not a math term we re gonna use a better term in a little bit If I were to quote undistribute or use a vacuum cleaner to suck something out of all three of these terms would you agree that it has to be the same thing that we suck out of each one In other words can I pull a four out of this and an eight out of this yeah Okay Any suggestions Let s just focus on the coefficients any suggestions on what I can pull out A two A two okay Anything else Four Can I pull a four let s go door to door Can he give me a four Can he give me a four Can she So if there was a four out there I would have to think what was in there to distribute a four two to make two I m gonna avoid fractions here Yeah see he s avoiding fractions I could I could technically pull out anything But with the factor tree we did at the beginning of class typically when you talk about that s a good point When we talk about factors we stick with whole numbers Okay Or maybe even integers but we usually don t go into fractions Sam what re you thinkin To unsimplify it couldn t you put in one of those boxes that we did yesterday for the terms Like put it in the middle and then find what it is Oh yeah Why you re talkin when we were doing this And then ask ourselves what would go here that s a weird question mark What would there and what would go there That s interesting Alec what are you thinking Couldn t you take out an A with that two Like on the problem Since it all has A s If you can take out a can you put out an A like you took out the two Can he give up an A Yes Can he give up an A Yes She give up an A Yes Well let s try that let s try that that s interesting So if I were to quote and again we re not gonna use this word much after the next Would you if you were to quote undistribute a two A from four A cubed what would that look like What would have to be here It would have to be a two A squared Well okay let s keep goin and then we ll check to see if this makes sense I ll get your question in one second Caroline So then what would be next So the two from the two would leave a ghost one And then the A from the A squared would be a what Oscar I was thinkin one A One A alright I d like that And then the two A from the negative 40 A would be a what Negative 20 Negative 20 A So now we re back to what Justin said We ve taken a perfectly nice simplified polynomial and turned it into a math problem Let s see if this is even right What do you think we could do to check ourselves like Lauren suggested Do the problem What do you mean do the problem Simplified Okay so let s simplify it real quick What s two A times two A and no peeking Four A squared What s two A times two A cubed I mean squared Four A cubed good And what s two A times A That s two A squared What kind Positive two A squared And two A times negative 20 Negative 40 A Oh it worked Yeah I have a question Yes ma am What exactly is the point of this That s an excellent question Shhhhhh ready Why on earth would you do such a horrible rotten thing Well one day shhhh One day what if you had this beast Holy Cow Whoa Do you guys know where to start No I don t know But check this out Didn t you just say we could take this and turn it That s the same thing we had right So can I factor that and turn that into two A times two A squared plus A minus 20 Are you cool with that Are you okay if I just leave the bottom Two A squared plus A minus 20 Anybody have an idea what might happen now Did you guys know that you ve been doin that since the fourth grade No Yes you have Just with much less obnoxious numbers What does 16 32 what does that let me use another What does that simplify to Here s why you guys probably already knew this Let s leave the 16 alone and isn t 32 two times 16 Yeah Ohhh That s the math That s the math that justifies simplifying fractions like you ve been doin since you were like eight years old That s cool What other occasion this is gonna be helpful How do you undo plus or adding when you re solving equations Subtraction Subtraction you call in the opposite right How do you undo multiplication You divide Divide well here s what we re leading up to How are you gonna undo the squared Factoring busts up the squared for us And it s gonna be a very important tool when we re solving what kind of equations do you think we can call these Think about it Look at the degree Oh quadratic Quadratic equations Alright let s take a look at another one Let me have you undistribute one again We need a better word for this Did we call this unmulltiplying No What did we call the verb here what was the verb on this Division
