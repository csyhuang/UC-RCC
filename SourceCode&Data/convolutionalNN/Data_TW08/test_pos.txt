 Emotions Is emotions that s so right Kippa were you going to say something else In this picture he uses lots of texture to create like when he s doing the sunflowers he uses texture to show the light going on Right and how did he show that texture did he how did he apply his paint Sometimes he would squirt it straight from the tube onto the canvas because he wanted to do it fast Sometimes he would squirt straight from the tube and he would paint so thick Vincent would that you could almost feel it feel the texture And emotion like Ozea said Emotion was huge for Vincent If he was happy he painted bright If he was sad he painted sort of dark How about our man Pablo Picasso What movement Logan is he Do you know the move Cubism Cubism And why do you guys know what the characteristics are of cubism Anybody besides Mr Logan anybody else know But thanks Logan for raising What are you thinking what Using geometric shapes to make things Using geometric shapes that s right He was very involved in geometric shapes and you can even see and flattening the shapes and flattening his color Where Van Gogh used his color to really be part of his painting and it could be bright or it could be dull or a mixture of the two Picasso used very flat shapes of color and you can even see that in his self portrait I wanna put up the work Let s start with our man Vincent again Let s take a look at See where my hand Oooh You can see all the wrinkles in my hand No way Isn t that cool Okay Sorry don t mean to keep fooling around So let s talk about this Let s talk about these two paintings guys What do you guys and let s see if someone else maybe can answer or talk about something What do you see do you guys see a difference between these two paintings right here Anybody somebody besides Kippa Carina That it kinda has to deal with his emotion like where the boats are I feel like what I m feeling is that he was kinda depressed and very sad because the skies were kinda dark and stuff And then at the sunflowers he s really happy and bright and That was good Carina Okay Elijah did you wanna Was that about what you were gonna say You were gonna talk about the sadness What colors like do you think that if Go ahead Elijah He could ve been in the boat because on the computer the boats were really bright colors but the sky was darkened more but the boats were all light yellow and dark light red and all these other bright colors Right and I remember you saying that when you showed me with the picture from the computer that s why I looked at you because you were talking about he must have been conflicted with his emotions wasn t that what you were saying Yeah he was feeling both happy and sad cause the sky was darkened and then the boats were really bright and the sea was darkened too Right that s good Okay Jose what did you wanna say He s sort of like there too but the boats might be out to sea Like one s out to sea but one s not but torn I don t know how many are already but Three are out in I don t know how many are out There s four that are here and then there look like four that are out I think that s the other Okay but what were you going to say Oh you re right three Well what were you gonna say about them I m guessing three two or three were the family of six kids and the mom and a dad But they could only take three because there s only enough for There s enough room for only three boats or three people But they only wanted their own boat two or three of them were but three didn t go because they didn t know what to do or anything but the other three did Interesting that was sort of your story behind the picture that you saw Kind of Yeah I like that I like that Trevor what re you gonna say It s kinda like medium of a position between sad and happy because the sunflowers they re mostly up but looks like they re starting to droop They re starting to die That is good I like that He might be like Oh I m happy for a while but I m starting to feel back down Nice Did you wanna say something I would like to say one has different types of One looks more real Those ships on the top look a little bit more real than the Than the bottom more realistic than this picture He really pushed his color lips in the sunflowers I think Does anybody know what were you gonna say Elijah You can see in the sunflower one like at the very top there s bright yellow but when you go down a little bit it s orange and then at the very bottom it s dark green Like right there Yes that is very true That is very good The storms and the sunflowers is trying to say that nothing is never everlasting Wow Kyle Happiness is never lasting and what was the last one I m moved by that opinion Go ahead and what was the So in the flowers the flowers are happy but then they start to droop and die Because happiness can be fleeting And we know Oh does anybody know what was the political was there any political things going on The political mood or the setting Where was Vincent from did you guys find that in your research He stayed in France is that where he studied Is that what you guys are telling me Yeah That was sorta the hub of his movement we ll say Any other facts that you guys know about the artwork that s up You can look on your research papers to see Or anything Go ahead Emily I think that the actual emotions of these paintings don t really connect at all with the political mood because when he painted the bright sunflower one so awesome it was kind of a dark time in France So really I don t think they were much of a Really affected him What were you Going along with Emily maybe he was just so dull that or maybe it was coming to an end when he painted them Because if there was a war or some sort of bad time and it was coming to an end he was probably starting to feel better about it because it was ending So it depends maybe he was going through things like maybe a very happy thing happened in his life then Because he didn t have the happiest of all lives so He didn t We ve even talked about that Do you guys remember when we talked about how Vincent Van Gogh suffered a little bit mentally He was a little Crazy Crazy and in and out of mental institutions Yeah so maybe something good happened Cause his life was not very happy So most of his pictures are No not most of them but quite a few of them are actually quite dull But you can tell when he s going through joy because he has those bright colors coming in Like the boats you can see a little bit of happiness in them but the majority of it is dark and sort of sad And then if you look at the sunflowers they re all bright and dreamy I mean yes this is a few dark bits but I think that s probably a time when he was going through something that was better in his life Guys this is really great I love all your comments Logan I m gonna take one more and then I m gonna tell you something What go ahead Logan I thought maybe that he was painting it and then something happened Like maybe he heard that war was breaking out or something And then he started painting it sad I have a question I think that You ve got something really important hon Yeah so he never really stopped a painting in the middle When he started he finished He never stopped Because if the light changed it would totally change the picture That s so true That is very true And you guys know that Jose is it okay if I speak real quick and then we ll go back because we wanna talk about Picasso too for a minute You guys know that Vincent used to live with a painter This is my fun fact Not really fun I guess But a fact about Vincent He lived with a painter Paul Gauguin This was when he was in and out of mental institutions And they had a fight and he became so upset you guys know he cut off his ear And I showed you that one picture of him is a self portrait of him with his ear cut off You guys remember that And the other important thing I wanted to tell you was that he didn t sell any of his works during his lifetime but he did sell one of his paintings after After he died they sold one of his paintings for 8 000 000 000 Remember that It was the most expensive painting ever sold at the time Okay now let s talk about And Van Gogh people if you guys wanna talk about Picasso you can but let s give the Picasso teams some time here This is And I m sorry the lighting is not the best But who knows what the name of this painting is Marie Is it Three Musicians Three Musicians And it was done by who Pablo Pablo Picasso Does anybody know where Pablo Picasso was from Let s see someone other than Mr Logan Travis Barcelona Barcelona Where s Barcelona you guys Spain Spain I got my Barcelona jersey Alright and who knows Rudy do you happen to know And he s like Uh oh I m on the spot Ooo Do you happen to know what movement or style he painted in Pablo Picasso In Cubism Cubism that s correct And we did go over what were the characteristics of cubism real fast Anybody Mr Logan Geometric shapes Geometric shapes and what else They were flat What was flat His pictures But what element His painting the colors The colors were flat Thank you Okay let s have some opinion about what you see up here The Three Musicians does anybody have Randy do you have any how do you feel about it honey What do you think about it I don t know It doesn t seem like it s in a down mood cause music is usually a happy sort of thing So it seems like a happy kinda picture Kind of a happy fun picture Pablo he wasn t so concerned about emotions when he painted He maybe was influenced by the political setting of his time Does anybody know what was happening in Spain at the time What are you thinking Civil war There was a civil war So maybe he was a little bit affected by that He also traveled Does anybody know where he traveled to Rudy To go and study the art forms of Paris He went to Paris because it was of all the artwork and stuff So he went to study there and then where else He went to Africa He went to Africa and he really became obsessed with African masks And so he did start using that as an influence in his painting Carina what were you gonna say darling Oh I was thinking it s kind of like a mix of emotions cause it has so many colors There s bright orange and yellow and then if you look deeper there s a blue and a black and it kind of just grabs your attention It s attention grabbing isn t it Cause of all the contrasting I think more in his is the contrasting colors You can see the blue and orange right next to each other Those are colors that lie opposite each other on the color wheel and they make for very bright they totally stand off each other Right the blue and the orange I can t remember what Oh they re complementary colors I couldn t remember what that was Right so that s why And I think his color contrast says a lot His flat colors and they re bright and he puts them right next to each other What do you think about this picture Robert Do you like it Yeah Do you know why you might like it or you don t like it I like the picture like yeah Well you and Maria are talking about doing remember you were talking about making your own picture You wanna tell us about that what you guys wanna do For your own picture And you re doing the style of Pablo aren t you Yeah So what do you think you guys are gonna do Have a picture of me and my brother and a picture of the Three Musicians on a porch You wanna have the Three Musicians be in a picture with you and your brother And Maria are you gonna Not on a porch On a deck That s what I was gonna say And you guys are gonna are you guys gonna reduce it down to geometric shapes The picture Yeah Try to Good good Do you guys have anybody Oh what were you gonna say Elijah It makes me think about it because there s so many twists and turns and curves and things Kinda like if you look hard enough you can see em but when you just look at it you re like Whoa Right when you first look at it you re like Whoa what is that Are those people Are those shapes There s lots of curves and turns At first it s a little confusing At first it is a little confusing isn t it When you actually pick a name and you actually try to look for em you can actually see what it is Right if we didn t tell you it was the Three Musicians you might not know at first You can kinda tell because of that one right there That thing yeah The instrument here And the guitar And then the paper with the two The sheet music The sheet music you could kinda tell it was about the musicians What were you gonna say When you first look at the painting your eyes are immediately drawn to the first guy in blue s clarinet Whereas if you peeked a minute and look at it you can actually kinda see instruments like they were saying At first when you just but instead you just see a whole bunch of colors and then you look at it and it kinda starts to form It does start to form What were you gonna say Emily I think that in my 
 Exactly Right So what do you all think about the fact that this is written almost sort of journalistically I know you re the big newspaper man and everything What do you think about that That s what I m talking about I m talking about the growth of the poem overall The first passage it s almost not objective but it kind of states what s happening It doesn t actually say what the author is thinking As the poem grows and goes on and goes to the next passages it becomes more poetic and more descriptive and it s more of the author s point of view and the author s stance on what s happening Nora what do you think about the poem so far I thought it was a good like utilization of the message I m taking African American history this year Okay We ve been talking about the slave trade the last few weeks So that first part we were talking about how they were like the sickness What are the specific lines that you think best describe the sickness and the death and everything We have jettisoned the blind to no avail It spread The terrifying sickness spreads It s claws have scratched the sight from the captain s eyes The slaves were all tied together in their own so the sickness and disease could spread through them But also the slavers like the white people on the ship were also susceptible to disease That s where they got the idea of whites becoming more like the blacks because they re in such close quarters that it s inevitable almost and the fact that they are holding themselves above them superior as civilized but they re still acting acts of barbarism is very much a historical principle So you really think that there s a moment of transformation in this poem where the whites who are theoretically the real barbaric people become like the blacks who they think are savages I don t think it s even a point of transformation I believe that the author Robert Hayden is talking about this as it has been So this kind of opens in maybe a stress when they re sailing on the slave ship and they talk about this and it s like there s all sorts of imagery throughout this that implies that these blacks are er these whites are becoming like the blacks What s your favorite line that shows this Nick Standing to America bringing home black gold black ivory black seed Now I especially liked the middle part of that black ivory Because ivory is usually white Of course Yes Yeah So you have the juxtaposition of black and white Yes I think the lines after that Deep in the festering hold thy father lies of his bones New England pews are made those are altar lights that were his eyes Jordan what do you think the about this religious connotation Well seeing that I m not too familiar with the Bible Judaism and Christianity are similar but in these two paragraphs that you were just reading I saw a big contrast between the glory of taking back these animals these slaves and making the best of them in the new world Between that and the evil that they re really bestowing upon the slaves Standing to America bringing home black gold black ivory black seed is kind of glory and that contrast between evil Deep in the festering hold thy father lies of his bones New England pews are made those are altar lights that were his eyes They also kind of need a religious figure throughout this voyage because throughout this we see that they re going through a time of spiritual crisis What port awaits us Davy Jones or home I ve heard of slavers drifting drifting play things of wind and storm and chance their crews gone blind the jungle hatred crawling up on deck It s like they understand that they re becoming uncivilized and they re trying to find a way to change this To justify their actions Yeah That s what they need a justification for their actions So they say God is with them and everything is okay And you have that sort of anaphora of the hymn that Jesus our Savior pilot throughout this entire thing that sort of brings and invokes the God into all of this so that it s almost as if to me they re looking for their justification They re looking to justify the horrific actions that they re putting out Which is ironic because these are often these spirituals are often sung by slaves to get through all of the times of turmoil So it s ironic that they re claiming that God is on their side as a justification for the enslaving of blacks I think it s also ironic though that the blacks are the ones who receive the justification from a lot of the whites in the new world At the end talking about John Quincy Adams he says it was completely justified what the blacks did when they revolted and attacked the white slavers The suffering that they had been enduring And that s like the moment of irony Yeah The slavers are saying How paradoxical indeed that you whose wealth whose tree of liberty are rooted in the labor of your slaves should suffer the august John Quincy Adams to speak with so much passion of the right of chattel slaves to kill their lawful masters And with his Roman rhetoric weave a hero s garland for Cinquez This is what I want you all to think about Think about the historical connections here John Quincy Adams one of our founding fathers fourth president of the United States was ultimately the man who got freedom or found freedom in court for Cinquez and the other slaves that were on the Amistad which is a ship that of course being discussed in here Think about these historical connections I shall return All right group What s going on We re talking about a poem You re talking about a poem I m going to talk about a poem too What a coincidence I know Isn t it coincidental What s going on What are you all discussing so far We re looking for the marrow part You re looking for the marrow part Yeah I m glad you all have your Beloveds out and everything What really interests me is the fact I think we have a real instance here where the 60 million or more to whom the book was dedicated This is their story is it not What do you all think How can we connect our reading of this poem to our reading of Beloved In the second part in the last paragraph it says The fever is melting down my bones Yes Right now we re connecting that to Stamp Paid who at some point had said that he was tired in his marrow as in his bone marrow We re looking for the page right now Okay Found it Okay And it s on this Whoa What is that Read the passage to us My marrow is tired he thought I ve been tired all my days bone tired but now it s in the marrow It must be what Baby Suggs felt when she lay down and thought about color for the rest of her life Okay So let s connect what you say in this stanza you have I d be trading still but for the fevers melting down my bones What is it about that stanza that you want to connect to this allusion We thought that her fever is melting down we thought that it was it s pretty much the exact same connection because it s bones going into the marrow so the outside going into the inside The fever is melting down to my bones it s just taking a different way And to get more than a physiological point of view here the marrow is where Where is the marrow In your bones It s like the core So Raphael when we re suggesting that the marrow is being corrupted in some way what does it mean for us It basically means that the entirety of the whole of the being is being corrupted Okay So in essence then from a symbolic point of view just like in Beloved we can relate this to the poem What kind of corruption do you see here For me it was mainly corruption of hypocrisy Okay Hypocrisy in what context Mainly that the enslavers honestly believed that they were in the right that they were different like this passage this short passage here It sickens me to think of what I saw of how these apes throw overboard the butchered bodies of our men true Christians all like so much jetsam Yes And then at the very beginning they re talking about how they re throwing slaves overboard Or even when the slaves decide to Lost three this morning leaped with crazy laughter to the wading sharks sang as they went under Yeah So there s this sort of weird juxtaposition of the whites being thrown over by the savages or the apes at the end versus the slaves who choose to jump over at the beginning Laura what do you think is going on in this particular context With all of the jumping off board it s a true escape to eternal freedom I guess if you believe in Heaven The thing that confuses me is I understand why the savage blacks would throw the whites over obviously death and more of a pain but it also ends their misery in a way of staying on the ship with the slaves getting the sickness the blindness and having to wait I think it s like another three weeks before they come to port So it s really contrasting and interesting how it goes back and forth This poem focuses I think on both sides on black and white Yes It really does illustrate both Which do you think is best illustrated Laura the black side or the white side The black side is really I don t want to say common but it s similar to everything you hear about slave ships And the slave trade and the slave trade So I think it s interesting that Hayden decided to also put in the white side of it because you don t really focus on what came of slavery Even though it was a horrible thing on the last page here it says That you whose wealth whose tree of liberty are rooted in the labor of your slaves I thought it was interesting because I often fail to make the connection that through the slavery we actually were able to grow as a country and through our liberty first we were able to bring the slaves out eventually through the Civil War Jordan continue I was looking at more of the religious side of it as with what you were just talking about Here it says Their moaning is a prayer for death Yes Some try to starve themselves And then you go down one two three four stanzas later it says Jesus Savior pilot me over life s tempestuous sea We pray that thou will grant O Lord safe passage to our vessels bringing heathen souls It s not so much praying for death it s praying and knowing that Jesus can lead them to freedom forever and allow them out of Who is praying for Jesus here Jordan The slaves Really That s how I took it Okay Did anybody here take it a different way I took it as the sailors Exactly Good Not that that s I think you re on to something in the sense that the religion of the slavers was eventually forced upon the slaves themselves So I think that they could be So I think there s a real sort of duality there For this point in history they evangelized Evangelized They had already Evangelized Yes It s a hard word to say Africa I know the Dutch for example had already been there So historically speaking then Raphael when you say it s the slavers that are the ones that are praying what s ironic about all of this That they re so much in the wrong and they don t see it all and that kind of hypocrisy And they re looking for justification for their actions Speaking of justification what I want you to think about now for a few minutes I m going to talk to the other group up front here why is it that the white side of things is all reported to us literally through almost a journalistic style It s all quotes It s all basically kind of like it s from a ship s log So think about this and I m going to be back to talk to you about it All right group what s going on It s all going on It s all going on Okay Tell me What have we discussed Everything Everything Tell me more Well we ve discussed about how in this stanza That there was hardly room tween decks for half the sweltering cattle stowed spoon fashion there that some went mad of thirst and tore their flesh and sucked the blood That was talking about the capture of the Africans Yes Who wouldn t be so thirsty that they wouldn t tear open their own skin and drink their own blood Which is just crazy in terms of the suffering Yeah And how that shows that in some way they were driven into some sorts of savagery And yet in the next stanza it talks about how the crew would lay with the The Guinea Rose Yeah The crew and cabin lusted with the comeliest of the savage girls kept naked in the cabins Okay Well let s talk about it for just a second We have a real juxtaposition of pleasure and suffering What do you think Yeah It s a real contrast between describing these people as sweltering cattle ripping their flesh open and then it goes right into how the crew like would sleep with these women Exactly They re fully taking advantage of them Imagine being kept naked in a cabin for the whole journey Yeah It s a very big contrast because they are calling them animals So what happens after their lust In the stanzas right before we begin section two of the poem what details are we given about what happens to this specific crew They abandon the ship It goes up in flames Exactly So it s basically set on fire and then what happens 
 What you just said They re going to go back together Well I ve glued them down so they can t The green and the red charts are locked down in place They can t get back but I ve taken up the orange field Wouldn t it generate a new field They re going to make a new field and that new field will be Say it again Oh like the earlier drawing We can actually say a little more than that In this vicinity here They ll be trying to pull each other back together So we re going to end up with a field that s exactly opposite What we did was they move around As long as it s still running They move apart until the field is basically nullified Let s look at one more example Do you have one more potato shape in there Most people Most people right So let s start for this last one let s look at this shape and say that I observe fields coming out like that Write down a couple of observations before you make your prediction Based on what you re seeing in there what can you say about what you see Are those lines all supposed to be straight Yeah To the best of my drawing ability they re horizontal parallel lines My drawing was perfect Mr Shields what They re going in two directions The orange Yeah the orange one Like a very large plate It could be just a potato in there and that s The thing in your hand This one Yep Okay let s take a look Chris can I get you to shut the door to keep the noise down We ll give you a break in about 10 minutes or so It s nice to have the extra period here First thing before we talk about this new one I failed to address Hannah s question and good insight earlier Yes The orange lines in here will be drawn into the negative and they re going to bend and will be coming outward from the positive end So you re definitely going to see this sort of pattern I think people saw a little bit of that in the simulations Anytime you ve got a conducting material Anytime you ve got a conducting material the field lines always intersect exactly perpendicular with It s a conductor So it definitely makes a difference when you call it a conductor and look at what happened in the field Let s talk about this new one There s a couple of observations Ian give me one observation and Claire give me the second observation Besides the fact that the lines are straight No that s a good one The lines are straight Very important Claire They re going in opposite directions Exactly opposite directions Okay Hakim give me another one Well the lines are coming out of it Okay they re coming outward not inward Good To indicate that the Okay so that one we know from the very first piece here The net charge is positive The fact that they re horizontal They indicate like a plate or something Yeah is it like two parallel plates Two parallel plates So where would you draw them Above and below There are two on top So like above and below like this Four plates Four plates Let s make it 16 But if you had a plate and the thing is neutral or no net charge and then they would just But what if you had one positive plate straight up and down the middle then it would push away on both sides Two positive plates Two plates sounds twice as good as one but I m not sure that it is Four plates sounds even more appealing An infinite number of plates sounds fantastic I m hearing good ideas here I want you guys to think about what it would look like in different scenarios So two positive plates Okay two positive plates and I m looking at the vicinity in the middle here is that right And do I want my two positive plates to be on the sides Negative plates Well negative plates okay Two negative plates on the sides like this so the field would look like what Bend Okay we re getting a bending because if I draw it here But you still have to compare It d be like this kind of a picture It d still be bent Greater than the distance Okay so you ve got So based on that you ve got some things going on above and below that should be penetrating into that shape What about two infinitely long Two infinitely long plates Both negative What would the field look like Forge the potato shape What would the field look like in the vicinity of two infinitely long evenly charged negative plates Wouldn t they go If I take a single positive test charge and release it right in the middle what would it do What if I release it a little bit to the left side An infinitely long plate We derived this one before a single one Remember the equation for the field or the general shape of the field from an infinite plane It s constant It s a constant exactly right Brittany didn t even have to look at her notes on that one But you remember what was our analogy to an infinitely large plate Yeah gravity on the earth here you know big flat earth I don t care how far above the ground I am it s the same number it doesn t change at all That s exactly right So an infinite plate the field is some number another identical infinite plate it nullifies it So in the same charge okay Well that isn t going to work Infinitely far Infinitely far away from each other When Brittney says it s a constant even if you go to infinity I guess it d still be a constant either that or you go to zero It would be two sets one set like that except that they are horizontal and vertical and they re infinitely far away where Two horizontal plates like this Yeah because I don t think that s going to work either Ben you re getting agitated back there And what are you saying We were just talking You re saying there s no way in the world they can be infinite Is that what you re saying Yeah You can t have an infinite plane anything because you re defining the shape So that s a good question When I ve got the shape here do we require that the thing that I m talking about fit inside of the shape No I m going to say no Okay so does that change your answer Okay I think we can and will look at situations where the surface And remember this is all leading up to that Gaussian surface idea we mentioned on Friday Where the Gaussian surface does not fully enclose an object Like an infinite plane we need to be able to study those even though I can t fit it inside of a box So we have to expand a little bit to the possibility that whatever it is is inside of there An infinitely long positive plate right in the middle Right in the middle Is that what you said about seven minutes ago Yeah I tried to ignore him because I didn t want you guys to get the answer too quick But I do want to acknowledge him Yeah tell me if this makes sense and why Somebody besides John and Ian It doesn t make sense that I ve got a plate and this is slicing my potato in half and it s a positive plate Would it have to be infinitely long Much longer If I don t Now I m not very good at drawing in 3D so is the potato lines are they diverging this way at all I can t tell They re uniform this way parallel lines this way so we know that it has to be infinite this way And not have divergence this way Well I didn t draw any lines coming out of the Do they have to be parallel to the ones that are on the board or would they be diverging That s going to change the answer that you give If I draw another red line that s coming like this that s clearly diverging from this red line So I m going to assume that every line for this problem every line that I draw is parallel and then we ll get a new Perpendicular with the plate Yeah perpendicular to the board And then all positive coming out both sides Very good Alright I ve got one more drawing on there I want to hit and then we ll just say some fantastic summary words and then I ll give you guys a break The last one here instead of the three dimensional shape now all I ve got is a single sheet of paper And this sheet of paper I ve got I noticed I noticed parallel lines arrows coming straight out of that shape Write down a couple of observations on it quick and then see if you can predict based on what you observed here what and where if you want to what the source of the field lines is What can we learn from the electric field lines They re all coming out parallel in one direction Yes parallel in one direction One direction They re parallel this way and they re parallel this way also So they re normal to the surface everywhere Are they coming from the other side All I see is lines penetrating this way so I could actually draw them like this and that s fine Do you know anything about the other side of the plate like is there anything there It s a two dimensional structure and the arrows penetrate Oh okay Yeah they re not diverging at all Yeah uniform orthogonal all that good stuff Into the paper So they re coming out of here They re going into here and coming out here Oh okay To the differences that s a closed shape This is a two dimensional surface If I had wrapped it around like this it would make a difference right Okay guys let s see what we ve got here I m going to ask Paul first Emily second and then we ll see if Michael can go for the trifecta Oh no No pressure You can be wrong it s alright Paul what is based on your observations what is the thing that you think is the source of the electric field here Where is it coming from that it makes this pattern in this object on this sheet I think this is like the second or the third example we did when it was passing through Where they re just passing through Yeah So then where do you think it s coming from What does that tell you about the source of the electric field I m not sure You have more to say No Emily give it a try Since it s positive on this side Yup You can see that there might be a positive charge Okay so if I had a positive charge on this side I would get electric field lines going like this That s correct okay Or if you had a negative charge Ah okay so you re answering two things which is pretty overachieving but I like it that you re saying that instead of a positive back here it could be a negative over here Okay now there s something incomplete about what you re saying The positive here versus there could be a negative here that s a great insight that it could be one or the other but Michael s going to help us out because you re a little incomplete on what you re telling us They have to be infinite Infinite Infinitely strong charge Infinitely long whatever a plane A plane yeah A plane back here that s infinitely large distributive charge that s positive That s the only way to get a uniform field here Can it work with what Emily was saying about it could be a negative over here It could be an infinitely long thing here There s one more option Does anybody It could be intro That this piece of paper here is neutral And you could just put a new positive charge But be careful Any positive charge if I start off with the very first drawing and I look at what happens when I put a sheet here the field lines are like this They re diverging I m not having divergence here at all So it can t come from any old point source We are going to assume that this thing is neutral though Okay that itself is not It s just capturing the story of what s going on Hannah Could there be both a positive and negative along the plate Yeah you can have both You bet That seems like a little bit of overkill but as long as you re making your sheet infinite in size you might as well make two infinite s You have all your infinite That s right And two parallel plates two plates that are parallel to each other one positive one negative is a very common thing So common in fact that it s on my tie today Oh yeah there it is See that Hakim do you have a question Okay so it s the positive plane that s standing or negative plane Yeah the infinite plane The infinite plane I was about to say that That it would be infinite Yeah I think Michael was saying that it would probably be Not the charge distribution the sigma how much charge per unit area will be some number but it would just keep on going on Chris Yeah you know that would be a lot Reasonably speaking if something goes to infinity all of your homework is easy So there s no purpose for me doing that What is the answer Infinity or zero It s got to be one Infinitely large in size with a uniform charge distribution does add up to an infinite charge but it s distributed infinitely far away So that s okay Now remember the goal of this as we were getting into this today is to figure out what can we learn from an electric field And here s the thing In the first three or four examples or five I guess for some people if I take a closed surface I can learn a lot Not everything necessarily but I can learn about what s inside of that Infinitively is the first one positive Yes Yes The next one that I drew was negative absolutely This most recent closed surface it had to be a positive plate shoved in there This last one with just a two dimensional structure to measure with to gauge what s happening I don t know everything We ve got a lot of ambiguity And this is why with Gauss law we need to use this closed surface We need to look at it from all sides We need to be fully envelop in what s going on or else we might miss something We ll go back again The equation that I showed you last week we ll put that on the board in a few minutes when we come back from a break as well as looking at a couple of scenarios just conceptually how we can draw these things to capture all that field Go ahead and take a break and be back in five minutes 
 On a regular basis Have you ever thought about what that causes I mean what causes wind to blow in the first place Whether it be a breeze Whether it be a hurricane Whether it be a tornado Would you take a few minutes in your notebook would you just draw a line write after what you wrote And I want you to give your best explanation of what the heck causes wind Just do this on your own first What could cause wind to blow Take a few moments just on your own Just like always guys you don t have to be right here I just want to know anything that you think might contribute to wind blowing On a big scale on a small scale Anything that you ve got that we can build on anything that you put down Alright when you have this discussion in a few moments share your ideas with each other And then remember one person will be called from the group to share either what you put down or what somebody else did Talk to each other See what everyone there is thinking What ideas do we have The air pressure and temperature changes and so it kind of like shocks and it creates wind That s good I think wind develops because clouds carries that air I don t really know much Alright folks When we go let s use let s see who gets to share Person two We re going to go with person two And let me switch this over here real quick so I can write down some of your ideas Hold on Alright where d my pen go Okay here we go Person two And we re going to start over here Did you guys have any ideas why wind to blow No table seven Sorry I don t know but I said heat and cold air rising and falling Cause I know how hang gliding gives us columns of air rising heat rising how you get in the air I m really not sure so I m just thinking Okay so something about hot air rising and cool air falling And like how they re Say that again And cold and hot air going over mountains Different land masses Okay very interesting Now she had the toughest job From now on every other person number two that goes you have to either come up with a different theory a different idea or you can agree or disagree with what Miah had to say But you cannot say I don t know Okay So you gotta kinda run with what s been said Keisha we re going to go back to you first What was your thought at your group Well we agree with Miah because basically we said the same thing that like the temperature of the air can have something to do with the wind Okay So I m just going to add on here temperature I was going to add pressure Temperature okay That may be something different Let s see what we can add to this So you re agreeing with Miah that it may have something to do with the temperatures of the air Yeah Okay Table three you guys had a different kind of theory We agree with what she said except we also thought the pressure how the wind blows and stuff Okay so you guys talked mostly about pressure Yeah Could you pass that up to table two So far we have two theories One has been agreed to already We have temperature pressure Our group wasn t sure But I agree with Kavya in how the pressure You re thinking that it s something do with pressure And okay there s an agreement here with temperature as well Pass that up to table one Prescott what kind of ideas did you guys have Well we were talking and we kinda agree with A or hot air rising And pressure and air too but I was thinking that currents or air currents carry the wind or carry the air faster Okay so let me add something about currents in here Cause that s another kind of interesting thing So are currents separate from these two Or the same Or added on to Or they another thing all together Just added on I guess Okay so we ve got temperature of the air we ve got pressure of the air and we ve got something to do with currents Could you pass that over to Conner Conner what is your thought We kind of agreed that pressure of the air probably makes the wind Like low pressure and high pressure You know that s an interesting thing with the low pressure What would cause air to be different pressures I thought maybe the Earth s core and the gravity pulls down more in some places than others Okay so let s see So you re agreeing with pressure and you re kind of saying the pressures have something to do with gravity Really interesting Oops hang on Something to do with gravity causing different pressures Pass that back to David David what did your conversation involve Well I thought the I really didn t know exactly what makes the wind blow but if I had to guess I d say it s air masses meeting Let s put that down Okay Hold on And you threw out something that says air masses meeting Alright so when you talk about air masses give us more of what you thought of what that is What do you mean an air mass And when they meet how would that produce wind Well I know that when warm and moist air mass collides with a cool dry air mass it forms a thunderstorm I was thinking of one warm air mass meets another warm air mass then when they collide it might produce wind I don t know why that s just my guess No no that s fine So you re thinking when you re saying when two different kinds of air masses meet it makes a thunderstorm But maybe when two of the same meet it makes wind Yeah So let me put that on So air masses meeting So since we re talking only about wind right now it s the same kind of air mass meeting Alright Would you pass that back to Ah Nathan we re going to have you go since Amber already went today Back over to Nathan Nathan what did your conversation revolve around back there Well we didn t really know but based on what everyone said I agree with Miah that it s the hot air rising and the cooler falling But I also think that David s ideas are kind of interesting I agree with A You re agreeing with A that it has something to do with the temperatures Miah what s your thought I also thought what David said cause I know how tornadoes are formed But then I thought air masses are way too big And I know almost all over the continent get a lot of wind And so I think it might have something to do with air meeting together I think that has to do with hot and cold air kind of mashing Okay so You said with hot air rising and cool air falling And then you said something about hot and cool air mashing So when you talk about them mashing are they like coming together and like swirling together What do you mean by mashing Mixing not mashing Mixing Yeah just kind of colliding together but not swirling Okay so when you re saying hot air rising cool air falling you re saying that those two things are mixing and it s by the mixing together that s what s causing the wind Yes Okay Guys take a second I want you to talk we ve got two more tables to go But I want you to take a few moments talk about the theories that have been presented so far and see if your opinions change so far And then any questions that come up based on it Talk to each other Alright guys about ten seconds Everybody time And three two and one Great ideas so far guys Let s go to the last Any questions or comments come up in your discussion that you just had Yes Well I think that if two of the same air masses meet it would just make a larger air mass I mean if you re adding water with water it s just making more water Huh so you re saying instead of wind being created you would just have a bigger one And I also think maybe it creates a thunderstorm if it s two of the different air masses but maybe I think that would create wind like negative and positive magenets refusing to mix You re bringing a couple of interesting things You re saying when a warm air mass and a cold air mass meet you re saying that those are kind of like magnets Like opposite sides attract Am I understanding what you re saying Sorry I mean both of the I m a little confused Also I would kind of agree with David now because if I m thinking about magnets then two of the same magnets would refuse Right So would that analogy be a wind refusing Or would coming together be more like the wind I think that analogy would work with the two different temperatures of air mass but there s the magnets are the same the air masses are That s really interesting when you go and you apply to analogy like a magnet like that which is really cool to bring in Let me get the two other theories and we ll come back to that How big are air masses Well let me come back to that Let me get the two others and make sure we get some other theories in Richard what d you guys end up talking about Did it change as you saw these ideas Yeah so originally we were thinking that it might have something to do with gravity s movement Actually we thought it would probably be more something like a change in air pressure You know I m going to because I think that s an interesting theory I m going to put it up here anyway You said it had something to do with gravity and the movement of the planet itself So with gravity and movement of the Earth Okay and then once you started throughout this round you re thinking more it has to do with changing pressure Okay and you agree with what Connor was it you that was saying that it was the gravity that was causing the change in pressure Yeah So are you feeling like are you taking your idea and kinda hooking it together Or does something else cause a change in pressure Okay alright That s fine Where s the mic Can you pass it up Here I ll come get it Abigail last theory Go Well at first we weren t sure And we were talking about kind of atoms moving like molecules and compounds moving away from each other and combining But then we changed our opinions and think that like the pressure of air and the temperature of the air and the compounds that make up the air moving and changing make wind from the combination So you re really mashing it all together So your theory revolves around molecules moving away from each other That was the first part And then did that end up causing pressures did you say No like and then the different types of air kinda combined I guess So then molecules move away from each other When you say different types of air So like warm hot and pressure And those combine Should I add that to this I don t know Tom Yeah Tom I have a question How would two air masses meet if they didn t have wind to bring them Well now that s an interesting question Do air masses now that s a really interesting question Are air masses just these big masses of air And then wind blows them around Because then it wouldn t make the wind if it couldn t if it couldn t come together it couldn t make wind Oh now that s a really interesting thing So is the wind Oh wow Is wind a result of the air masses Or do air masses need wind to move Well that s a really good question Ben you had a hand up I just thought about it and I didn t really want to share the question I just was thinking in my head and I thought through the question Alright Does anybody have any other theories they d like to suggest Other than are there Let s go through them real quick So we had the theory that said it s hot air rising cool air falling and somehow those two mixing that creates the wind We had the theory that said it s the pressure of air and that pressure is kind of dictated by gravity We had something with currents So it s somehow the currents in the air whatever those happen to be that s what s causing the air to move as wind There s air masses meeting If it s the same what Dave was saying If the same air mass meeting that s what causes the wind It s gravity in the movement of the Earth which Richard and this table suggested Although they moved away from it I think it s a valid theory to be suggested And then it s molecules moving away from each other and then somehow combining with the other things So would you take a moment and if you had to commit to one of these as being why you thought wind would blow take a moment and talk to each other and decide which one you think you d commit to as far as which one you think it is Talk to each other I don t really know like what Matthew brought up how they would move So Alright guys here we go Would you grab the voter that is registered to you And when you turn it on you should have an A through F option And would you choose one of those to be your theory please Is this graded No it s not No we re just theorizing right now So just go with the one that feels best to you What s the question It is which one of those theories do you think it is that is what makes wind blow Wait for a few more people to vote Oh Mark we gotta get to voting Patrick you in Yep you re in Okay Mark what you want to vote on is which one of these theories you think is best Votes are on your voter and fire away And he s the last one to vote as soon as he goes we ll see what way we as a class think Oh you got it Okay here we go Let s see what you think Alright so B is our best theory so far So right now as a group let me save this So right now as a group we are thinking that it is pressure and Let me ask you this Let me get a quick hand vote for this just out of curiosity One of the things was that the pressure is caused by gravity How many of you are going to add pressure would be caused by gravity then Okay most of the people voted that way look like they re going 
 Our is like Crown Crown Royal and like it shows like a helmet and like an ad for it and it says He who wears the crown I think that s like if you wear the helmet you will seem cool Mm hmm and the helmet is for what do you think Motorcycles or cars kind of racing kind of stuff And Crown Royal tobacco or alcohol Alcohol and racing a car Thoughts Drinking and driving Huh Well that s bad But they appeal to your your uh love of racecars and motorcycles and cool stuff but those two don t really mix do they Next group Ours is tobacco and it has a picture of a firefighter and it says A bit braver so it s trying to hook you by you wanting to be braver and trying tobacco So the inference there would be that tobacco makes you braver What do you think Could it really work If I chew tobacco Am I gonna be able to fight a fire No But firefighting appeals to a lot of young children right That bravery that toughness that rugged fireman thing It s like if I do chewing tobacco I m a rugged fireman type Um what are my teeth gonna look like though Yellow Not gonna look like the rugged fireman type am I Fireman sounds like he smiles is that what you said All right um ladies Um ours was alcohol and um they got our attention by like the grandma and the daughter playing patty cake and telling stories about her So grandma and daughter and granddaughter playing patty cake lovely little sunny porch sponsored by Budweiser Oh my Oh that s so popular So drink You re appealing to the family nature And the message is drink our drink Yeah it says that like all stories weren t about family they also had some other stuff Family and Budweiser Yeah No Yeah you re getting it now All right Ladies Um ours is um There s isn t really an ad There s is a display at a grocery store Yeah like there is um a whole bunch of like alcohol in the background and up closer there s tobacco and then there s a bunch a candy bars that should appeal to the little kids Right next to the The tobacco Tobacco okay Candy bars Like right there and then um also you have pretty much the candy Alcohol behind the booth tobacco right up front and candy bars right at hand level Kids would probably think that tobacco s candy They might Or as good as candy Does tobacco come in flavors like candy does Yeah No Yes it does Oh Mint berry apple Ew really Really Hey I think I missed a group Did I miss a group This one up front Nope Did I get you guys already Did you guys share Oh you did share just with me Share with the rest of the group It s Ours is alcohol and like if you re a rockstar you ll drink like if you drink this then you will become a rockstar What hook did they use The girls in bikinis So how many guys are in that picture One One guy and he s the one who s drinking the alcohol and Fifteen girls Fifteen girls in bikinis So if the message is if you drink this You ll get hot girls You ll get hot girls yeah All right you ve had a chance to let Oh sorry Eyes Ears Mouth Thanks You ve had a chance to look at these ads Um you ve got a chance to see how they re trying to hook you in You re knowing that the messages that they re sending are slightly warped It s their trick to pull you in but it s your job to think and process through using your critical thinking skills Weigh it out Consider but then choose something else that s healthier So we ve looked at negative influences It s time to talk about positive influences in your life things that can help you say no to all of that no matter how appealing it is no matter how many girls in bikinis show up Leave your cards right where they are in the center It s time to take a look at the charts that are around the room There are five of them These are activities you can do instead of things like using drugs alcohol tobacco like a social activity um something you can do with someone else Ideas Have a sleepover Sleepover good All right so in just a few minutes we re gonna be rotating around the charts with different groupings We re gonna be writing down our ideas of other positive things instead of this Can anyone name one physical activity something you can do that would be instead of using drugs a positive thing Football Yeah Did you want to share too Go ahead Um riding your bike around the block Good You re on the right track guys Keep those ideas in your head When you get to the chart you ll have to write it down What s something you can do with your brain a mental activity that would be positive Chess Chess I like chess Math Not for everybody I understand Um this chart over here says Emotional What s something you can do um that can make your emotions feel better your passions or whatever How can you support yourself emotionally so you can say no to this Trying to think happy Yep Positive thoughts Watching emotional movies Definitely gets your mind off those I know you got great ideas and I m gonna be willing to see those on those papers in just a few minutes so save them in your head Okay The last one is spiritual Spiritual Somehow you can nurture your spirit so you have the ability to say no to negative influences Go to church Church All right Save it You ll get a chance Time to look at your pencils again Leave your papers right where they are okay Face up This time we re gonna go by color and you might notice that there are markers at each station for the right color So when you get to the station if you are patience I promise I ll explain it No worries When you get to your station we re gonna start with your bag of colors You will take your bag of colors and your marker and you will only use your color marker So if you are a green guy you would grab a green marker and you will be writing at this station first You ll write down however many ideas you want You ll talk it out with your group You might notice Mitchell that I also put group work uh reminders up here about how to work with others in your group One everybody has the right to speak so make sure you give everybody a chance to talk it out if they need to and to write it down the topic Don t interrupt Give everybody a chance to share their side Two everybody has the right to be respected We re not looking for put downs We re looking for ones that can encourage us positive things so when you re getting ready to write positive things speak positively to each other as well And three everyone has to agree to work together to solve a conflict So if you re having a difficulty in your group talk it out Work together to solve that problem If it s not working and you can t solve the problem who can you turn to for help You Me And others in your group So if you re a green person you re gonna get one green marker and there are multiple in here in case your marker doesn t work Get a different one Write down whatever ideas you want When you hear me say Switch or Rotate you move to the next chart around like the face of a clock Take your marker with you So there ll be multiple colors on here You ll get a chance to write on every one Yes How does this work Are you supposed to write it down like a list You can write all over that paper Yeah Anywhere as long as we re on the front Everywhere all over that paper so you can all be on there at the same time as you want you can take turns you can arrange however you and your group want to You each can have a marker though There s plenty of them for everyone Yellow s are over here at Emotional um I believe blue s are Social purple s are Physical and oranges are Mental Questions before we begin Think about something to do besides You ll have approximately 30 seconds to a minute so listen for me to say Switch Keep writing until I say it Go Here How about we take this and put it on the floor Does that work better I know it s going everywhere isn t it Here you go You guys want to take that one down too put it on the floor so it s a little easier to write on Yeah Good I know isn t it cool Yeah So I see you got chess on there Anyone think of some other ones Other mental ways to use your brain things you can think about it Think of school kind of activities things related to learning using the brain Spelling You can practice your spelling You can do your math I think you guys are in right place You have a lot of good ideas Tell me your favorite one so far Give him a spot Good How do you spell baseball Oh online The Playstation yeah that is definitely a social event I ve got XBox Live So social means involving what Talking to other people human beings a relationship with them All right Ready in 10 nine finish what you re writing eight seven six taking your marker with you in five Oh our marker Four Yep Your writing in your color Three two one rotate Spiritual All things that are spiritual What does that really mean Your spirit Your spirit yeah It could be feelings I think we did emotions though right Yeah So this one would be more nurturing your soul yourself We ve got meditation We ve got mediation right Yoga Oh yeah Why don t you write that one down How do you spell yoga Yes perfect The Bible poems How much do you connect with your spirit or your soul Any other resources or people Pastor from a church Friends you know from the church or wherever you attend services Who else besides a pastor can lead um a group You can pray Pray good You guys are on the right track Emotional support Where can we find emotional support Family friends good Who are some other resources for emotional support Culture How can we nurture your own good feelings What do you do to feel better Cuddle your pets Cuddle your pets You know that one s my favorite too It s okay you don t have to spell things All right capping markers Ready to move 10 nine eight seven six ready gentlemen in five taking your marker in four three two one Rotate 
 So good morning everyone Good morning Good morning today today what we have is we re going to have a debate based on a couple things that we have recently experienced One was research that we have conducted about the chemistry in scientific measurement that s required in order to address a local issue that we have with current regulations on water and different lobbying groups trying to change those regulations for their own interests and the groups they represent Okay And so we had a field trip to Wastewater Treatment Plant that allowed us to gain information locally from scientists to see what they re doing on their side and what their opinions are for either side of this debate that is current in our city So today I m going to start with our overarching question which has really helped us in our research and is now going to help us to just devise our debates The overarching question is up on the board if you d like to see it It says how is scientific measurement applied in the creation and the regulation of our local environmental protection laws The environmental protection side over here is proposing new tighter regulations that may have an impact on local businesses and rate payers or the people who pay for the water utilities in our city So I ll discuss the format of our debate First and that s again up on the board I will be finishing up my introduction here and then we will have our lobbyist group introduce themselves who they represent and what their major goals are for today s debate Okay Then we ll have a question session where each group will be able to probe into the reasoning and the deeper understandings to reveal your research and each side of the story so that our City Council members on our outer rows back here will be able to reflect upon what is being said So city council members please be writing your notes When we get towards the end of our debate time period we will then have you folks make a debate It s going to be a vote on whether or not we should agree with the environmental side and their decision to make tighter regulations to change current regulations to allow lower levels into the water of various different chemicals that they will be discussing Okay At the end each side will have a one minute opportunity to discuss a focus summary statement in which they will be able to summarize the things that have been revealed during today s debate Good And then as I said at the end we will have a vote City Council will vote on whether we should make the restrictions tighter on the water quality standards in our city Are there any questions before we begin Okay excellent And so I believe the this side had choice and so that means that Corbin and his group for representing industry will be allowed to have that closing the last closing statement today And so we ll start with Tyler and then we ll try to go back as fairly as possible back and forth So Tyler if you d like to start with your opening comments about who you represent and why you re here today Our side of the argument focuses on the environmental side of the debate We believe that new water regulations via legislation that would more effectively treat our drinking water should be enacted The hazardous and deleterious chemicals that are in our water particularly the excesses amounts of nitrogen and phosporous need to be controlled While it may negatively affect the selfish interests of industry our group would like to promote the idea that doing nothing and leaving our water the way it is is not an option Excellent So Corbin we re ready to hear your side and who you represent Our side focuses on the business aspect of this debate We hope to persuade the EPA and City Council to agree that the waste water that we put back into creeks and streams meets the criteria that is currently the standard for cleanliness And that it does not need improvement except for a few chemicals which does not improve nitrogen and phosphorous or that we do not need to severely increase taxes to pay for all of that Outstanding And so and then we will begin I guess then with Tyler who can go ahead now and you can ask your first question And we ll be looking for City Council members If you have any questions that need to be clarified statements that you would like to determine what the reasoning is behind it please raise your hand and we ll make sure that you get in immediately Okay This is so funny Okay we figure that since you say that our waters don t really need to be it already meets the standards of cleanliness but already in Colorado we see fresh water species that are becoming more endangered as the more chemicals because of the pollution that is put into our waters via industries like metals and dentistry have already become endangered and extinct and we just would like to know why you think that that means that the water s clean enough Okay let me ask you this Do you have information on what chemicals killed those fish We have like the excess amounts of nitrogen and phosphorous that the EPA the standards that they re trying to enforce now Like we saw on the video this creates the dead zones because it removes oxygen and the algae algae blooms start to produce So it s mostly the nitrogen phosphate that s preventing the correct amount of oxygen in the water for the fish to breathe technically Okay I d like to follow this up with an article from I believe this is from the Gazette which is our Colorado Springs newspaper Since we re focusing this debate on Colorado most likely our city we see that our city does not have a problem with algae blooms says the writer of this article So therefore when you talk about algae blooms we don t have a problem with this So why should we be focusing on it Because the water runs off the lakes That does cause a problem with us Okay But even if we did have I mean a few Like I said again our city does not have problems with these So we can t therefore we can t focus our debate on these things because it doesn t apply to us Well that one article in a local newspaper from one writer said that we don t have problems with algae blooms But I ve been in the mountains around our area and I ve seen many lakes ponds just completely covered with algae and scum And that so many of our local creeks Monument Valley Park and stuff are just littered with gross algae and it creates these dead zones that the fish swim into and do not have any way to swim out of because they have no nutrients in them and just die on the spot And the same thing happened in the 1960s with Lake Erie and it later happened with Chesapeake Bay like we saw in the video And the same thing was happening where they said we don t need to fix it everything s fine and then just as nothing nobody did anything The lake soon was dead and it was like there s no fish in there And the water s just completely ruined with all kinds of chemical wastes so doing nothing isn t really Okay so I m gonna interject What I m hearing is that there s a debate in here about whether or not our local water is an issue so I d like to hear from somebody in the City Council area who will be making a vote today How about your thoughts about the current water quality What you have heard from your constituents in the areas where you are located and to determine whether or not you feel currently right now what level of danger are we at Have you heard a lot about this Do you feel like we are in need of serious change So we can direct the rest of the debate Okay Anybody who would like to contribute Okay Stephan Well all I know is that where we re located we re at the we re pretty much the first people that use our water and then it goes downstream for other people to use it so so when we were talking about eliminating the pollution the pollutants that we put into the water it s not it wouldn t be really affecting our city but the cities that are down the stream from us Okay but this article says that our excuse me I think I read this wrong our state does not have a problem with algae blooms Regardless of the algae problem it says without the oxygen the fish bugs and other organisms that live in the water will die and quoting from the same article it says in the worst case scenario you basically have water devoid of all natural aquatic life But that s a worst case scenario that we don t have right now and we haven t had and it s not an issue in Colorado Granted it might be an issue in like Chesapeake Bay or Lake Erie But we don t have it here it says so And multiple scientists have backed that article as well Now Corbin do you have any measurements or do you have some values that you can back that up with Not specifically on nitrogen and phosphorous I tried to find some but I found So does anybody have any of that information because we want to know how close to danger are we Do we know about current levels or about where we want to go with this Okay I would like to comment on I m sorry behind you I just called on her Oh excuse me So even if it s probable wouldn t you want to prevent it from like happening here with the algae Well if it s not happening already then what do you have to do to keep it from happening Yeah if it happened but it hasn t happened yet Yeah but what she s saying is it might happen Yeah I mean just saying that something might happen is just like saying something awful might I mean I could say that you know an earthquake might kill everyone tomorrow It might happen We don t know if it s going to happen But fish and other organisms are dying It is happening It s not necessarily just the algae but it s the future problem We ve already seen issues with the Yeah let s see what Nina has to say as far as City Council Well I just have a question wouldn t it be better to be safe than sorry _ You re right it would be better to be safe than sorry but like I said the levels of toxins in the water right now do meet the EPA required standards So therefore it is a safe level according to the scientists who work for the EPA But we re saying that the EPA standards need to be improved Yes yes we realize that Because they re not they re too low and there are many chemicals that are new because of new industry in metal companies and many other things that are dumping into streams And those chemicals are getting through How would you go about doing this How would you go about stopping the pollution Because something that s important to remember here is the fact that the pollution is not only caused by industry it s something that s misconcepted is for example cars People think cars pollute the air and it exactly does pollute the air But when it goes up and it becomes acid rain and it falls back into our creeks it s also a pollutant Therefore industry s not the only people who are polluting the lakes It s actually U S citizens doing the same work too Okay I like that And so can you be more specific Did anybody gain anything on the fieldtrip about learning about which types of things the citizens in our area are putting down their drains Yes That may cause issues Yes Okay I ve got a whole bunch of them Alright Corbin why don t you share then what it is You want me to read all of them or just So we re not focusing just on one group There may be other groups as well but also maybe it could be addressed as a result of this debate Go ahead Corbin Well the guy that we had giving us the tour of the wastewater facility did make some funny comments that he s found some pretty ridiculous things in the water treatment plants Some of those examples were railroad ties dentures and he found a live person inside of them one time So it s not like the waste treatment plant is purposely putting all this out there It s you can t stop humans from putting out waste and a lot of the stuff that they re putting in there that they re actually reducing the levels to parts per a billion or parts per a trillion which some of the machines there do do are poisonous things like fluoride Which actually the highest water treatment plant that puts out the most fluoride is actually Mason which is right up there and lead and mercury And it eliminates that from parts to a billion from parts to a trillion Well first of all I would like to answer Mr Dunmar s question or Mr Waz question I m sorry We do have information on how much nitrogen is required in the water and it s 10 parts per million So that s just to answer that question and then to move on to yours Yes of course as you said in your own words you can t stop people from the pollution that they do cause However it is the job of the water treatment plants to kind of remove that pollution and to produce a safe environment And when we don t have strict enough regulations this environment is endangered for not only for people but for also the wildlife for the economy for you know natural systems that occur within Colorado It s all you re putting it all on the line Okay let s talk about what would happen if we did restrict pollutants that go into the water Okay Well let s talk about the costs that everybody s the citizens are going to be paying that they said that all our state is going to be paying Before you talk about cost would you rather pay more and be safe or pay less and risk dying Okay I would like to comment on that That s an asinine statement because do you have a statistic on how many people have died from water pollution I do have a statement from the Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Ki moon says More people die from unsafe water than from all forms of violence including war You just said from the United Nations Yeah this isn t yes we re talking about a local issue now but that is a statement that proves that Okay I would like to comment on this once more when you said United Nations that s Okay I m sorry We re going to have to go to hand raising I believe because we re getting too fast of an answer before someone gets a chance to finish So Theo finish up and then Corbin will follow behind you No I made my point Okay Well like you said you do realize that s a local issue but the U N is United Nations of the world So that s not a local issue You re bringing up a fact that s from countries like Africa that don t have clean water at all nonetheless water So of course they re going to die from water poisoning but here in the United States we have the cleanest water in the world no matter where it is And Colorado also has one of the cleanest state populations of water if you will out of all the states Yeah because of the regulations we have in place and with the new chemicals that are being put into our water we need to restrict our regulations What are the new chemicals Yeah they ve been there for awhile We re having new problems though Can you explain it Everything such as nitrogen and phosphorous It hasn t been an issue before Why is it an issue now It has been an issue It absolutely has It has happened all over the United States Okay when we talk about nitrogen we re talking about if we restrict that we re talking about maybe shutting down part of what we do here As we all know that we are we do grow many crops in our state And nitrogen mostly where it comes from is fertilizers used in that industry So to say that we re going to restrict nitrogen would be we might have to restrict or shut down some industries that do produce food Such as what What industries For fertilizers Fertilizers You can t use fertilizers on your lawn because if you have And not even lawn crops Crops lawns anything because the fertilizer you use goes down drains which go into creeks which is really polluting it more than the wastewater facility was So shouldn t the wastewater facility pollute it less since we already have natural pollution coming from these facilities We re already doing so much to prevent these chemicals from going into Okay so Will I hear you re saying that we re doing a lot What was learned on the field trip Specifically what role do the scientists play who are employed by our city What role do they play at the wastewater treatment plant And how does that affect your group s goals for today s debate What are the scientists doing specifically and how does it support your side Like they said on the fieldtrip they use bacteria E coli to break down the wastewater that s in the water It s not like they re adding pollutions to it Their job is to take it out which they are trying to do By doing that they add some phosphorous and nitrates that are just byproducts of it but they remove a lot of those afterwards It s not like to clean it 100 it s going to cost 25 billion dollars and that s just for the state of Colorado Okay let s see a City Council members I m trying to get to them quickly I m sorry Amanda behind you Stephan Where did you get that information that it would cost 25 billion dollars This is from the Gazettte The Gazette article It s from the article Science has proven that to remove nitrogen and phosphorous from the water which is you guys s goal to restrict it it s going to cost about 25 billion dollars to remove it all If you just want to do parts of it it s still going to be 2 46 billion dollars Which is four times the amount of what it is costing right now to remove the things from the water Wouldn t that be better tough than having to fix up a completely good stream that destroys the economy Well I actually on the fieldtrip I asked several of the chemists that work there whether the pollutants that we put into Fountain Creek and what we re doing for the environment and they said the water they put back into Fountain Creek is the water they get out of it It s cleaner than that Yeah So in my opinion that statement is totally absurd We re putting cleaner water for nature and nature seems to enjoy it more as I asked the chemist as well And farmers down stream also enjoy that water to water their crops and it helps their crops grow more than Fountain Creek s streams already Excellent point Corbin Why don t we try Alexis and see what she has to say I have a question as to how the water pollutants destroy the economy You can say a lot about the economy What do you mean by water pollutants destroying the economy Well you say that 
 A lot of people thought the mass of the water in the bag would be less than the mass of the ice cubes in the bag How many people One two just three of you Okay Cameron do you want to start us off with your reason why Because the cause you can put water in a water bottle to put in the freezer then that water bottle will like explode because it has so much ice in it Okay So because the water when it freezes expands then therefore you re saying it has more mass Yeah When it s frozen Yes But when it melts it doesn t take up so much space so it has less mass Yes Okay Michael Do you or are you on the same idea as far as more as far as thinking there s less Was your reason the same as his or do you have a different reason why it s going to be less Mine was the same Same idea Yeah Okay Hannah you got a thought or something Well isn t it like the same Isn t it like the same thing because it s the same thing It s just expanding but it s going to have the same mass When you re saying it s the same thing what do you mean by the same thing Like if you have water in a water bottle like it does expand or whatever but it still has the same amount of water so it still has the same mass Okay so Hannah s saying it doesn t matter that it expands It s still the same amount of stuff and therefore it should still have the same amount of mass Is that correct Kay Houston idea on that Well about the water bottle thing it would be opposite to this cause when you start with water it takes up the entire bottle But the bag the ice is the one taking up the minimum space of when it freezes an entire bag So it wouldn t So are you saying if we let the ice cubes melt are you saying the mass is going to go up It s going to increase Yeah Okay Colby I d say that when a solid turns into a liquid its form changes but not its mass Okay so kind of the same idea as Hannah Only you re talking about the actual forms then It can change form without changing mass Hannah says it s okay to expand because it s still the same amount of stuff Okay Michael s got another thing thing to talk about Well when you put like the water in the bottle and then you like freeze it then you unfreeze it then there s less water than what you started with and it probably would change the mass Why is it so you re saying the amount of water you put in first before you freeze it is more than the amount of water after you thaw it back out Yeah Do you have a reason why that might be Well no it s just Okay any other ideas on this one Okay how many people thought the mass would increase then How many people said the mass would increase A couple of you Jared why don t you tell us why you think the mass would increase I thought the mass would increase because water weighs more than ice Like if you pick up a bottle of water that s frozen it doesn t weigh as much as a bottle of water with water in it Okay So Jared says that water weighs more than ice Correct Anybody else have a different idea Anna Well because ice floats on water so that means it has less mass so if it thawed back out then it d weigh more Okay So Anna s using the example that she s seen ice floating on water therefore she s saying the ice must have less mass than water Correct Is that what your e saying Mm hmm Colby you got something to say about that I have something to say about that It will stay the same going off of what she s saying Oh going off of what she s saying Okay go ahead then Ice is pretty much the same as it s water it s frozen water so it still has the same density as water it s just colder So if it s colder it floats Ice because it s cold it floats in the water So you re saying the floating of ice has nothing to do with its density or its mass it has to do with its temperature Kay Houston Well I think the only reason ice floats is because an ice would weigh less because ice isn t completely full There s some air in there Okay So Houston s saying there s some air trapped in there that was not in the water beforehand Okay Anybody else Anybody want to have any other arguments about why the mass should stay the Oh sorry Anna Oh okay I disagree with Colby how he said that it floats because it s cold when heat rises and so if it s cold wouldn t it sink if it had to do with the temperature Okay so Anna s saying that heat rises and cold sinks so you don t think it has to do with temperature Yeah Okay Colby response to that or are you Well in water it works differently Warm water actually sinks more to the bottom actually and cold water s more on the top Alright So if you put cold in ice it will float above Okay Oh I have some hands up now Michael Well when you re in the lake for example the warm part s on top and the deeper you go the colder it gets because heat rises So you re using your experience in swimming or something in a lake Yeah It s colder the deeper you go warmer towards the surface you re saying Yeah so the ice cube must have oxygen in it because when we hold our breath we float up Okay When we have no air we go down Okay so you re saying an ice cube has air trapped in it that s what s causing it to float Is that what you re saying And Hannah were you gonna agree with her as far as the lake water temperature thing Yeah so when you put your sweater or something in the water it s like the top is usually more warm colder Okay Alright Now people who think the mass is going to stay the same Who are those people Who thinks the mass will stay the same Gavin why don t you give us the reason why you think it s going to stay the same I think it s going to stay the same because nothing s lost when it melts Nothing goes away It s still the same thing He s saying it s going to stay the same because nothing is lost When it melts it doesn t get lost Okay Anybody else who says it s going to stay the same have something to add Gabe I said that Just talk louder I said that it ll stay the same because there s still the same amount of water melted or frozen and even if it s in a bag if it melts and tries to break down into gas then it s still in the bag so it won t go anywhere So Gabe s saying that it doesn t matter if it s frozen as an ice cube if it s melted as water or even he s even going as far as saying that even if the water liquid starts turning into a gas it s still going to be the same because nothing s leaving the bag Is that what you re saying He s going even a step further he didn t even mention anything about turning into a gas but he s saying even if it does that it s still not going to change Right Houston Well I disagree with that because if you take a frozen lake the ice is only on top it doesn t freeze all the water Okay Hannah I agree with what he said Even if there s air bubbles in the ice then after it melts the air bubbles it s still in the bag It s still concealed in the bag So sounds like the people who are for it staying it s the same are really sticking with the fact that everything s in the bag Nothing s out of the bag or leaving or coming in and then the people who are thinking it s going to increase or decrease have a lot of ideas about ice having more mass than water as a solid and then some of that s through the temperature Michael one more before we move on About how it all stays in the bag well when you melt water it sweats So wouldn t it lose some of that So are you saying some of the moisture s going to be on the outside of the bag Like comes off the bag If you have it on the table then it comes onto the table Like how it has a Okay so here s my question to you then That water that s on the outside of the bag that you re talking about You were saying that water came from the inside of the bag Well it sweats from the the compression of the temperature So you re saying that s what s causing the mass to go up then Wouldn t that cause the mass to go down Okay so that s my question to you then is where was that water on the outside coming from Inside How is it getting to the outside I don t know Some scientific theory Okay Does anybody agree with her idea that some of the water from the inside might be getting to the outside Yeah Do any of you guys have an idea of how that might be happening to help her out James how do you think that water might be getting to the outside The moist is like when it What s it called Wait a minute The carbonate the condensation it like seeps out like the air it seeps out So somehow you re thinking it s seeping through the bag Colby I know how that happens actually Because the water in the air will stick to the bag because it s colder So it ll stick there and just condense there so it ll look like it s It s just water from the air So you re saying the water that forms on the outside is not coming from the inside It s coming from the outside which is different than what they re saying Cameron did you have any other ideas how it might be getting out there Kay Alright So we got some different ideas on that one Let s move on now to our alka seltzer problem This time last one we started with people who thought the mass would decrease Let s start with the people who think the mass will increase So people who think the mass is going to increase with the alka seltzer Who are those people Alright We re going to have Kyle start us off on this one What s your reason why Kyle Well when the tablet dissolves I think after dissolving water will rise and make more Make more water Yeah Okay So Kyle thinks the reaction is going to create more water and therefore more mass Sam different idea than that for why the mass is going to increase Okay so you re thinking it s going to increase because you re adding something to the water Colby I think it s going to increase because the alka seltzer tablet will release gases which will increase the weight of the bottle inside Okay so the gases that is going to be created from the reaction are going to add to the mass Jake you had your hand up for the mass increasing correct Do you have a different reason why it s going to do that So basically saying the same thing as Colby More gases Hannah Aren t the gases from the water in the alka seltzer aren t they going to just stay the same Good question So what you re saying then is if the gases are coming from the alka selzter tablet in water so what are you saying the mass will do I think it s going to stay the same Actually it ll decrease It ll decrease Okay why do you think it s going to decrease I don t know Okay Who could come up with the reason as to why it might decrease Cameron Why is it going to decrease Because the acid from the from the from the tablet the acid from the tablet is going to release gases and the water will go out of the beaker How is the water going to get out of the beaker Because the tablet will react with water and the gases will float away But isn t there a lid on top Maybe the lid will pop off or something Let s assume the lid is does not pop off Let s assume I have it on there tight enough that it s not going to pop off Then since air is lighter than water then that means that the air that means the mass will decrease because the water will be like not as much and there will be more gas in the container So Correct me if I m wrong So you re saying that assuming the top stays on it s still going to decrease That s the decrease right Because the solid and liquid are going to turn into Gas Gas and gas is lighter than solids and liquids Is that correct What you re saying Yeah Alright Jared has something to say about that I think that the mass will decrease because the tablet will disintegrate and that mass part will be decrease Okay so he s saying that the tablet disappears then the mass will go down That piece that the tablet s bringing to the table for mass is not going to be there anymore Kevin what are you thinking Pretty much the same thing that the tablet s going to dissolve into the water And so mass will go down Yeah Okay Who thinks the mass is going to stay the same It s not going to change Who thinks it will stay the same Why don t you tell us why it s going to stay the same I think it s going to stay the same because the water the alka seltzer piece is a water it s just in a different form But everything is still Okay So you re saying because nothing s going away it s still going to be the same It s just in a different form So kind of like what some people were saying about ice in the water Gabe do you have a different reason than that No it was a lot like hers It was the same as hers pretty much Yeah Okay Anybody got anything else they want to input on the alka seltzer one Why it might go up down or stay the same before we move on Gavin I said it would probably go down because if you have a bunch of gas in a bottle it ll probably weigh a lot less than a cup full of water like the same amount Okay so you re going again with the idea that gas has less mass than the water and the tablet And since we re turning them into gases the mass will go down James I said since the tablet is gonna be kind of shrinked once it mixes with the water it ll stand making it a lot more liquidy and bigger and then the mass will get higher The mass will increase because it ll produce the Alright Let s go to burning paper Alright Burning paper Let s start with the people this time let s start with the people who think the mass will stay the same People who think the mass still stay the same Colby s the only one Morgan Gabe Not very many Jasmine Morgan why don t you start us off for why you think it s going to stay the same I said the mass will stay the same because the air and everything else is still in the jar and it s not going anywhere Okay she says it stays the same because everything is still in the jar not going anywhere Jasmine you had your hand up Do you think the same thing as her or do you have a different reason for why it would stay the same I agree with her You agree with what she said Colby Burning stuff does not add It s still the object but it s more spread apart Okay so the mass stays the same you said It s just we re going to take up more space with it Okay Michael No Yes I was stretching Hannah I disagree with that because it when it burns I don t know if that s the word for it but how it s causing it all when you burn wood in a fire eventually all that will turn into ashes so I don t think it has the same mass or anything Okay James you got some more on that When that paper burns it ll turn into charcoal which basically is lighter than paper and then that ll make it so mass will be decreased Okay so given the idea that we re taking the solid things and we re changing them into maybe non solids so either liquids or liquid acids they re not gonna have as much mass as those Edward what do you think Do you think this mass will go up down or stay the same I think it will decrease Decrease Yeah And what s your reason for that Cause when the paper burns it turns into a gas so some of it and then gas is has less mass than solid objects Okay so again back to that gas is less mass than solid objects Kayla what do you think Increase Decrease Or stay the same I thought it would decrease like what Hannah It ll disintegrate Okay So as a quick vote how many people thought on this one oh sorry Kevin go ahead Also I think it s gonna decrease because the paper s gonna burn and incinerate but also the match when you light the match it s gonna burn too Okay Some of you maybe forgot about the match I haven t heard you mention it until just now so that not only is the paper gonna burn up but so will at least part of the match Okay cause it s burning too alright A quick vote How many people on this one said the mass would go down would decrease And how many said it would increase And how many said it d stay the same So the majority of you are on the decrease side on this Okay here s my next question We ve now heard what a bunch of people had to say about each different situation One if it would increase or decrease or stay the same My question to you now is that after listening to all the people throw ideas out there has anybody changed their mind on any of these In other words like maybe for the ice in the water one I was thinking it was going to increase but after listening to every one now I think it s gonna decrease 
 How much bigger is one than the other It s like a thousand times It s like four times Wait Those zeros are really skinny Well they weren t too bad It s quite a big difference isn t it So is our picture drawn to scale No No Can we make judgments on what s happening by our picture No Not unless its drawn to scale right Rachel how would we redraw that to make it more in line with our numbers Which side is bigger The one with the negative Okay so we want to make that three times seven to the sixth minus six much smaller right Yes Would you please redraw Make it about a fourth of the size I ll try You can just do a new one Don t forget arrow tips please Okay Now does that picture help us understand why our hypotenuse is almost the same as the side Okay so do we use our picture to make judgments Yeah Okay only if it s to scale Thank you ma am Okay Sam You understand that Okay Alright now one more thing we needed to do for the Yeah Go ahead That hypotenuse has got a curve It s okay We ll make allowances He doesn t have a straight edge up at the board Okay Raci what else do we have to do here Find the direction Find the direction Raci how would we go about doing that Okay so tangent No that s fine We can use tangent Which numbers will we use then Okay And Pardon me Are we trying to find the hypotenuse right now No We well yeah we re going to We just didn t write it that way To solve for Theta we would do inverse tangent okay Now what do I tell you always to do with this Make sure It s in degrees In degrees A couple of you had it in radians That s because in Precal we I understand that but So Okay now we have the angle Is that the angle of the resultant No What would you do Jonah 180 Add 180 because It s in the third quadrant Drew would you agree with that Yes Because Because the resulting forces can t They can t there s no forces in the other quadrants so the resulting force couldn t possibly be in another quadrant Okay but how do we measure that angle Counter clockwise from East Okay good Alright Any questions Sam Question I didn t add the 180 but then I put my answer as a certain number of degrees southwest That would be fine So you can do south of west also because it defines where that angle is Alright Now do you guys feel better about this problem Okay John Can you measure that from I said it was I m pretty sure this is incorrect but 12 and a half degrees west of south I mean now that I realize it s Yes you could have I guess it s technically the same thing It would have been west of south Did I mark it wrong Yeah Alright well just show it to me later I might have just missed that angle there Okay I ll make that correction for you John Okay Let s go on Jonah Jake thank you Jonah you re going to the board for this one What should I write We can erase all of number one Taylor would you please read the problem for us Sure A proton accelerates from rest in a uniform electric field of 640 What does that say Newtons over Coulombs Okay let s stop there for a second Hold on Don t erase the nanocoulombs You see the difference between an N slash C and a lower case nc Sometimes if you re reading too fast you are going to mess those up I do it myself So always take a good look at the units Units help inform you what you have Okay thank you At some later time its speed is 1 2 times 10 to the second For A you have to find the magnitude of the acceleration of a proton For B how long does it take the proton to reach the speed C how far has it moved in an interval And D what is the kinetic energy at the later time Okay so Connor Calling on you again here Magnitude of the acceleration How would we go about finding acceleration normally if I just said Connor tell me how to find acceleration What s the first stuff that comes to mind f equals m a f equals m a Okay or a equals f over m f over m Jonah a equals f over m We re working with a proton Mass isn t given in the problem but is that going to be an issue for us No No because that s our table of equations So the mass of a proton 1 67 times 10 to the minus 27 kg So we have that part but we don t have the force So Rachel how might we find the force Isn t the e equals f over q so we can use the charge of the proton to find the To find the charge and what s e It s a constant No no no its not a constant Oh isn t it the 640 newtons over coulombs right And what does e represent Rachel The electric field Electric field good So if we solve this for force what is that going to be F equals Okay you can plug numbers in first too that s good Jonah Can you slow down for some of us please Yeah Jonah you re not supposed to be looking at your sheet so put your sheet down What did Jonah just write up there Okay he went too fast So let s back up He plugged in the variables He plugged in the numbers But do we all know where that equation came from Green sheet Green sheet And e is the Electric field Good okay And f Force q The charge of a proton Alright So now do you all know the charge of the proton It s equal to the charge of an electron Very good alright now we can find force right What was the force then 6 13 times 10 to the 10th I got 1 02 times 10 to the ninth That s the acceleration Oh my bad Yeah I was doing acceleration F equals 1 67 1 024 How did I get this problem right Oh there it is right there 1 024 x 10 to the negative 16th And that brings up another good point Write your work more clearly right Because if you can t follow your own how do you expect me or the AP reader to do that So do yourself a favor Make sure its clear Okay Where do we go from here Ann Back to a equals f over m And we have force and we have mass now right Okay now I have led you through the problem solving steps for number one and number two A John lead your classmates through 2 B Okay 2 B You have Do you want me to lead the class I want you to ask questions Don t tell us I want you to ask questions okay Okay So you need to find time So what equation would you use Jonah stop using the sheet No I told him he could use it Wouldn t it be velocity equals acceleration times time It is Yes Oh come on Jonah don t It s actually v o times x times t not x v o times t That s right Isn t it v o times t You are thinking of the equation for displacement Oh yeah x times v o Well v o is zero because it s from rest Alright Drew what would you plug in The speed that you re given at the beginning of the problem and you found the acceleration Oh the speed is 1 2 x 10 to the sixth and then you plug the acceleration you found from the previous problem into that equation and solve it So t equals No John s leading Class what does t equal 1 96 times 10 to the negative fifth Negative fifth or negative seven Five Alright Sam you lead for part C Read part C You lead Part C How far has it moved in the interval And if you look up to the problem nope you don t have to look up to the problem You look up to number B which we just did Number B Yes you do Number B and you look at the time that we just found and that s going to be the interval Thank you Jonah So how are we gonna find time Ann Or distance Sorry distance Why d you ask me a question You told me to ask you a question No I didn t Alright anyone else know Gretchen you look like you know What s the equation to find distance in number C Distance equals velocity times time Nope That s not what I got But I guess you could do that You could do that No you can t You can t do that Why not Because I was gonna do that at first Gretchen but then I thought in my head that since the object s accelerating the velocity is not going to be constant throughout the path of the travel I have an equation You have an equation Ann I do What is it How about x equals x the original x plus v o times times t plus one half a v squared So what do we know about v o and x o Ann That they are just zero So what can we do to both those first parts of the equation Just throw them out the window Drop it like a bad habit Drop it like it s hot So that would be half times acceleration times time squared And conveniently letter A letter A we found the acceleration which was what Drew 6 13 x 10 to the 10 Nice is just and the time in letter B What was it Raci 1 93 times 10 to the negative So if you pound that out on the calc Can we just pound it out You cannot just pound it out because you have to Do what Miranda I don t know Put the square in there Change back to degrees Oh you snuck it in Snuck what in The square I don t think I said the square No I didn t but Jonah thank you for saying the square for me Pound that out in sig fig wise what do you get I got 11 8 11 7 John If acceleration does matter couldn t you also use the equation v t Because I also did that and I got the same D equals one Write it on the board please D equals What s d I know it works I just don t know how it works I m going to tell you in a second One half v average times t So why will this also work then Let s get some of your thoughts Ann Because if it s the average then it s looking at the middle velocity instead of the top and bottom so you just Wait a minute It s the average velocity and really the equation is the quantity vo plus v times t Yeah that s what I wrote down Right and so you take into account the acceleration with the change in velocity So wait a minute If the equation is vo plus v Then you just get rid of the No Yeah you do v plus vo times t the quantity vo plus v Times t would just be v average times t Okay let s write the whole equation out John one half parenthesis v o plus v end parenthesis t Then isn t vo plus v just v average So t equals v average times t Not v average No Yes But vo plus v divided by 2 Oh okay I m sorry I see what you mean I missed that Yes sorry But it can t just be final velocity Okay Is there another equation we could ve used I saw some of the other ones on your sheets that worked Anybody in this class have one of the other ones Jonah did you You could do V squared equals 2 a x So another way v squared eqals 2 a x and solve for x right Good job so you can see there s multiple ways of getting at the same answer right And D letter D I ll have Gretchen lead Letter D is asking to find the kinetic energy at the later time So what equation would you use Sam Would it be kinetic energy equals times the mass of the object times the velocity of the object squared Yes And then if we know the mass of the object of the proton from the first equation and that was 1 67 x 10 27 kilograms Thank you for using the unit And then we found the velocity in letter Given Or it was given right So 1 2 x 10 to the 6th Meters per second Thank you Squared And then you can just plug that into your calculator Sig figs 1 2 times 10 to the negative 15th gs or kilogram meters per second Meters squared over seconds squared Don t forget you have to square the units Kilogram meters squared over seconds squared Kilograms meters squared over seconds squared Yeah What is kilogram meters per second You have to convert the meters I could have sworn kilogram meters per second was something Oh momentum That s not what we re looking for though right No it s not No we re good Okay now Better understanding Yes You gotta stay on top of stuff You can t let those distractions get to you Okay Pass your quizzes to the front face down I ll put them in your files for you Do you want to see I ll take yours separate Are we allowed to retake them Pardon me Can we retake them Sure Thank you You gave me a minus six Well I had everything Okay now we are starting the next chapter today so I have some handouts to give to you Do we have till this Friday to retake the last test Yeah and quarter ends on Friday so anything you guys need 
 Well let s say about like a plane A plane can use the wing to like slice right through the the wind making it just fly with ease but let s say the wing was vertical and then it would just be working like a parachute and just stop its fall Okay did everybody hear what he said No Daniel did you understand what Jonathan was saying Yeah Okay so does that make sense to you then Daniel Yeah Okay John About the thing the last part did he say vertical Yeah like like like vertical like pointing upwards Oh Okay What do you think Reese what do you think Um what Jonathan said Jonathan would you kind of say it again Reese would really like to pay attention and he d like to hear Yeah I m saying like like a wing it uses like like like a V shape of a duck of a duck squad Like every single wing goes down each part and then it s just like a V Okay Shayla Um I said they fly because the air pressure in the wings gives it stability to keep stable and make sure it doesn t fall onto the ground Okay Kelsey Um I think that if the aerospace vehicle was in space then I think it would just float in space because there s no gravity Okay we re kind of yeah Ramaji Okay I m kind of lost Ramaji is lost let s help her find herself No that s a good thing Because I ll be honest I m a little lost So tell me where you are Like I thought we were supposed to put like why we think they were built not how they were built like like I wrote um I think aerospace vehicles fly to improve society and help and new aerospace technology helps build modern things Okay Can everybody understand where Ramaji went with her answers Kelsey I m totally lost now Okay here s what happened okay so let me see if we can find this a different direction Um in reading all your different sentences most of us had a purpose for aerospace vehicles flying okay or some of you wrote that they fly both in space and in the air okay and so we re not kind of getting where I want to get to So can I for a second kind of change the discussion Just because Yes John Is it like when you take a rocket like on the rocket it has uh two wings and like one tail Great so his question that he asked does a rocket have two wings and a tail Um here s what s happening Mm I thought the vehicles would help you and what I m seeing is having the vehicles is making you try to figure out what it is about how this vehicle was made And I m not as concerned about how this vehicle is made okay as I am the science behind how it flies and why we design it that way does that make sense Yes Okay so can we go a different way with me for a minute Each of you has a picture of a hot air balloon on your table correct Okay I know I took yours Reese which is why you don t have one now I need to know something okay This vehicle doesn t have an engine okay Okay Now I want you to think about this for a minute and I want you to discuss it at your table before we talk whole group I want to know how does this hot air balloon fly how does it get in the air and how does it stay in the air And is it possible you don t know anything about this Possibly Possibly It is possible okay it is possible Joelle you don t know anything about this okay So I want your table group to share what you know for a couple of minutes about a hot air balloon and how it flies okay And I m gonna come around and talk to different groups okay So how does this hot air balloon fly Okay so you two start the discussion at this table So discuss that because some of us did have a good concept and some of us don t okay So share in your group Okay what do you two know Okay Has an engine a propulsion engine Okay but is that an engine Okay so now you can do your discussion What did you come up with over here So the fire blows hot air into the balloon Okay without it it would do what It would fall down okay Okay So any idea why the hot air makes the balloon rise What do you think Okay okay Ooh that was awesome You are so good today Um I think we re now getting somewhere So let s talk about this hot air balloon for a minute okay So I ve heard some different things around the classroom I want to know how does that balloon get into the air Nathan The fire in the hot air balloon blows the the balloon up to where it can float down Okay Shayla do you agree or disagree I agree with that because yeah because you pull on a cord and like it lights up the fire and stuff and then the fire pulls in air and it like shoots it up with the fire So is the fire being shot into the hot air balloon No air is What kind of air Hot air Hot air is being shot up into this part Okay John Didn t they say one of those like if you compare They can t Jonathan can t hear you Oh sorry If you compare a hot air balloon and a balloon they re you use hot air for the air balloon and you use the helium for a small balloon yeah and the it s not really air kind of I thought it was steam Okay okay Now why would you think it was steam Because you know how when you just um when you put like a fire fire in one place it sometimes can turn into steam Maybe The fire turns into steam No not the fire but like when it s when it s done Ann Maria says she thinks you need the word water Yeah because when you heat up water then steam comes up out of it Because steam is like moisture Steam is like moisture that s In the air In the air okay Ramaji I agree with you John Okay I think what he s saying is because in air and the fire is there or whatever and so then when they re getting pushed up that comes and like then I m lost here Okay like then the steam like yeah you were right about the moisture part but it but there is no way that like water is in this There isn t water in there Yeah I mean Reese be supportive I mean there s moisture in the air but still like fire is a big part of it Okay can I ask a question Okay Do I need water in order for the hot air balloon to fly No no you don t Ramaji says no Laura says no I said no Mariah says no Kelsey I m totally lost Kelsey it s okay to be lost okay Kelsey you re if you re lost you need to know where you are So here s the question what do you feel like you know and understand about what s been discussed so far I thought I was understanding everything until John said I m so confused right now So tell me John was talking about steam John was talking about steam I would agree Kevin John was talking about steam So the question is prior to that Kelsey okay prior to that what would be your understanding of how the hot air balloon flies Basically nothing before that I just think it s steam because of like hot and air because or like there would be like a fire inside of the air and then it would be steamy Okay let s see if I can bring around some concepts Ramaji and John can you let me have two seconds okay Um we have a concept of this fire that s heating air but we also seem to have a concept of water that gets heated and creates steam Correct But I m also hearing and I just want to make sure I understand I m hearing that the steam isn t necessary for the balloon to go up John Well this is this is how I thought it was steam Because you know how sometimes there s clouds and you you want to go up in the air balloon and sometimes it might rain like when you re in the air balloon sometimes it like when you pass through a cloud and the air is super hot it actually turns into steam I think Okay Ramaji Okay Listen I ve got to come over here Okay so like like You two can put your hand down for a minute and I ll go to you next So like steam is I think it s putting pressure like on the balloon to like make it go up So we feel like we have air pressure okay I don t agree with Ramaji though because with the air there s no steam involved there s like kinda like what John said he said when the planes come up the hot air pushes it Okay I m gonna ask Oops I didn t let you speak Well like it s just like like comparing this to a regular balloon with helium it would float up just like an air balloon but you can t put helium in an air balloon Does everybody understand that So if I put okay that is an awesome analogy So everybody listen If I put helium helium is a A gas A gas okay helium is a gas so if I take a regular rubber balloon and I put helium in it the helium because it s a gas helium floats that makes my balloon float right Whereas if I just blow up a balloon what happens It just falls down on the ground and I got nothing okay On the flip side Kevin what she s saying is with a hot air balloon instead of filling it with helium I m filling it with hot air okay Now I have a question I think you ve got to think really deep about this one If hot air Reese is what makes my hot air balloon go up okay I want to know would it be easier for me to fly my hot air balloon on a warm day or on a cold day Just think about it for a second just think Would it be easier for my hot air balloon do you think to fly on a hot day or a cold day What about on a windy day Ooh Okay she said what about on a windy day Let s assume that there s a slight breeze on either day okay but the temperature is either warm or the temperature is cold okay Kelsey I personally think that it would be better to be on a hot day because then the sun would be helping with all the hot air so then it would make the air inside the hot air balloon warmer to help it fly higher So I d get radiation into the balloon Okay Ramaji I think a cold day And why on a cold day Because like there s not I mean even on hot days there s still like low humidity sometimes and so like it you basically with fire would kind of I don t know not set your hair on fire but like No when it s cold there s no moisture in the air so like it would be like like helium but like Okay Shayla I think that it s a hot day One of the reasons is because there s hot in the hot air balloon and if it was on a cold day there s a fire in the thing in the hot air balloon it could blow out the fire and that could make the whole thing just plummet to the ground and people could die Okay Ann Maria I think it would be better on a cold day because well I don t know if this actually really makes sense but like the hot air would be working against the cold air Exactly And like if it s on a hot day it would be like the same Just a second So Ann Maria if the cold if the warm air is in the hot air balloon and it s a cold day what would you expect to happen to the balloon Go up And why would you expect the balloon to go up on a cold day faster than on a hot day Because like the hot air would be pushing against the cold air faster than it would be pushing against itself Okay Over here I agree with Shayla on the hot day because like a regular air balloon just regular heat would make it go up but if you had the sun hitting against it I think it would help with radiation like the sun would help out The fire Yeah how it has something to do with radiation Okay I think the sun hitting against the balloon would make it go up higher Okay Nathan I think on a cold day because it would give it less chance of popping from the hot air that might pop it Awesome Kevin what do you think I think the same hot air because I ve never seen a hot air balloon fly when it s cold Okay Dakota Oh wait Kevin I have a question for you How do you define a cold day Okay what s the okay here s my question okay You said you d never seen a hot air balloon fly on a cold day and what I m asking is is there a particular season that you would say the air would be too cold Winter Winter okay Dakota what do you think Uh I think uh Kevin Dakota can think on his own I know he can I don t know Cold day warm day what do you think I think a warm day because it would be easier to fly Okay Daniel what do you think Cold day warm day I would say a cold day because the hot air would meet the cold air so it would be more enhanced going up you d get more from the hot air Okay I need to kind of bring this to a close real quick and I know you two have lots to say Tyree did you want to add the last comment Yeah Uh I think the hot day because who would go out on a cold day when the higher you get the colder it gets Okay Tyree says who would go out on a cold day because the higher you get the colder you get so Tyree s logic here is that if I m going to go in a hot air balloon I don t want to get really really cold Okay ladies I know you have lots to add okay but I kind of want to bring this to a close but I need to know a crucial question So everybody has to commit to this question I want you to don t do it until I tell you to Ready You re gonna hold um you re gonna hold your arm straight up if you believe the better day would be the warm day and you re gonna hold your hand at the side of your shoulder if you believe it would be the cold day that would be the better day I didn t say go yet Okay on three everybody So does everybody understand This is cold this is warm okay Ready one two three Okay Okay now hands down I have just two more questions and then we re gonna close out today s lesson okay Question number one I want to know if you ve ever heard the word 
 How you guys doing So 3 Oh what did you do by touching those It made a short circuit It crossed Wow the orange is a lot less than the kiwi and the apple Yeah It s only 3 Why do you think that is 03 Maybe because It s like different rods or something Oranges are more sour than the other fruit Not and like have more acid or something Because it stops the energy We want it a half centimeter apart right Yeah Two centimeters Around So okay go ahead Make sure they aren t touching 0 1 It s not even measuring at all Oh 0 1 0 01 Oh 01 That s crazy I know How this supposed to be one the other two were so high 0 98 I never thought fruits and vegetables could have so much energy Except for oranges I thought this would have as much as the apple My hypothesis I actually thought that the orange would have the most Go ahead Alright Lizzy you can do the voltage reader Stick them in a half centimeter apart And a centimeter in Okay Lizzy make sure they don t touch Don t short circuit them It s like completely zero The bigger it is the more volts it has The middle one it left like a little here and this was the most I think it s more concentrating volts in the middle more than anywhere else Hmm I wonder why that would be Okay so now we have to get a calculator Okay so 0 22 Plus 0 09 Plus 0 28 I got 0 1966667 So what are you gonna do with that number Round it up Okay 0 20 But wait doesn t someone else need to try it Oh yeah yeah yeah that s a good idea 0 22 plus 0 oh never mind Divided by three I got the same answer So what was the answer to the investigative question What do you think The The apple had the most Do you agree with that Yes Why do you think that is Do you have any guesses It s It s bigger It could carry more volts It has yeah It has like more juice Yeah that s true I think the juice Was your hypothesis correct Actually it was Like right here well Well actually I said the potatoes will have the most voltage because like usually they potatoes for like cloth and other things to energize with but I guess apples would work better What was yours I thought the I thought the carrots would produce more because you know usually when you like eat one it s like very wet wet when you just get them so I thought the carrot was going to win but guess not I thought it was the apple I already said that My hypothesis I thought I think the potato would have the most because I heard like I ve heard that potatoes could produce a lot of energy and last year when when they were doing a science experiment they said that they had potatoes for like volts So I suspected that they may have been have a lot of voltage also Okay To our investigative question our question was which fruit will produce the most energy And the Kiwi Kiwi and apple had tied for it 0 98 So I don t know maybe like some other time we should do another experiment and see if we get the same results I wonder why the orange was so low though Maybe because we since we put it too deep or something No we did the same thing we put all of them Yeah I know Well So then our so our answer was that the kiwi and the apple both had the highest So how about your hypothesis I thought orange would have it I thought orange would have it I thought orange had it too And had the highest Why Because it had like I thought the apple would because we didn t I thought the apple was because of how much bigger it was How about you Kirsten what did you think I thought the orange because it has more citrus in it I mean yeah I would have thought kiwi would have less because it s so small Yeah me too That s what I thought Then what was our evidence Apple had for an average had 0 98 Orange had 0 16 And then kiwi had 0 06 0 16 And then kiwi had 0 98 So kiwi and apple tied And then our evidence is our data table because that s where we recorded everything Yep So then how can you be sure that you conducted a fair investigation We did them the same length apart and So what are you guys trying to figure out over here We re we re trying to figure out what if the apple carrot or potato has enough voltage to light the food battery What is the food representing in this case A battery Okay Yeah Okay how you gonna figure that out What is your plan We are gonna do gonna try to do a voltage reader and put try to see how much voltage there is in an apple potato or a carrot I think we should use the apple because in our investigation it had the most voltage well like the apple but should we do a parallel battery or the something that starts with an S battery Series Series let s do series Let s try series It lights up more Yeah it s brighter Okay let s get it done Oh wait we re gonna need more There s a wire in here So I think that the apple will like light up the battery brighter Or at all because it has I think it s gonna have the most it has the most voltage and so it ll make it become brighter Which do you Oh wait we re doing a series battery so Maybe we Where s the other apple It s over there Reece has it Need to wrap it around tight Can I check Jayden do you wanna do it Sure I ll have the honors Keep this one untouched because I m gonna wrap this wire against that because it needs to this negative Just the white one Okay there is no wire in this Okay so I think we have enough wires here What do you need the wires for To wrap around to make a series To allow the energy to flow through Okay so what s the purpose of the wires So that the energy will be able to flow What is the energy that s going through the wires Electricity But okay so what is the function of the wires To like be able to pass from one spot to like the battery to the light Okay so you have two different wires Why is that To be able to You know why you have two different wires Um no No I m gonna give you a minute to think about it Okay Is it working No not yet Well I don t think it s working I think I didn t Oh it s going No I don t think I wrapped the wire around right Oh yeah because the This is really short So yeah it was tucking it Let s see that and that and that Yeah that thing s wrapped up tight Well if the volts are enough Don t the apples have to be touching No they don t have to be touching They just have to be the wires just have to go from positive to negative Yeah True But if they don t have enough voltage we should use a potato Yeah we can put the potato to help Yeah we need to put them in every fruit And then connect the wires like that to that that to that So make sure they don t touch Yeah so kinda wrap it around with the wire Yeah try to wrap it around as tight as you can so that Do you what do you guys think do you think that fruit could power our school I don t think so It might power a small light bulb like the ones that we use in here but You don t think there s enough voltage to supply our whole school No Well like maybe if we put like a bunch of fruit on the roof or something I don t know how that would turn out but maybe if we put a whole bunch and like stacked it on top Would you think that would be economical You think that would be beneficial to us in any way Maybe Why It could but we d have to keep changing out the fruit and changing out the fruit It d be lots more work that s for sure Don t let them touch That connects to that and that Do we have another one Because this one is broken Can we borrow one from over here Oh we have one There you go What do you think is gonna happen I think it ll like because we have none of the same touching First we should check the voltage Well I don t we ll just see if it lights the light No don t connect those Why would you wanna check the voltage Just to see if it has enough potential of battery Would make more electricity All the averages I think it should be good this way Because we tested a battery and saw how much it was Connect one to it Then connect yours Lizzy Maybe did we do it wrong No I don t think so Well I think that maybe it loses potential inside the fruit Maybe it Try an separate those a little more Kirsten Maybe they re both plus and plus Maybe it s because we re using three types of fruit If we use just two What if we took the prongs out and replace that with this Okay try that Put it in a different hole this time because we just changed it Well don t What are we trying to do here We were trying to make all these the same one Why would you do that Maybe because they need to be the same From the both positive and negative Oh And we need to make sure so those could be the plus and minus doesn t matter which way And that and that needs to touch and then that one and that one which is exactly what we did But wait 
 What were you saying Joe I said young people definitely benefit our society overall more than old people in the country Why Just because they can Progress Contribute more Yeah Like they can work and they can help our industry grow and provide opportunities for more people Yeah they re a lot more active compared to old people more who just is gonna basically sit at home I mean if we look at like the current political situation in countries that are rebelling the rebellion is completely composed of the youth Yeah If we look at the political situation in America like Obama s election was pretty much the 18 to 21 year old vote It s just like clearly they re like better at affecting social change In this time period that we re discussing why would you want the youth to come Well because this is like the start of all social change in the union and I want young people to bring a youthful energy and determination and some sort of hope about the country that they re moving to and that all my union in here They re gonna progress they re gonna like technology and they re gonna invent stuff So you re onboard with the I m just saying we still need more money They re going to be working and they re going to be taking money out of our economy because they re gonna want to pledge How much are they gonna spend Like we need old people to spend a lot like rich people to spend But we need workers Yeah no so it s like We need workers old people cannot work We need a combination If only get young people If we look at this list of people that we can bring into the country that we were supposed to look at to begin with the old people on this list aren t that rich Yeah but there s The bottom line is Gonna be more than just the old people there the old people other countries But right now we re focusing on that they re going to be moving and they re rich who would move here Why would they move to the Land of Opportunity if they don t need opportunities I didn t mean to say that That s honesty Okay Yeah but I mean I see that It seems like the majority did the majority rule on that Because I guess who was against having younger people come in I know Matt was Was Matt the only one who wanted older people to come in Ok and you were Also I m a loner You just went with the consensus Yeah Okay good Another point another point Also old people coming from another country just to spend the rest of their life aren t necessarily going to be all that interested in America Okay as a country And wait and also They re not going to vote they re not going to you know try to participate in the country itself so they re just here to die in comfort Okay go ahead Darvel On the way it s already tough enough to come across the sea to get to the United States because so many people died on the way getting there so they might die on the way getting there So don t even consider them to begin with Right Or if they re sick they can t come into the country anyway Like we re not going to let people who have cholera into our country because then it ll start spreading here so You said colema or column Isn t that more in Cholera That s like Okay I was like what What else did you guys have on your cards What about religion Does religion matter No I don t think it did No no That s one thing we I think we all could agree on Yeah Oh everybody What about the nativists What about the nativists Darvel you were okay with the religious freedom happening in this group Well I mean it s kind of like on the edge of the He s conformed But I because most of the time it s Christianity in the United States so Also majority rule Yeah majority rules USA USA Okay so who did you guys decide to wait was that the end of your criteria or No we had There s still reasons for coming race and knowledge of English previous jobs and Oh what d you guys say for English What d you guys say They have to know English Yeah we said they had to know Basic English at least At least a little bit They have to know some of it Or Enough to you know find out where the bathroom is Really Or enough to like communicate Or have the ability to learn it With other people who may not know English that well And Boss you were okay I mean I feel like I m one of the only ones who disagreed with that because like being a boss like I have connections like in every part of my city and every community and communities are often like separated by race so By race and And language Mm hmm So maybe different communities wouldn t have trouble communicating if they only knew one language Mm hmm But being a boss with my connections I could definitely like I could make it so that they could communicate and I can get them what they need help them out Okay I don t think now English is a necessity Well you wouldn t I think it s pretty I mean how are people supposed to communicate And it s just going to make life miserable for the people who are trying to make it Because I mean overall the majority speaks English But we do have immigrants in this country right now that speak different languages so they could just They re getting by though Right right I don t know if You should know them working in factories you should know a lot of these people Yeah but You might even know someone When I think of like different languages I think of like the Tower of Bavel or Babel it s like in the Bible story where like everybody spoke different languages and then the tower collapsed So like if everybody speaks different languages we can t get work done productively because we don t know what each other want Like if we say Yo go make this type I don t know just Do this job and then they do something else you need communication Darvel what do you think about the language piece Well I think that speaking English is basically it s a necessity I mean obviously you would want workers to come in because he just wants money He doesn t really think communication is that important but as a nativist I believe that it is Why What will happen if we let a lot of people come into the country with different languages maybe be different races different ethnicities What will happen to the country if we let those people in I mean that could create like conflict between the work because like Matt said they really wouldn t know what to do while they re working Also that could change the patriotism of the country as well But will they know why they re working Not really So people who don t speak English don t know why they re doing a specific job Well probably yeah I mean they know that they re doing a job to get money Right so does English really matter I m just asking I mean they re not gonna really X you wouldn t care if they spoke English because if they didn t speak English it might make it easier to exploit them I somewhat care Because they have to collaborate with the people they re working with to get the job done The way I see it is they can come into the country with a you know as long as they have the mindset of I should probably learn English to succeed in this country then I think it s a good idea Because if you re going to be immersed in a language you re going to be able to learn it eventually so I mean as long as they try to learn English or try to know basic English I think they should I mean I think I agree to Darvel Like if I was a nativist I m not saying I am but if I was a nativist I wouldn t want hoards of people who don t speak English coming because I mean it s like America s pure we ve got everybody speaks English like we don t want But does everybody really speak English right now Not now I m saying No not right now in 2011 but in our age that we re discussing If I was a nativist in my Even then right In my like Ideal world you would want everybody to like speak English Okay The whole world should speak English Oh goodness Yeah that s what a nativist would say I went with the English speakers because like to properly rebel and have a voice communication is vital and I think that people who aren t speaking English won t be interested in what I have to say can t even understand what I m saying so Okay well you guys decide and talk about who you guys are letting into the country specifically okay Yeah All right thanks guys Oh we already did Education s not really that important to me though I think it s really important Dude it s saying that a lot of these people going into this country aren t educated to begin with Well education like You would want educated people As a non union worker like I don t care about education I just want to keep my job and I want like union workers to get out of the country And as a union worker I want educated immigrants because then they would stand up for themselves and like change factory conditions Me being a tycoon I just want people to work for me I mean they can come to this country they can live the American way I ll supply them with a job What s the American way American way is to Well but you re not giving them any money Wait wait wait what s the American way 2 5 kids We are actually 2 5 kids white picket fence Dog Well that s the American is that the American way now or then We re talking about then Labrador Basically the American way is I want them to be doing better than the country they were previously in Okay That s my concern Well but they came here to like succeed and you re giving them like two cents an hour I mean for me with education though it s not that big of a deal because then again if they re coming to America they re going to have to learn our customs and our way and with them being uneducated that s easier for us to mold them into society and opposed to like we can mold their thoughts into like correct candidates to vote for and stuff like that But this is supposed to be like a free country and they came over here because we like grant that and we re just like manipulating them Yeah but like basically the only people I want in the country are like people that are going to give me jobs Like people who are kind of like Who are those people Kind of like sketchy people kind of because like You want sketchy people to come into your country Well sketchy people are about to give me jobs because like sketchy people are about to like What do you mean by sketchy What does sketchy mean When you re saying sketchy do you mean poor or like Nah I mean like people that are like rich and stuff and they ll like have a business and whatever but like They re corrupt a little Yeah they re a little corrupt so they won t like hire union workers and they ll keep their people ununionized so I can come in and take the work make that cash Know what I m saying Oh okay So you want it that people will have money when they come into the country but not be on the side of unions Exactly So that they will They ll give me jobs They will okay they ll hire non union workers They re not people that are going to be entering the workforce they re people that are going to be like already kind of upper you know what I mean Okay so you want people with money coming into the country Yeah exactly Okay Did you guys decide on a criteria already Yup Or are you discussing a criteria We have a criteria This is our criteria pretty much Okay what s your criteria We said non educated which some of us don t agree with Who didn t agree with it I don t agree with that Why Because I did not agree with it America is the land of education Everybody needs an education You can t come here Well but at this time remember education is not like going to school It s more of knowing a skill or a trade It s like street smarts almost Well if they don t know anything then they can work Yeah Okay And we decided on that Do people really need to know a lot though to work in these factories No but like No my business is to teach them how to use these machines We don t want them to be taken advantage of I mean but at the same time I don t really see the importance of education if they don t come with like money or some type of like I don t know some type of prior knowledge with like succeeding in America Because you may know you know how to read 100 books but that doesn t help you like start a business or something like that Yeah Yeah but not like that kind of education Like education enough where they know like that two cents an hour is not okay Like so they can stand up for themselves and like be able to like negotiate with you Why is that not okay I mean everyone has to get paid Everyone gets paid that same amount Yeah but they re living in like cramped shacks and like poor conditions I mean that s in your opinion A house is a house Yeah and then look at where they re coming from They re coming from religious persecution they re coming from these governments that are collapsing these war stricken countries Exactly and the government I think it s better to work in a factory earn some wage Yeah but how much are you earning compared to them Eat or have necessities in life I mean but there s also government support too That s where I come in I set them up with a place to stay stuff like that you know That s what government s here for is support of people that come in here So it s best when they re not educated it s best when they don t have money because that makes it easier for them to get help and that s what we re here to do is to help people But then they re relying on you and they don t know what to do with themselves like when you They re relying on him but then he lets them rely on themselves so they come in rely on him and then he kind of sends them like How Helps them out How does he keep people from relying on him Because then all right so I can help them decide for who to vote for in some type of election that can help them with their lives Like if there s a politician voting for labor laws I can help them If I m with that politician I can Yo this is the guy you want to vote for This is the guy that will help you That s like brainwashing though they like have a right to think for themselves Honey this is America Exactly Exactly Exactly So you re saying that nobody should campaign ever You re saying campaigning is brainwashing No you could campaign but you don t Exactly he s just campaigning Can I just say something No but he s like getting them all to agree with him Okay if you think about it this way you can really have people from all spectrums of money wise like from all kinds of economic backgrounds You can have the more rich people come in sorry the education backgrounds The more educated people are going to come in No matter what they re going to help our country more than hurt it Then for me I can supply the people who have gotten a lesser education and I can give them a job I can start them off in life and maybe they can go to the library and learn themselves Why don t you better their working conditions then if you like are helping them Because I mean still this is much better No because they like die in those factories It s better than being killed by their previous governments Wait have we decided No it s not It s not the same thing Have you guys already decided on this piece already Yeah we have like our set laws we just have disagreements about that You guys have disagreements So you guys were able to a consensus on them Yeah well we kind of voted on it We decided that they have to be non educated come with some sort of money Their religion and race doesn t matter Come with a family 
 Think out loud what are we doing OK you know the area of the square is 196 so you want to How do we do that Take 196 divide it by four Hold on let me hear from somebody that I haven t heard from Need to find the square root of 196 OK why are we taking the square root instead of dividing by four Because all sides are equal Well if all sides were equal that s why we would divide by four Because to find the area of the square you have to square it So the opposite of squaring is square root So we would divide by four if we were given the perimeter If we were given the perimeter of the square we would divide by four But we were given the area so we need to square root 14 OK so the side lengths are 14 Multiply times 4 It s 56 Anybody see a problem with this OK so this side is on the inside of the figure So it doesn t count so instead of doing 14 times 4 We do 14 times 3 How do we find the perimeter of a semi circle 2 pi R divided by 2 2 pi R divided by 2 How do you find the perimeter of a semi circle 2 pi R divided by 2 So the radius that means 7 7 is 14 2 times pi times 7 So that should be 2 times 3 14 So the whole thing is 53 38 So then 2 pi R divided by 2 I got 2 times pi times 7 divided by two cause the radius is only 7 cause that line was supposed to be 14 So 14 divided by 2 is 7 Here Skye can you take this Thank you Put the final answer on there and then quick to the next problem C squared OK all of the line segments in the diagram of the bathroom floor shown below are either vertical or horizontal How many one inch square tiles would it take to cover the figure Don t you got to work it into two rectangles I think it d be easier of you did it the long way Does it matter which way you split it Either way you re going to have to split something right You can determine either of the missing sides In order to find the area of a rectangle you must apply 7 times 6 is 42 Where is I don t see a 7 in my problem OK but what does 7 represent I don t see a 7 what is It represents the length of this What length From the line on down to 6 OK Could you label that with a 7 Cause I still don t see 7 It said how many one inch squares OK so you want to multiply what by 12 87 87 times 12 Why But you made the 12 into a 7 OK so you want to do Where are you all getting 12 from A foot is 12 inches There s one inch not twelve Oh because I found the 87 feet squared I found the area of it but then you ve got to find how many 1 inch so you multiply it times 12 because there s 12 inches in a foot So what are we multiplying with 12 So we re doing 87 times 12 Shouldn t you divide though Try dividing What do you get when you divide Say that again In one square foot there are 144 inches Instead of going by 12 which I said originally shouldn t we be doing it by 144 Since one square foot is how many inches it is But I ve got 87 square foot But I m saying in each foot there s 144 inches So instead of 12 there are 144 square inches So instead of multiplying by now that I think about it we should multiply it by 144 OK let me ask you guys this what if we converted all of the feet to inches before we found our area Could we do it that way Yeah OK let s try it that way What would 9 be in inches 9 feet in inches 108 108 What would 5 be in inches 7 in inches 7 feet 84 84 thank you Kashmir And 6 72 72 thank you Sierra OK we know what all our units are in inches Now when we find the area we re going to be finding square inches Somebody want to take over from here Skye do you mind if you continue writing Uhm yeah No I don t mind Thank you You can erase all of it My eraser got stolen So do we do this the same way but multiply the length and the width right Yeah It s what 6 480 It s multiplying But that s wrong though Don t you still have to subtract I mean like 84 minus 60 because they re part of the No we didn t convert the 12 We converted the 7 Oh OK So it s still already changed Good question though What s the total 12 528 I just checked it originally with the 87 times 144 and that was correct You are supposed to multiply by 144 Good job What did you say it was 12 528 How d you get that OK Next problem No You have a question Yes When you get 1000 When did you have 1 044 Oh and then you multiply by 12 again Because guess what 12 times 12 is 144 So that s what you re doing You re multiplying by into 12 and 12 right They way you get 15 from when the outside is 10 before the 15 From the very very top to the very bottom Thank you because now we know that that s 1 inch Can t you break it up Now that we know the basic triangle in the back That means you re breaking it up into a triangle and a square Yes The square on the bottom I m sorry Jacob The base of what The base of the triangle in the back But what s the base 5 The height is 5 and the base is 15 Well yeah but I was asking Jacob what the base of the triangle was Can you explain why the base of the triangle is 18 Because the width of the rectangle is 10 and I have to add the sides of the triangle 
 Can someone come up and put number one on the graph And then we re going to debate about it Anassia can you come up and show us where you think one should be Alright so what I think is I don t know if I m right or wrong or whatever but I thought kinda one is there Do you guys see it No OK back can you give us a reason why OK well it says David had drived back to pick up his credit card that he forgot at the restaurant so I kinda think that from home the restaurant must be close that s why he took the chance to go back to get his credit card We don t know if he has money on him ya know It could depend on circumstances but I think that the restaurant was hella close that s why he went back and went back home OK wait wait wait Wait wait wait wait OK So honestly who has that opinion So you think one is at the very beginning Mmmhmmm of his trip OK can we have someone else draw another number one that is in a different place Anassia can you pick someone Overwhelming You I put it right here Right there Right there OK can you give us a reason He s driving and then he goes to the restaurant and then he s driving away No This is the restaurant right here and then he s leaving and he s like Oh snap I left my credit card Then he goes back and then he s driving away That s it OK wait so whose idea do we agree with Sidius or Anassia Sidius OK but we still have to convince Anassia because she still thinks it s at the beginning right I thought it was at the beginning too You did Who convinced you Myself Yourself OK so if David is driving back to the restaurant then should his slope be what What should his slope be Negative If he s going back to the restaurant Right because if I m travelling this way my slope s getting bigger my distance is getting farther But wait I turn back so my slope has to be Negative Negative So do you think one is when the slope gets negative Yeah So are you convinced now Anasstia That it has to be negative for him to go back Yeah So are we OK with erasing that first one Well I have to erase all of it anyway Oh OK sorry OK So one should be where he s going back right where he s going negative OK Alright Is there a real end to it Well we re going to see once we get through them Alright So Sidi can you pick the next person to show us where number two should be No hands I would put two here Can you explain why Candy Wait just give us an explanation Yeah because he said that his car breaks down so he goes back so the slope is negative He went back Close to his house Yeah near his house but then it s near the beginning so the bilaterals have to be near zero Because the line there represents the distance from his home right I ve got a question OK You know how it says he is told a way to a repair shop near his house We re looking at his car not looking at the tow away car aren t we So wouldn t it be considered constant since his car is moving So I guess the car is on the tow truck right So now wherever the tow truck goes the car has to go right Yeah Does anyone have a different place for number two No So we all agree that two no do you want to put two in a different place Put it in a different place Let s see what you think Put it in a different place let s see what you think Go I was thinking of putting it right here That s what I was thinking That s what I thought too Can you explain why Why Because he says that his car broke down and was towed back to his house So I was thinking that the first sentence so his car broke down So if he was not going anywhere then the time was going then constant so if as you see the time his speed never changes while the time is just going down That s what I think That s wrong We don t say that s wrong we say Well I disagree Well So convince him otherwise Because the car is still moving and if you look really really closer at the graph the last point isn t directly on the girl so we can assume that since it says the the repair shop is near his house that the ending point would have to be somewhere near zero Also if it was constant that means he would just be in one spot but it s clearly saying that he s being towed back towards the repair shop so he s in motion like the slope is showing distance and not speed Well the graph is showing that the slope is going somewhere So can I say two things One thing so it s a different interpretation of this problem right So if he was broken down and the car was just staying there then would this be a good place for two Yes If the car was just staying there because distance is not changing or is changing It s not changing right Because time is going on but distance is staying the same However number two says he s going to the repair shop close to his house So is he just staying in one place No right So he s gonna go back home so if he s going back home so this slope would be negative or positive Negative Negative And it s going here s home right So where does he go back home Or very close to home Here right Are you convinced Danny Yes OK let s erase the other number two But Danny thank you for being brave because I could understand that interpretation Alright Danny can you pick someone to put number three on the graph OK number three is over here I disagree Wait wait We haven t even heard her explanation Wendy what s your explanation why Because it s stopped for gas and got a quick bite to eat it s kinda constant here so it can be stopped So why not the long one Because he s in the restaurant I suppose But then So if one is here if one is here it has to be in the restaurant then right Well then one is over there so then why would three be all the way over there One is here right No no no One is all the way at the beginning No Sorry that s Y But then it says that he got a three Yes but it s here Yeah he ate there so wouldn t that be the one Like wouldn t that be where he gets his gas Number three said that he went to eat but it doesn t say where did he eat Maybe he just eat at that restaurant that he mention about Yeah maybe he went a bit farther and said OK let me go somewhere else so that s why So what did he do here Eat and gas It doesn t take that long to eat One hour People take a bit to longer to fill up on gas and then they can t just eat while they re getting gas Oh let me eat while I m getting gas OK so are we going to take a longer time at the restaurant or a longer time at the gas station The restaurant The restaurant So do we want the slope to be zero for a long period of time or just for a short period of time Short Shorter than wherever you pick where the restaurant is right So we haven t gotten to the restaurant yet have we No No OK So could three be the place where he stops and gets gas Could it be Possibly We don t know if quick bite meant one hour or meant half an hour Or maybe it meant five minutes Yeah you know you never know So if we interpreted five minutes gas and quick bite quick sandwich Could we put three at that place Yes Why Because the slope is almost constant for a short period of time I think that at three he went back to the restaurant to get his credit card Maybe the gas station is near the restaurant Why you make this so difficult That s possible though right I m like thinking of putting at the beginning Here Here is four Wait wait wait Don t go on four yet But I think the three should be before one Because you can t just eat in the restaurant and then you eat a quick sandwich OK we re going to do this because I like the debate you re having but I want groups to think about it individually and then we re going to come back but I want to put one thing for sure on the board OK so If if if if If If this is definitely Let s say this is definitely where David stopped to eat OK so this is where David is eating Eating as in in the restaurant Eating at the restaurant yes So here David is eating for a long time at the restaurant OK A long long time So that s the longest is this the longest time where the slope is flat Yeah So we re all gonna agree right now that this is where David is eating at the restaurant So this is where David is eating at the restaurant can you put all the other numbers in a logical place Because I hear you guys talking about logic Like he can t go to the gas station before he does what Goes to the restaurant and gets his credit card OK so I see that s one logical statement so in your groups I m gonna give you five minutes for this Can you put one two three and four in a logical place and have a good argument for it OK 
 Take a look at that goal just to remind yourself whatever it is you re going to be working on And this we want to remind you that it s kind of dinner party conversation ish You agree with people at dinner parties You disagree with people at dinner parties but it s civil because it s friends that you invited over to your house You don t raise your you don t raise your hand at dinner parties You wait until you wait until You wait until someone else is finished speaking before you start speaking of course because that s polite dinner conversation You add on to what one another says But like I said we don t necessarily have to agree And then when the topic starts to die down at a dinner party somebody else brings something else up So you can raise your own questions as well So the seminar is open and my question to you guys is who you think is most to blame for the deaths that occurred at the end of The Veldt What did it mean like George having like I think that I know a lot of times where he especially in the towards the back he it goes back a little ways He s like talking a lot of things like comments turning comment commen I can t say that word He says they re going to turn the house down possibly for a month and how he pick out the picture painter And he was telling his he was like talking to his son a lot and like about not about doing what his son would not want to have happen and how he spoiled his children so much So he takes out there s a lot of things that his son his son and daughter it just doesn t say as much wouldn t like because yeah But he wasn t like he wasn t like I agree that Oh yeah I m gonna go die today I agree that it was He didn t want to die I agree that it was Of course he didn t want to die Who wants to die Except for if you re suici you know suicidal I agree that and on Page 15 where it says um it s mostly on 16 but starts on Page 15 Won t this house and this room replace you and your wife and your children s affections It assumes their mother and father grow more important in their lives than their real parents and now you want to come along and shut it off Kind of shows why that they hate them And because it because it s since the nursery is their parents it s like some guy who thinks he can tell you coming along and can tell you to kill your parents you know It s the same thing as they re doing though They re killing their parents Well But they think the nursery is their parents they don t think their parents are their parents They don t matter as much as parents If they d been nice to them and now they re going to turn everything off then isn t it imbalanced So now they re relying on the house because that s what they ve learned to do as Yeah It d be like take an example people are killing their parents And on Page 15 it says like I also think that it s the dad says I sen The psychologist says I sensed only that you had spoiled your children more than most and now you re letting them die in some way So if they like they don t really know like when someone says no to them they ve been spoiled so much they don t even like well they just can t take it It makes them go all crazy and stuff So they wanted to kill them because they like couldn t fly to New York so Yeah Because I think And if their parents and if their parents and if they felt that their parents were actually their parents then maybe not But since their parents don t really take care of them it s the house that takes care of them Yeah And then the The house and the room replaced their parents Yeah Their parents and friends It s not like the parents could They don t have friends because they re the room they get all these adventures because of the room Yeah They don t have friends And they kind of like rely on the house to give them stuff all the time If the house refused them if it could then I don t think that they would want to kill it I think that it s just because they don t feel like their parents are actually their they don t they feel their parents aren t important to them So when they say no On page on page 13 the mom s saying That sounds stressful Would I have to tie my own shoes instead of letting the shoe tier do it And brush my own teeth and comb my hair and give myself a bath The kid s like now relying on everything He s never had to do something for himself So he doesn t really like know Yeah He s gotten so like stuck on having everyone do things for him he thinks like doing your own thing would be like A challenge Yeah Like and I guess you can use an example as Wall E a show People get like so fat and they rely on everything so much that like they have to move in chairs and they when you golf it s virtual golf there s a robot for you So they just they take robotics and machines to the next level and they it s all they rely on And so many people don t have to work Yeah and weren t the ones that like bought the house that they were actually the cause because they were the ones like on Page 5 and 11 they even said that We were the ones who bought the house We were the ones who got us into this mess So but then all of a sudden they just took it away from their children which made them mad So again they were the one who was causing all this madness in the house I think it Like don t you think that people would be sort of obese like Elliot said Yeah They would be They would be Yeah but then they d be like everyone else in the world But then they also Yeah and Getting exercise But they re obese And also I think that it s George Hadley s fault not necessarily both the parents because the mom didn t really do as much Because like well the quote over there it said that like she s the one who let them in for a minute But She just wanted to be nice She just wanted to be nice But I think like on Page two it says But nothing s too good for our children George said So I don t think it s as much Lydia s fault because she also tries to get them out of the house instead of just staying there She just wanted to be nice to the kids because George had shut it off so abruptly But I think it s more George s fault that they spoiled them and that therefore gets himself killed Does anyone know when this story was written Because I m guessing it was 1950 All right Because I was I m guessing it was wri I was guessing it was written when women weren t like thought of that highly Because Wendy only actually speaks once and is a sniveling idiot most of the time And Lydia s and Lydia Hadley is pretty passive And it s the guys that are have all the action and have anything really going on Except in the final scene Well yeah But that she on She says one line One line in the whole book basically I know but Lydia sort of has a bit of action Yeah but She doesn t do much She doesn t like She s pretty passive She doesn t like um disagree with her husband or her kids She doesn t do anything like that She just follows whatever her husband says Maybe she has a few opinions but not really And Wendy says four words alone in the whole thing so Well I mean you hear her screaming but other than that Is that a word Well that was Unless she s saying it Close enough at the same time as Peter like when they both come in and say Hello mom and dad Doesn t really count or when they both say Mommy daddy come quick But she s saying it at the same time She only says four words by herself in the entire story The screams are actually their parents when the kids were pretending in the nursery that their parents were being Yeah they realized that at the end but they didn t really make that very clear They re like suddenly they realized why those screams sounded familiar I thought the whole book or the whole story that it was like the kids screams But it s actually the parents What are Yeah because it s really not clear on that I figured that it s actually so they all Well I m it s more it s nicer to have like a mystery kind of Mm hmm Yeah I figured that it s the author s fault The what The author s But How is it the author s fault Because it s his story Well the author wrote it That doesn t make any sense But Carl the author Yeah that doesn t make much sense It s not his fault It s the it s totally off topic Yeah I agree with Elise When I didn t really get who the screams were until the very end where they said yeah that I think it s on Page um 19 But yeah that they were it says on Page screamed and suddenly they realized why those screams had sounded so familiar So I thought it was the kids the whole time I thought Aaron was saying something before but then everyone What I was going to say is the a little while ago when I was going to ask you why do people think it s like Peter Hadley or other because I mean The other is both of them Because more or less the majority did George Hadley So why just those people who did that why did they do that I understand with Peter Hadley because it is his he seems to have the main role of actually murdering the parents But it s not his fault he got spoiled He can t help it if his parents spoiled him Yeah because Actually even if the parents had been played more of a parent role they would still probably have preferred the nursery because You don t need to the parents could still say no and the nursery does they can like do whatever they want with it I agree with the both parents part of it even though the mom wasn t as involved as George was the mother was not do posing a part in the kids life as being the mom and the house was So that caused them to think the house was their parents and the house was their family This is Indirectly directly I think You can go Directly the Peter was probably most responsible for the parents dying Directly Directly But indirect well directly the lions were Oh my God Indirectly but directly it was mostly Peter but indirectly it was it was kind of everybody s fault I kind of agree with like both the parents and then the dad Because in the beginning the parents are like slowly taking away some things like the painter and not letting them go to New York And that kind of builds up their anger But in the end the dad just wants to shut it all off And then the son starts getting really mad and like threatening them finally they like get really mad and then they start imagining the parents dying and then They ve been imagining the parents dying through the whole thing I think it was the parents fault and the inventor Because I mean none of it would have happened if they wouldn t have had the just like the super technology house and the nursery So it s technology s fault It s not the inventor s fault because he didn t know But it s not the it s not the inventor s fault that they thought though If he wouldn t have made it it would have never happened And also if the dad wouldn t have bought it it would never happened too So that s my two opinions They couldn t But they bought it but they made it and bought it to be a good thing not a bad one No one invented it so that you would so that it d be used as a murder machine They didn t just make it like on the advertisement Greatest Murder Machine Ever Perfect for murdering your parents We don t know like why he built it Maybe it was because of that but you don t know like exactly what his point of the invention was It was to like study the children s thoughts It was to study their minds Because the children He said that but what if it s not He s a liar The children were mentally impaired and they needed to be looked up on and they wanted to know what they were thinking so So a psychologist Another good quote to show that it was to show that it might have that it could have been the parents fault was that on Page 11 it said yeah George said Who was it that who was it said Children are carpets They should be stepped on occasionally Because the parents didn t they didn t do anything to the kids They They didn t really step on them that much until the end They just did what they want They just all of a sudden just like flattened them Yeah they just did it so abruptly Yeah they just started and let it go It was just like bam you re dead No wonder they wanted them dead Guys let s try and talk one person at a time or else we can t hear My turn Okay On Page 15 it says that the dad went from Santa Santa to Scrooge And like if he would have taken away like one thing at a time over a period of time I don t think the kids would be like like killing them But it says he just took all the good stuff away at once and they got like really mad That s also kind of dangerous though Because they started getting mad at him as soon as they took away the picture painter So it was they still could ve gotten mad It s also more dangerous for the parents to actually slowly take them away because they get more and more mad All the anger I have another opinion that I was trying to say but then I let Fiona go first That s not fair No that s not it s my fault All the anger built up because Anyway um 
 Viewing my art room from the front corner I have a storage area on the right hand side Entry to the art room and paint storage is right by the door Uh a cart for paint supplies that can be wheeled out into the room I have a large white cabinet for all of my paper and on the other side storage for student art work I have a dry erase board a digital white board and a bulletin board for instruction for students in the front of the room We often sit right in the center of the room There s also a birthday chair there for the birthday person to sit in My tables are shaped around there in a U shaped formation each labeled by a colorful paint splot hanging from the ceiling Indicating the table there s a red table orange yellow green blue and so forth Each table has organized supplies in a painted shoebox and red caddies left on the tables In the very back corner is the teacher desk Two computers to the left of that as well as a laptop that s hooked up to the digital whiteboard Across the back of the room I have work space for our student teacher and also to mount student art work and store some ongoing large artworks On the back wall I have more storage metal cabinets rolling cabinets and a light board that we can use to copy work from And directly below me is our class pet this is where Shelly the turtle lives and she is currently hibernating Like rabbits and dogs dinosaurs And kitty cats And puppies So first thing we are going to do today is look at pictures Listen so that we have time for working I need everyone to put in bubble We are going to look at some pictures that artists have made long long long ago The very oldest art in the whole world Are horses and bulls inside of a cave So the very first artists way back during cave people they were making art about animals About horses and animals that ran around that they saw in their environment all around them Put hands down put hands down dinosaurs yeah Well that was after the dinosaurs But I m looking for somebody that would be able to point out an animal that they recognize up here Does anyone recognize some of those animals Yeah Izaiah do you Izaiah Izaiah with a Z Do you want to go up and point Come up and show us some animals that you recognize Only animals who only only Listen She s the teacher right now What s it Kangaroo What else Let her answer Fish and turtle and um crocodile and a duck Yeah and some kind of a bird Good job Did you notice that these are all made with dots That s how some artists who live in Australia Kimberly come right here in front of me Turn around so you can see That s how some artists in Australia make animals And they kind of show what s inside of them don t they It s really good that you notice that Izaiah Do you have a comment I know all those animals Good so you were naming them right along with her Raiden why is your name up your hand up You said last time we have to finish our Oh we do have to finish those you re right We will don t worry Okay Next What kind of animal is that A horse A horse You know what it says at the top It s a horse of a different color Because what color is it Blue Kind of like the Wizard of Oz right there Why boys and girls Why is the horse blue What do you think Why is the horse blue To make the horse beautiful To make it beautiful Why else would it be blue Maybe because it There s another one It s a unicorn horse isn t it What Shhhh what I m curious Izaiah why would an artist make a horse blue Because it might be a unicorn Well it could be Why Because it might be a different kind of animal Yeah it might be a different type of animal horse Have you ever drawn a picture and maybe just used your imagination And used your favorite colors in it How many people do that sometimes I know I do Sometimes I might make an animal but instead of making him brown maybe I ll make him pink and purple and yellow Ooooooh And make him a little bit more imaginative Sometimes at my dad s house all by myself What else do we have Another horse Here s a fancy prancy horse Now the other horse was kind of looking down but what s this horse doing What s this horse doing Jumping Flying He s walking or galloping isn t he He looks Look how he s standing Look at the two horses If you had to tell me how this horse is feeling Sad Why do we think sad Emma why do you think sad Because he s looking down He is looking down isn t he Maybe he s sad because his family just got killed by another animal Oh I hope that didn t happen He could be sad about something that happened What about this horse Happy Why Melanie why do you think he looks happy Because he still has a family of his own Because why Because he still has a family of his own That s not why That s not why Izaiah you might have a different idea than Melanie Isn t it okay to have a different idea Yeah So I need you sitting Kimberly and Regan you both need to be sitting right here where you can see hun Izaiah so it s okay to have what was your idea about why he might be happy Because he s walking and his family is going to get killed by a pack of animals Oh my but that wouldn t be very happy would it You think he looks happy Are there any other words you can think of to describe him He s prancing around Usually if you re in a bad mood do you walk around like this With your head up No I used to do this too That s not prancing that s stomping But prancing is when you have your head up isn t it Kimberly Kimberly Right here Come over here by me Maybe maybe he was doing this because on his arm There s something on his arm Oh it could be like a bandage couldn t it It might just be the way it s painted like his knees are a little bit lighter than the rest of him Is that what you re noticing What are you noticing but one of my family died Awww That is sad isn t it Really really really old That happens sometimes I m sorry family died in a fire Guess what Guess what Shhhh Kimberly if you want to earn your star card today you have to come sit by me Brandon if you want to earn yours you have to be sitting on your bottom not crawling on the floor You have to color inside of it You might want to draw his shell first to make it really big Look at mine Can I see Good job Make these lines really really dark Hey look at my turtle Go back over it like this Boys and girls if your paper s kind of cause you re pushing so hard then you re drawing dark enough Okay they should really be pressing hard with that Good go over it really really dark That s dark enough It looks great Oh Kimberly yes And put your name on the front with the crayon Well look Izaiah here s two choices for your shell You can start with an oval like that or you can start like this Okay Yeah but I think two different ways see the top one and the bottom was a half circle Which one do you like Make it really big Perfect There you go Look at my turtle Boys and girls I want you to darken your lines and draw for at least five more minutes before you paint Okay Keep darkening your lines Okay darken those lines We have to go and get our paint Boys and girls darken every line and I m going to come around and as soon as I see that yours is nice and dark I ll put the paint on your table Okay This is yours That s good that s good This is dark enough What I want you to trace over is the black parts And see these pencil lines You have to trace over top of them Or the paint will cover them up So what color would you like to use there What color would you like to trace these in Come pick a color Come sit down Tyler start working on your design No start working on your designs in the middle That s perfect Nice and dark Boys and girls see how dark these lines are This is a really good example of how dark you want your crayon to be You want to go back over it and trace it really dark That one looks good too Nice and dark That s awesome Start drawing I need yellow Boys and girls would you put your name on Pardon the interruption please come to the office please come to the office Put your name right here While you re getting ready to paint put your name on the front in crayon Nice and dark write your name nice and dark with your crayon Well trace over it with the crayon Look at mine As soon as you re sitting down Caitlin I m coming around to look Boys and girls when you re ready you may put your hand up and I ll come around and check your pictures You are ready Yours looks really nice Good He made me draw it for you Very good Melody I m waiting for that hand to go up Isaiah ah That looks great While you re waiting for your paint make those darker Shhhh Darken these a little bit Izaiah what are you doing Oh I like your turtle 
 They re coming around They re coming around When you have it You re a Grand Old Flag goes under your seats What Do the Stars Do Put them in your hands William why don t you come sit next to Victoria

sweet We need it to get ugly Let it get ugly and I want a slide I need to hear every single pitch Ready Really try and let that sound vibrate in your forehead Sing it like I want you to zero that sound right at me like you really mean it I know you do Ready Much better Again Get a big breath Again I want to hear every pitch on the One two ready go I love it Do it here Whoo Sit down Take out What Do the Stars Do Please my friends look at part one Big breath This is tricky because we start on a low so It s what do the stars Very very high Make sure you re sitting up with good posture Here

seem to hold it forever and it s kind of boring Speak really loudly Christopher what was your idea We could crescendo We could crescendo I think that s a great idea I think it needs some kind of motion So let s put a little crescendo on the word do Ryan what s your question A sforzando We ll try that in a second Let s see We ll choose which one we like better Let s try just a crescendo on do just to keep it interesting So it s Try and do it in one breath If you have to breathe Don t breathe at the same time as your neighbor Stagger Ready Here we go I love the crescendo We have to get it

far we want to get today on that Look at where the clouds where the clouds can fly Notice part three does Is your pitch after the word higher lower or the same as the pitch in part three Higher lower or the same as the pitch as below Are you sure We start on the same So that s how you re gonna know to Yeah Is this gonna be beautiful This is gonna be Sorry I think this is gonna be really beautiful like which one we just did Yeah It has a lot of the same kind of qualities but there s some really rich harmonies and some really rich beautiful opportunities for crescendo and decrescendo and all that kind of stuff Yes The whole song isn t a cappella It s a cappella in parts Yeah It starts out a cappella which means no piano Jeffrey sit up It s a cappella for a little while and then the piano comes in Then it s a cappella again and then the piano comes in and then it ends a cappella So it kind of goes back and forth What we want to get from this for today from this piece is I want to hear your expression I want to hear that crescendo that decrescendo Same thing on the word clouds What do we think What should It s another one of those long notes So we need to do something with it What should we do with it Decrescendo Put a crescendo in it Energize it a little bit Should we try each Should we try a decrescendo and try a crescendo and see which one we like better So the long cloud Two of them We have two of them So let s energize them and then we ll try backing off Let s see Ready I believe that s our pitch Ready Here we go One Two Do we like that Just energize it a little bit That was crescendo Do we want to try backing off Which one do we like better you guys Let s try the decrescendo Ryan question Oh one of each That s what you re thinking Rose So make one crescendo one

crescendo lovely expression Put that one under your chair and take out You re a Grand Old Flag 
 What I need you to do is you re going to be looking at both sets of data the one from October in the morning and the one from last week in the afternoon So I want you to work with your shoulder partners okay And the first thing I want you to look at this table you can do all three Isabella you can come sit right here You re gonna work with your shoulder partners and I m just gonna take a second and I want you to see what is common what is in common how is the data aligned Okay So I want you to work with your shoulder partners want you to talk about what is in common with both days of data Okay where are you all standing What is the same between those two days You re looking from this day to this day overall what is the The heat that was trapped inside the heat that was trapped inside got trapped because the black it was on and the black soaks in the heat so when the black soaks in the heat into the covers it traps it into Okay y all figured out about the black look at your other You have three other kind of solar water heaters look there see what other types you can find What did y all find out The black cover covers it Okay The black cover it s highest on both sheets On both sheets And what did you say White is the lowest and white uncovered is Whites are lower than blacks and white uncovered is the lowest Okay okay Okay everyone find some similarities Okay if you can hear me clap once If you can hear me clap twice Okay just one thing Don t tell me all the things that you have found the same Table four what did you find that was the same in those sets of data Elijah Only one went down Okay which one went down White uncovered Okay so you saw that white uncovered went down What s another scientific word for going down everybody Decrease Okay so white under decrease in both okay What else did you find Alex That the rankings were the same for each one Okay and when you re talking about the rankings what are you meaning Like white uncover had decreased the most Uh huh Um white covered was was really toward the middle Uh huh Black uncovered was also was the next one and black covered was the last one In order from the heat Okay does everyone agree Yes You all see the same thing Now what does it mean that black covered had more of a change than white uncovered What does that mean Justin That black absorbed more heat Okay that black maybe absorbed the most And what did the white do Everybody It reflected It reflected or Anthony what were you gonna say Absorbed the least Absorbed the least because it was reflecting Now okay that was the easy part Now I want you to look at your graphs and I want you to try to figure out things that are different okay Things that are different this is a little tricky okay So you work with your partner try to figure out the things that are different okay Okay and how does that relate to the results Look at these results and how are these results different Okay and so you have a wider range than you do the width okay So what were you saying now That I think that the they are so seperated out the first time we did it than last week Okay girls what do y all think I think here it s like up Now think about why it would be a lot closer Ooh Okay okay well let s take he said hotter the morning what was our temperature 24 24 And the afternoon what is So think about what y all talking about Okay y all ready to report out Okay if you can hear me clap once If you can hear me clap twice Okay different Give me one thing that was different Stephanie They all got different angles Okay the lines are different angles you re right What else Chloe At 10 30 A M all of them had all of temperatures were higher as well as to the 2 30 P M Higher temps in morning okay Um what else Kristin can you think of something else What do you think Nick There s different air temperature Okay there s a different air temperature Okay what else Just looking at the overall graph Justin Just looking at just the picture of the graph how does the picture look different from the morning to the afternoon All of the temperatures went got decreased In the In the um at 2 30 Okay and when you say decrease which graph looked like this The morning or the afternoon The morning The morning which one looked like this The afternoon Okay so overall the graphs look a little different from the morning to the afternoon Now why do you think that could be Why do you think that could be Kristen Because it s like on the side Oh okay here s our school okay This is where we did our experiment And Kristen s saying that the morning time the sun s here okay Where was the sun in the afternoon Anthony It was like barely Okay okay Semijah It was in the clouds Okay it was sometimes it was going behind the clouds Where was it Alex where was it in the sky You don t remember Behind the school Okay behind the school So this was our morning experiment and this was our afternoon experiment Okay and did we get different kinds of data Because what was truly pretty much the same Between both days besides the sun what was the air temperature in the morning 25 25 Okay so our air temperature stayed the same but the thing that was different was what Where the sun was Where the sun was okay So thinking about that we are going to try to get a solar water heater installed at the school okay a solar water heater installed at the school so what other do y all know a solar water heater a hot water heater in your house okay When you get in the shower or get in the bath and you have warm water how do you think that water s heated Does anyone know Peyton You have the water in your well you have a water heater in your garage or um Okay it s in your garage but what s heating that water The sun No 
 Has more light around him and it goes off into this huge dark hole through the trees Why do you think it s more light around him I don t know Just to show that to bring him more into the main point that you should see when you look at the picture What is the dark force symbolizing Why is it a dark force Why isn t it like a bright light Yeah I don t know It kind of reminds me of what Jack said Dante started going through the forest It kind of reminds me of his travel of starting to go to the layers of hell and stuff Hell s not a very bright place so it reminds me of that One thing the light and religious paintings Jesus has a light around his head so it might symbolize how he s pure or more religious But What d you say I said but Dante isn t pure so why would they highlight someone who wasn t as pure as like Jesus Okay so I want to come your statement in a moment because Kailyn had something to offer Why do you say he s not pure Is there any indication that he s not pure Well it s kind of an inference because he s man We all assume that the purity is in God or Jesus or Buddha or whatever He s not because he s man and men have faults Women have faults A human being is just not divine I guess But it says in the text that he gets angry with people who are not true to their religion and their beliefs politically and religiously So he kind of is the most pure one Not like Godlike but he is more pure than the rest I believe So do you think that s why Dante went to hell in the first place To go see all the bad people Do you think he was going there to learn a lesson Or going there to prove that he was right Because remember this is a fictional This is fictional So can a character cause you re right we infer that man is sinful But can a fictional character be perfect Can be flawless Can be sinless And if so is Dante trying to go a different way of inference Is he trying to infer that he is from what you ve said that he wants to find out more of what sins are so he can make himself pure if he s not already So can a fictional character be pure One of the questions I think was the three beasts he encounters and what do they represent I kind of thought that they represented what he does or what he did and everything Like a wake up call You re going to go see all of these people who have done things similar to that so you kind of want to change your ways They were reminding him what he has done and what he did because he was violent because he was in that guild kind of thing He was considered a fraud by the other team I guess side So I think it s more of a like he s going to there to see what happens when you don t be the best you could be I guess Who judges where you go Is it the devil or is it a higher power I thought it was the gods that judged that Are there gods in this story Do we ever hear much about the gods We aren t sure about the gods Yeah really Who judges where all these people go Cause they re talking about all the famous people and the places they are but who decides that We didn t really read the hell part as opposed to the Yeah yeah So maybe in the other books it would explain Where the gods are And you said who judges where they go and everything Technically we don t know what supreme being judges that because all we know is the devil is on the bottom eating Brutus Cassius and Judas But in the book on page 41 lines 8 9 Minos is the one who discover the crimes and dictates where they go So he s kind of like boss of hell sort of Forty one lines eight and nine I have a question Are their crimes so bad to the point that they go to hell or is it just because they made like sins or something Because everybody makes them so would that make everybody go to hell That s what I find too Meaningful But in their own perspective they are different Individual yeah So do you think that the layers of hell are how bad of the thing that the person did like how far What do you think depends on how far you go down Like the pain increases One of my questions are are the punishments of different people different based on who they are or what they do I think it s what they do but through their actions they can kind of be defined as who they are I think the layers of hell go down as the pain and suffering increases related to their crimes Couldn t it be like their pain and suffering for all of eternity is based off of all the pain and suffering that they had caused others in life For instance in Limbo All these babies that had died and weren t baptized are now there but they hadn t really hurt anybody so they re not being quite as punished as let s say Judas who s in the center of hell having his head gnawed on He caused a lot of pain and suffering therefore we was given a greater punishment for what he had done So it depends on who they put it on Yeah So if they just keep it to themselves Like gouging out the eyes That s not really hurting anyone else Right Where s the gouging of the eyes Where did you just pull that from What piece did we read where the eyes were gouged out Oh I m sorry I got confused Oedipus Oedipus He punished himself for it in a weird way But do you think that his punishment would not go as far because he didn t torture other people Think before you respond Think about it because I want you to respond to this This is huge I want you to write your question down on a piece of paper and then their responses to it because you have probably just now created a thesis for an essay we re going to do for the end of the year Okay So write down your question Mainly she has brought up just like I heard you guys doing with these pictures a different text Didn t you bring up the Odyssey with this Yeah Do you want me to write Oedipus specifically Yep write down the gouging of Oedipus eyes Where would Oedipus have ended up in Dante s Inferno Okay so pretty much Yep And I want you guys to answer and then I ll move on and come back I love how you bring in another text That s one reason I brought this picture in so you guys hit on that I love that you brought this up This is real higher order thinking because at the end of this year our essay for you guys for the final is to bring in the texts that we ve read and you have to develop a theme so right there s a good start Okay you ready for them to answer it Yeah Okay The pain that Oedipus caused wasn t intentional So I don t really think he d be punished as harshly I do believe that he d be punished due to the fact that he did kill his father and I believe a couple other people during that fight So he would be punished but I don t believe that the gouging of his eyes would lessen any of the punishment Cause really he didn t knowingly go into the incest and do that intentionally So really he shouldn t be punished for something that he didn t know he was doing But he still killed somebody He did kill somebody And the gouging of his eyes I don t think would lessen that I think it was more of a pain in life lesson for him Although It did cause him a lot of pain I believe the guilt that he faced caused him greater pain than his actual gouging of his eyes May I clarify something really quick here So you re saying basically because she asked where in hell would he be So f irst of all what level do you think he d be Gouging eyes or not where would he be in hell Where would Dante run into him He would be with the murderers With the murderers okay So you re saying that he wouldn t be any more in depth than that simply because of his gouging No That is just his own Retribution Yeah He did that to lessen the guilt in his life In himself Cause the guilt was much more painful than him gouging out his eyes And also even delivering pain to yourself can get you in hell with like suicides Right Cause there s the whole ring where like people kill themselves and they go to hell Or they destroy their possessions I didn t quite understand it completely but it seemed to say destroying items that they had I don t know maybe a couch or something If you destroyed that you d go to hell because they destroyed their own items Right right In Circle Nine and that s what important about this in Circle Nine those people that destroyed or take from You know you have Canna after Cain Everything is allegorical Every part of Circle Nine there s an allegory There s Ptolemy there s Cain Everybody is compared or made allegorical in there for their sins Because of what they did to humanity Like Ptolemy murdered people in his In his He was a ruler He just murdered people Mass murders So he was put in there as a comparison to that kind of sin That Hitler type of sin So everybody in that level too Which would be interesting to see Talk about some of our other literature Talk about The Odyssey a little more I have one more question about sin Do you think is everyone s definition of sinning the same Actually I don t believe so We were just talking how everybody lies but how are some still in Limbo Goes along with what he said was no I didn t steal so you stole and then you lied Yeah So you double dipped So you half and did different things Oh interesting so what d you come to We came to they d go to the serious one Yeah Whichever one s more serious Why Basically the one thing that impacted the world more like in a bad way is going to take the worse punishment So if I stole a penny or I lied to the king I d probably get punished for lying to the king That s what we kind of came up with Yeah So I want to ask you a question If you re saying you lied and then you lie about lying or you steal and you lie about lying I don t steal sorry Yeah they re two crimes and this person has chosen to commit two crimes Okay so does that play into that Would you suffer twice the punishment then No it doesn t bring up any of that in Dante s Basically everybody s got the same punishment But still wouldn t you get like harsher Well depending on the circle Yeah but some people in the circles do have worse punishments than other people Will you give me an example Well let s see Ulysses and I forget the other guy s name they are in the same flame and I think he said the flame was burning brighter I would assume that d be a worse punishment than other people if they re burning If they re burning yeah Some of the less worse um lesser punishments It s like magicians get their heads turned backwards You could see where you ve been but you wouldn t cry over it Unless getting stabbed to death and then healing and then getting stabbed to death again Yeah Then your flesh getting eaten off over and over and over again Yeah Yeah I want to ask you guys a question because we ve studied pictures all year long and there was one when we were studying Oedipus And I don t know who in this group had this one when you were doing those folders together but there is what is her name Antigone s brother s name that was dead Polynices Yeah Polynices Was it the one where she was like leaning over his body Yeah by the rock Yeah Okay now that you ve read The Inferno do some of those photos from some of these other stories and poems tie together or relate or reoccur I can relate Okay talk to me about that Because it reminds me of Dante being lost in the forest in the beginning and then it reminds me of how Oedipus gouged his eyes out and couldn t see anything and so he didn t know which path to take He had to rely on somebody else He had to rely on Virgil to get him through what was to come Then Oedipus he had to rely on Antigone to tell him where to go and trust her with his life basically Nice Nice That s what I got Well as I walk away I want you guys cause I m going to leave this here I want you guys to talk about other literature Cause you said yes I can relate some You just did I would like for you to relate All right Okay Okay 
 Let s go Okay Continue Yes All right scholars here s my question What do you think actually let me start by quoting the passage So it says they can either trust or predict what Chacko s attitude would be and they were trying to hide that get rid of it all before Chacko returned So what do you think Chacko s opinion of all of this chaos would be Could you just be particular with the chaos you were talking about What s that The entire situation the steamy love affair and the reaction on Baby Kochamma s part And Mammachi s part Got it I don t think he d be happy about the love affair cause as it says it s like she had defiled generations of breeding like the little blessed one blessed personally by the Patriarch of Antioch Antioch an imperial entomologist and Rhodes Scholar from Oxford so it s like she had taken what their family had worked for for so long and just thrown it out the window I m gonna have to disagree with that Becca I mean I think that Chacko is a liberal type He is very progressive he s a Marxist he didn t allow his father to beat his mother as most Indians Traditionalists probably would be OK with I think that Chacko would be no more angry about the whole affair than anybody would be if some guy was having an affair with his sister As a social ideal I think he would be fine with everything I agree because I feel like oh God I had this whole plan of something to say and I can t remember Sorry No it s not your fault Well what is the only thing that made Chacko upset at Mammachi Was it that she abandoned her children Oh I got it Yeah I feel like the most of this passage though it s third person narration it really feels like it s coming out of Baby Kochamma s mouth and it s like her diction throughout all of the italicized stuff The whole central paragraph where it uses a lot of dirty diction like mud and filthy and coarse and black To quote the passage once again So I feel like that all really Baby Kochamma s words and not necessarily Baba s beliefs and I feel like they have really contrasted beliefs Yeah I mean I feel like all the diction you were talking about for instance when it says Mammachi s rage at the old one eyed Paravan standing in the rain drunk dribbling and covered in mud And it repeats mud a lot and I think it s that s just kind of dirty and the action is really impure and they re trying and almost like mud covers things up So it s almost like it should be covered up And they were trying to cover it up But don t you feel like they used Chacko not being there and coming back as an excuse to do everything they do Oh he s coming back so we have to do this They kind of use him as the excuse to do it Well it s sort of like Chacko could intervene and so we have to do it now so we can t miss our chance to do it again I think that s important actually I think that a theme of unintended consequences like it says here It wasn t their fault when the whole thing spun like a deranged top I think the theme of unintended consequences is really crucial to both the book and the movie In the movie for example when Mahuditi says she thinks she knows what the consequences will be if Kayani gets married but the unintended consequences confound the defilement that she commits by him being around I think that s this book and movie is really trying to say is this is what happens when you set up rules and don t adapt to social conditions which are inevitably bound to change I ll just go In the fourth paragraph they talk about having a plan It s very orderly and they said that Kochu Maria was a midget lieutenant They had this very organized and planned out even though in the second paragraph she shuddered with a school girl shudder It s like her childish emotions are being turned into or coming out through her adult form where she has the power to do stuff Yeah on that I really want to say cause it says school girl shudder at the beginning And then it back in the fourth paragraph when it s talking about their plan they re referred to as the two old ladies So that s contrasting in a way to be described which obviously it s important Yeah I think that s one of the themes of the passage Conflicts between age and which one is ultimately I don t want to say better but a better advantage I guess Like in authority Between age and youth you mean Between old and young Yeah age and youth Which one can have a better life according to them They also play with age When they locked Ammu up it s kind of like putting her in time out like they tricked her in to her room which is also a parallel I saw in the movie when they locked Kalyani up so she couldn t get married It was to keep them from doing stuff I just want to bring up another theme of the passage Where it s the very beginning where it s before we are completely ruined by the It kind of presents this idea that society is not built on the basis of individual needs what you do In this society at least affects everybody around you And it kind of contrasts Ammu s individualism with what societal hierarchy and how these two women are higher on the hierarchy so they have authority over her and so they re telling her not to do this And they re presenting their authority over her And Chacko s even higher than them just cause he s a guy When the passage lists the life cycle events the weddings the funerals baptisms and birthday parties it says for generations to come so I feel like what Peter was saying it affects all of society That also ties in with the age because the weddings are for younger people The funerals are when you die The baptisms are when you are just born So it s saying it will affect everybody at all parts of their life that s how profound it is And even that sentence that Peter was talking about before it goes any further Before we are completely ruined I think that s also just family selfishness because they re just projecting what her the consequences of her actions will be for them Not necessarily for her And in the movie where the leader of that house of she s just really concerned about herself She ll sacrifice all of the other women just so she s comfortable But does she also use a we I think both Baby Kochamma and Diti say the same thing We re gonna be ruined by this We we we In regards to that I think In water you know how all the widows they sorta put them together and they sort of create this unity It s all out of despair because they all lost something In a sense Mammachi lost her former love and so did Ammu Ammu had babies without It wasn t a formal tradition The way she had her babies And so in a sense she has She s in grievance and so those two aspects unites these women Yeah they re all widows Yeah they re all widows and that really But does that give them right to be Oh understand that s why I feel like it says we Not we like our family but more of like we women who are widowed Austin what do you think Do you think that gives them the right to because they ve also lost and because Baby Kochamma and Mammachi has also experienced trauma so that also means Diti as well Her husband died when she was young Does that give them the right to take that I don t think so cause that was actually one of my questions Especially when it says Her tolerance immense needs as far as her son was concerned became the fuel for unimaginable fury at her daughter And then just my question was is Baby Kochamma s actions motivated by Indian society or her own emotions So I don t think that they should be able to from their past experience take it out on everybody else I think that what we re talking about right now maybe be reason that Ghandi appears at the end of the film Because Ghandi as he is portrayed in water is a symbol of rationalism And it s when he shows up nice Diti sees that may have a refuge from cycles of hatred and of tradition conceived for the purpose of basically personal gain Ghandi s existence in the movie is indictments of almost every action taken in this passage by the scheming old women I think that Ghandi in the movie represents more of rebirth because they talk about how much society will change once Ghandi takes power The widows will gain power The untouchables won t be untouchable anymore They ll gain more rights So I think they look at him as not really rationalism because some people think that he s just crazy The Brahmin caste don t see him as rational so I think it s more of a hope in an idealized society Building off of what she said how Ghandi represents re birth I think coincides with the movie s title Water For me at least the way I saw it I felt like water was rebirth throughout the movie They washed themselves it was washing away their sins Being reborn I thought who s the girl The one who killed herself Kalyani I thought that it was symbolic when she drown herself Because the way she was killing herself she was submersing herself in water and I thought since water was clearing away your sins and stuff she in a sense she was clearing away her sins And so she would go to the next life sinless I think that the drowning of Kalyani parallels to how Sophie Mol drowned How it s like the innocent life was taken by the water Which isn t really innocence too But was Kalyani innocent I think that if she hadn t been forced to do things she would have been she didn t feel right about what she had done I m gonna take the opposite view point to the water that symbols of inescapability in the movie because of the way in both the movie and the book It says the fisherman had already found Sophie Mol She They drowned trying to cross the river and Kalyani loses everything when she crosses the river and realizes who Norian really is The river is important in both works It s an inescapable wall So I don t think water is portrayed as a good image I mean it could possibly be both I think Peter made a pretty good point about it Sam did with Kalyani s death and Sophie Mol s death But I think it could be both I think it s a duality thing And then going on combining what both ya ll said where you said it s an inescapably and the way they view it as washing away their sins View it as a cleansing thing also for example emphasizes the irrationality of all their beliefs And they re cleaning themself in this if water is just viewed a symbol they re cleaning themselves with something that s bad I also don t think that They depend on the water too to get their food from it They wash themselves in it Yet it s also it creates this it s something that the Paravans are trying to overcome A lot of people are trying to overcome this barrier but they depend on it They still need it So it s contrasting what they believe Just like a duality thing Yeah It s the family and God s talkings Their immediate family They depend on each other because when you re a child you have to have an older figure to help you grow up But they are also They cause the turmoil with each other They create their own problems pretty much It s like you can t live with them but you can t live without them Susan did you have a question Yes I did Well a lot of them are about similarities between characters But one thing that I thought about was how Norian dealt with his lover s loss and how Velutha was able to deal with being separated from Ammu And do you think that their status influenced how they were able to deal with the situations Sorry I missed all this So she I heard Well Norian because he was a Brahmin the highest caste I think he said we ll either going to Calcutta or India to start his life You mean Kolkata Or I m sorry or England To become a lawyer So he had the option of completely starting his life over wherever he wanted to go because he had education and he could provide for himself Velutha was an untouchable so he had no opportunity 
 tilted towards the Sun you re closer to the sun which is heat which means you re going to be warmer When you re tilted away from the Sun then there s less heat because you re farther away from it it s going to be colder That s what changes the seasons Once again it goes in orbit Like you said the closer we are to the Sun or the father away once again it goes back to being an elliptical orbit I think that tilt causes the seasons and the closer we are tilted to the Sun that means it s like Summer or Spring then if we re tilted back it s Winter or Fall I m kind of understanding what you guys are saying Because I m thinking of it as like say like the globe that s sitting right there say that Ben was the sun You can use that if you d like Say that Ben was the Sun the Sun would be shining at the bottom of the globe because the globe s tilted So there wouldn t be much Sun at the top of the sphere because that s the most tilted away from the Sun So it would cause Summer lower and on the other side it would cause Winter Why are you shaking your head I disagree I think the Sun would hit more on top than it does on the bottom because like Antarctica and stuff always cold and it s at the bottom So I think it hits more in the top and in between like by the equator Because as you go down South it s more warmer but still if you go down way down to Antarctica it s totally freezing they don t get no sun That s not right Because there is like sunlight in Antarctica and stuff It s just cause like the latitude and longitude and like because Because Antarctica s at zero degrees So it s cold down there I want to know when the Sun is going in its orbit if it just goes from this to this like boom or if its turning and its like facing the Sun like that like I don t understand that Okay So our question is what Like when you re going around the Sun and its on its axis like this tilted and it goes around eventu Does it just like go like that Like real quick And then it s like shifted so the bottom is getting more light and that would put us in Winter What do you think Kaylie You haven t said anything Do you think that our our tilt s going to just change No I think it s like whenever we re rotating like it goes around the Sun in the orbit Can I show She s saying that as it s rotating it s staying the same it s just that it s changing because you re changing position from which way the Sun is Can I show an example with the globe Yeah please Say the Sun was in the middle Say like the globe is right here Say we re right here it s Summertime really close and the Sun s right here And as we go around like maybe like we re right here and this is Fall and then we go to Winter And as we turn this way for the Spring and then we re back to Summer again because we re going around the sun so But the only problem with that is we re still going to be tilted away when it when we go over towards the Sun We re still going to be tilted away won t we Well the Earth s always tilted Yeah but we ll be tilted away In the Summer you re tilted towards the Sun Let s go back to does the tilt change Okay so we re definitely talking about this tilt and I m guessing there s a lot of kids that are a little unsure about the tilt Yes So if you think you understand the tilt help everybody else understand We re not getting this tilt in what you re talking about So explain it the best way you can and help each other okay so I don t get this tilt Does it just flip flop What do you think Anna I think it stays the same What about you Shana You haven t said anything yet Well as the Earth goes around in its orbit it shifts just like a little bit that way you re like closer to the Sun And then during the Winter we re father away Is that how it is We re closer towards the Sun in the Summer and we re father away in the Winter Yes Who doesn t think that Could I try something with the globe real quick Yes Could I borrow Nick to be my Sun Yeah Be his Sun Nick Come on Sun Go out there and stand in the middle Pretty dark Sun Yeah you are Okay we re gonna say that this little pin here is where the Sun is hitting today All right And we re spinning woah spinning that way It s spinning it s spinning it s spinning it s spinning but it never it never tilts back towards the Sun That s what I don t understand does it just go like this This is a really good question This is a really good question Now I want wait don t move yet I want go ahead be the Sun still And I want you to walk around and explain to people what you re talking about Number one show us the tilt Okay that s the tilt Show everybody the tilt Okay everyone this Nick move you re in the way of people Just duck down just crouch And this is the way of the tilt the way it s tilted that way But as we go around it s still tilted that way And this side here is still far away so what It s going to stay Winter all the time Or is it just going to like flip And be like Hey guys look Now we re Summer but we re upside down That s what I don t understand He has a very good question okay His question is why is what hemisphere are you talking about The Northern Hemisphere Okay So why is the Northern Hemisphere always tilted towards the Sun how he s walking away Because his argument is that Oh I have it right here Go ahead It says Because the Earth s axis is slightly tilted when the North Pole is laying towards the Sun and South Pole is laying away from the Sun And when the South Pole is leading towards the Sun the North Pole is leading away from the Sun It says As a result the number of daylight hours in the Northern and Southern hemisphere are not constantly recalled because the Earth is divided in two halves of the hemisphere by the equator the hemisphere that leads towards the Sun has a long day and short nights Does that have to do with anything See I Wait Does that have to do with anything That s Sabrina s question Does that have to do with anything So summarize what you just read to us Does the tilt have like also have to do with like the days and like the short days and short nights Does the tilt have to do with the short days and long nights and long days and short nights Shawn you re shaking your head yes You think it does have to do with it Say yes Yes You think it does have to do with it Why Who could help him explain why would a tilt change the length of day Move over Lucas Because like it s if like it ll be indirect Sun if it s tilted away from it And instead of like I don t know I think it is because I think another thing in the direct rays because the way we re tilted it s the number of daylight hours because of the less Sun as much of the Sun because of the tilt and how the Sun hits it when its on its tilt I think like see how it tilted that way No why don t you use it Why don t you boys sit down and let Pass that globe over to Byers and let him explain What I think is You know how it s tilted this way Maybe it ll tilt the opposite direction for the Summer Like instead of it being tilted towards this it ll tilt the other way for the South Instead of the North be showing the South would be showing That s what I think Where is the Sun That s what I m not understanding The Sun would usually be in the middle You need a hand Yeah Okay go ahead be the Sun again The Sun s in the middle And that s why if it s tilted this way we re getting our Sun but I thought if it would tilt the opposite way like instead of being tilted this way it d tilt that way then the South would get more Sun Okay So how But what you re asking is the same question as Lucas Yeah How does that other hemisphere become tilted towards the Sun That s what you re trying to figure out Whenever Lucas walked it around the whole time what hemisphere was pointing towards the Sun The Southern Hemisphere was pointing towards the Sun And the Northern Hemisphere was pointing away from the Sun Ben No I thought it was the Northern was pointing to the Sun and the Southern was pointing the other way But it remained constant the whole orbit Yes That s what I couldn t figure out like how did it just like did it like flip around and all of the sudden Maybe the Sun it changed What do you guys think Does the Sun move JJ you haven t been in here yet I think like every day it moves a little to the other side Wait what does The Earth The Earth moves everyday Yeah it might Like it tilts every day It tilts the tilt is changing Is that what you re saying So the tilt changes What were you gonna say I think the It The Earth like doesn t move like when it stays in one spot I think it might like flip Like kind of like just go around like Can you show us Do you wanna show us Sure I ll try I was gonna say maybe like as it s as like the Earth turns around maybe it like tilts forward every so often and backward So you re telling me the tilt is changing though and it flips Yes Okay so what are you saying It just goes around like this and eventually it just like spins around So it spins on top of its rotation Yeah What do you think Brad I think yeah I kind of agree with him Wait with who with David While it s like going around its orbit it just like tilts So the tilt is changing Yeah What do you think Alec You haven t said anything yet I don t agree with him I think that it spins while its moving around Don t raise your hand you don t have to raise your hand Only this like what Nick just did or maybe every day it goes a little bit and tilts like this And the Sun hits more of the Southern It s like everyday goes a little bit little bit little bit so where the South starts to get more Sun Because like when we re in Summer and Australia has Winter So when we re in Winter Australia has Summer So And it s in the Southern half and we re in the Northern half Wait Tiffany you were shaking your head Do you agree with what he s saying Sort of yeah Because if one spot on the hemisphere gets more sunlight the most likely it s gonna be warmer than the other Like he was saying when we get more sunlight and the temperature s warm up here the temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere get a little colder if they don t have as much sunlight and not as much warmth You see what I mean Like say I m right here the Sun is tilted so you see how the Sun s right here And then it tilts a little bit like this We re still getting Summer sunlight but Australia s getting more sunlight I have to agree with what JJ said earlier It tilts everyday So the tilt is changing You think that the tilt is changing Morgan you think the tilt is changing No I don t think it s changing I think it s staying the same because even I think the rotation helps because if it goes around the orbit even though its rotating it helps Like Nick you re the Sun like and the axis stays and when it rotates the Earth rotates and it s like kind of it like helps us I don t know like indirect sunlight I don t know Something like that I can show what she means I think Go ahead I think it s also about the gravitational pull Like when it goes around farther there s less gravitational pull As it goes around farther there s less gravitational pull Okay when you do this Grace please explain to me what it is So that everybody here that s watching can try and make sense of what we re talking about I think what she s saying is like say Nick s the Sun again Since the Northern is that way I think she s saying is it doesn t rotate but this is but we re kind of going around kind of like this So then it changes So now the Southern is towards the Sun and the Northern is that way So now it s changed She did something very different in her orbit Did anybody catch that Yeah yeah Like she it didn t move it just went around like around the Sun What do you mean it didn t move The Earth stayed still and just moved at one point It didn t do that Okay let s do it again okay And I want you to make sure that number one everybody sees where you start and everybody sees what happens to the Earth as she s showing you how it s going around So explain to us What is this Where are we starting Okay we re starting out this way with the Northern towards the Sun and the Southern away from the Sun And as we are rotating I don t know if all of you guys can see this But as we re going around Stop there It s not moving So since it s not moving now the Northern is kind of like facing away and the Southern is facing towards the Sun now Keep going And then just make sure that the camera can see what you re talking about as you go around Okay So did everybody see that Who doesn t understand that Who didn t understand what she did right there Okay So Now I don t understand actually wouldn t it actually have to stop rotating and then it would have to rotate on its axis and then start rotating again I m not sure what you mean by that Like you spun it like this All right But the Earth is going like this the whole time Would that end up stopping and then it go like this Or is that still happening It s not turning like that It s just rotating around the Sun Wait Sabrina you had something to say Okay So here s what s happening Lucas is a little confused about your explanation okay So we just have to go through it again What did you have to say Sabrina The earth doesn t change its tilt It stays like an exact same position but when it goes around the Sun it gets like different ways like the Sun hits it in different directions which causes different weathers Okay wait why don t you try to show him Maybe it s just a different person Maybe it will help explain it okay So the more people we can get information out of remember the more we re gonna understand So start and tell us what s happening And just make sure the camera can see what you re doing The Northern Hemisphere is towards the Sun and the Southern is facing away So this causes colder weather and up here where it s facing the Sun causes warmer weather So when it goes around the weathers start to change and then when you get it around here the Southern is facing towards Wait is the Southern facing towards The Southern s facing towards the Sun And the winter is facing away Which causes it to be warmer down here and Winter up here Who can help her out because What I don t understand is Go ahead go ahead I don t understand it because it s still changing from day to night but then it s shifting so wouldn t it have to stop spinning and then shift If it stops spinning we re gonna die Not necessarily Okay wait Ben start from the beginning and explain what s going on Nick is our Sun still Put your legs in so he doesn t trip Northern Hemisphere is towards the Sun Southern s away And it s still spinning it doesn t change Okay And so stop there and what s happening The Southern Hemisphere s towards the Sun and the Northern s away from it And what happened to the tilt the whole time It didn t change It what It didn t change It didn t change it stayed the same But that made more sense Like I couldn t figure out why it wasn t spinning but now I do And then it keeps going And then it just goes back Now I understand Okay Let s use this model and try to figure out where are the seasons happening So where do we live Anna We live Yeah where he s pointing What s that called somebody America North America North America let s get bigger Northern Hemisphere What Byers The Northern Hemisphere Okay so we live in the Northern Hemisphere Right now what s happening It s Summer It s Summer in the Northern Hemisphere Does everyone see that Yes Yes Anybody not see it s Summer in the Northern Hemisphere see it Yeah Okay so 
 5 03 5 03 All right let s talk for a minute before you continue with your little test First of all let s talk about motion What do you know about motion Motion is the way that you get from one place to another It s changing position Changing position so just now Bailey was running was he changing position Yes Yes all right so how do we know that he was in motion Like when he is running toward me how do I know he s in motion That stays there and you can see him coming up Nobody else was moving around So that s our frame of reference He came over there so we know he s coming toward us All right so you guys did a trial How many times did you run Bailey Three All right so what are we gonna do now We re gonna have to add them all up and divide them by three Why are we dividing by three Because we did it three times Okay you did it three times You re finding your average What s another word for average Mean Mean good All right so let s find his mean or his average And then we ll record that and double check to make sure the whole group has the same amount or the same number Okay what did you get 5 21 5 21 is that what everybody has Nathan maybe you redo yours and just check since three people have that Let s name some things that are in motion What do you know that s in motion The earth The earth is in motion yup But I don t feel the earth move so how do I know it s in motion Cause sun is the frame of reference Okay so if I was thinking of the sun which is what they do and the earth we know we could see the earth is moving and the sun would be your frame of reference What else do you know that moves Animals Animals Insects Cars Insects cars Boats People People books Boats Boats All right so how are we gonna find our speed because now we know how many seconds it took him but what s something else that I need to know besides how long it took him The distance The distance traveled which is a hundred feet So what difference did we do Hundred feet A hundred feet Okay so what s the first thing you have to do is measure out your hundred feet Yes You did that and chalk marked it Good all right so let s We re talking about the average time taken All right so let s do that now 19 So let s talk about what that means 19 19 Feet per second What s that mean Feet per second 19 feet per second So if I say feet per second can you explain that to me What does that mean 19 feet per second Every second I would go 19 19 feet Good okay so if I m driving in my car and my car s going 70 miles per hour and I m on the interstate do I say my car s going 75 No No you d say miles per hour bleh 70 miles per hour Can you tell me Nathan why What does that mean 70 miles per hour 70 miles per hour means you re going 70 miles per each hour For every hour so that s good to know for vacations right Especially when you have little kids who are saying Are we there yet You gotta figure out how long it s gonna take you Are we there yet Right okay All right you re going to go into your next part and I ll be right back to check on you Who s the next person Jordan It s gonna be Jordan All right Miss Jordan Hold the longest tape and put it down right here so it will stay up He thinks he needs one more piece of tape Ready Ready Set go 1 76 1 89 Okay so why don t you write them both Do you have two spots Only have one You have two spots write one there and one there That s what you do there just like that What did you get 1 89 1 89 All right let s come talk about what you re doing So let s get the three kinds of balloons that you re testing Just gonna bring over here Dan why don t you get the um come slide that over here so we can get that tape off and get ready for the next one We might try that one here So we have A big round one A big round one a green one okay A long one Okay And a birthday one Did you all predict the same one would be the fastest or do you have different predictions Different Different predictions what do you think The Happy Birthday one You think the Happy Birthday one Long Long Long Long Can you tell me why you think Happy Birthday and then you ll tell me why you think long At first my prediction was the long one because it was not as much wind blowing against it But now there s wind blowing It blew it to the sides and putting more force against it which slowed it down and made the long go faster It d be like this wind Yes You had this big That is a pretty good prediction Why do you guys think it s gonna be the long one I think it s the long one because it s more smaller and the air can come off faster and it s more stretchier Stretchier Tight it s more tight All right all right we had some wasn t going all the way so we changed it to 20 It would stop about maybe three feet away from the end It would stop so what did you decide to do We changed it to 20 You moved it to 20 Okay so What else could you have done besides move it to 20 Blow up the balloon more Maybe blow up the balloon more Maybe the little one wouldn t have worked though huh It s not that much in there We tried the big red one putting more air but it still stopped The little one I think the wind kind of changed how fast it would go and how far All right so All right So let s come back this way Watch out behind you Megan Dan you can go over to There s motion in the wind huh 176 and 108 All right so here we go What are you gonna do first Let s do the round balloon first That was nobody s prediction right Nope So let s do that one first What are we gonna do 20 Add both up And then what are you gonna do Divide by two Why are we dividing by two To get the average To get the average Why did you do it twice Why didn t you just And there s two the two trials Why you did two trials Why wouldn t you just do one Why do you think that would ve been better to do two Divided by Then we wouldn t have to divide it we wouldn t have to find the average at all But I guess we d get a better result What d you get there 2 35 3 73 That s what I got 2 35 You add these two together and you divide them Remember this is the average Can you have four I divided by two but I got 3 73 Let s try again On the calculator I always do things twice to double check 2 35 2 35 Everybody s good Okay so let s go down to the bottom of our sheet and we are going to figure out our average speed So what s our formula for that How do we figure out average speed You do 20 because of the Okay so that s when we took 20 because you see we had 30 on our sheet because originally we were doing 30 So let s cross out you changed it to 20 And I think it was Dan that said if we were to probably no Hannah said we could probably could put more air in that balloon But changing the feet that ll work Now how fast did the first balloon go 19 35 by 20 Look at your formula again 8 52 Your distance is 20 so you re gonna do your distance divided by your average time Good 8 51 Okay and I ll come back to check on you you All right let s see how these guys are doing This one s a runner The line s over here right Jordan 16 16 We re at the end of Nathan s so let s go ahead and figure out Nathan together I ll come sit in your spot They re in here So to figure out Nathan let s talk about it together while we re doing it We need some more calculators over here Wait what s this 641 Everybody please do catch up Got your pencils Wait wait 641 575 Tell me again what we re doing average time 6 08 Does everybody have six Read it back correctly Six point O eight Is that how you read it correctly in math Six decimal Do we say decimal Six Six point zero eight Do we say point Six and And Eight hundredths Six and eight hundredths Ohhhh Gotta get it So let s look just at our average time for just a second Stop for a minute and let s look at the top at our average time How do we know who is going the fastest when we re look at just the top part just the time Average time The lowest The lowest number right cause he s getting in the fastest time So now when we go to the bottom and we re figuring out the speed how do we do speed Whoever s the lowest number The highest number The highest number it s going to be Let s go ahead and do Nathan and then we ll compare then we ll let Demi do hers 16 point 16 point 16 44 right Yep So let s look so far at the bottom Bailey Jordan and Nathan Who is the fastest So far Bailey So far Bailey okay so how can we instead of looking at this this looks like a whole bunch of numbers to me What can I do visually just to make it a little bit clearer Make a bar graph Okay we can make a bar graph with this Anything else we can do Line graph Maybe get each person to make a line graph Take your own three times and make a line graph with your own three times Because that would be you right over time That would be a great idea So we can do the straight line graphs That s a good idea with the line graph Bailey So when we make a line graph we ll do that at the end using this information and then we ll do a bar graph using this information Does that sound good All right Demi s turn s up Let s go Let s see how we are doing here Okay we re at the very end So which one ended up being the fastest The long one The long one But I think that Devon had a very good prediction I think his reasoning was good See that wind blowing In a race when you re in a race and you re running or when you re in a foot ball team what side do you want to be on if you have the ball and you re trying to get that ball to the other side You want the wind to be with you right Because if you re against the wind the wind is pushing on you so I think Devon had an excellent Good job Devon next time All right we re at the bottom Why do you think that balloon was the fastest I put The shape of it the wind went right past it All right remember there was unbalanced force So the force inside the balloon where was the force The wind the air The air that Devon blew inside that balloon the air inside pushed the balloon and that s what made it travel and it was an unbalanced force so when you let go It probably was the fastest because even though the wind was blowing it s on a round part to where it would spin and the wind would just roll off of the balloon and it would just make the balloon roll but it would still go as fast as it usually goes That s a pretty good idea too It s kind of like when you re driving a car if you re on vacation sometimes your parents you may see them driving behind a 18 wheeler Why do you think they would do that Because the wind blocks the Because the wind is blocking 18 wheel blocks it The 18 wheeler s blocking the wind so you can get more miles per hour I mean you can get better gas mileage doing that If you ever see your parents doing that Some people don t like to do that though because of rocks Rocks yeah it could be dangerous Yeah it could be dangerous becuase of rocks Good job 
 Counting on that I agree with AJ but also I think that What I want to say is that it kind of adds a lot more risk when they get rid of the space shuttle because kind of like what AJ was saying it s good to have a backup just in case you want it And we still do need to go up to space every now and again if we want to maintain stuff up there So we know that so we re having other people work with it but the problem is is that actually adds more risk because now we have to deal with the fact that What if they messed up What if they blow up or do something wrong And if they re not as stringent on safety standards as we are then there s gonna be a lot more problems and if it s not able to do the same things that s going to be completely bad too Okay Eric said Go up to fix things What would be some things that we would need to make sure that we re going up to maintain in space Just to kind of follow up International Space Station Okay International Space Station Some of the satellites we have in orbit Okay satellites that do what for us Television and communication Okay Ms McCall what s that one with the sun that is predicting the sun flares You can just write Sun Probe Sun probe That s fine Excuse me while I turn this on And the Hubble Hubble s gone a lot longer than they expected it to so if it breaks we d want to repair it Especially since we don t have a new one Alana I know how Mer was talking about the risks like with the Challenger and that was really devastating but I remember the wife whose husband died on Challenger She said that he knew the risks That s part of being an astronaut and being in NASA and willing to go up there and you re risking your life It s not like they went in there totally blind about that I think that s kind of the price of gaining so much knowledge about something so unknown right now We have to be able to risk our lives to get it and if they have people willing to do that I say go for it Okay Blanca and then Megan I get what she s saying with they risked their lives but you re also risking the money and time that everyone has put into it They spent all this time and all this money on these ginormous space things and to put them up into space And like the Challenger it just exploded and they didn t even really get that far just for one minor error And I don t think they should cut all the way like they were saying Have it just when you need it but it s still a lot of money that our country doesn t really have right now so maybe it s not the most important thing and there s other things that they need to fix before they can go back to putting more money into that We ll go Megan then Bieber So you know how we re paying Russia to fly up to the International Space Station I think what we should do is have a shuttle and have people pay us to ride up to the space station Because then we have more funding for NASA and then we have a shuttle Then people know they can get us instead of giving all this money to Russia to fly up there I feel like we should still have our own shuttle so that we can fly up not for free but we can fly up with the United States and then have open seats for other countries who need to come in They can pay us for it and then we get the money Okay Bieber you need to sit close Eli then we ll go Rachel I don t know what color to show but Russia s not making a profit off of us riding up there They re just trying to cover their costs It s not like we ll be doing good business ferrying people to the International Space Station It s not like a tourist attraction or anything It s pretty bland up there Russia s just trying to pay to get us up there That s the cost of flying somebody there They re not making profit out of it Okay good that s a downpoint Rachel I agree with what Eli said and also people were talking earlier about jobs and how it creates a bunch of jobs And I think I read somewhere that they created 25 000 jobs or something like that But if you think about it if there s 300 million people that s still less than 1 of the population So while it seems like a big number it s still not creating as many jobs and we could be creating other jobs somewhere else Especially with the economy so we could be spending the money that we would be spending on NASA on something else to help boost our economy before we start focusing more on NASA and spending billions of dollars Amber then Clark I was going to say I kind of agree with that because our economy is so bad right now Any kind of job that is offered will be really good for us right now at this point in time So I don t think cutting the funding for it would be a really smart idea because that s also putting a lot of people out of work Clark The statistics with the jobs created are probably from when NASA was being used a lot and now that it s been cut down already all those jobs have already been cut And I don t think in this economy people need jobs requiring that much education not everybody has that kind of education to have a job like that People just need regular jobs in general So you re saying their employment would be kind of geared towards upper level educated as opposed to maybe And like in science and stuff and not everybody has that That s a downpoint Luis Going back to the billions of dollars that are wasted or could be used for better things I found out that the funding for NASA only accounts for 0 7 of the US government spending I feel like if you just cut all of that that s not really going to make a huge difference when the government s spending 99 3 on other things We ll go Hallie then Troy Going back to the risk of sending people out into space I researched and I found out that the risk of manned space flights are actually increasing because the budget cuts have already happened As we re pushing for more people and more money we re actually hurting ourselves more because the safety and quality assurance programs have been trimmed back The risk is just becoming more and more That s an interesting point As we re slowly cutting back on the budgets already we re automatically increasing that risk because of those budget cuts Troy I actually support them cutting the budget because for one when they cut budget they re setting aside money to buy more space exploration from private companies Those people are more likely to employ more employees than the government which also stimulates the economy a lot more I mean if everybody s employed by the government like what could happen to Greece Okay Shannon hasn t spoken Bieber Kind of off of what Holly said with the risk and everything going up I did a little research and with NASA there was only a 4 1 fatality rate Out of something like 439 astronauts there have only been 18 deaths I feel like there are other jobs with a higher fatality rate than being an astronaut Okay so even with the budget cuts we re not seeing this huge increase Jillian A lot of people are making the points that it s only affecting the people that are on the space shuttles but at the same time I don t think people realize the amount of carbon dioxide put off by one shuttle launch It s 28 tons of carbon dioxide and it s killing the plants and fish around the site area and it has a lot of negative effect on everyone not just the people in the space shuttle So you re taking the environmental aspect Besides looking at costs besides looking at jobs there s this environmental piece specifically with carbon dioxide What is the issue associated with carbon dioxide Jillian The ozone layer depleted and global warming Thank you global warming Tyler To go along with what Luis said they only get 0 7 of the national spending but we also have gained more knowledge from NASA than any other government thing We can discover maybe how Earth is going to end and we can discover things that are more important than other government government spending So you re kind of going at the idea that the benefits are outweighing the small amount of cost when we compare government spending We ll go Eli then Justin Also Luis said it doesn t account for very much of the US budget and if we cut that spending it s really not going to go to anything more productive Maybe more guns or something It s not going to feed the world and buy food for homeless people It s just going to go to corporations and wars And then in regards to CO2 emissions does anyone know how much CO2 emissions a moose puts out in a year Far more than a truck driver Cows and moose I think they can flirt over that I think that s just moose So you re making the comparison to say the idea that even though it s a human made craft if we look at natural sources of the CO2 emission And the relative frequency that a moose passes gas A space shuttle launch doesn t have that big of an effect on the environment Touche Anyone have a cup that hasn t spoken yet that wants to jump in real quick Justin Going off of what Tyler said if we stop funding NASA then we pretty much cut off studying anything outside of our solar system because of the atmosphere of Earth just doesn t allow us to see that far So it would lessen the chances of seeing the birth of a star or the death of a star or where earth might be heading in the future Interesting point Amber then Eric Besides everything about the jobs NASA has created a lot of things that have helped us today different technologies Like in someone s presentation they were saying something about they re creating lighter systems for firefighters and then cosmetic companies are even using their stuff So there s a lot of technology that s been created because of NASA so I think it s benefited us a lot more than it hasn t helped us And so you re saying those products that have been produced because of the exploration are useful to us in our everyday lives It s not just useful for exploring many new things I forgot my order Was it Eric on that one I have a couple different connections One of them s with the cost Like they re saying it s 0 7 of the total budget but the thing is not only is it that low of a cost it s 14 billion just to give you an actual number It s 14 billion dollars for the entire budget of NASA This year just for this year alone To give you a comparison it s around 640 between 680 for the military budget That is 47 times more expensive Now you can say Well alright that s the military The thing is that first of all it has a lot higher mortality rate Second of all it s a lot less productive in general I mean we re pretty much paying people to kill other people on the planet I m sorry but that s not very cool in general For one of those things we re trying to get a high fatality rate not for our side but the other side But the other thing is that for jobs creations if you want to create more jobs and you re going for a more positive feel you wouldn t decrease funding for NASA you would increase funding Because think about it If you increased it 47 times to the military I m pretty sure you d get a lot more than one million even a lot lot more than just one million jobs from NASA if you increased this funding a lot because imagine whole new planets Just for environment alone is the fact that we have seven billion people on this planet and with seven billion people we can t hold that many people very long on this planet But there are so many other planets out there that we could easily fit everyone There s enough planets in this entire galaxy for each person to have their own planet That s how many planets there are So you re thinking planning for the future that it might be beneficial for us Holly As I was researching I found out that there s really no short term benefits and we re not guaranteed long term benefits Yes we are learning about things outside of our solar system and universe but the main goal of studying outside the universe is so eventually it could help us We re not guaranteed to find some new way to cure cancer or to protect the earth from magnetic storms There might be some way we can save ourselves but we re not guaranteed that So you re saying the unknown part of that research kind of plays into the factor We can keep researching but we may never find the answer Monique you got some info Yeah I think when Hepetiah said how benefits outweigh the budget and the risks we ve talked about what was up there The benefits are so much longer than what we have in the risk section We gain knowledge we need to study the sun probe and Hubble and International Space Station With jobs it provides a whole section of jobs having shuttles go up to space Not only that but they ve created new inventions through that and I think the inventions they have created is really important at home and in the hospital Going from there there s going to be more Not just stopping now So again tying in the cost benefit analysis that the benefits are much more outweighing the costs A J and then we ll go Alana I guess to counter what Troy said and what a few people have said when they talk about that more jobs can be created using the money It s not just about the economy When you think about it NASA wasn t meant to help the economy at all and it wasn t meant for job creation even though it has employed so many people Through the research that I did there was a story from somebody that s going to be retiring just because he knows he d lose his job anyway He said that After 30 years this is all I know We re losing the most brilliant minds our country has because they just don t know what else to do NASA s been open for decades and that s their job Technicians and analysts they re not going to just become accountants or something There s nothing after NASA That s probably the highest most prestigious thing What do you do after that It s not like they re just going to fill minimum wage jobs which is what most people are looking for right now anyway if you re thinking about job creation It s a good point you have all these highly educated specialized people as A J points out Where are they going to go Are they going to be able to find jobs within our country Are they going to go overseas and then maybe be helpful and more productive for other countries It s a good point Alana then Troy I know we re talking a lot about the cost benefit and job creation but I want to go back to the safety and I have a question for everyone just to think about The main part in all the failed missions especially with the shuttle and the Challenger it s basically been human error You know they talk about how the higher guys wouldn t listen that it was too cold outside and the ring would break and everything but I ve been thinking what if we were to use some sort of higher technology instead of relying on human and the possible errors that we make Like robots we use robots to build half our cars and that probably cuts down a lot on the human error rate So do you think using more robotic and higher technology than just humans would that help in any way with the safety issue and the errors that we make That s an interesting point We ll have to put that on the question board Troy what you got Kind of to counter what A J said these people are highly educated Minimum wage places are probably the ones that are hiring the least Companies with a lot of money are the ones that are hiring them now People that have highly specialized degrees they re really intelligent and they could be working at places like in finance Those people are being hired a lot more than people that have financial degrees If you can do quantitative physics those people are going to be hired a lot more than someone who s just a finance agent So your counterpoint is the idea that because they re so highly educated they will find some sort of a niche Yeah There s a lot of people that actually get degrees in rocket science and end up going into finance because it pays better Interesting Jillian Back to what Alana said if you re using robots to make it safer that s also just going to cost more money to make those robots and to find people that can make those robots If you re using robots as the engineers then you re having people lose jobs Interesting point So kind of a counterpoint to shifting our focus from human exploration to robotics there s some drawback association We ll go Rachel Going back to what Eric said a while ago he was talking about the military and it has a higher budget but I feel like the military helps a lot of people and it creates a lot of jobs and educates people because the military pays for a lot of people s education university and stuff I know a lot of people now since university is so expensive a lot of people are going into the military so they can get their education paid for So I feel like it should have a higher budget because it s creating so many jobs and especially for people who aren t necessarily has a doctorate in physics or something People that are really smart like what Troy said they won t really have that much of a problem finding jobs especially with a big corporation They don t have to necessarily work for the government or NASA or something So I think that the budget should stay where it is because that s pretty funny We ll go Megan and Tyler I don t know when it was mentioned but we were talking about how we re trying to find how the earth will be when all has failed and I feel like with all the carbon dioxide emitted and with our atmosphere right now we re trying to discover what our world will be like when all of that s gone I feel like that s really important for the development of Earth is to know what it s going to be like when there is no more What can we do so that we don t turn into a Mars or Venus What can we do now to stop it from happening Good so you re making connections to maybe the video when they talked about the future if there s an issue with our magnetosphere Potentially could we wind up like Mars So kind of getting a jumpstart to say where we are headed future wise So almost like a selfish need to figure out what s going on out there and where we might go Anyone that hasn t spoken yet want to comment 
 Well I can start I just kind of wanted to follow with Lina s going back to the very beginning of the book and sort of I guess a response to Mariana s comment I think that a big focus of the book is sort of that beginning story with the starfish like at the very very beginning when she talks about how one girl tosses back a starfish and then she brings all the other people that toss back starfish so it s not about making this huge change in one moment cause that s never going to happen It s about that one step where you inspire somebody else to take the next step And since we are young adults you know if we take that step now and we continue taking those little steps throughout our entire lives before you know it things are gonna change So even though it seems discouraging like oh it s really hard and upsetting and speaking from personal experience it can be upsetting it s about continuing on and taking those little steps Yeah you know at the same time I think there s something hard about it but it s not something that is beyond our control It s just we don t want to appear confrontational Because I thought we were having this discussion on Friday I was listening in my science and physiology class to what people were saying and was listening if there were any instances although it doesn t count as racism you count it as prejudice by definition I was listening for instances and actually something does kind of fit Because there was this one girl who was talking about how her stepfather was or her mom s boyfriend was really mean and was always cheating on her mom and yelling at her and he said Oh I wish you were white he wouldn t do that stuff if you were white This was a black girl There was this other in my physiology class Isn t that not racism Well that s not Do you think she was serious or don t you I don t know but you know even if it s joking it s still a pretty serious thing to say And besides there was a Mexican boy in my third block class who was making fun of one of his friends some relative saying get a bean or a shnean But you know even as jokes these still have effects and these are instances where I could have said Well no that s not an appropriate thing to say That could be offensive to people But you know I didn t just because I didn t want to be confrontational So obviously that s some fault of my own for not getting involved there Going off of what Tomas said about the ethnic jokes or whatever I m wondering if you re considered actively racist if those jokes don t bother you Like I hear that all the time in my third block class and it doesn t bother me It s kind of funny sometimes Because a lot of the time it s not interracial it s the same race You know what I m trying to say There s no Armenians but I can t roast another Armenian Should I throw this This is not gonna work Laser it bro Maybe you should just call on somebody and then throw it I think while racist jokes can show racism they can also show an amount of show how comfortable we all are with other races and I make fun of my parents I make fun of my teachers because I m comfortable with them Maybe we should talk about that And I mean I can do it because we love each other and it s okay it s unconditional So even if they may get annoyed at me we become stronger from making fun of each other I m scared So going back to what Lina was saying at the beginning and what Tomas was saying a little later is with the escalator thing I felt that was a good metaphor for the system but it also struck me as a bit of a false dilemma She makes it out that racism is the biggest problem facing us today and not to say that it s not a giant problem but I feel like one can be passively anti racist whilst working actively towards anti poverty anti hunger anti war and making a difference in the world whether it s in the field of racism or not And then going back to what Tomas said about the and I lost my point what was it It ll come back to me Who wants to go I think Tatum would agree with you and she would even I think say that while you re actively combating say poverty you are having a positive impact for say poor African American families And she points out the correlation statistically speaking between ethnicity and class But one thing I want to say in relation to some comments from over there is that I think that one thing that it means to become an adult and I m thinking what Holly said is to suddenly be forced to think of global concerns and think beyond our own individual needs and wants And I think it s really as simple as that what Tatum is asking of people That she s asking them now you consider your duties to the people around you I want to hear from other people I got my point for Tomas it s coming back It came back to me I had two points when I asked for the yarn then I forgot one of them and I just remembered it I want to encourage other people to speak up too And we ve got 10 minutes left There s a lot of voices that haven t been heard yet today What I m gonna do is something that I m gonna encourage other people to do too I m gonna toss it to somebody who s not wanting to speak and make them make their voice heard I ll keep it short and then I ll throw it to someone Okay Toss it to somebody who doesn t have their hand raised though So back to what Tomas said about the confrontational thing is it s really hard to strike that medium between either being confrontational or being patronizing And it s the fear of the reaction of either one of those that I think stops most people from speaking up Like either confrontation or you re appearing patronizing and therefore destroying racial relations even more So Samuel Yeah sure Well I was gonna say out of what Chris was saying sometimes racial humor can actually I think while sometimes it contributes to racism and I have a problem with telling too many off color jokes and gender related jokes But I think sometimes that kind of humor can start to eliminate prejudices and bring that into the broader dialogue and stuff So if you look at people like comedians say like Dave Chappelle how many can say that he s a racist person because he makes lots of race based jokes in his comedy On the contrary I think he actually helps bat those issues by bringing that humor out When Tatum mentions the fact that she thinks there s no such thing as being passively anti racist I think what she means by that is like it s sort of hard I actually got to mention you know our society we have a lot of comic jokes and all of these other things here present in the system of housing and stuff is unweighted or whatever It s kinda difficult to how should I say it I don t know what I was trying to say I can t put it out into words but anyways I kinda agree and disagree with her It s like you can do little things to change however what I was trying to say is that it s a lot out there and it may be difficult That was all I was trying to say I don t even know Here you go What I would say about jokes and stuff at times it shows that you know we re addressing it sorta kinda in a way but at the same time it just shows how much we see it played out in our society And then for some people that say it that aren t actually trying to make a difference it s like I mean it s gonna be hard to make a change and be like Hey let me correct that Because to them it s just like all fun and games But to us it s like okay Yeah It stopped It died I agree completely with what Laticia is saying Although for instance how Sam was saying about Dave Chappelle although people make jokes as they do address that in that manner it s not like people make jokes so people understand that Oh we need to break these stereotypes I ve come to realize that every joke has a little bit of truth in it Obviously yes by making these stereotypical jokes yes we re addressing it but my point I guess is just it doesn t necessarily prove that people are anti racist Alright I just wanted to say the question the prompt is why is there no such thing as being passively anti racist And it s because racism is so ingrained in our system and our being From when we re born we re exposed to racism consistently And because of that we can t be passively anti racist Our default setting for the most part is being racist Not overly racist but we are So it s not possibe just to not be racist by being alive Once you come to being in this world you are racist You can t change that so that s why there s no such thing as being passively anti racist You have to work at being anti racist It just doesn t happen So I completely agree with what Wyatt s saying The way I look at racism is it s like a poison and once you ve been injected or you know whatever to it it stays in your system forever And there s always gonna be a little part of it no matter how much you try to get it out of your system there s always gonna be a little bit of it in you So before you can fix the people who have been exposed you have to get to the source of the poison and stop it Which would be parents or teachers I don t know I m a source of it You know like crazy teachers who say the wrong thing and then students go home and like Oh yeah my teacher said this and then they go and tell their other friends and stuff and they kind of get passed around I don t know it s not you I m just saying I don t believe you Yeah I agree with Wyatt and Brooks because I think that we were talking about how Disney movies may have these subliminal racist undertones but at the same time there are racial undertones to everything that anyone says basically right There are always implicit messages which aren t necessarily said overtly which may come through to the way people word things There are subtle subtle messages and the attributes come through peoples speaking So everyone s totally surrounded by all sorts of prejudices from all sorts of different sources from the time they can understand words So yeah If someone s gonna hit you in the face it might as well be this I want to go back to what Brooke just said about parent kin thinking about racism I mean how many times have you ever hear your parents saying teach you a lesson about racists They don t even try They might just give you some parental info on your surrounding Or just say those joke you were talking about So you re saying that you think parents should have conversations with kids I m saying that parents should know how to combat racism and they don t even try Going back to what Ryan said earlier I agree because if they keep using racist jokes as jokes then it will become overused and kind of a clich so people won t want to use it anymore 
 In the Lion King like I was thinking about it there s no democracy in any of the movie No there isn t Yeah and how the Lion King s like everything seems really British you know like very England monarchy type stuff But in the Lion King what bothered me is when it said like the two hyenas like Cheech from Cheech and Chong was one of them and then Whoopi Goldberg was the other one I was just like how could they do that and like not realize that they were feeding into this racial stereotype by being the voices of the hyenas Like don t they think about that stuff Yeah I was thinking the same thing Did you think about it before when you first read Cinderella I think when I watched the Lion King like I thought about it I mean even when I was little I think it registered in my mind like That s a black woman s voice Why would her voice be in this animal and not any of the other voices Right I don t know Disney intentionally did this They were building up into an already existing culture of racial stereotypes so I think the mentality of that was why fix what s not been broken and when they should have fixed it But at the same time Mufasa was that really what s his name James Earl Jones who s like Morgan Freeman Right Mufasa was an evil Like if I had to pick a God it would be James Earl Jones or Morgan Freeman Mufasa was the good Simba s father right Yeah With like the really deep voice You made a good point though about no democracy in Disney movies There isn t because there s no democracy in marketing There s no democracy in the media What are the six big media conglomerates Disney Disney GE What else GE GE Newscorp Yeah Newscorp Then Viacom Viacom Time Warner And Time Warner But why can t Cinderella be a first lady Why does she have to be a queen Like why can t she have some other magical power Why can t we instill some like actual life in there But that s still not this is still not the classic but then I wouldn t be surprised if Disney will come up with another story I hope they do Well they came up with Tiana right Which added the gender stereo the roles the racial roles or the racial stereotypes Tiana is absolutely beautiful The image However there are again the pre existing culture and norms that Disney is too scared to move away from because that has provided them or given them this 80 billion dollar industry I did promise you a reading on we do have time I promised you a reading on China as to what happens in China Before I do that I just want your input on the Disneyfication of children s culture with the article that you read I know you wanted to talk about it you were really excited If you have your article in front of you you can use that You can look at it I also jotted down plenty of notes but when you reflect on what we did today I want you to think these books these books are books are media music is media videos are media okay Food for thought for next time when we have our discussion Does media construct an image or a message There s no right or wrong answer but think about it Does the media construct an image or a message Okay As you read your read articles So Hannah to you go ahead The whole like Aladdin where how they changed the verse the lyrics that was like awful That was crazy Like I think I have a different opinion from everybody like truth hurts to me I think it s just like I don t care that it says that Like I didn t notice that no one notices that while they re singing Like while they re singing that no one like realizes oh Cut off your ear Kids don t Like if your was in And that actually happened back then that actually happened The ear one didn t bother me as much because that s kind of true But the whole it s barbaric the like that was awful It shouldn t be Because if you think about where it is if you look into the history it is barbaric and they used to do it And in some places they still do it It s the whole Hammurabi An eye for an eye You know it s that culture Yeah it s true it s true so why not teach what actually happened But I don t really have a problem with it I mean like But if that s the only way that you re looking at the Middle East then that s wrong Because they have a history with beautiful art they invented math and like they gave us all this wonderful stuff that you can t just look at the problems that they have now or the violence that was in their culture because there s violence everywhere I mean that s just stereotyping They cut people s ears off in the Middle Ages in England just as much as they did or at least as the same They did worse things probably in the Middle Ages than they did in cutting off people s ears It s just unfair that they portayed the Middle East like strictly as a barbaric violent place in that song It just makes it wrong I think it was like in general and it was because Arabia was so bad in an oasis like that Yeah they weren t specific it was just Arabia but like it took there was like Indian things about Aladdin that it wasn t supposed to be India it was supposed to be like Israel or totally different There were a lot of like Middle Eastern elements rolled into one so it would make one thing like if you went to the Middle East if you went to like Pakistan it wouldn t be what they say it is or if you went to India or you went to Israel like they just took bits and pieces and combined it into one Which looks like a different Why did they do that What would you think They didn t look into it they didn t bother to do the research Yeah they probably didn t Because their culture is so different than American culture that they just thought that they could just skip over it Like I thought it was gross that they didn t even bother to translate what they wanted to say on a manuscript Like if it was in English they would have had the actual letters on the piece of paper but they just you think that you can just go like this on the board and that looks like Arabic writing That s not Arabic writing is really complicated And the whole thing with all the accents how all the bad guys had accents and the good guys didn t The bad guys had like Oh the beards and noses Bigger beards and then the good guys they looked American I think it made you assume the worst like reading that just made me like Wow like Oh my gosh it s not really giving you the information But yet you didn t notice it when you watched it though right Yeah I mean you didn t at all I did though But then when we re older we go back in history Maybe that s because I have that class and we realized that it s all war with religion and like I know those times Go ahead Religion what about it She noticed that I did notice those things like you can kind of tell like different culturally wise like the different Indian elements in Israel or the different like Pakistani influences but and they had like Hindu going on It s just really really weird But I did notice that but like I don t know maybe like Hannah said she didn t notice that but because she didn t grow up like learning to write Arabic No And like reading about all that stuff I guess it s also like how you grew up Right Someone who showed America like without photos I have a question When you think about it when we talk about American culture we view it as pretty homogeneous of the American values Okay there are these values and that s all there is But we know that that s not true Do you find that to be with these movies by blending all of those different spaces and all those different cultures do you find that to be the message is not carried out the right way to children that the Middle East is highly diverse okay And not everybody looks the same or writes the same or behaves the same but Disney has done something that the media does What does the media assume That everybody who watches a movie Is going to react the same way It s going to react the same way right So the media assumes that homogeneity attitude Yes The problems in the past 20 years in the Middle East like when little kids grow up and it s like if I look at a picture of Osama bin Laden I think Jafar because he has a beard and he looks like that Like we re taught that that is evil Do you really I don t That the person with the turban and beard is evil because the terrorists that are doing these awful things to people all over the world just happen to be Muslim totally extremist Muslims that most of the people that carry out their religion don t practice Kind of like most Christians during the Middle Ages didn t go out and chop people s heads off in the name of Jesus It s the same thing Right You know But we look at those pictures of those Middle Eastern men and we think bad because of it which is like Jafar and Aladdin That s when acceptance comes in like You have to accept what s true and what s not Exactly Talk about ignorance I mean why do we have to accept that Because it s not true Because it s not true there are thousand and thousands You don t see me going like Oh I m making bombs I m not like saying acceptance like it s not true I m not like saying acceptance like Osama bin Laden like accepting that s what he looks like to like Jafar Like that s who he was so that s what he looks like You know what I m saying Yeah but I don t see that If I see if I look at Osama bin Laden I don t see Jafar No I don t either I don t identify it at all I don t either but you know what I m saying Yeah like little kids like 10 years from now if they watch Aladdin and they re going to grow up and what s going to be in the news is September 11th and Osama bin Laden But what the point is is that evil people look like everybody else Like Ursula could have just been a really pretty mermaid and still done all the horrible things that she did to Ariel Right Like it doesn t matter what you look like they create these evil images of people like all old ladies are either really smart or they re evil They either have wisdom or they re out to get you There s no in between Or the zoo keeper in he had a German accent he was evil and that was during a war the movie Or like the three crows right That were talking in like the very like I don t know African American inner city slang and they were just all that stuff that was just really It kinds of makes it like just like the story was describing what a bad person must look like we have that image like up here like tell them it looks like this so when we see them we automatically assume like Oh man it could be a terrorist just like when we watch a movie like Oh that s the bad guy So like it s the same as if they re doing a cartoon and if we re in real life Right so that leads to problems that we have with profiling for example Putting people on one side or yes It doesn t really relate to the article but I was watching a movie with my mom and I don t know what it was called but there s this like I guess class project or oral presentation that someone had to do and this girl chose to write about her religion which she was Muslim and she wrote about like 9 11 and she was like Just because they did that doesn t mean we re all evil And like I don t know she had all this stuff and then the principal like told the FBI or something and they came to her house and deported her family back to where she came from Just because of that That s it That s when like a school needs to teach acceptance That s not the end Or like families and the school needs to teach acceptance Everyone was calling her like a suicide bomber and like Go kill yourself or Are you gonna bomb all of us And we call ourselves a country of freedom of religion I remember when I was in sixth grade there was a girl she was Muslim and people used to throw markers at her and stuff and call her a terrorist It was around 9 11 and stuff like that and it used to like upset me because I used to feel really bad Because she like didn t do anything she barely even knew how to talk They d like throw markers at her and stuff just because she was Muslim Like because like no one has acceptance like no one learns that it s just like people make inferences like Oh man it s a bad person so let s stay away let s shy away let s make fun of them instead of like when you re going down the street and just like we were talking about earlier how there s like if you see a big black man you re gonna put your phone away you re going to take your phone out and try to call your mom put her on speed dial You don t have acceptance either Like you may say we should get it but you don t have it It s just the way we grow up We don t suspend judgment You don t suspend judgment It s difficult to do so There is this conflict between acceptance and our values Because the values that we have that think by this individualistic view of what it is and in doing so you divide people into groups and construct images about those people and it s as simple as reading a children s story okay or as watching or turning the TV on in the morning and just watching the Disney Channel or Noggin or Nick Jr or whatever There s messages that we impart on our children there s messages that we impart on ourselves Or picking up the newspaper I don t know if you guys have noticed in the newspaper but there is a big there s a dichotomy between how different areas are described Immediate areas our city compared to our surrounding areas Right so media is biased They re systemically biased okay There is no democracy but here is the fundamental thing as an American we pride ourselves in democracy we pride ourselves in leadership so what do you do What path do you follow How do you 
 You re totally fine So you guys will be using I m assuming a meter tape Yeah For measurements And then can you take a minute to explain the balance thing again so we re good Strength versus strength qualifies ten times Ok so I like that you re making everyone go clockwise everyone s doing ten alright And then see how long they can balance on their most dominant foot Ok There s a max of 60 seconds and no shoes on No shoes on ok perfect You guys are good Ok so wingspan what are your units you guys are measuring in Centimeters and you re going tip to tip right And then what was the ability again They ll take their shoes off try to touch their toes And then we ll measure the distance from their finger tip to the top of their foot Ok good In what units Centimeters Centimeters Did you say take shoes off or no Yeah Ok cool You guys can start collecting data I ll come back to you Ok what do you guys got Same thing we got yesterday Recap me Hair color You were hair color Why the hell don t you have something else I don t know Ok so here s my question Cause I was thinking about this last night You re gonna be asked to make a scatter plot graph of this data How would one go about making a scatter plot with hair color Ok so you re gonna assign numbers numeric data to shades Zero to ten Or one to ten One to ten Yeah One being the lightest The lightest lightest We should probably get this straightened out before we do it right And then ten being the darkest Ok before you start collecting it can you just give me a really quick specturm Draw a line out so I could see where you re getting your number data And then what is your characteristic That was your characteristic What is your ability How many steps does it take you to walk backwards seven feet Ok so we ll probably do that in the hallway Does that sound fine Meter tapes are up there That s a lot of guys So give me a real quick scale then you guys can start Ok One and ten So that s blonde and really blonde And like really dark brown So where would red fall in Like me Like right there So you re gonna make blonde one end The low end are we all in agreeance on that Yeah and mine is like in the middle Ok and then the other far end s gonna be the darkest brown Yeah Or black Or black Are you gonna have everyone taking data on that Or maybe one or two people just consistently doing the hair color You know what I mean so there s not a ton of variation Measure their hand from first crease to their middle finger And then hopping on one foot right On your tiptoe Or no balance balance And then once your heel touch into the ground it s done And your hands can do whatever you want Ok are we shoe on shoe off Shoe off Shoe off and is it right or left foot Right foot for everybody Ok Right foot shoe off on tiptoe Max two minutes Max two minutes so the deciding factor when to stop the stopwatch is when their heel hits the ground Or their other foot Or their other foot So it could be either or Okeydoke So just a kind of a flashback to remind us This has been a couple daytime span here Our goal behind this is try to determine what we can learn from a fossil So as we work through this unit we re gonna start building together pieces of information that help us come up with ideas about the past We ve been specifically as I ve said before looking at one specific fossil foot fossil length right The idea behind this is that scientists put the pieces of the puzzle together we start to get a clear image of what s going on Again our goal was to determine if there s a relationship between the characteristic you chose the ability you chose and a person s foot fossil I asked you last night to plot up your data for both characteristic and ability and then if possible draw a line of best fit That could be an indirect relationship a direct one a trend or no relationship What I m gonna ask you to do for a minute talk to your neighbors Compare your data Make sure we re on the same page in determining a relationship And then I d like you to come up and post your data It s gonna be a pretty simple process to post your data So for example if group one what was your characteristic For fossil length Hand spans We re gonna put characteristic on the left side so they re gonna right hand span for us And then what type of relationship did you guys see for that Direct Direct so all you re gonna do is do this That s all we need to report Ok in your lab packet you are going to find some little graphs You re gonna be asked to record everyone s data I ve also given you a supplementary sheet cause you re gonna need more graphs I messed up and didn t tell you So what s gonna wind up happening is all the graphs would appear on here You will also copy down into your packet because as a whole you ll be looking at everyone s data and drawing conclusions ok So take a minute to talk to your groups I ll come around and give you some markers Determine what your characteristic and ability relationships are Post them on the board and then we ll talk No Can you determine it No Cause they re not They re just kind of clustered It was like more not clustered Ok so we re gonna have a trend fall in between where I guess the trend really is between 15 and What are we lacking You know what it was 12 30 last night Fossil foot length stride length Ok so we re having a trend falling between what s our lowest Our lowest is 12 and our highest is 23 but like the trend is between these ones Ok I think that works So you re gonna give a horizontal line on your graph up there Need help Ok whatcha got Would you draw a line for a trend Yeah it would either be vertical or horizontal just like we did in the beginning So this person s kinda like an outlier right so let s just for argument s sake take them out Does that help clear the data up at all You could say no it s ok They re all kind of in the same foot length but they all have different times Ok so we ve got a pretty wide range here right For trend we tend to see more of a skinnier range So if you look at our options it s definitely not a direct or indirect I would say based on what you showed me right Trend wise it s kind of a wide range So what would we determine what s our other option No relationship Yeah I would probably go So up there instead of drawing a line just write no relation ok Here s your marker With this one cause it s kind of like a trend or kind of just focused in this area But then there s also the increase Ok so here s my question That s a good question When I look at this data right If I had a pick excluding this line if I had to pick where someone with a foot fossil over here would fall where would you pick Up here Why Yeah it appears to be going this way So that would indicate that you have a direct relationship It s kind of the easiest way to look at it Ok group number one Hand span versus foot fossil length and then jump height What kind of relationship are we seeing here Direct so the bigger the foot fossil the bigger the hand span So just to clarify hand span we re talking tip of thumb to tip of finger Correct Why do we see that So I asked you guys last night to jot down some ideas in the conclusion section so you might want to turn to that page everyone cause you wanna gather some ideas here Why are we seeing this Why do you think we re seeing that relationship What did you guys say Because your hands and feet are usually proportional in size You re not gonna have a very large foot and have very small hands Usually Ok So I have a question for everyone in class I bought some new shoes and I like them Do you like them They re so big on you They re a little loud Don t worry I won t wear them on testing days They look good What s the problem here They re like way too big like twenty sizes too big How do you know Why do you know that my foot s not this big Yeah it doesn t look proportional to my body And exactly what Megan said bodies in general are proportional Now we go through some stages in our lives where we have long really lanky arms Or you might know someone that has extremely long legs They re kind of fitting outside that pattern But in general bodies are proportionate right And so we can probably makes some connections to certain body characteristics based on other body characteristics right Because of this idea that we are proportioned You re not gonna see Shaquille O Neal wearing a size three shoe He ll fall over He wouldn t be able to support his own body Common sense applies here That s a good one Jump height So you said pretty much everyone kind of fell into one kind of area but there s no indirect or direct relationship Why do you think we saw that Jump height is an ability versus Ok jump height is an ability you are correct It depends on muscles versus structure Ok so it s depending more on muscle as opposed to structure of your foot I remember the class like could already reach so that played to our height and the proportions of our body and then in turn determined how high I could jump in itself so I guess with your foot depending on what size shoe you have that in turn kinda determines your height because of the proportions of your body By having them reach guys What was your point When you set up your lab Cause I remember distinctly talking to you guys you said you re gonna have them make a mark and then they re gonna jump Well it s so that the taller people didn t just automatically jump higher than everybody who was shorter than them Cause then it s already the distance like how high they can actuall jump as part of how tall they are Ok So you re saying that by measuring the height you factored that idea in So Mr Bieber isn t totally outjumping say Adrian who s a little bit shorter So you already kind of factored that in Why did we not see a connection though Megan said jump height deals with more muscle mass maybe opposed to foot Cause everybody kind of jumped the same There wasn t any variation So it didn t really matter what foot size you have Ok So when you say jump the same you mean achieve the same scores roughly They found the same general area in that same general pattern That s why theres a trend It was all in just one spot So in general when we re looking at fossils would jump height be one that we could solely predict then based on the length of the foot fossil No Probably not Which kind of makes sense anyway Group two Group two didn t get their data plotted but let s take a peek They did foot fossil length and height If you were to make an assumption if there was a relationship what would you all assume would be the relationship Direct why direct Cause it s proportional Bingo bodies are proportional You re gonna see that pattern as we work through this Proportional ok Average stride We didn t really get a graph but it didn t look very direct It was a little more indirect More indirect I think so Like this So you re saying longer No no Like there wasn t really a pattern Oh so your e saying no relationship Yeah Does that make sense Alana says no I saw this Why Well just based on the proportional idea if your height and hand span is proportional to your foot length then your legs then the length of your legs are also proportional to your foot lenghts and the length of your stride based on the length of your legs So you re arguing that you think we should see what kind of relationship I think a direct You would say direct Claire and then Barrett Well cause we had the same thing but a little bit different And well backwards It couldn t really be that accurate because it wasn t a very long distance and people had different ideas of walking Some people were trying to take larger steps or being more careful or walking slower It wasn t just like an average So you are saying based on the idea of body proportions that we should see a direct But you re saying you agree that we should see direct No we should see an indirect An indirect Longer leg shorter strides Direct Longer legs longer strides But you re arguing that the way maybe that the experiment was set up didn t lend itself to collect proper data Yeah Ok good point I think it was also just I was asked just to walk like I normally do and I don t take very long strides I kind of walk really slow so my strides are very small when I just normally walk Ok so you almost felt it was kinda awkward like how am I supposed to walk So maybe we could have captured it in a different manner We could have designed the experiment if you re already walking and then you walk past the line and maybe keep carrying through that stride I think no relationship is accurate because my stride length I would assume is based on how long my legs are I have very long legs but everybody knows I have a small foot I mean I m still proportional like I m normal sized but my legs are just a lot longer than anything else Ok so you re kinda arguing that maybe you re not always going to fall into every part of your body being specifically proportional There was a lot where some people with kinda smaller feet had relatively longer strides and some people with big feet had smaller strides It was kind of just all over the place Ok So what are we labeling this Direct question mark no relationship question mark If we re basing it on the data that they had I d say no relationship Ok if we re basing it on the data even though we didn t plot it Looking at their actual data we would say no relationship Could there be a point where we could argue that we might potentially see a direct relationship Yes So for our data collection we ll leave no relationship But keeping in mind that very valid point that if you re gonna have longer feet more than likely you have longer legs More than likely you re gonna take longer strides But inherent as Claire said in the kind of setup of the experiment that maybe that didn t shine through Group three Hair color versus foot fossil length No relationship Is this shocking to anyone Yes Even though they had a great numeric scale Why Why no relationship Bubs I didn t have anything to do with it It s like a gene base Hair color is determined by Your DNA Does your DNA determine your foot length Yes it does But not the same gene Ok but not the same gene Ok now you re getting very technical I appreciate that Yes sir I think its partially because Would you think that there would be a connection Like smaller foot lighter hair Well go on for like racial background like your ethnicity Some ethnic groups are generally taller and have bigger feet than the others Ok so maybe you re arguing the sample size The idea that we were to survey globally maybe we could see certain ethnic backgrounds that tend to be taller would have different I could see that Yeah Well I think it has nothing to do with it because I m six feet tall and Franco s under five feet and we both have dark hair So obviously Yeah it s got nothing to do with it Ok so on face value looking at hair color Would we say that foot fossil length would be a good indicator of hair color No Ok I would agree There s no connection there No connection My question though is There are organisms that lived in the past And we have very I would say We have certain ideas about what their coloring was like How would we come up with that then How would scientists come up with that idea Of the coloring of certain organisms Caroline Well if you say that lizards would be or dinosaurs would be green it would help them blend into their environment so you would assume it would be good then to be green but you don t know for sure So you re thinking evolutionary connection It ll be beneficial for them to be able to blend in their environment Yeah Yes Claire I think you also said a few days ago About how you re supposed to assume everything in the past works how it does now So if you see some type of reptile in the past it probably looks something like a reptile now Ok so again you re doing that evolutionary connection to modern day relatives saying well if they appear to be this color possibly due to some benefit we can assume in the past Good nice job 
 So how is that energy Different things like jules Which are increments which are similar kilowatts hours and BCU Okay You could also measure it with a thermometer if it s kinetic energy sometimes Okay I have an cubic feet tons and gallons too That s mass And volume Oh cause it was like Hold on Totally different thing I don t remember While she s looking at that what are some cons of nuclear energy that most people are concerned about Well there are no no explosions That s a totally different process with nuclear bombs and nuclear power Oh I have And it states in lots of articles about nuclear waste that it produces very little waste At all Well I have a cubic feet it s for like natural gas Tons is measured for coal Kilowatts hours is for electricity It doesn t pollute the air You could inject the water back into the earth to reuse it Like you could put the water back in and keep reusing it And then the disadvantages for geothermal energy is the gasses that are released smell bad and efficiency is only 15 which isn t it s not that great And there s a limitation of it You can t just like keep reusing it and reusing it I think that would be like a possibility for a scenario but like we don t know if it s warm enough to be able to do that Yeah if there was a good spot around our area it might be good but How would you know if your area was a good spot I don t know They would have to do tests and stuff Plus I don t know that people would want it in their backyard It s hard because Cranberry if we re thinking of where those people well like a civilized area People really don t want something That smells bad Yeah that They don t want any disruption And where are you most likely going to see geothermal energy come from There are Inside of the earth Right but it s inside of the earth but it comes out in what ways In geysers In geysers or what else I m not sure Volcanoes Oh Yeah so who that s definitely something You don t have volcanoes everywhere either Yeah Right And you definitely wouldn t want that in your backyard And sometimes if there would be a good area maybe the state or the country would buy the property to like put it there because it s a good spot Sometimes they do that for like mining and stuff They like buy the property Okay Okay I had hydro electric And some of the pros that is it doesn t pollute at all And the actual running of the power plant is really cheap And then it s really reliable So say there was a big power outage in the area the hydro electric power plant could get that running again But it s run by building dams in rivers and they re extremely expensive to build which can be fixed by partnering up with someone else who needs that A different a business or something But it can also cause flooding upstream for the animals and people and houses I have a question for you Do you have to have like a big river or could you use like a little creek like we have around here I don t think you could necessarily use the creek The Connoquenessing Yeah but yeah you have to have like a big river and it has to be fairly out of the way Would it like cause flooding Yeah you couldn t have any houses really upstream because could they d flood And for example your science book says that the Hoover Dam which is on the Colorado River it created a waterfall of 400 feet which is more than twice as high as the Niagara Falls So you re talking about a river that you would have to be able to create that drop because the water creates the kinetic energy Am I saying that right Yeah And that s what causes the electricity Correct So if you could create something like that with the three rivers we have here that might that might work And again the whole Yeah the three rivers that could do it because there s a bunch of big rivers in Pittsburgh Yeah Yeah but if you build that up wouldn t that flood Well not in the middle of the city you could maybe do it like out of the city cause the rivers aren t just like in the city they go out And also if you have a good area flooding wouldn t matter so much if you pick the right area Which I mean I guess the whole thing So definitely not in Cranberry here Where we live Well we get a lot of rain around here so I m just like flooding would be like a problem Yeah We re sort of in a drought right now there s not been a big rain for a long time Does it harm the animals that are in the river It s better for farmers because down the streams the water is deeper and there s more fish and stuff but there s less plants and stuff Like upstream it floods the animals and homes and so it doesn t really hurt too much down stream I guess it depends because the farmers need deeper waters but not if there s less life in it Because that s what they re trying to achieve Rachel tell us about yours My energy is fossil fuels The pros were that it s the most effiecent of most of the energy sources we can use It s easy to find if you know in the general area of where it s at It makes up half or more of our energy in the United States The cons are that it s non renewable There s a limited supply It makes a lot of pollution when it s mined It s expensive to transport It harms aquatic life with pollution It takes millions of years to form That s something I didn t know about fossil fuels that it takes a very long time to develop It has to be like compacted Uh huh So maybe the big plant it might be able to not might be able it would probably run out fast if we started using it a lot so there wouldn t be a point in making this huge plant and then it just run out Yeah So it might be something people would use more often in the future Just little by little like just for little things What do you mainly use it for Like energy but like What falls under the umbrella of fossil fuels Coals and oils And natural gas Yeah Yeah And you said it when you mine it so we would have to transport it here There s so many people that live here that wouldn t want that Isn t that what happened in Mexico What s that called The Gulf of Mexico yeah Weren t they mining for fossil fuels like oil Oil yeah And that happens so that s like a natural disaster And that s happened a bunch of times so it s not that safe So for our scenario what do you think would be the best two Maybe nuclear around here out of the way a little so it wouldn t create any huge explosions So thermal energy transfers into electrical energy So it s kind of like biomass cause they both you burn both of them except yours you use Mine s not renewable Yeah yours you use like uhm What s it called Like plants Fossilized plants and stuff And for biomass you just use waste or woods scraps and stuff like that Actually isn t the isn t the fossilized or fossil fuels or whatever don t they keep on making them Yeah fossilized yeah but it can t it takes so long to make them because you need all the pressure and the decomposing like plants and animals that once it runs out it s going to take a while for us to get more Like thousands of years it takes to replenish Yeah It takes a long time Yeah it takes a very long time for sure So I think Keeton I don t think yours would be the best for our community to use It s running out anyway yeah so How much pollution does it cause A lot Why does the world just use it if it s running out Why waste it We talked about the efficiency What s the efficiency cost of fossil fuels I wasn t sure I couldn t find the exact Uh 38 to 47 That s actually really good cause like biomass was only 22 to 30 or something So that may have something to do with what your decision is right The efficiency of the energy I think so I just You should save some of it You don t need to save it but it s not that good of an idea to rely on this energy source that s not going to last forever That s why I say you could also use that as a backup plan because if we use something that s renewable like Katelyn s or something but something like a disaster happens that could always be our just our fall back That we know we could use that if we have to Just like an emergency generator It s like you know it s there if you need it you can use it and it can last for a little bit Since it is running out would you guys say that it would be better for us to use it now or save it in case Oh definitely save it Save it I say save it too Now I actually think save it because I think probably save it I would say to save it because if something would happen and then you would need to use that specific type then you ll be able to go back to it but if you use it all then you couldn t go back to it So what are you all proposing as your primary energy source Biomass Okay Cause it doesn t cause that much pollution And then they harness that pollution like Katelyn said They capture it and then they use it for different things like growing trees or Cause the only thing that the only pollution that really comes from it is carbon dioxide And they have a way of capturing the carbon dioxide and using it to fabricate metal and create paper and use it in greenhouses and stuff Wow interesting Yeah I thought that was pretty good So I think Katelyn s definitely provides the most for the community definitely out of all Yeah I have high effiecency rates so you ll be able to get like a lot of usable energy out of it Yeah the Colorado River isn t actually renewable energy s that good of an efficiency rating Actually actually the the hydro electric energy is nearly 95 efficient Wow Once you build it since tidal doesn t use any fuel either It s just once you built it but the down side on building is it costs so much So I don t understand why people would want to use that amount of money whenever because you could use that on different things You could do it to create more biomass Like if you wanna try to look up ways to make that fossil plant roots or plants just try to find research to make that happen more quickly speed up the process so it wouldn t be a non renewable resource like fossil fuels or anything There s no they said the small streams and like rivers and stuff like that they only create like a small amount of energy and so we can t really do that in Silicone Valley What about the three rivers in Pittsburgh Could we not somehow harness that We were talking about that I was like talking about redirecting the river Redirecting the river Just making one big one Yeah I think that we would be able to use the three rivers in Pittsburgh because they re all pretty big rivers so if we just put like one dam in there and then we harness the energy from all three I think that we could get a lot of energy from it I don t think it d be enough energy like to completely rely on it I think that we d still have to use other resources to still create energy because I know the title it only creates 10 hours of energy a day but I don t know if that means like an hour of that energy runs like a power plant It didn t exactly say how much energy is used to do one thing So I don t I don t think that d be a good idea to completely rely on that and put it in the three rivers And doesn t then the with the title energy too there has to be a difference in the The low and high Difference in the low and the high Yeah three meters of low and high Yeah so where did you find out where in the world there is that difference Yeah They said the biggest title it was in France or something But we don t have any in the United States because we don t have an area that we can put it in that has that big of a difference Oh wow So there s none used in the United States and I don t think we could use that then Well what you were saying before about how like each energy source we basically have to fall back on another one Yeah Because none of them we could completely rely on to supply all of our energy I think that we would definitely need at least two choices At least two And if we had to pick two I would pick biomass and then your nuclear because you said a little amount takes it a long way Yeah like you only need a little bit and it can produce a lot of energy And the efficiency rating s pretty high It s like 35 so yeah Wow that is pretty high Remember you said it was like really hazardous Yeah it doesn t produce a lot of air pollution or greenhouse gases but if like one small accident is made then it can cause like a really big disaster which would be bad for a community of people since there are so many people in it I think that Katelyn and Kelsey were talking about like different kinds of energy sources and according to issels uh issues 
 Plug in two You got it We got it All right First question is Once energy is used up it s gone for good Talk to your partner no Let s try that one more time folks eyes up here What was the rule on the darts The rule is don t do anything until you say so Thank you Don t act until I say so Go Yeah There could be a little bit left of potential Is that what you mean Yeah Well All right On three I m going to need eyes up here please One two th Don t flip your card until I tell you to I shouldn t be able to tell what your card is It should be much more secret They re colored guys I can tell what they are Okay Here we go on three hold up your card please One two three Okay We ve got mostly disagrees And then we have very one confident Oh we disagree So here s what we re going to do Put your cards down I m calling on Mark first So where should we be looking Mark At Mark Okay Okay So I strongly disagree because say So you know you when you You know how you eat food you get fuel in your body and you have energy and you go out running And then you re out of energy you re tired you go to bed you wake up the next morning it comes back You eat more food and it comes back Okay So you re getting it from a different source Yeah Okay but that energy you have originally So that initial energy that you have and then you ran Does it go away Yeah you have plenty more but does that original energy go away No Where does it go Because you still don t have it right You have to eat more food This is supposed to be challenging Great job Who has another idea Or who can tell me where does it go It s awfully quiet Awfully quiet What do you got I don t think it literally Well I don t think it goes anywhere You just It just keeps making more It makes more So the energy I burnt right So I m running and I m running and I m running Where does it go Out Out where To the air To the air in what form Breath Now this is tricky This is where it gets tricky Breath is made of what Vapor Carbon dioxide Water and carbon dioxide And we call that matter We call that stuff Is stuff and energy the same thing No No and this is really a tricky idea in Science So we re going to keep working with you on that So where does the energy go Out into sweat Out into Now okay sweat is Stuff It s stuff right But where So where does the energy go Does anybody want to change their answer And say once it s used up it s used up for good Anybody Some people I think Now Tatum what do you think I think that when you run it s Some of the energy go into the ground How many people agree with Tatum That some of that energy is going to go to the ground Oh yeah Yeah Okay In what form does it go to the ground In static stuff What s that I think you said static stuff Is that what you say Yeah Okay so static stuff is Now this gets really tricky because now we re getting into electrons But you re thinking about the rubbing kind of thinking Is that what you re thinking How it rubs And then you shock people Okay So that can happen That s a little more complicated so I m going to put that on hold for now But what So if I m running and that energy s going into the ground somebody said that Who said that Tatum Tatum Okay So Tatum said the energy is going into the ground In what form is it going into the ground Yeah Energy transfer It is an energy transfer right This is going from my foot to the ground What form is it in Do you guys know what I mean when I say form Yeah Yeah We talked about kinetic and potential and heat and what else we talked about Elastic and Light Gravitational and light and chemical Sound Heat sound Ooh there s just hey is any of that sound energy No No Maybe it could be sound energy Yes Sound Because you re You re stepping hard You re Okay so if I m running I m probably going to produce some sound Anything else that could go in there Jason Huh Okay I think that as you step on You ll actually transform some potential energy to the ground because once you step on you all react to gravity to the ground So gravity s pushing down now remember what gravitational energy is is how far it is away from the ground right So how much room it has to fall basically So would there be If I go like this would there be any gravitational energy there Wouldn t there be if you raise your foot Now it s got gravitational Here s what we need I m really doing something to say But here s what I want you to think about this one Actually let s do this one more time I want you to re vote on this Once energy is used up it s gone for good Talk to each other for 10 seconds You re thinking it s going someplace else I don t know where but I don t think it just disappears for good I think it s going somewhere That it s somewhere but just not sure where Yeah All right folks we re going to re vote on three One two three All right put your cards down for just a second Here s what Henry just said and I want you to raise your hand if you agree with Henry And we re going to talk about again guys we re not getting answers to all these questions today we will at some point I promise We re going to do it in the formal labs but not before I m through telling you Henry tell me what you just said I think that it s not gone for good I m not sure where it goes but I think it doesn t just leave It s still somewhere but I don t know where How many of you agree with Henry That you think that it s somewhere but you re just not sure where I don t know where though All right Do you know what form No No Anybody else Know where But wait Doesn t it just transform It can transform into something else but then my question for you would be What What kind of energy is it All right but here s what we re going to do we re going to move on to the next one If a person is pushing a box the person has energy but the box does not otherwise it would help out Ready set go What s the evidence that the box has energy What form of energy is that that s moving I don t know Well it s kineck kineck One more try Kinetic Okay Because it s currently in motion Yeah Okay All right So now here s what I want We re going do a challenge question What about the person What kind of energy does the person have who s pushing it That I don t know You guys all have it Okay here we go Eyes over here please Are we a little bit on balancing in agreement All right here we go A person is pushing a box the person has energy but the box does not otherwise it would help out On three hold up your cards please One two three So what you re saying then is you all think the box does have energy am I correct Yeah Okay Chloe tell me why What is your evidence that the box has energy I think it has energy because when you re pushing it it has a friction with whatever you re pushing it How many of you agree that there s friction there Because it s rubbing against what The ground It s rubbing against the ground There could be some rubbing against you but most likely it s going to be rubbing against ground But here s my question what is your evidence that it has energy It does have friction and now it gives you some sort of indication that it s doing what Moving It s moving What do we call that something s moving What kind of energy does that Just shout it Kinetic Kinetic So it has kinetic energy So here s my next question so does anybody disagree The box does not have kinetic energy Tate I didn t believe it I thought it was transferred I thought that it was energy transfer Yeah Okay So you think energy s being transferred from the person to the box Yeah Okay but the question is still does the box have energy Even if I m transferring it there Does it have energy while it s moving Yeah Well do you mean before the person I mean while I m moving it I m in the process of pushing the box Does the box have energy Yeah but don t you think part of it would be from you and part of it I think all of it is from you Oh But does it still have energy Yeah Yeah it does So what s your proof Chloe just said it What s your proof that the box has energy Friction It s moving That it s moving Okay now the friction is proof that s it s moving perhaps But you also see it moving that would be the proof that it s moving Okay so here s my other question I m going to make this point this is too easy for you We re going to make this more challenging What about the person pushing the box So here is me this is how I push a box So if I m pushing the box what kind of energy do I have Think about it Jack what do you think Kinetic How many of you agree with Jack that I have kinetic energy How many of you think there s something else going on there as well No So I have I can only have kinetic energy right Because I am Moving Pushing Because I am moving and I m pushing Okay What other kind of energy must I have I have to say something else like it s kind of helping to and what disagrees Yesterday you told us the classic pool You re talking about energy transfer You guys know what she s talking about We re talking about the pool and handle Yeah I think of it kind of the same thing only the pool hall has some of the because you have the stick in your hand and you have the energy potential energy and then you start moving it and then it s kinetic and it goes through the stick and through the ball and it moves So you re saying that I have some form of potential energy as well Yeah before you start And then In what form is that potential energy Because I think Emily was about to say this too Think about this guys Where am I getting my energy from Is it gravitational No Muscles Okay so I ve got my muscles I ve got my body But where s that energy coming from Food Which is a form of what Marcus Fuel Which is a form of what Potential Time out We re asking Marcus Marcus what form of potential energy is fuel Um This is hard Did you want a lifeline Yeah Anika can you help him out Chemical Chemical right Make sense Yes Okay All right we re going on to the next slide Are you ready Yeah Woo hoo hoo Okay here we go Now goodness gracious Okay this is a hard one Cold moves faster than heat Ready set go And but also I remember my mom on hot days she s like Don t go upstairs because it s hotter Heat rises So is it is it move So your evidence that it s moving faster is that it goes up Yeah and also when you put it in hot hot water it s looser because Okay so you re saying if cold moved faster it would go up as well Yeah Faster than heat Okay How about moving in other directions other than up Is there Do you have any Wind Okay so that would So does one move faster than the other Tatum what do you think All right Think about it All right here we go Okay here we go So on three hold up your answers please One two three We ve got strongly agrees We ve got an in between We ve got an ooh we ve got a strongly agree And we ve got a couple in betweens All right We re mostly in orange land we ve got one green So here we go You ready Yeah And stand together you re going to back them up Yeah So okay so we agree that Are you sure No Just kidding Because I think the answer you just gave me was certain So you re a strongly disagree Okay Well I read it wrong I thought it said heat Yeah I thought it said heat moves faster than cold Okay so tell me why you strongly disagree then Tim Well because there s just as heat rises So it has to be lighter to move And so it must be moving faster Yeah How many of you agreed with this How many of you thought about this whole heat rising thing Interesting And how many of you Nope you guys it never crossed your mind Okay Let s hop to another Tatum do have anything else to add to that No What is your evidence that cold moves slower Because he was just saying heat was rising do you have any evidence that cold would move slower Let s see Alex what do you think Well because when we did that investigation and stuff on molecules they move faster when they re hot The coke can Yeah the coke can investigation Okay so I m going to ask them for specific evidence So what was your specific evidence in the coke can the hot molec that they were moving faster Well there was steam coming out of it and then in the solid everything s Molecules in solids are super slow And then as they move on to liquid then gas they move faster Okay And then you need heat to make liquid into gas How many of you think that this whole molecules moving faster in a gaseous state proves that heat moves faster than cold How many of you are kind of stuck on this idea of cold So let me ask you a question and I want you to think about it for 10 seconds then we might move on let s see What is cold Not looking for examples of things that are cold but what is cold What is the idea of cold or coldness Okay think about it for a second Ellie what is cold Well it s like It could be water that s frozen in I was thinking that heat moves faster than than cold because if something was frozen the molecules wouldn t be moving that fast because if they were they could try to push out on that Oh then it might be Okay so she gave me an example of what is cold But is coldness So what what does that even mean What does that even mean Anna Shivering What s that Shivering Okay shivering is because you are cold What is coldness Okay I think it s when the temperature is really low and everything s kind of darkness when you think of the sun warm it s really warm when you have the sun But it s when you think of something cold it s sometimes Okay I want You guys are giving me some really good examples of what cold is Here s what I want to think about Okay how to phrase this Is there a such thing as cold And if so how would you define it It s a hard question Oh You got to answer Get ready to answer Get ready and do one quick response and then we re going to put it aside for now and we re going to move on Come on Hunter No because it s just heat that s a That s just water that can be heated or Heat heat is cold Heat is that Yeah it s like Heat that s cold Yeah Oh So it s all just kind of a scale Like you got hot over here and cold over here and you re talking about there s less heat over here than there is here Heat has cold molecules Heat has colder All right So here s what we re going to do we re going to talk more about this later We re going to move on to the next question for now Here we go 
 So our question was What are the reasons why Holden has a sudden acceptance of letting Phoebe grow up And I got this question because I feel like the carousel represents growing up because you have to let people grab towards something they want or else if you re not letting them experience the world to its full extent then you re just sheltering them and they re just going to live a sheltered life So they can t really do all the things that they have the possibility of experiencing Yeah I agree with him with Damon because I think the carousel symbolizes the ride through life Because it never really stops just continuously goes around and around And the goal is to grab the golden hoop And I think that symbolizes I don t know happiness because everybody tries for it and they keep trying even though they fall they keep getting back up on that carousel and trying to grab it And if you hold a kid back from trying to grab what he wants it s just like no I m not going to let you go out there and try to get what you want They re sheltering them from their own happiness kind of Because I also agree with Brandon but I also think that let s just say Phoebe was on the carousel and she fell off I don t know if Holden would go to her but I think based on his character he would But then I think that would be bad just because like Brandon was saying if you don t let them fall if you don t let them make their own mistakes then they re not gonna learn from life So like my dad he s so overprotective I think pretty much all parents are really overprotective of their kids but you should just let them go out there and experience the world and learn from themselves Not necessarily because I think that s their fear learning from their mistakes So I just think it s better if you just let them go like a little bit at a time just so they can just figure out things in life I think people have a hard time letting go of any child whether it s their brother their sister their actual child because it means that they re leaving soon and they re actually going to experience their own lives and then when it comes to a parent or an older brother or sister they don t want you to experience the same thing that they did too so they re like telling you what to do and it seems like they re telling you how to live your life but they re giving you advice I think parents the reason that they re so protective is because they know that saying ignorance is bliss because it really is and innocence is in a way you know because you don t know And so they just want their child to be happy but inadvertently they re actually making them sad if they just won t relax so they can And also I think a lot of kids don t understand this but part of the reason why our parents have such a hard time letting go is because you were part of their lives for as many years as you ve been born They preciously try to take care of you and they may seem like they re trying to shield you from everything but they re just trying to look out for what s best for you But you can t think of it like oh once this one chance goes by I ll never have it again Because it really is like a carousel You re gonna keep going on and you will have another chance Going back to the carousel I also thought that the carousel it may just seem that there are a bunch of different people on it So I think Holden kind of realized that even though the carousel he knows have different people on it you kind of have to allow the kids to grow up because you can t always keep them the same like the carousel it s not a real machine or something We all have to grow up eventually Just listening to you guys what do you think about when I was home in Los Angeles my nephew at that time was about six months old And at that point in time he was just crawling and putting everything in his mouth and stuff like that like leaves You d show him an apple and he s like Ahh And then he puts a leaf in his mouth And you re just like Holy You have to dig it out kind of a thing So in one respect I mean it s just like there s this idea of let people figure out things on their own but in that respect he ll die if you let him figure out oh you can t eat that So I m just trying to think as far as a parent goes how does a parent know when to let them figure it out versus how does a parent when to protect them And I think that s part of the conflict Holden is having he s trying to figure out how he can protect people and what he should protect them against Me and my grandpa talk to me and he was like I know that I have to let you go And I think that they know when to let you go by how responsible you are Like if you do what you re supposed to do and you show them that you re working or doing what you said then they want to let you go because they know that you That s true and I also think that it s not really based on yourself mostly It s based on your parents and how they ve grown and how with having kids you grow up as a parent and you know and it s just nature you just know when they re ready That s what I think I don t think really it s just based on all of their mistakes I just think it s pretty much based on Interesting I think when people start changing and stuff like their attitude because I ve noticed my little brother he s starting to change and he has an attitude now He s starting to get a little rebellious and stuff and I think that s when parents have to start letting loose on their kids cause we have to experience things on our own and it s not just being told what to do and stuff You have to have that experience to learn from Every person has their own free will Like the saying you can take a horse to the water but you can t make it drink You can enforce your rules on your child as much as you want but you can t force them to do anything you can just have an influence on them And that s something that parents have to understand You can t force your kids to do their homework but you can ground them if they don t All right guys I want you guys to keep going You guys are doing a great job I can see your notes are also looking pretty good I m gonna move on to another group okay But keep this going because I think you guys can come up with a lot more okay Thank you guys You guys are doing an awesome job with your volume we re gonna come over to this group over here All right can you fill me in on what you guys talked about making sure we have the volume up We have a couple of questions we have like Oh okay Let s just come up with tell me about the one that you guys are the most excited about The first question is my question which was what are the reasons why people live their lives through other people And I kind of came up with that question because Holden he kind of was denied of his childhood because Allie died and so that really impacted him And since that he s kind of been trying to preserve the innocence of Phoebe Like making her go back to the carousel even though she says she s too big for it He s like No you re not He s trying to help to her keep that innocence or just children in general keep that innocence that he was denied It kind of was a parent versus child kind of thing It goes against like parent versus child So a parent when they have a child they kind of want to live their life through their child And they make them do all these chores to get into because they never got to do it when they were little because they were deprived and their parents probably didn t want them to do it So they kind of Interesting I said that I just think this whole concept of the identity is not yet established and you have the father and have somebody else create their footsteps I had these two other questions because I was reading the book where I was wondering why I was trying to get more in depth with why Holden wanted his job to be catching children in the rye Okay so I kind of answered it and I said it s very in tune because when you fall off the cliff you can t get back up Just like when you lose your innocence you can t get it back because this experience happened If you get exposed to it you can t magically forget it It just stays with you and that s a part of you that s just lost Interesting That kind of relates back to the question about It seems like Holden is kind of holding onto his past and so he s still living in that innocent stage and when he s living an innocent stage he can t make a wrong decision which is very hard from his now because he s 16 he keeps transferring to all these schools and he can t really grow up because he still has that memory and so that s why he s confused about his identity Good point Going back to the first question about why people live their lives through other people it kind of goes through influences too Like he was talking about James Castle and when he died he said that James liked to digress on a topic and have speeches and it kind of made him think about oh yeah that s a pretty great idea It s not bad but why would people be waiting for that It was actually like a digression off topic makes you think of new ideas And I think going back to that question again that sometimes parents want the best for their child so they convince their what they want their child to be If that makes sense And at the end sometimes you can t force the child to do what they don t want to do So in a way it s kind of like you guys said the parent versus the child They wanna form their own identity as a teen but at the same time the parents are so busy trying to protect them Is that what we re kind of getting at through everything They re so busy trying to protect them that they just gotta learn to let go Is that what we re saying Yeah kind of Like Holden says he s trying to protect that innocence because he s always referring to There s a part where he s walking down the sidewalk and he called Allie to help him cross to the other side And that s kind of interesting because usually you don t think an adult would say that A child would say that And it s because he s mad at his parents because they won t talk about it so he s kind of just living with this Interesting So he s just trying to find a way of coping Is that possible Yes And then there was another kind of question about where Holden comes to Kiana said Why do people feel the need to forget the deaths and move on And I thought of this question because when Holden was inside just his room Phoebe was getting all frustrated with him because she was like You don t like anything You don t like anything And he was trying to make up stuff that he did like Like he did say he liked Allie and she ll say he s dead so pick something else And he was arguing with her saying that just because he s dead you don t forget him and you can still like someone who s dead And he thinks that Allie is thousand times better than nicer than people who are alive today now So that just proves how he s holding on to that and he s not planning on forgetting that and he holds that near and dear to his heart And so that s probably why he doesn t like a lot of people because he compares them to how Allie was and his innocence his maturity level how it was then and how he sees how people today because kids don t understand he s holding on so he doesn t really understand what s going on Anything else to add on to this No I like what you guys are doing I like how you re tying in the death of Allie with the catcher in the rye type of a thing What about the carousel first of all I don t know it sounds like it goes with the whole keeping the innocence going and all Cause I know he would probably ride it too Did he ride it I was thinking of repetition because how the parents feel it rotates around and round And whenever Phoebe passed by he would tell her how pretty she looked She was never changing That s kind of what he wanted he wanted her to stay in that stage and nothing to change Nice All right guys I m gonna check on another group I want you guys to keep going with this you guys are tearing it apart Good job looking at the symbolism and tying everything together All right and your notes look good as well too I like it I think you guys could explore the carousel and tie that in a little more Okay hi guys You guys the volume is doing really well So you guys fill me in Okay Tell me what you guys talked about Just mostly like and symbolism in the book Start getting louder 
 Um that one substance there s no other types of substances laced into the main substance Okay And what is yours A substance that has nothing mixed into it or added to it Okay so I hear three different things here okay I hear pure means one substance not mixed with anything else I hear pure is something that s not altered or manipulated in any way And then I hear something s that natural I want to know what your thoughts are about those three definitions So do you agree with those three definitions or not And tell me why And tell them why Well I don t think it s natural because natural is stuff that can be mixtures Can you give me examples of natural things that you think are mixtures Um like trees So what And you re saying a tree is a mixture because why Because it like has different colors and different like feels to it Oh so different colors and different feels so like different textures Is that what you re saying And why does that mean that it s a mixture Cause it s not all the same How do you know I don t know I don t What do you guys think Do you agree with her that a tree is something that s natural but it s a mixture So and that was your definition that you got natural I would say it s natural Like some things are natural some things aren t natural I guess cause Think about like when a diamond forms It s a natural thing and it s only that substance Sure I agree with you with that example A diamond is a naturally occurring substance that is pure But for your definition what I want you guys to think about is a definition that s true all of the time So for a tree I want us to use that example about a tree really quick Cause you re saying it s a mixture right So you re saying it s a mixture cause you have different colors and different textures Why is that statement different colors an indication that it s a mixture Well it s like it Okay And a difference between substances What is color an example of Michelle Characteristic properties Characteristic property which we know what about characteristic properties It is characteristic to that one substance It s characteristic to that one substance Okay So would you change your definitions based on what we just talked about Yes Okay So what I want you to do is write down what you guys now agree is the definition of pure on this piece of paper Okay Hey you guys I know you re discussing it and I hope that you re kind of arguing against one another and defending your argument for your definitions Here s what I m going to have you do Based on your conversations it is now your job to write one definition for the word pure on this sheet of paper that your whole group agrees on I ll then share all those with the rest of the class to see if we re all on the same page or not Okay We already had one discussion where we had three different definitions My guess is when I read what they write down they re now going to have an agreement on what a definition is But I may be wrong so let s see Write your definition As soon as you have it done hold it up in the air Pure substance same thing Pure or pure substance Okay so what do you want to do What was your definition My definition well huh What did you write literally First time the first time Yeah the first time What did you write initially I wrote that a pure substance is a substance that is like clean It s not dirty or anything Good and then what did you change it to A pure substance is a substance that has not been touched Okay and why did you change your definition to that Like what made you Did it happen because you guys talked about it Yeah Okay so what did he say that made you think that you should change it to something that hasn t been touched He said like a pure substance is something that naturally comes from the Earth Okay So you said it s something that naturally comes from the Earth So is that what you mean by not been touched Yeah So it s just natural and not manipulated by people Yeah So it could have been literally touched but Unprocessed Unprocessed okay So give me an example of a pure substance that naturally exists Um Tree Okay so tell my why you think a tree is pure It hasn t been really been really processed or anything it s in the forest Okay so then what do you know about color of substances Um Sometimes it s a characteristic property It is a characteristic property right Which means each substance has it s a certain color And for that substance it will always be that color When you think of a tree do you see one color or do you see multiple colors Sometimes multiple Multiple colors so what is that evidence of Multiple colors Characteristic property It is a characteristic property but I mean how is having Hey Brett Can you please focus on what you need to be doing Do you have your definition done Yes Okay here s what I would like the rest of you guys to do including Brett s group You now if you have your definition written down I want you to go ahead and start doing number two Give me your examples of pure substances And give me your explanations I m going to give five minutes for that That means 10 38 So A tree has multiple colors Green is going to be an indication of of what Would you be able to say that green would be an indication of one substance Not really No okay why not Because leaves or grass Bark is a tree Okay so you re saying that more than there s more than one substance maybe that can be green Okay But okay so that s fine If there are different colors of green do you think that means different substances No What about characteristic properties though What do you know about a characteristic property It never changes for a substance It never changes for a substance So if I have two different greens do you think I have two different substances No I would Cause that s the definition of a characteristic property Right one green would be characteristic for that one substance always Never ever something different If I see a different color that must mean I have a different substance Okay If I have two substances together do you think that s a mixture or pure Mixture Mixture So a tree Do you see multiple colors on a tree Yeah What does that indicate A mixture A mixture of multiple substances Is a tree natural Yeah Yeah so does that affect your definition for pure If you re saying it s a mixture it can t be pure but it s natural so maybe our definition needs adjustment So think about what you might change your definition to be now okay Okay and write one down Are you done with this problem It s anonymous Okay well then Water isn t is it Oh interesting so you guys you don t know if water is or isn t You explained on the board that one time that it was a mixture of oxygen and Something else Okay so let s Okay well what s the chemical formula for water H two O H two O so what elements are combined to make water Hydrogen and oxygen okay So I agree with you there hydrogen and oxygen are bonded together which makes water okay So do you think water is pure or a mixture Well when they do the water definition we were trying to decide like if something s straight like we could some not a mixture Okay Then is it pure Okay I m going to read your definition really quick okay So a pure substance is a raw substance Nothing inside of a pure substance has been changed or added it came straight from nature There is no trace of any other substance It is not a mixture Okay I see two definitions in there Here s what I see I see a definition that talks about it being I see three One your definition is something that comes from nature Another one I see is Something that has not been changed Another one I see is no trace of another substance So that sounds like one substance Okay those are the three definitions I see But is there a substance from nature that hasn t been changed No Water is a substance from nature that hasn t been changed I mean yeah we add things to it It hasn t been changed but it is a mixture Is it a mixture though Yeah But what about when like animal live in it and stuff does it change So you re kind of thinking maybe it gets contaminated that way If it gets in contact with something else Yeah if they re even from nature So here s what today we should be able to figure out by the end of the period And you guys pretty confidently should be able to tell me if water is or is not pure Here is my hint My hint to you is the way we can tell by looking at something if it s pure or a mixture cause you can or maybe not just by looking but experimenting with it It s based on characteristic properties of matter That s what I want you to think about So it s just the primary colors then What do you mean Primary colors Well the primary colors I don t know It s just that color So is color a characteristic property of matter Yes What does that mean then Wait but can t you change it When something s a color But when you add one color to Something Like if I add a color to the water doesn t it change the water When you add a color into water it mixes with the water So it s not still water It still tastes like water I didn t say that I just said it was mixed It s a mixture oh Okay I didn t say that either but If you put the food coloring in it So and why are you saying that s all of a sudden a mixture Because they re So different substances together okay So what then does pure mean Not mixed a substance by itself A substance by itself So you believe water is just a substance Okay Alright Alright you guys These crutches are going to kill me Are you okay Those hurt you re hurt Okay you re okay We re going to talk about it right now okay Do I have everybody s piece of paper Are you done Okay This is not true Really Yes Alright turn here and stop what you re doing Listen to what What I want I know that you may not be done with your examples yet Because you re still struggling with your definition of pure I want to show you what other groups are thinking So I m going to show you all these I ll ready them for you too so that you re going to see that we have differences And the idea is by the end of today based on what we do you should be able to change and finalize your definition Okay And competently be able to give me examples Alright So the first one and I ll try to move this Let s make sure you can see this If it s hard to see Tim will you turn off actually why don t you go ahead and do that now Tim I think it will be better I don t know But just the front set of lights Thank you We ll come down Okay The first definition An unprocessed material which is one substance by itself instead of combining multiple substances to get the material I see two different definitions I see one pure means to be unprocessed and then I see another one substance by itself Okay Here s another one A pure substance is only one substance that is not a mixture So you re starting to see that pure and mixture which I will agree with are basically opposites of one another So you ve got to explain the difference between them So a pure substance is one substance that is not a mixture So I m wondering what your definition of mixture is Who wrote does anyone Who wrote this one are you willing to share Do you have a definition for mixture then Um well multiple substances that are mixed together Good so you re saying so great your definition for pure is one substance while mixture would be more than one substance Okay This one says a substance that has no mixture involved So you re saying that there s a clear difference between the two I still don t quite see a definition for the word pure yet in this definition A pure substance is a substance with no other substances mixed in It is one single substance So I m starting to see a little bit of a trend A pure substance is a raw substance Nothing inside of a pure substance has been changed or added It came straight from nature There s no trace of any other substance It is not a mixture So we definitely have agreement that mixture and pure are something different but I see three definitions One it s something that is raw or something that and I think this is what this is saying Correct me if I m wrong but you mean by raw kind of in some way connected to natural Okay so something that is natural versus something that has no trace of any other So I kind of see the idea of one substance versus multiple Okay as a definition Okay maybe I only saw two Okay Oh I thought this one was typed I was like How did that happen How did Was that you is that your handwriting That s insane Okay I like it It s like prefect Woah Okay There you go Alright A pure substance is a substance or material that hasn t been mixed with any other substance It is only one substance Okay um Two Two more A substance is only one substance and it is not mixed with any other substance right And our last one Oh this one s actually different A pure substance is an element Okay that s a different definition than the other things I ve heard They are made up of one atom They are not mixed with other substances nor do they contain other substances within them So I hear two definitions in here One being pure means that it s just an element And then I see another one that it s a single substance Okay So I want to hear some of the examples you re coming up with right now And I m not going to say if they re right or wrong I m just going to try to probe you with some questions Okay Naud What is one of your examples Salt Okay so you say salt is pure Why do you say salt is pure Because we don t think any other substance is combined with salt to make salt So you re saying that to be pure means one thing one thing in that container and you re saying if it s just salt that must be pure Mm hmm Okay Miriam It has to be raw and like like plain like raw salt Like not like mixed with preservatives or Okay so literally just salt that s it Yea Okay Alright so let s take another example Or if you disagree with them you can also offer up your argument for that Shaina what do you think Well we all thought that a diamond might be a pure substance Why Well I think a diamond can only be cut by itself and can only be cut with a different diamond OK So that s really dense so we thought that if anything was added to it something else would be able to cut it And that would be something else that was less dense So interesting What is um You re talking about density What is density It s a characteristic property A characteristic property So this is good You definitely should be starting to lean towards what you know about characteristic properties of matter Okay That is key to helping you understand the difference between pure and mixture Who can tell me what a characteristic property of matter is Hannah A property that stays the same regardless of the amount of the substance Yeah a property that stays the same for a substance regardless of the amount So what I m hearing you say is that you think the ability to cut into a diamond has to do with its density And you re saying that because you can only cut a diamond with a diamond it must mean that the densities are the same And so since the density is the same for the whole diamond that means it s one substance 
 Okay so put these where they need to go on the board And Liz your job is graphing So Harper tell me about your data You your plant is 20 centimeters Okay and it s grown 11 centimeters Wow that s a lot of growth isn t it Good job And Emma what s your job You were the recorder And so some of the observations The leaves are bigger It has grown bigger In the middle of the leaves there are tiny leaves Cool in the middle of the leaves there s tiny leaves That is interesting And your cotyledon has come off Okay so that s good Excellent Okay so Coby you re going to be using the board and putting your data up there So tell me how high how tall is your plant now 20 centimeters Okay let s go check your graph We re out of room I have more So next time you ll have a graph that will be take two of this and it will be 40 centimeters Because 20 plus 20 is 40 So here s your 20 centimeter line what needs to go down here Okay now remember to help Parker with observations Natalie does the board Oh Natalie go up there Okay girls let s talk about what your findings are because just a second Talk to me about what happened with your plant Let s take a look So what do you think has is the reason for it not changing It was 10 centimeters when you started It was 10 centimeters again on Monday Okay but that s okay because we know the cotyledon was for germination It s done with that now and it can grow without it Is it a growing plant Looking at your graph Is it growing So maybe the leaves will get bigger and then The roots will get bigger too the roots will get bigger The water and the nutrients Okay let s take a look at your observations Roots longer white root cotyledon fell off leaves are pointy bigger leaves Now what did we observe about the growth About the growth of the plant What did we observe about it I think we should include that in your observations Okay so observer should record that Okay boys and girls I need all board job people to come on up here Okay now you guys one at a time are going to fill in your data Make sure that you re choosing a new color And I m going to make sure that these have seen all of your I don t think I ve heard about your growth here Okay tell me about what happened Joshua you need to go sit down work on the math You re not ready for that yet Okay so talk to your group and see what you need to do next Okay so tell me about what has How about the growth Right now it is okay so Alex Yes go get some Now your plant has it s 12 centimeters now it started at So how much total growth has Okay so it started at the 10 and now it s a 12 So can we make that who s the recorder So we want to make that because this is how much is it growing Okay so it s growing and let s look at our graph You ve got your day and now Oh so you went up a little bit too high here Let s take a pencil Alex and just do a small X right there so that we know that we really wanted our bar to stop at 12 Maybe more so that we can see it Keep erasing it that s good Don t play with your plant please If you re all finished you should be working on the math problems Okay now let s talk about your plant Okay let me come around here Tell me about your plant It started to get bigger The shell was growing out and we it s And how much has it grown total 50 Oh five Five that s right You started at seven and now you re at 12 so the difference between That s exactly the same as my plant too What I noticed about yours is over the week it came out of like you said the seed cover came off and the leaves Started to peel and it started to break Yeah Okay so the stem is really long Let s put this up here The leaves are bigger Who is the observer You are okay And can we see something about the seed cover Okay so while he s doing that we need to do some important things here What about the date One 30 goes here because that was Monday One slash 30 Okay and today s date is Okay and that s it because today s the third and this bar shows Natalie go sit down This bar shows that Good job you guys and you ve got that added And let s make sure that we re gentle with that measuring You can work on it together Molly stay with your group You guys work on that together You guys can work on it together So you guys have had what s the most common number of seeds they found Five Five good How about the total number of seeds Now do we know is each dot worth one Okay so what s the total number of seeds So how many seeds in all Okay boys and girls Sophia s finishing up If you have math extension problems in your table group please put those to the side And I m going to ask Chloe s group and Angel s group and Derek s group to come and have a seat here on the carpet so we re close to our graph You do not need to bring anything with you because we have it all up here already Chloe come join us please Alright Ashton and Josiah you can move closer so you can see or you can stay there Coby and Isaiah please come join us Alright Now one last person needs to fill in her data Let s see that would be me and my height was 16 Okay so while I m doing that take a look at the graph we just built And think about what are some things that you notice about the graph What do you see What are some things in common What are some things that are different Turn to your neighbor and tell them one thing that you noticed about the graph Okay eyes on me Now you tell me what are some things that you noticed about the graph Alex That six and three has the same height as us Okay so group six and three and you are group Five Five all have the height of all the way across and it s 10 12 Centimeters That s right so we have three groups that have the same height Ashton what did you notice So group one four and your group eight they re all not matching But all the other ones have a match So group eight and one and four are separate They don t have someone who s kind of similar So that leads me to ask about groups two and seven tell me about them Blake Seven and two are the same Seven and two are the same they both are the same why Keith Because they both have 20 20 Centimeters So what group on there has the smallest plant Alfredo what group on there has the smallest plant Group four Toby and how tall is group four s plant Ten centimeters Ten centimeters that s right Now group four Molly tell us a little bit about what happened with your plant 
 Okay so tell us a little background about Ed Alright well it showed that he had chest pains and also his vital signs showed that his heart was very weak so we thought he was having a heart attack and also he was unconscious Okay so because of his complaining of chest pains be subtle from conscious or no He called and he talked to the paramedics but it also said he was obese and so that could contribute to it as well How do you suppose that contributes to having a cardiac condition Generally it can clog your arteries What can clog your arteries The fat that builds up Okay from being obese Yeah Okay is that one of the I guess physical signs that someone may have a heart condition Yes Okay okay alright Go ahead It is also his blood pressure It said it s at variable levels so that means his heart isn t working properly or consistently So that means it could also contribute to a circulatory system it could damage it It s also another sign of a heart attack Okay so the variable heart or actually the variable blood pressure And some of you had questions about that when you were doing your research You were wondering what did this variable mean and I think what you said is exactly right it s not normal okay They state the variable meaning it wasn t working how it should Okay so sounds like this guy had some definite issues both with his vital signs and with his history So tell us a little bit why you ranked him number one compared to let s say you ranked who was your number hmm Who was your second who proceeded him Nelson Nelson so you got Ed ranked over Nelson where some other people had Nelson ranked number one so what do you think Well he s unconscious now so that means his heart attack started some time ago and once you have a heart attack you need treatment immediately and since his heart attacks aren t his title he needs it I think it s important to see to get treatment To get medical care Yeah Okay if he doesn t get treatment what do you think could happen Probably he ll die from the heart attack if he doesn t get treatment or paralyzed What do you mean by paralysis Why do you think he could become paralyzed I m not sure if it s a stroke or a heart attack if you go through it if you get paralyzed or not Okay you re not sure if it s a stroke or a heart attack that leads to possible paralysis Yeah Anybody like to comment on that Question go ahead Jordan It s a stroke It has a brain clot and then that will cause partial I can t say it Paralysis Yeah that word but heart attack You could have a heart attack after that using different parts not paralysis Good point So Jordan says having a stroke can cause paralysis What system is being affected when you have a stroke that could lead to paralysis What system in our body is that Nervous system Yeah nervous system Okay understand Doban Jake got that Alright so you guys have Ed you ranked him number one and then you ranked Nelson number two along with quite a few other people It looks like we have some consistencies there Let s look at group B You had Nelson ranked number one but then you did have Ed ranked number three So you didn t think Ed was as serious having this heart condition compared to Nelson and or Monique Well Nelson and Monique had the most critical vital signs They seemed the most the worst because their temperatures were in the critical zone and above where they started so they were overheated and they probably had heatstroke or hyperthermic So they were not and they were dehydrated too When your body starts to dehydrate that s not it really messes up all your systems So they were What systems Cardiovascular system the respiratory system the immune system everything s just being attacked here because with Eve let me see this his heart rate was way below normal and that s the cardiovascular system His temperature was completely 109 from all the heat from the canyon What s the normal body temperature for that of a human The normal temperature is 98 6 and he s at 109 He s at 109 folks Okay I think this was one of our hypers if you remember Nelson and Monique were our two hypers that were airlifted into the hospital okay So he s at 109 Isn t this like the immune system Mmhmm Yeah so that s the immune system and then his breathing rate is way down It s at 10 respirations per minute 10 respirations per minute And the normal s like 20 so he s down to half So I think that his vital signs were way more out of whack Did you count in on the blood pressure The blood pressure It s really low and that means his circulatory system s not working right which means blood s not getting everywhere it needs to be Which means he could end up having I don t actually know if it would lead to a stroke but like if everything s not getting blood everywhere his brain might not get enough blood He could have brain damage or something like that It s interesting she said stroke talking about Nelson Was Nelson having any type of nervous system symptoms Seizures It was seizures He was having seizures Is that is a seizure an event that occurs as a result of something going wrong with the nervous system Absolutely Think about all the systems you just named What s going on with Nelson Cardiac nervous circulatory immune Dehydration Entire bringing in dehydration Digestive not enough water This guy is having a rough time isn t he So if you re pretty confident in why you ranked him number one Yeah Okay comments Anybody Well the reason we ranked him three was because we thought that he was most likely going to die and so we thought that his daughter was a higher priority because Monique Yeah because she has a better chance of survival So you ranked him three and it s interesting you said We thought he was going to die He was maybe beyond that point of help Yeah Okay so why d you rank him three Why not rank him seven Well what if he has a shot He s got a chance Yeah Okay he has a chance over Mark That wound to the chest Yeah because Mark got shot in the chest didn t he You d save him though It s interesting you said if he has a shot Mark s the one that got shot He was more stable than Nelson was though Mark was Mark was more stable Yeah Interesting you re bringing in the whole fact of now you re triaging it You re saying okay Mark s a little bit more stable even though he s got this gun shot and they were kind of vague in what they said about the gun shot We don t know what kind of gun it was But I feel like if you rank him a three he s at such a critical position that it s either you rank him one because he needs treatment right away or he s going to die Okay so you re saying he s got to be one based upon all the symptoms based upon his vital signs the condition that he was brought in If you re not going to rank him one you might as well just let him die Is that what you re saying Or early on Like you can t wait too long I guess You ve got to rank him one to three otherwise So he s like what group were you We re F You re F so you had him okay you had him at a two Yeah Okay alright so you re saying he s a top three Yeah especially You had a hand up Oh I was just agreeing with him If we thought we had any chance we should be like let s not waste any time to finish this either that or just make him seven Okay good point Brian Well were were thinking Speak up a little bit please Well we were thinking that even though he s unconscious and having seizures he was a crooked patient but compared to like the other ones like Albert or Mark his symptoms weren t that of like great danger as the others and even though his body temperature was 109 that could have been because he was going through heat stroke but now that he s in Asprins they re a cool environment You bring up heatstroke Why do you think he s going through a heatstroke Well I don t know because he was unconscious and they said he was dehydrated and everything Well dehydration can be due to heatstroke and like I also figured it d be heatstroke because his daughter Monique Yeah I m sorry Monique it said that she was dizzy and nauseous and if she was in the same environment as Nelson was then it s more likely that their symptoms are close to each other because if she s going through like nauseous and like dizziness then it s most likely that he is too because they re both in the same environment Very interesting I want to come back to this point Ryan you ve got your hand up What were you going to say I was just going to say that Monique has the same symptoms for heatstroke You re exactly right Now my mind instantly goes somewhere here Jordan your hand was up first I was just going to say that since their temperature s so high they re probably in shock and always their temperature is almost basically fatal levels so just putting them they re going from a really hot environment to a really cold environment Or really cool compared to where they were If they ll put them into more shock which can also be fatal which means they re not exactly just because they re in a hospital doesn t mean they re necessarily going to get better right away Okay obviously they need some treatment You don t want to go from one extreme to the other but do you agree that they need to be cooled down quite a bit Yeah They need to get cooled down and what else do they need Water Water lots of water correct Yes You can t really say that Monique s symptoms can apply for Albert too because Monique was having like an allergic reaction to the bee sting So that s probably what most of the symptoms are from We forgot about the bee sting It says she s dizzy nauseousness has cracked lips is having difficulty breathing has a rash on her legs and stomach Okay she got stung by a bee Like you were saying the reason we put Monique as number one besides experiencing possible heatstroke we also have her experiencing a very bad allergic reaction to the bee It shows here that with the difficulty breathing the bee sting her body is having a very poor reaction to the bee sting and that if left untreated for longer times without getting pills and stuff like that or EpiPen Getting what EpiPen You know what it is Just say EpiPen EpiPen yeah Epinephrine Epinephrine Yes It should elevate them in the largest sense where she could potentially have life threatening without her entire like respiratory system is closing off she loses her breathing possibly Absolutely she s having the preliminary signs of an allergic reaction here Here s where my thought went and I said we d come back to this point Maybe Sean you were going to comment or somebody else They re both out in the wilderness this canyon they re both having heatstroke symptoms Actually Monique got stung by the bee she s having separate issues there You don t see anything else different about these two individuals Sean One got to stay put for a long period of time and assured a maybe cooler spot while the other still had to keep going up through the sun and the heat to try to get to the top Do you think that would have a difference in their physical One gets to rest while the other still has to keep going and going and going another what third of the way Excellent point you know What s the other issue between these two Jack you know Well like they re both in the same environment and they both have symptoms of heatstroke but Monique got stung by a bee and at the same time Nelson has no signs of any external trauma or anything that happened to him that caused the symptoms So it could have even been a seizure or a stroke made him lose consciousness and causes a temperature to rise so high is because he was probably thinking that there was something off Interesting interesting Yes Would it be their age Age excellent Look at the difference in their age How old s Monique 18 Yeah she s 18 Nelson the dad right He s 51 I m not saying 51 is old but there s a big difference between 18 and 51 plus the fact you add in what Sean said he s got to hike out of this canyon he s going to try to find help right Is he having to expend a lot more energy Yeah And he s got to go uphill He s go to go uphill yeah It s hot he s got no water he s got to go uphill he s losing basically control of his body No energy no water Erin And that s why we had Nelson as number one and then Monique would go second because they both had like the heat problem but Nelson was having it was much more severe with him because of his age and everything And Monique she was sitting there for three hours after being stung by a bee so it wasn t like so we put her close up to the top because there was she s already been waiting for long enough She needs to get help like right away because she was sitting in the shade waiting for hours while her dad had to go struggle up the top of the canyon So they were in a really bad situation and they just needed help immediately because they d been struggling long enough Absolutely What During our discussion we were kind of using Speak up a little bit sorry Okay so during when we were discussing the age we were thinking also Monique but Which group were you real quick E You were E okay So like what we thought was that since Monique is 18 years old verses Nelson is a 51 year old well like it makes sense that Monique has a stronger immune system because she s more young and she has more nutrients in her body whereas Nelson could be different but we don t know if he has any diseases like diabetes or high blood pressure It doesn t show but I m just saying in general We were writing specific about his other health because I wrote that down Age related diseases Age related diseases yeah So we re missing some medical history Yeah so it s possible there because he s older and because his immune system isn t as strong as Monique s is we have to like or doctors have to like protect them with treatment more early because his immune system is much more weak compared to his daughter s Absolutely As doctors medical history is so important It s so important in the triage process and we ve been through this folks You know you go to the doctor s office you go into the hospital you know in addition to while they re taking your vital signs what are they asking What are they asking when you go in Medical history Oswell Have you had any previous stuff What s stuff mean Like surgery so like problems Okay other medical conditions Yeah Okay what s another question they ask Very simple Has it ever happened before Has it happened before Is it hereditary Could it be hereditary what s your family s history And I think that s what Brian you were relating to back there What are you here for today Okay let s look back in the chart should I At this moment when he comes into the hospital he s obviously not having symptoms of having high blood pressure in the past and high blood pressure might have actually helped Oh so you re asking about you re referring to Nelson Yeah because if he had high blood pressure then that might have actually helped keep his blood pressure up to normal if it went down severely because of what happened in the canyon But because it s so low I would guess that he doesn t have a history of high blood pressure Okay you might want to disagree with that and take history out of it Blood pressure is obviously low I think we addressed this a second ago Why do you think it s low Sarah Because everything else that s going on it s also affecting blood pressure Yeah I think I truly believe with the limited amount of information we have I truly believe that because of the dehydration the heatstroke the no energy no nutrients I literally think this entire body all the systems Shutting down Shutting down I really do think that But it s a good point that you bring up because his blood pressure s 85 over 50 Does anybody has anybody ever taken their blood pressure before Okay 85 over 50 that s low I mean that gets to borderline point where you know you re dizzy I mean you could have an episode because that pressure of your blood going through the circulatory system it s not high enough I mean that gets borderline with instead of having to take medicines for high blood pressure you got to take medicines to bring your blood pressure up I think his body s just shutting down and you bring up a good point but I think in this case just with everything else going on I think his body s just shutting down Okay Honestly on the side of that besides you were saying like high blood pressure could actually help During the scenario that he s in high blood pressure like with it s problems that it could cause with it s possible weakens the heart could have actually killed him during the long extended time of trying to get to the paramedics That was due to the fact that the high blood pressure has the of hurting muscles at a much different rate than most people That this test could have possibly failed during the time to get to a paramedic without And plus even had he survived the high blood pressure and got on the top the shut down of major systems in his body would have still caused the blood pressure to get down so that there s no possible low levels that could even cause problems True yeah Blythe Like on the graphs I feel like there s Nelson his blood pressure and the blood pressure of Elders was like similar because it was 80 over 50 whereas Nelson was 85 over 50 But we just talked about how like Nelson s blood pressure could be low and this other instance it might not be but with Elder he has a head injury and 
 Yeah the oil Okay so we discussed that one So Maddie is going to write down about the peanut butter What the observation was At the first observation it was 9 centimetres And it has grown In Joshua s words it has grown Good And you re gonna do that for all three of them Okay um The peanut butter No we just did the peanut butter Oh no I mean the banana it s it s It s grown like 4 inches taller Its like 1 1 and a half inch taller Its like one and half inches Okay what is that Look Its like 9 and a half 10 and a half 9 10 and 12 That s 1 2 3 We re looking at the bananas yeah wait that s half an inch Alright so did you get that Were the Cheetos recorded Okay good Alright so now we ve got let s look here Josh go ahead and read number 9 Compare and record the results from all three fat absorb absorption observations Observations Observations okay so we re going to look at all three here we ve got our data laid out here Look at your Cheetos Um the first time Cheetos was eight and a half inches the second time it was 10 and a half inches and the last time it was 12 12 centimeters So what does that mean Joseph what do you see when you see those numbers going like that Um its like growing because every time you check one its like a little bit bigger and it gets a little more inches on and it gets a little bit more big So basically the longer that the Cheetos sat on the paper towel the more fat and oil is absorbed into the paper towel right Okay So um Josh if you ll just go ahead and write that down about the Cheetos And Hailey what did you notice about the next food The apples Um two times it stayed the same and one time it got a little bit smaller Just got a little bit Yeah Okay it says two are the same and one is just a little bit different And that could have been just um where is our centimeters It could have been just human error where we just sort of measured a little bit off Okay Um cause if you look at this apple sample here there isn t really any coming out of the green circle is there So nothing was absorbed from the apple Did you see that Okay alright So if you ll add that to our list that we ve noticed we observed Shemaire you look at those potato chips I m going to leave that one here Tell us what the overall pattern was with the potato chips The potato chips Talk real loud for me Um ok the potato chips they like changed each time Like the first time it was 5 the second time it was eight and a half and this time it was 7 And what are those that you are talking about what units of measure Centimeters Centimeters okay So we want to make sure we get centimeters written in on there okay uh huh Alright so what does that tell you about potato chips Um that its not like that fat it doesn t got that much grease in it cause pretty much it showed like it was lower and then it got a little bigger then it just got a little bigger Okay so comparing the three here what do you notice Pretty much that this one has more fat than these two It looks like with this observation just this one here in class today and later we re gonna do we ll look at the food labels of potato chips and Cheetos But right now just on our observations it does look like the Cheetos have more fat right now okay But when we start reading its gonna be potato chips Oh that leads us in It s gonna be Cheetos So go ahead so um let s look at number 10 read that for us Josh What can you conclude from the observations and recorded data Which snack has the most or least amount of fat So you all will come and discuss that together and then you can answer that question right there Put most and least Fine okay I d say the apples have the least amount of fat And the potato chips have the least the apples have the least amount of fat then the potato chips second and the Cheetos is last And why do you think that might be Why do you think the banana has expanded the most Because its I don t think its because of the fat in the bananas and getting in Talk loud I don t think its because of fat with the bananas that s getting oil on the paper towel because bananas are pretty healthy and they don t really normally have fat in them Yeah yeah Okay so that s your background knowledge You are aware of that What were you gonna say It s like its not fat or oil its like its just water Maybe water absorbed in it What prediction would you make if we were to let this sit over night to where like the water would have time to dry up What would you predict this paper towel would look like tomorrow Let me go with Tray It would be all wet and soggy So you think it would actually be more wet Yeah Okay Emily what do you think Well I would think that the way it is now that the paper towels are gonna end up like that and the bananas would get all and more disgusting and Okay does anybody think that the banana might that the wet watery part might dry up Maybe I think it would expand a little bit more and then start drying until the water is out of the banana and then the banana starts to dry out too Okay well alright We ll actually leave that one out and see and we ll check on it tomorrow And see what it s doing And we ll kind of answer our own question there okay Okay wait we re not finished what do we say about the banana You have to talk louder though The banana I guess the banana like expands the wetness It expands a couple centimeters like a half a centimeter Good use of centimeters I like how you re using the actual mathematical term there The centimeter is good Okay while she is writing that I m going to let Tray go ahead and read that next question Well if you can see it Maddie will you let him read that so we can kinda be thinking while your finishing up there Um what can you conclude from the observ observation and recorded data What snack has the most most and least amount of fat Well um as my opinion I would think that the banana has more fat than the peanut butter and the least amount of fat would be the fudge Okay Josh Well I would think that the fudge has the least amount cause it has the least amount of absorbed like grease and fat But the banana has like all this oil water and all that like sinking into it Okay Maddie I think that the peanut butter has the most amount of fat because um like I said earlier the bananas are more healthy than the peanut butter and it s probably just water and this is like oils and salt and stuff making it more greasy and that s probably more fat absorbing into the paper and then the fudge hasn t had very much at all so I would say it has the least amount of fat I would agree with like most of y all because the banana and the peanut butter is like has like a lot of wetness in it And the fudge has like a little bit of wetness Like a centimeter Yeah about a centimeter But also the bananas could have the least amount of fat because they are healthier and that s probably just water Compare the results to the original group hypothesis Our hypothesis is that the potato chips will have the most fat Talk loud Our Hypothesis is that the potato chips will have the most fat Our group decided this after discussing Cheetos versus potato chips deep fried and adding salt and Cheetos are made out of cheese so cheese is made out of milk from cows which is healthy Oh wow lots of thought went into that Okay so read that question again how do we compare our original hypothesis to what we ve discovered now in our research We were wrong Say that again We were wrong Okay so according to our data what did you find Why do you say we were wrong Because like the Cheetos they had like a bunch of fat grease and stuff Talk louder And the potato chips they like barely have any They had some but it wasn t quite what you were thinking right What were you gonna say Josh we re gonna come right back to you No Yes Joseph She thought it was the Cheetos which we thought it was that and afterwards now since we found out that it was probably the cheese Talk loud When it gets stuck on you fingers it s all wet and oily and everything Okay No she s the one that said cheese was healthy Okay well think about it some cheeses are healthy this is more of a dehydrated powdered cheese added to the Cheetos right Go ahead Josh what were you gonna say She said that maybe the salt from the potato chips could ve dried up the grease maybe Okay Hailey Pretty much what Josh said It s the same Okay so you just agree with that So Josh maybe you could all just write down some of what you all discussed About the change from what our prediction or our hypothesis was to what we found now Okay And Hailey if you want to go ahead and start some of our discussion questions Okay Based on our discoveries from today what snack has less fat Joseph Um apples Claire Definitely apples Josh Apples Yeah apples When you go home today what snack would you choose based on the data collected today and why Joseph I d probably do the apples because it pretty much has no fat which we learned and I d probably want to eat no more Cheetos since I found out how many fat was in them now Never again Never Oh you wouldn t live would you Very good Hailey say that again I wouldn t eat Cheetos very often You wouldn t eat Cheetos as much but in limited quantities right Okay very good Shemaire which snack would you choose I d probably have to say apples too because they are healthy either way and I love Granny Smith apples they re my favorite Oh good good healthy snack eater I m going to have to say now since we found out Cheetos how much fat it has Then we start thinking about how much fat is actually in there we probably don t know how much fat is in there Right Well we re going to look at those food labels closer now that we ve investigated these and see which one really does have more fat the potato chips or the Cheetos 
 Okay I can see two in here Can you read the article first please Yes Loudly The president of the republic should be an Egyptian born to Egyptian parents and enjoy salient political rights His age must not be less than 40 Gregorian years Mm hmm I agree with the president um Mm hmm He should be Egyptian born to Egyptian parents because it will have make him have well rounded perspectives and it may lead him to having interests to other countries and so It would make him have interest or will not make him prevent him It would not prevent him to um from getting to a different country s interest than his country Okay Good job I agree with Yessenia because if both if he s from parents that are Egyptians he can have some connection with Egyptians and he won t have pressure from other countries that want to change some of the rules they have And um have like wars with different countries about their economy and things they have different Mm hmm That s what I that s what my opinion yeah that s why I agree with her Good I disagree with the part of the where it says that they should be Egyptian parents Mm hmm But I agree with Jesus and his concerns about the Egyptian parents But my opinion is that they should have at least one parent Egyptian and the other another race Mm hmm Because if one parent s Egyptian like the child or the becoming president would have a something of concerns and would know some parts of Egypt and its government and if the other and this other race would help him guarantee for the governments in the other places and countries states Okay Good job Which the legislative process Good job I agree with Yessenia and Jesus because if they re from Egypt and their parents are Egyptian then they can have some cultural background and they ll know more from people and they ll have connections with the people Good Good So now what is the result now Do you think you re going to change the part I see I ve heard some different opinions here Are you going with the change or do you want to keep it as it is I think we should keep it as it is because I mean that s a good thing to have Egyptian parents and a background like Hilda said a background of culture Mm hmm So I ll say yes leave it Just leave it the same Okay Just that part Okay Very good So you will just leave that part as it is without change Is there any other parts for this article Yeah there s a second part His age must not be less than 40 Gregorian years Mm hmm Um I disagree because um when you re young you ll know more about technology and computers and everything Mm hmm And that s how um the youth and younger children in Egypt that s how they went and communicate I agree with Yessenia a lot because when a president is younger but not old he can connect with the youth and other younger people Because when Egypt was in the revolution the president was 81 years old Mm hmm Mm hmm Eighty four And behind the revolution was the young and they were like younger So he didn t really understand them really well and they didn t understand him well because he was a little older than them So for me I ll say 35 um yeah that s a good age for the president They can connect with teenagers and people of younger I just Very good I like the connection that you made Jesus between the age and the people who were behind the revolution Good job I disagree with Jessie and Jesus Good Yeah Because I think that part of the constitution is okay because 40 um 40 years is makes them have plenty of experience and to doing his their work And like it makes them like for like what Jesus said about technology they can learn about it and they can show them and all So basically they they ll pretty much know Who do you mean by they The becoming president That the old or the young The old The older one He cannot understand or work with technology that much Yeah Because Jesus said that they um they won t know about technology much Mm hmm But they if they re 40 they would have plenty of experience Mm hmm And they can learn about the technology and know how to communicate with the younger adults and teens you know Okay Good good I agree with Emi but I agree with Jesus and Yessenia so Mm hm That s okay Um because Focus on what you want to do Like youth was like 70 or 80 of Egypt Oh good But if he s older he s going to have more responsibilities Mm hmm And he can be more responsible Mm hm So I disagree with Hilda Responsibility Because when they re younger they re more active and more responsible Like they can remember most things where they keep stuff And when they re active they can like travel through Egypt and see what s wrong with the country and what s wrong with the economy and they can make changes and talk to some people about their opinions and things they want to change the country So I ll say the younger but not too young Like 35 and up Thank you My opinion is that 40 is okay because the young the young people like at 35 because 35 s not that young but lower than that can make a little bit of difficulties because they make they might make like a mistake They might not know a thing and they just put another thing You mean they will not be mature enough Yeah mature Sure Good Like the 40s the 40 year old people like they they pretty much know everything They learn it they were educated The government laws and Mm hmm this and that Mm hmm But I think that part is 40 years is better Good So you would like to say okay just to open or or or break it down to so young like 30 or 20 or even teenager right Well I like that the two parts that you brought Hilda about 70 that the majority of the population of Egypt are already youth And your part that you said that this will make Jesus that that will make help them to have good connection with the young people there Good job So what did you decide on I see that you re going with certain direction We should change it The first part of the statement of Art 75 Mm hmm Which is the constitution We should keep that as it is And the second part of the 40 years we should change it Well we should leave it like that as well Very good I like how you are compromising with them Emi and you are going with the change So what part are you going to change Um It will be transforming to what Thirty five Mm hmm Thirty five years Not less than 35 Not less Good job Excellent Very good After you take your notes let s move to the next article Article 77 The term of the presidency shall be Gregorian six Gregorian years starting from the date of the announcement of the results of the Mm hmm The president of the republic may be re elected for other successful years Mm hmm I disagree with the six years Um Yes Mm hmm Yes Keep going Because I think it s a little longer and some advantages are that people could get tired of the same president um having them over again And I think it should be lower for four years like in America And some of the disadvantages are that people could like him and he might be re elected for another six more years Um people could elect him because he did some great things to the economy and things to the country And that s what I think of for the first one What do you all think about it You think the first one should be as it is or changed Changed to four years Changed to four years Yeah Okay What do you think I agree I agree with Jesus because an example of this is Hosni Mubarak He he um was following supposedly the terms of the constitution which which he made an excuse and took many chances in um having the presidency So I for like 30 years So I my opinion is to lower it down to four years and if they re re elected which they can use democracy like here in America Mm hmm If they re re elected they will have at least 12 years Basically Okay Do you disagree Um the statement I agree because it will give them more stability and more time to elect Mm hmm I agree with Jesus and Emi Why do you agree with them Because six years is a lot of years and if they don t like him they ll have to wait a lot a long time so that another president can come into power Okay So you think bringing it down to four years is better than having the president for one term for six years Yes Okay The second one is the president of the republic may be elected for another successful years The thing I dislike about this is that they don t really explain how um the terms For example the president of Egypt um used an excuse to be re elected because um he said that in the constitution it said it didn t say specifically how much how many terms um they lead So I ll I ll change that that um leave specifically a number of terms they need to be elected Um Very good point Luis I didn t um Jesus I m sorry Very good point here You brought really a very important point And this is what will this was like the concern of many people over there The specification of of what Successful terms Of the how many terms very good Successive terms Very good Does anybody have an opinion or disagreement Uh I I agree with Okay I agree with um you because that s what Hosni Mubarak was really he was making excuse to like stay um him how like it is to keep him as a president and re elect him over and over to um and he was telling them that he was following the constitution because their theory said there was like no number of Yeah so he I agree also because like you said the example of Hosni Mubarak was the serious serious excuse They um the people were basically mad at them that um certain term because they didn t give a number of the terms so um that s why Hosni Mubarak made that excuse and wanted to take over Very good When the point of staying too many years in power or in office that brings to me something that s going on in other two countries You remember any of the other countries in the Middle East and Africa that has something going on there Because of this specific part Libya and Yemen What s going on in Libya now They re protesting against um Gaddafi Very good yes Good job I like how you remembered his name Why Why they are protesting against him Because he d been in power for like about 43 years Good job Mm hmm Okay what else is going on in another country Or what country is having something going on Yemen Yemen Yemen Very good Okay Well this brings us to go back again a little further something about different types of governments Remember Egypt was a republic okay When their the president stayed there for so many years that will not be a republic country That will be what A dictatorship A dictatorship Very good That will be a dictatorship So the the the type of government is if government is not a the republic or maybe democracy as they say or claim but it will be it will be A dicta A dictatorship Very good And the people in power the people in the office government office will be what Dictators Okay It s because they do what they want to do and they don t listen to other people Okay and what is another name for dictatorship or very close to it

alternating your mallets Are you bouncing your mallets Are you doing the correct rhythm Did your question start on doe if you re the question Did your answer end on doe if you re the answer Was your melody memorable and singable Here we go My turn first so we ll go question answer down the batch feels and you get it Todd I forget the I made this pretty one just for you Paige question is ready here you go Do I start this time Yeah you start this time Yeah you re going to do the question now I m giving you the answer Now question answer question answer Let s actually do this Question answer question answer Question answer Ready Britney Josh you get ready to do the answer Ready Britney here she goes Oh you know what Ben it sounded like the end was ended on a doe Oh yeah All right you want to try it again That s why Eli was like Oh Yeah okay Ready go Good Sabrina go It s um Question Okay Nice job Now some of you didn t get a chance to do the question or didn t get a chance to do the answer Right So here s what I m going to have you do And we have 30 seconds to do this With the person next to you one of you do the question one of you do the answer okay Let s try it together Ready set and here we go Answer Nice Here s the beauty of the pentatonic scale boys and girls No matter if we re doing a million different things at the same time if we re all on different bars the notes of the pentatonic scale sound so good together that you can could be playing something else and it still sounds musical 
 So what about this part Is this any different or is this part the same as last time It s different because Well Let s let Rileen talk Chris It s different because it s wider and it got right to here and the other one came up to there It s like six more it s like ten more centimeters than last time Okay So once you guys finish with your observations you guys can start working on collecting your data for the canyon and for the delta See this part is completely dry It s pretty much almost half Water s above the side Watch that watch that it s gonna fall Look at that It s like a boat going down a waterfall That was sand I know The water has stopped going One minute s passed Thirty Oh There s a start to get ready It s not done playing It s still not done Well the water Look at this look at this I know we re still dry There s a pool of water at the end There s a pool of water at the end Look at this there s a dent there s a dent Oh wow Right here s dry Okay why do you guys think this part didn t get any water Because it probably went under So Cameron says it went under Xander what were you saying It was going too fast and it didn t it was probably right here so it didn t decide to go all the way over here and it went right here It formed a lake right here It went the easiest route So it s got eight or nine minutes So now ten nine minutes Is water still draining Yeah the water s still there When are you guys gonna decide when the end time is When this goes There s been nine minutes right And the water is dripping Last time we got 15 minutes The water s dripping into basin Last time we got 15 minutes So how does it all compare Because um it compares because it s almost the same and look at it like poured a pool or something Cameron you were saying this one is almost the same Like it took the same amount of time No No No I m saying it s getting there No the other one s longer because it drained a bigger whole Yeah So Elondra how was the time different for this one How it was like similar Let s hear what Elondra says This one went faster This one went faster Yeah way faster So you re saying it s similar not too different But Elondra s saying it went faster Do you agree with her Yeah and the deposition it s like way over here Way across there You guys are I think pretty much done with your water draining now Okay so Nine or ten minutes and it s done So you guys want to record your end time No no it s still going It s okay if there s still a little bit of water left in Once it stops draining you guys can put the tape over here and you guys can start taking your measurements Where do we get the toothpicks Don t we have to know what time it is 10 30 right Was this when the chocolate melts When s the chocolate melt Elondra What It looks like chocolate So are you guys ready to start taking your measurements Yeah Why don t you guys open up your science notebooks so you have the table in front of you and I ll bring by a toothpick so you can get started on the writing Yeah I think the widest part is right here Can I do the poking Huh Can I do the poking You guys have your measuring tape out We have to go get the measuring tape Tape that back up Here our widest part is right here Widest part is that No no no you re not supposed to poke it How long is that It s about to here Okay we got what we need Go from centimeters Centimeters Aw Cameron Cameron you messed it up That s not our longest part Our longest part is this Okay we have to redo it Wait where does we start Right here Here you do the poking Don t poke it into the thing but how deep is it Here grab it No you re not supposed to do that Remember what she did Okay this right here It s about three centimeters Three centimeters So depth of straight channel is three centimeters Okay what do we measure next Okay time to do the width How much was it Three centimeters Three Okay What s the widest Where s the measuring tape Around six centimeters How much Six Six centimeters Six Okay now we need to do width of soil drop to end of stream channel It s all this it s all from right here It s from here to here You guys we need the tape measure Yeah width from here to here No it s this long I ve got it with my fingers This long It s about 15 No it s 14 and a half No that s 15 Yeah 15 Oh yeah 15 Same with the other one 15 It goes all the way to the end Yeah length Okay 29 How many 29 Yeah and depth of soil dripped at the end of end of the stream channel Where s the toothpick So right here Right there yeah Okay where s the time Okay so can you hold that there How much is it Five centimeters How many Five Five c m Okay width of the soil dropped at the end of the stream channel So right here We re gonna actually move to here No no width Oh width Looks about 11 centimeters maybe 11 centimeters Alright length of the soil dropped at the end of the stream channel So now we re measuring that Here you can do it So what re you guys working on measuring now Length We ve got a long length 27 28 28 yeah 28 centimeters Jorge you can measure Now what do we measure Depth of soil dropped at end of the Wait what was it 28 Depth of soil dropped at the end of the stream channel Where s the toothpick I m letting Jorge do it Okay Jorge you can do this one So maybe poke it here Poke it in there Now put your finger down Put your finger down where it is Slide it down until you feel the dirt Good Bring it over to Kendra So you can kinda see the dirt right there That s not even a centimeter You start here Okay That s not even a centimeter That s three millimeters So we round it down to zero centimeters Okay Zero Okay we re all done No we still have to Work on your bird s eye view picture in your notebook Up in the big can Oh no they re over there Okay The same bird s eye view or a different view That s what I was going to I m especially gonna draw in here because that s really interesting Really interesting Did Cody just go get something Yes he did Oh my gosh he s so nice So did you guys finish taking your data Yeah we re gonna do our bird s eye view Before you guys look at your bird s eye view I want you to share What d you guys find from your data So let s look at your data tables for a minute Okay It kind of made like a cave No right here Yeah So I see the difference right here In the depth of the stream channel the basic stream was actually more than the rushing river What was more Like in centimeters so one centimeter off So Alejandro s looking at the depth of the stream channel and the last time it was three centimeters deep and this time it was only two centimeters deep So last time it was actually deeper How about which one was wider The rushing river So the rushing river made a wider stream channel Yeah I think the reason why it was wider is because more water came in It basically didn t spend enough time going in it basically just went Yeah and it made it more curved inish and stuff Okay Jorge what d you notice I noticed that right here it made a little cave and I think something like water I think there was a little whirlpool there Yeah there was There were a bunch of whirlpools Yeah there were doubles There s one right here and here So I think it broke the water I saw one little whirlpool right there and another one over here I saw one here So the water was kinda doing some different things in some of these places Yeah I think it s cause it curves like that so the bubbles keep on spinning if the water s coming through Yeah so the water s So what about the delta The deposition How is this different than your first experiment Oh my gosh it was five centimeters bigger Five centimeters bigger What d you notice Jorge The biggest part was that it was only this part right here Okay Yeah that was the longest part that was part of it all So Cody I noticed that this time how deep was your delta Our delta which would be to get that soil Yeah Zero centimeters So does that mean there s no delta So how did you guys come up with zero Cause it was three millimeters so we had to round down Okay so you guys have your data And the length of the soil It was a lot wider wasn t it Yeah the length of the soil was like four centimeters bigger It was from the end right here and it continued down So you guys remember we re gonna take this data Someday are we gonna put more of that stuff in here Oh put more of the earth material in Yeah And see what it would be like if you added more material Okay maybe that would be a question we could investigate Maybe the delta would be thicker because there s not enough room for all of it You know why I m asking you that Because I think it would be deeper because right here it only makes little ones here but the other one would probably make it bigger because it has more space Okay So you think these channels might be bigger Yeah If there was more earth material What if we made an even bigger hole Oh so you re wondering if it was an even bigger flood what might happen Maybe that would be a hole like this big Yeah you guys are doing that thing that scientists do after they do an investigation they start asking more questions I wonder what if we tried this So you guys have got your data so we ll be ready to put this in the class data table right Find our averages probably on Thursday Right now you guys are going to be working on you want to make sure you get the runoff sample draw what that looks like today we ll see what it looks like when it settles out later and then you guys are going to work on your bird s eye view and think about where s the humus where s the gravel where s the clay so you can add that into the picture Hey guys I m gonna like Yeah I was thinking the same thing like rip this up Whoa there s the biggest Oh that s cool Ms Maher it made a big dip I m guessing that some water s still down there 
 Most friends have finished their first trials I wanted to talk real quick about what s happened on your first trial Who wants to share what happened on your first three trials And I want to know was it something that you predicted would happen Cody At first we kinda got a little it kind of got a little complicated Since you came around it fixed it a little Why was it complicated cause the rest of the group didn t see your experiment Why was it complicated Because it keep turning and the wax paper was What kept turning The car Your car kept turning Yeah and the wax paper kept coming off and turning it So it was a little complicated So after you got it fixed and after I helped you then what did you find out That it was kind of easy to do So did your measurement did that end up being what you predicted it was going to be When it closed did you think the car was going to travel that far or did you think it was gonna go a shorter distance We thought it was gonna I thought it was gonna go very far Because that s a little bit slicker Because that it s slippery Well I was listening to another group talk about something I think it was at Bhavana s group raise your hand if you re in Bhavana s group And really deep had really good observation Because they were thinking that it was gonna go a little bit farther too But you told me something about the surface that we were testing on I said the the wax paper was a little bit smooth and the carpet was a little bit rough So do you guys agree that the wax paper being smooth and the carpet that we re testing on being rough if you agree that that has anything to do with how far the car s going to travel give me a thumb s up I think that makes a difference Lucy why do you think it makes a difference The carpet there s a feel of bumps if you could feel it and the wax paper is slippery So that s how it makes the difference cause slippery kind of makes stuff fast like if they have wheels or something it makes stuff fast That s true So as we get ready for our next test you probably only will have time to do maybe one trial But I want you to predict now that you ve kind of explored the wax paper and you know how far the car will travel looking at your information your measurements I want you to talk with your group about how far you think the car will go on the bumpy surface And we re choosing to use the shelf liner today The black shelf liner in your tub Do you think the car s going to go farther or a shorter distance than what you measured on your first trial We may only get through one trial And that is okay Alright but I want you to talk about it with your groups first and then start So Lawson what are you gonna do first before you test Get in a group meeting and sit down and meet Yeah and talk about your predictions first That s what good scientists do They re always making really good predictions about what they ve observed Alright Go I m setting the timer I think it will go really bumpy well not really bumpy but a little bumpy And it might go just a little less than the smooth I think that it will go slower because the surface it s really bumpy and one time I went on this bumpy slide and I did not go down very quickly Don t worry about recording the information right now but we ll record in a little bit I think they re gonna go a little bit far I bet slower Hey you can t pick off of me I think that it s gonna go farther and faster I think it s gonna go a little bit farther and a little bit faster I think it s gonna go a little bit slower I think it s kind of gonna go since it s bumpy it s gonna slow it down I think it was gonna go farther Group meeting s over So you think it s gonna go faster than it did on the wax paper No I think it s going a little bit slower but still a little fast like medium So you don t think it s gonna change that much why do you think that Cause it doesn t feel too too bumpy It doesn t feel too too bumpy she s making a really good observation What do you think Jaylin My predict is when you put the car on it it s gonna kinda go medium it might go a little bit slower and a little bit fast and then when it gets to the carpet it s gonna go slower and then it s gonna turn It s gonna go a lot slower and then it s going to turn I think like that fast Okay Not too fast not as fast as the wax paper Go ahead and test but let s think about your setup here Before you move this let s look at your setup As the car rolls what would happen maybe if it stays in motion until it gets to that green rug What might happen It might get stopped Remember the car s going to continue to move until something makes it stop So what might you want to do with your ramp We might want it to be here so it will go straighter But it might bump into the black box It may well you know the rug is going to I don t mean there but I mean I know what we could do we could do it this way so it won t crash Well you could either move it over just a little bit so that it has nothing in its way Javier could you go get us some tape It may not even need tape it might cling to it without the tape Try it and see Let s try it without some Yeah it doesn t even need tape Who s the task manager here Me Look out he s doing the first test I think it should be Jaylin Okay Jaylin now do you test sideways we talked about this yesterday when you wouldn t agree And you guys talked about that if some friends tested sideways and some friends teted behind the ramp that it may make a difference Then you guys said you wanted to keep it the same Javier can you move out of the way You ready Now wait a minute wait a minute Cause I bet you probably got his on tape Jaylin show me how you did that again go get the car Watch what he did with his popsicle stick Cause I hadn t seen that before Do it just like you did the first time What did he do with his popsicle stick He flipped it down Do you think that makes a difference in your test if he flips it down or raises it up Why might it make a difference Olivia Because it might when you put it down you re putting it down fast and I bet it makes the car go a little bit faster And it gives it some force Did it give it more force So Jaylin is this surface the same as this surface Is this the same as this Yes I think Is this popsicle stick the same as this here No So if you test the car on this and this is that going to be the same as testing it on something bumpy No So what do you need to do with the popsicle stick Raise it up You might want to raise it up next time Alright Try it again I ll come back and see if you guys are ready One two and go Wow that was great Now let s start measuring Now we re gonna start measuring Okay Okay one two No Tessa s gotta do that One two three ready Oh my gosh we were right Our first prediction is one two three four five six seven eight It s eight Oh my gosh Why s it eight And ours keeps getting a mess up I predicted eight too see I predicted seven mostly We got eight cubes on this one Eight cubes really Before we clean up I would like for you to have a quick group meeting about what you learned about the different surfaces so far Quickly sit down with your group and have a quick group meeting I m gonna come around and be watching Quick quick quick It s almost time for us to go About what you learned What you learned today about the wax paper and the bumpy surface that you used the shelf liner What did you learn from what you tested I learned that the bumpy surface made it go that bumpy makes things go slower and that smooth makes things go faster How do you know that Because when we use the smooth it went further How far did it go It went about eight cubes No I think it actually went seven I don t know we didn t put the lines behind it 36 about further than this because it went 36 or so and this only went eight cubes So that makes it the point where bumpy is slower So 35 on the wax and only eight on the bumpy The shelf liner I think it was seven on the bumpy Big difference isn t it Is that what you predicted No I didn t predict eight I predicted 16 No I didn t predict on the bumpy but I predicted I predicted one and I got the right answer for it on smooth Alright Well you guys have two more trials to do so we ll see if your numbers are close when you use trial two and three Alright Go ahead and get cleaned up We already cleaned most of them first Well no you need to clean all your things up everything back in your tub You can go ahead and record your data but we re gonna get cleaned up Go ahead and get cleaned up Alright push the red button you can push the red button Mary come over here Tell us what you learned Okay Mary come over here I learned that different surfaces can make something different whatever you re testing make it go fast and slow Mary what did you learn I learned mostly the same thing except when we did that you know how this is less bumpy than the carpet It makes this go faster than the carpet which makes a difference Yeah Jaylin what did you learn I learned if you put the car on this it s gonna go a little bit faster If you put it on this it s gonna go a little bit almost fast And it s gonna stop and go slower and that s why it went right there Okay does anybody have anything else Javier what did you learn Well I learned that if it s smoother it s quicker But if it s a little bumpy it s slower That s it Alright everyone put your things in the bucket 
 Like compared to osteoblasts the osteoclasts to be more efficient and work harder than the osteoclasts therefore you re more than you are building so that ratio can cause brittle bones So what Okay right Yeah One s up one goes down Yeah if you re taking away more than you re putting back No I m sorry why don t osteo Cause there s a lack of estrogen and or testosterone that is triggering the osteoblasts to work We kind of hit on that a little I don t know I kinda did but I kinda didn t What causes osteoblasts to work That it Okay so when they re saying that the osteoclasts are working more what they re not saying more than they used to work they re saying more compared to the osteoblasts okay It s not like the osteoclasts have been activated and are elevating their activity They re just doing what they do It s just because the blast activity dropped which you guys got that the blast activity dropped Why did that blast activity drop Because there weren t enough hormones to trigger the action of osteoblasting Good Is everybody get that Cause see now the blast activity s what s really dropping And the clast activity keeps going like it normally goes but relative to one another you have more clast activity less blast activity and therefore you re losing bone Everybody got that idea Okay good you did a good job reasoning that out Okay you can keep going Matt Okay our next question kind of gets off of like the description of osteoblasts and it says How can osteoblasts or how can osteoporosis be prevented Brooke Well they recommend having like a good number a good amount of calcium intake a day about 1 000 1 500 milligrams you could do that something simple like that could prevent like osteoporosis in the long run All right I would also suggest regular exercise in order to kind of build up the bones with weight bearing exercise so that there s less there s more bone actually broken down Basically a healthy lifestyle and refraining from smoking and alcohol lots of other stuff and then bisphosphonate for extremely high risk Along with everything else there s a I went to the Food and Drug Administration you can have Zoledronic acid which can be injected every two years for like prevention along with the diet and exercise Anybody else have anything they d like to add I was going to say hormone replacement therapy then some other Nobody else Okay Now who s on to how is osteoporosis diagnosed Yeah I found the most current one is a form called Dual Energy X ray Reabsorption Test to test the bone density you get a score of either one or below means you re normal one to 2 5 is osteoporosis 2 5 and above it s just your bones are gonna break any time All right Anybody else There s just a bunch of ways that they measure the bone density so there s like a centimeter scanner and then a quantitative that s what they use cause it s like really hard to detect osteoporosis sometimes and not so you kinda need more ways to test Good You can also take a sample of your and analyze it to see if there s any signs of erosion or anything that ll lead to osteoporosis Okay what s that called Anybody know what that s called What is it Bioscan Good Before you even go to the doctor like it s really hard to diag like there s not really symptoms of it But some of the symptoms are like bone pain and tenderness and stuff like that and breaking bones with little or no trauma What do we call that when a bone breaks with little or no trauma What kind of fracture Traumatic Traumatic would be if it was kind of trauma Pathological good job yeah Pathological fracture that would be a pathological fracture if there s a disease under there like osteoporosis which has made it weak enough to break Good call So somebody mentioned the scanner Zach right You talked about that The abbreviated what did what was the full name of that scan again Dual Energy X ray Absorption Okay has anyone ever heard of a DEX scan DEXA scanner that s where the D E X comes from Dual Energy X ray DEXA scan and that s very common yeah Is that like what the guy from Pursuit of Happiness Yeah I don t know if you ever saw that movie I didn t Yeah the bone density scanner I didn t know if that was it Yeah okay so how did they what the general how they actually what bones do they look at in the scanner I think it was the wrist the hip and the spine those are the most common places for osteoporosis The lumbar part of your spine because that s the first to go Why What else is important to consider if you if you think about the type of bone being affected what type of bone being affected What type of bone I should remember Trabeculae Yeah so that s a spongy bone right So trabeculae of the spongy bone why would the lumbar vertebrae be particularly vulnerable now It s a spongy bone Yeah it s an irregular shaped bone but the body of the vertebrae is basically a cortex in and it s a spongy bone in there it s all trabeculae What was the other bones that you said Madhura Wrist and hip Okay so hip as in what do you mean by that do you think Robert Ilium Ilium It s all a spongy bone A spongy bone in the ilium good place to look for it But here s the thing what about the wrist How come think from a practical scenario how come the wrist Yeah Lexi I think it s cause you use it like so often that they is probably the most common because you use your wrist for like basically Do you use it a lot Another possible reason Yeah Kevin Because it s a lot of like small bones so they may be easier to break or like be more fragile Okay that s a possibility Mikey I would say cause it s easy to get to like it s pretty hard to take like and actually have your hip where they do like biopsies going in to your hip It s kinda hard to get like a good angle but like your wrist can there s not a lot of like skin or muscle covering it so they can like put it under a scanner and get a pretty good picture Okay thank you for that That s exactly why they use the wrist I mean the wrist bones when you think about em you know they re not weight bearing so they re probably not the best to evaluate for osteoporosis it would be better to evaluate weight bearing bones but they do have spongy bone in them they re little irregular shaped bones which have a cortex with some spongy bone So there is some material in there to evaluate but you don t have to disrobe you don t have to do anything you just put your arm in the machine and they can do what s called a screening a screening test Has anyone had a screening test for anything ever before Or thought of ever heard of screening tests being done for other things No Not familiar with the screening tests I think I ve had one Have you Yeah because if I had like it wasn t for bones though It could be for anything Like they were looking for appendicitis but they couldn t find it so they were doing other all these other kinds of tests I don t know if that Well a screening test it could be it could be a screening test Screening tests are basically more generalized testing not the most specific but meant just to give you a clue if something needs further evaluation okay So if you put your arm in the scanner and it was towards the low end it s not the best for making an end all you know quantitative diagnosis But it s a good for determining if we should go ahead and do a scan of the lumbar spine or ilium you see So that s why the arm So it s interesting that you brought that up that was really good cause it really helps us look at the whole Where is this occurring and Why do they use those specific bones Okay Matt anything else there Our next question we have already said how it s diagnosed we know what it is So how can we treat osteoporosis Well I said I found online that there were really no treatments like true treatments for osteoporosis It s more of trying to prevent it by getting enough calcium and all the other stuff we said before because you can t really treat it once it s gone Well that s funny I found something a little different there s a few medicines right now like talking about you ve seen all those commercials and weird stuff that actually do prevent it Now they re actually saying like helping you actually reabsorb the calcium that you ve lost from the bones But it s also something kind of funny I saw if the bones start to become more dense they also found that like around your jaw starts to deteriorate faster some reason actually get like sore throat So I was wondering if anyone try to reason that out Because I could not figure out why just your jaw starts losing calcium but your long bones start gaining it Are you saying that they re taking medication and then they re experiencing pain So that Yeah like the calcium to deteriorate But like your long bones it s like your limbs and everything start to become more dense Is your jaw a lot of is it one of those bones Yeah some but there isn t a whole lot in there there is some Is it a more compact bone Probably a more compact bone in your jaw there isn t a lot of cavity space or spongy bone space there Maybe that has something to do with that Even having a sore throat I don t know why that would affect it at all Maybe because it s a horrible medicine I don t know like the thyroid gland like this one or the parathyroid this is like calcium like bone absorption so maybe I don t know it s not working as efficiently so it s not getting the through to the jawbone Or maybe it s working too much or something Maybe since your jaw is losing calcium and it s kinda gaining like losing its calcium so it s probably starting the beginning phases of osteoporosis Your hyoid bone isn t your hyoid bone isn t it Sort of high It doesn t really touch any other bones but it s kinda in there So it s kinda in your throat so that could be like I don t know it s kinda unusual Just answer this one with the general area cause there s a lot of instances where you couldn t sit or lay down for like three hours after you took it because it would deteriorate your esophagus So I don t know there were a lot of really bad side effects just Well what I was wondering I kinda see like some doctors like just wanted you to be aware in order to treat it would be prevention would be the other side to treatment just go do like those lifestyle changes Instead of like thinking Oh I ll wait until these signs come up and have platelet scans and I ll take medicine Just to be proactive about it and have those lifestyle changes like not being a smoker and don t drink excessively and like have those good workout regimens so you prevent it rather than treat it Yeah seems like a disease that s either prevented or managed not so much treated but I thought I think someone mentioned this before but the bisphosphonates cause other people who get osteoporosis are people who take corticosteroids for like asthma like in your inhaler So it s something that inhibits bone breakdown so it doesn t sound like it treats it but it kind of manages it so you don t break bones Yeah did anyone request a name a name brand Fosamax Did we see that Yeah Did they tell you how it worked No actually No well Fosamax is like did you see something there Zach Yeah wasn t that the bisphosphonates bind to the hydrocapsin crystals in bone and inhibit osteo osteo something bone reabsorption So they re inhibiting which cells Osteoclasts Okay yeah so that s how Fosamax and those work They inhibit the osteoclasts so they re not building bone though You see the difference Yeah They re not really building the bone they re stopping the erosion it s a little different But if you have like dead bone or old bone that needs to be replaced wouldn t that just inhibit it just as much because there s still old calcium sitting in your leg that I don t know whenever there s waste in your body that doesn t get dealt with I mean like when you have an appendectomy and there s waste in your appendix that like it can kill you if there s like waste in your body So maybe that would just prolong the process of osteoporosis not so much as help it in the long run I m thinking cause any time you re keeping like something that s old in your body that s not good Like you eat something you have to like you have to digest it and I don t know Yeah it s a good thought process Good thought process So that s what Fosamax works that way So if we were gonna try and design something and our job is to design a drug that helps let s say someone who has osteoporosis let s assume they have it now What types of mechanisms in other words what types of things will we try and get a drug to do What would we want it to do You want it to like stimulate the osteoblasts like a little bit better And someone already mentioned this but they had like estrogen supplements like supposedly like help out with that Maybe stimulating more osteoblast ability Okay well go with that a little bit about the estrogen replacement Did anyone request that as a therapy Yeah Kevin And there s like these like it s like hormone therapy and we have like estrogen patches where you can take it as a pill So it adds estrogen to your body so it balances out your loss of estrogen and raises it Yeah there s like he was talking about the hormone replacement but I also read on Google Health that it s rarely used and it s not used twice with women I don t know if that has anything to do with it I can Google it I guess like if you use the treatment once Any ideas why Anybody find out why estrogen replacement they used to you know what They used to give estrogen like they give vitamins it used to be prevent osteoporosis by taking extra estrogen Seriously and it wasn t all that long ago how come it isn t get Because then your body stops producing its like natural estrogen so Good idea maybe Any other poss Nick any idea you can think of I don t know you re not producing enough So because you re not we should get more well how come have anybody heard of anything that s related to estrogen therapy bad things Facial hair growth Well testosterone can increase facial hair growth someone else over here Cancer Cancer and that s the problem they saw incidences of particularly breast cancer went up substantially and so that s why Artie they re saying that you know hormone replacement it s still being used It s rarely used Yeah but not like it used to be not like it used to be So if we could stimulate the osteoclasts to work properly or blasts to work properly then shouldn t you like have like some sort of treatment to like make the osteoclasts work as efficiently as the osteoblasts We would have like sort of a difference in their relationship Good idea But isn t that the job of the osteocytes to basically maintain the bone So shouldn t we find a way to like make sure that the osteocytes are maintaining the bone Because if the osteoblasts are going to do their job once they re stimulated But they have to be stimulated so show me if you re looking for a way to stimulate them more than make a more efficient solution at the osteocytes No that would be more like a genetic thing cause your osteocytes your DNA is like breaking down as you get older So it s like not it s like I don t know is it mutating When it gets older I don t know a lot about genetics but I know your DNA kinda breaks down as you get older and so that makes your cells not as efficient So it might be more of a DNA kinda thing Where you have to engineer that DNA wise to make your osteocytes work just as well when you re like 78 as when you re 12 So it might be in like that area but I don t know a lot about that so Yeah it s interesting where you can go with it All right You can take this because even Artie even you were saying something about hormones before with maybe why that treatment gave a sore throat What were you saying about that I don t know maybe it had to do with the parathyroid gland I don t know maybe it like produced too much I don t know the jaw bone and it reached the jawbone first and I thought that it had too much and like released all of it and went to the rest of the body So which hormone of the calcium related hormones would we wanna increase if we thought along those lines Maybe that s why your jaw s if you release a lot of that hormone then it s building your jaw up and when you re building bone you get growing pains Maybe it was like a growing pain thing in your jaw Maybe 
 Hello guys After all the hard work you ve put in on doing your presentations and your tri board and all the really cool stuff you ve done now we need to put it all together and see what you think about these energy sources that you ve done all this research for Okay So first off doing a little poll Which energy source do you like the best and think it would be the best one to use Solar energy Why It looks pretty cool and I don t know it seems like the most efficient way because the sun s always there and the sun won t run out That s the word whenever you re done using it You can sell it You can keep the energy from the sun from the morning and afternoon during the night You can sell it Okay so he thinks solar Who else Okay Go ahead I like the wind Oh so you can talk to him Because you want to be able to talk to each other right I liked the wind one because it stored up the battery And the battery whenever it wasn t windy and so it kind of was always there It didn t matter about the wind Yeah you can answer the question I also think that wind s the best one because not only can you store it and have energy for whenever there is no wind you can also make money off of that So maybe if you get it in enough homes you won t even have to have a job You can make money off that That s a very good point That s a very good point making money off of that energy source Which other ones did we say could make money Um the solar Solar can make money Well I like the wind Because it s like the sun is going to burn up one day but the wind is always going to be there And the only bad thing about it is that the birds are going to die but that s okay Okay well what are some pros and cons then So you just said birds would die if we use wind power okay Does that outweigh the benefit that you get from using wind power I think birds dying isn t that bad because you know we eat birds so I don t think it would be that bad if birds do die I mean I don t think a lot of birds die because of the wind solar energy Not as much as oil or any of that other stuff Yeah or like we eat birds The other one I like is the hydro one that James did because His was ridiculous That was nice So what part of it were you most impressed with Like not like the demonstration but it was a great demonstration but hydroelectric power in general what part of that Like how if you have a pond or something you can put it in there and then it will power up your whole house Do we need moving water Oh yeah you need moving water to have that You d have to have a stream but you could basically do it anywhere you have moving water And if you really wanted to spend some money there s also the pump storage plant from a high reservoir to a low reservoir So that one actually sounds pretty good So somebody want to defend theirs Rakif I don t really like mine because Which one did you do I did oil Natural Gas Oil and natural gas okay Why not Because mine isn t as abundant as the wind or as the solar energy so it s probably going to run out pretty soon Like oil natural gas and coal do run out They re not going to be as here as much as the wind or hydro or something like that Well there s a lot of dangers involved with using oil right Oil rigs pipelines lots of dangers involved right Oil prices can cause high gas prices That s true too Remember in your presentation you talk about some of the dangers What were those dangers and are those dangers any better or worse than some of the other dangers for the other energy sources For oil Yeah The pipelines can burst and they can kill marine life in the water if the oil gets out They could cause another oil spill Explosions But coal I know you re supposed to like stick up for your natural resource but I kind of think coal can be good but it s mostly bad because a lot of people s lives are getting killed because of all the gasses smells and being down there for so long And I think that s also very bad And the land it hurts the land and the environment Coal is a very dirty resource if you think about it All the coal dust it can cause a lot of lung problems So the miners that go down there they re risking their lives right Yeah Any of the other resources as dangerous as mining coal No Nuclear energy What Nuclear energy is the worst Okay what about nuclear energy How dangerous was that when you looked it up It s a six out of ten chance Of what happening It depends It costs way too much first of all to build it It is very expensive That s true It s got a lot of risks like if it gets into your water or if you breathe in the radiation I imagine it could It smells bad Okay does collecting oil use more energy than it provides Good question What do you mean by collecting oil Like if you have to have the process of going underground and drilling the oil does it use more energy than it provides No I don t think so Because in my presentation it said it produces like a widespread like a very large amount of energy And also that your wave and tidal power powers our system as you said in your presentation Oh good point Those two actually work together When you talk about the wave and tidal power that energy could be harnessed to run your offshore drilling So that s a very good thing as well It s a benefit of drilling Absolutely Are there different energies that do benefit each other Yes the solar energy and wind Because the wind energy is based off the sun because of how the sun waves come onto the Earth and then it turns this sun mill so it produces the turning of the mill so the sun and solar energy and wind energy The solar energy and the wind they actually work together because I ve seen some wind turbines that have solar energy panels on the top One then the other can go That s okay I think solar energy is a really good thing because for a lot of power plants like for times the condition of natural resources like wind even hydroelectric if there s a drought or something or not enough water flow you could always have the solar panels stuck on top of the plant or anywhere Right because we ve found that solar is pretty cost feasible right Yeah it s not that expensive And actually you won t have to pay an electrical bill if you get that If you were going to use solar panels to power a wind turbine or something you re better off just using the solar panel It would just cost more money to have to get the solar panels and the wind turbine or to have the solar panels power the turbine It doesn t power it It s just like another way to get energy at the same time that you re getting the wind When there s no wind there s not much of a wind That s what the battery s for Hmm interesting I have a question for solar power too For solar power how can I make aluminum more efficient in the future Well it doesn t use a lot of the gas so it doesn t affect the environment So it doesn t affect your breathing And you don t need solar panels like you don t need to turn stuff on during the day because the sun through the windows can give you light and then can store up for the night Okay I have a question What natural resource do you think will be the most used in the future Like 50 or so years from now Wind It was used like 3 000 years ago so if it was used 3 000 years ago I think it would be used 3 000 years in the future That s not necessarily true because it could get more worn out by the time 3000 years in the future comes The problem with the wind thing is it can be used in country like rural areas because in other areas you can t put a wind turbine in a normal neighborhood Because you can t can you put one You mean I could put one outside the school here Well it would give energy to the school and the rest of the houses that are near the school Well I d put it on top of the school because then there would be more wind higher up Right and we have to worry about spacing right Because we were saying wind power is built usually where On wind farms where you have a lot of flat land Because if you build in a mountainous region are you going to get a lot of the wind If it s high enough it ll probably be enough Then if you build your wind turbine high up on a mountain what is the chance of that wind turbine maybe getting struck by lightning or being damaged that way Yeah that could be a real problem because of the wind and the way it could be struck down Right that s very possible So when you think about one energy source is there really one energy source to go with Or do you have to take into consideration a lot of factors of where you live what s available Because again talking about building a hydroelectric plant we established you need running water Is there running water everywhere around the United States No No And what s the problem if you flood an area even if there is a running water what happens if you flood the area Well they have to decide Usually if it s going to be a major problem they will actually dig a separate reservoir for the river to flood instead of it coming up on the banks of the river and destroying homes and things That s mostly our United States rule But in China they really don t care So they flood three or four cities multiple towns fill up three gorges of water Wow That s just insane Because once you disrupt water flow you have a problem So again there are some pros and cons to these Okay we re going to take a second and we re going to try to rank the resources in terms of which one you guys think is the best one to possibly use So if you had to pick one that you wanted to go with whether there was running water think you have those things beside you don t limit yourself there but turn to your neighbor for a minute and discuss which one you think would be like 1 and 2 Because each one of you might have a different opinion Give each other a little bit of a reason why and we ll get back together in just a second Alright guys another 30 seconds Then we ll get back together Alright three two one Let s wrap up our conversations Alright How many people by show of hands went with one of the non renewable resources like coal oil or natural gas Cool So everybody picked a renewable resource as the way to go Alright Ryan I think it s either wind or solar power How many people agree Oh so wind or solar is the clear choice Jonah why The thing is I think solar would be first Because solar energy you can use almost anywhere pretty much But the wind if you live here you can t get it as easily because there s not as much wind So it would be a lot easier to have solar because you can use solar anywhere because the sun is shining pretty much everywhere We think solar too because the sun is always there even if it is winter or it s a little cloudy the sun is still there Yeah but what about at night time So Maddy what did we find out about solar At night time like a lot of people go to work during the day so no one s at their house using their lights and stuff So there s a battery that stores all the energy and then you can come home at night and you can still power your house You still get some light at night bouncing off the moon Dustin what do you think I was thinking that solar energy would be great because I was comparing it to if you want to charge your phone and you have it plugged in and while it s plugged in it s fully charged and you can still use it and it won t un charge because it s still plugged into the wall But if the power goes out at your house then it will stop charging and you ll have that much battery left So it s kind of like if you re out in the day and your house is charging while there s still sun So you re still getting energy and at night time when the sun is gone you ll have that energy saved in the battery of the solar thing Well it s the same thing with wind power You d still have that battery there Yeah Wind power would be Would solar power still work during a storm It depends how severe the storm is So you mean this is like built to last Yeah if it gets struck by lightning I don t think it would still work But you know when there are clouds outside during the day on a cloudy day you know the solar radiation is still getting through the clouds right So that solar panel would still be getting energy from the sun on a cloudy day just at night you would still have to use the battery that s been stored Just like with wind power There is wind power all day long all night long but sometimes it does die down at certain times so there s a battery too there as well Exactly I agree with solar power but I agree that it would be great for being on your houses and things but I don t see the purpose of a solar farm It takes up a lot of land Just the point to collect the sun I think it would be better putting it on a house or combining it with another power plant like wind power or something like that because And cost wise it would be probably expensive because it was 900 for just one of those panels And Miss Shonda said it would take about 12 just for one house That s basically about 10 800 For one house But we also think that solar panels blend in more than winter lines Just imagine random winter lines in your front yard Yeah but we saw pictures or a video of a solar powered house and most people don t like solar panels because it looks unattractive on the top of your house Same with the wind power wind turbines would look unattractive But you can still decorate them if you want You can t really do that with the wind power I mean solar power thing because it s mostly black That s a good thought So going forward thinking of an energy solution because as you guys get older energy is going to be something you have to worry about We ve seen the gas prices The gasoline prices for regular cars go up You ve seen the ethanol being developed Is it good to keep developing new technologies How many of you guys once you start driving think if you could do it or your parents could do it for you would drive a hybrid car I would Okay would you drive a hybrid car Yeah I would drive one because it s more in miles per gallon and with rechargeable cars you can charge your car instead of using gas and spending more money That s good Also the emissions from your gas 
 Consider what you read about organic lettuce and Rosie from Omnivore s Dilemma and from what you re reading do you feel it s worth the extra cost and effort to eat organic Yes So for some organics I believe it is worth it and others I don t Industrial organic I don t believe it s worth it because for the lettuce in the book Omnivore s Dilemma they said it takes about ten fossil fuel calories to make one calorie from lettuce and I don t believe that s energy efficient at all But other farms other industries or other organic farms like Polyface Farms they use all natural energy not a lot of fossil fuels go into it and I think it s more efficient So organic like that I believe is better but industrial organic I don t believe is better That s a good point I was wondering is somebody could expand on the difference between industrial organic and organic Phil if you want to pick someone Eli So normal organic food like what started the idea of organic food was completely different from organic food that you buy at Whole Foods nowadays Like what the people originally thought the concept of organic food thought of was like the local sustainable farm like Polyface Farms where it s completely energy efficient and they use all natural resources like grass and just stuff like that to feed their cows and other animals But industrial organic systems it s pretty much the same as normal industrial food system except they don t use antibiotics or pesticides to make their food They still have animal rights There s still animal cruelty and stuff inside the the factories and stuff like that Araceli I agree with Eli because when I read organic I thought organic was good But then basically it was the same thing Like the chickens they still got fed corn but they had an open door but they were so fat they couldn t go through Like why pay the extra money for something that s going to be exactly the same as the other thing I think it is worth buying organic food Because even though the animals are treated the same and even though it still wastes a lot of fossil fuel we save a lot of farmland from being put like pesticide and everything on it so we could have chemical free land And also we save our water system from being poisoned by the chemicals we use So it might cost a little bit more but it s worth it Matt In response to I guess Eli it s not exactly the same there are definitely the perks to the industrial organic system with the lack of chemicals and hormones But yes I can definitely agree that it s a very similar thing it doesn t solve all the problems with the industrial system I don t agree with what was just said that when you farm without pesticides it s better because in Omnivore s Dilemma even though they farm without pesticides they crowd the ground so much that it destroys the land So it s not necessarily better it just sounds better I just like Simone s point because I think that a lot of the problems are still there and even though it might be a little bit better without the pesticides I think it s still important to eat real organic food I think that would be the best Industrial organic is a step in the right direction but I don t think it s close enough to where we should be with our food system I agree with Molly that industrial organic foods on the face are both They re worth paying for because they re the food that we should be eating but in other ways they feed into other problems with pollution If you want the right type of food you have to create a food system that can sustain a country as large as the United States but still has healthy animals And animals that have evolved to eat only being fed that is at a cost low enough to feed everyone in the United States like we are fed now I was going to also ask a couple personal questions since I was talking to your mom about how does your eating habits change do you think now that you feel like you re more aware or She says that she always bought grass fed beef and I try to eat healthy but in the case of fast food of course I go and eat fast food But lately I ve been badgering her and asking her if she could get a grass fed steak I ve been waiting for that for a long time The corn fed steak that my dad gives me smells bad and it looks bad so Anyway There s nobody asking I don t think organic s really necessarily healthy for us because humans are still trying to figure out what vitamins we still need what essentials we still need Like people are still discovering that plants have certain essentials that we never knew we needed So how can we tell organic s good for us if we don t know what organic is different from what we get from normal food I thought Curt brought a good point up too which is the best organic is just straight from the farm to the buyers but it is a great point that Curt and Greg brings up which is that that way can t feed as much people as the industrial organic or just industrial food I completely agree with that It s implausible to try to make what they call beyond organic food at such a high amount because it really consumes a lot of land and a lot of energy We read in the Omnivore s Dilemma with the moving the chicken coops so much every day that s a lot of land for very little meat and honestly that would not be able to sustain the whole country Lisa So I kind of agree with what you re saying but it doesn t have to necessarily be a few big farms that are completely going organic If there s little farms all over the United States then meat can go to those people around there It might not happen all of a sudden but little by little people are going to learn that organic is better Whether it s more expensive or not it s healthier for us knowing that the animals When the animals are not fed on natural stuff that in turn is bad for us Ashley I agree with what everyone said and that the point that Paulina brought up about we re still trying to figure out what vitamins are what and what s good for us Because I feel like it s more better to spend even just a few more cents if organic food isn t that expensive and go to certain places A few more cents on the local home grown organic food because I used to buy meat from the What s it called The meat section The deli Deli yeah there you go And I used to buy meat there and I thought it was all fine you know whatever until I went to the doctor one day because I was getting really injured and she was like You re missing all these vitamins and she gave me all these vitamins to take And I didn t know that that was missing inside my food and then I go to the organic section of the supermarket and it s not even like vitamins that were missing in the meat it s vitamins that were missing in the drinks that can be found in organic food For example like the naked juice has these vitamins already included in there just because it s like naturally grown and organic So I was willing to spend the extra dollar for my health So I feel like if people realize how important it is for your health that scare will wake them up and they ll be able to spend the dollar Okay well I agree I think that it s worth the extra cost for organic because like in the book it said when we buy organic food we re voting with our forks and we re voting for the type of food we want And if we go organic then the producers will think that most of us want organic so they ll start growing more and selling more organic food so that it might become cheaper in the long run I personally don t really care Like if it s cheaper that s cool because if it has pesticides on it you can just wash it off And animal s rights are nice but they re going to be killed anyway It s like they re all going to die anyway They re going to die so Michael I like it And yeah I mean even though organic s good we still have a lot of cheap food that feeds a lot more people that have lower income So we might not be like the healthiest nation but at least we give an opportunity to feed every single person in the United States So I kind of like that They don t have to worry about paying high prices for food even though it s bad for my health And even if it is bad I could just exercise So I think it s a personal responsibility to watch what you eat So we should be open to that Even with the industrialized food system we re still not feeding everyone If you go to like the Appalachians and stuff like that you still have kids that are starving every day because their parents don t make enough money to buy even the cheap food So I think that it s not that we need to focus less on the cost of everything and just figure out a better way to produce food and grow it and to make sure that it gets where it needs to go I think we need to worry about cost later on and try and focus on a way to do that in the short term so that in the long term we can feed as many people as we need to Lisa I see how you brought up the Appalchians but my question to you is is it more important to worry about issues here where it effects us or would you find it more important to focus like worldwide Like you could focus on problems that people have outside but like wouldn t you focus on start here make sure that we have what we need first and then branch out I think that with that like with a lot of people who get stuff locally So if you re saying locally like are you talking like Chicago Don t you think it s better to start locally and then Like we get better locally and then we get better statewide and then we ll go on until everybody has enough money to do this or their food everyone can buy their food I think so but you also have to take into consideration that even if we do something in Illinois that doesn t guarantee that other states are going to adopt the same policies And I think if we focus on doing something for United States and worry less about the other countries even though politically it might not be the right thing to do worry less about the other countries at this time But I think we need to take a step back and focus on just fixing as much as we can on a whole and then going down into the smaller levels and seeing okay how can we make this better on a local level Chris I think that we can t really make it perfect like the way Polyface Farms is because of how the cities are laid out Because the cities are too big to have farms in reasonable reach of the people there So I think what we have to do is have this industrial organic which still is I mean a lot more worth it because it keeps the biodiversity in the soil and I read in the book they said something like that the size of the state of New Jersey was like a dead zone at the end of the Mississippi River and the Gulf from all the pesticides and fertilizers that flow down And that s problem that we should focus on Well I agree with Teresa that we should start only in the US because we can t just make a generalization that other countries are using corn and are eating unhealthy just as we are We only know that the US is eating unhealthy because according to Omnivore s Dilemma King Corn and Food Incorporated the problems are only occurring in the United States So if we want to solve this problem we should start from the origins because we started using corn massively creating problems and stuff not because of other countries Well maybe because we imported corn from Mexico and they dominated out other corn types so we started using corn But we should start focusing on more of what s the problem over here instead of other countries because we have to solve our own problems first before we become worried about other problems maybe Yeah I was going to say that it is worth it to spend the money in organic because even if it s just a little bit of farms here and there people seem to be willing to travel the extra mile just to get that healthy piece of food Like in Polyface Farms people came from hundreds of miles I think or 100 miles just to get their healthy chickens or the healthy food And with Jerry I wanted to say that Well nevermind Okay then So I remember Gabby said how we should be focusing on making as much food as possible for everyone in America and that s the issue we should be working on But that s really what the food industry does like making the most food possible They pretty much put everything else aside besides mass production They don t really care about animal rights or worker safety or anything like that They just put as much work as they can into making more food and like Gabby said people in America still can t afford this food that s cheaper than it s ever been in the past So it just shows that really we can not go back to just normal farms because there s no way just natural farms like Polyface could ever sustain a population as big as America Like we kind of dug ourselves into a hole Yeah Okay so what do you think we should do then If we ve dug ourselves If we ve dug ourselves into this hole even though if we re going to be producing less food that s better quality I agree that is better because then you re taking the animal rights into consideration the workers rights and everything But then either we have to figure out a way to change how people eat and so people are eating a bigger variety of food or somehow figure out a different way to be able to feed everyone Because at the end of the day either we re going to have a lot of people who die because we change this and we change it too fast and we re not ready to adapt to it or we can do it slowly and try and figure out ways so that everyone somehow survives Eli Okay well I think that we should really just follow the model of like France or some other country in Europe or something Because they have a way better People in France are so much healthier than people in America and they don t eat nearly as much food They still aren t starving most people in France aren t starving or anything So there are countries it s just not left them Okay I don t know if this makes sense but if they have like 20 000 chickens in one pen do they have to feed them corn Like what s wrong with mass production but making it a little healthier Why can t they just give them something else that s maybe not all corn maybe half corn or half corn to little corn And then metaphorically speaking this totally reminds me of Hitler and like how he took over all the people and made them work to death and everything and that s like what they re doing with the animals They re just working them to death and they have no rights or happiness whatsoever Deja I think the answer to your question is that most people just want money so they ll buy whatever s cheapest and pay low wages to people just so they can make a lot of money I think that s the answer to your question about why don t they just choose another food instead of corn I think it s because of money But also consider what about What about the industrial organic Doesn t that address this whole problem of how the chickens are fed Even though they re raised in coops They re still fed corn Molly Okay so I think that it s a really good idea that Matthew brought up a while ago that the industrial issue it can t really be solved by using beyond organic I think we ve moved on from that We can t really go back to beyond organic because we wouldn t be able to feed enough people And then just to Adam s point I don t think that we re not producing enough food I think the problem is that the people don t have enough money for the food So I think that producing more food wouldn t really help I was going to say everyone keeps talking about mass production and that view would feed everybody But if you think we actually waste a lot of food too That s actually important I think we saw a picture or something all of it gets thrown out every day or they have ads on it on TV If we re so worried about feeding everyone why don t we eat better ourselves and stop buying so much food we don t actually eat Well either whether you guys want to change it locally to outside or outside to inside I like the idea that you guys think about spreading the idea Whether it s taking France s ideas and taking it onto ourselves or just ourselves spreading it out Because so obnoxious they would go out to McDonald s my family and be like Do you know what that eats And then just start talking We re like Shut up don t tell me what it eats I m going to eat it And now my mom asks me she s like Is this good And then I read it I m like Yeah it has this and this and this And now she turns to me and like asks me should we buy this should we not So I think I have changed a little bit at least having been
