 so you can t count it out completely Hmm So we have three things going on here I hear exponential decay I hear an upside down parabola and I hear a negative sloping line Red why don t you chime in I haven t heard from you Are you going with decay Are you going with decreasing line You going with upside down parabola What had you guys decided We were going to go with decay but You were going to go with decay okay But I changed my mind because decay it keeps decreasing all the way But MySpace it got to a point where it stopped decreasing and it was like what Rosetta said So it stopped decreasing which is what you re saying and you re saying that s in agreement with Rosetta I have a serious issue with a line stopping Can somebody talk to me about that I have a serious issue with a line stopping or having some kind of decrease that then slows itself It s the end of the line Slows itself Colin I haven t heard from you I don t think it s linear because the linear is going to signify that at one point there are going to be no users or people on MySpace I agree with Elsie that it might be decay because it decreased but decay doesn t ever touch the X axis which would signify there are no users Ah And there will always be users Oooh what s somebody thing about that Really really really significant comment that was just made by Colin What do we think The fact that it s never going to how did you say it I said that the linear was going to at one point to hit zero and with decay it s never going to hit zero It s going to get really close but not touch it Jeffrey I agree with Colin Because if it was a negative line like a negative line right You re going to go past zero and you can t have a negative amount of users cause a line keeps on going forever Ok does exponential keep going forever No I mean yes Yes it does but because it s so small that it never touches the X axis but it keeps on going so it just never hits zero So if we all agree are we getting closer to agreeing that it s exponential decay Yes If we are agreeing it s exponential decay then what Jeffrey just said what does that mean for MySpace the company Will it go out of business no Based on what Jeffrey just said about an exponential decay at the end What does that mean for MySpace the company What do you know about MySpace the company at this moment It s still low It s still low but is it in existence Yes It is Do you know what s keeping it You know I think because you re always going to have that one user account Ok you might you might always have that one user There s something though that MySpace provides that other websites don t that s very easy to do that other sites don t have And this is what s keeping it from touching that X axis Do you know what it is Alicia Talk to us I can t hear you Music Yes Alicia who is in the band would obviously know this right Tell them what you do on MySpace Alicia Bands can make pages and they can upload their songs and you can listen to them Yeah you can upload your music on MySpace easier than any of the other sites Very good thank you for chiming in Alright let s shift gears from MySpace now let s talk Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter What do you think about the growth of Twitter Alright keywords Red start me off with keywords and then we ll bounce to Pink and around the room Give them your attention ladies and gentlemen Are you guys prepared and ready for Twitter Rush I m sorry rush Where show me It s missing something there What s your keyword Rush It s in the middle of the sentence In the third sentence Oh rush is that what you said Ok just speak up I m getting old I can t hear Growth continues steadily Okay anything else Yeah but it s at the tweets This the tweeted Yeah It goes with this Okay So what do you guys pick for the growth What function models Twitter s growth Exponential growth You think it s exponential growth as well Alright is there a team Pink you re up I disagree with that I think it s linear because it says that another keyword that they ve given is with 40 million in May that whole sentence right there Got it That s like a slope if you think about it With 40 million in May 2009 6 months later 60 million and then 80 million in May 2010 The slope it would be 20 million So it s linear It s going positive slope Hmm filling out those listening labs Pink just gave some hard core evidence Red do you have a comeback Or have they won you over You have a comeback Let s hear it Lenny what s your comeback This can not be because because it s going to get to a point where it s going to stop It s not like we re going to take it like Do you have a time machine Ok so let s leave Lenny I think exponential growth isn t going to stop and I think a line isn t going to stop right And I think that if we think about the future I think that s what Star is maybe trying to do is predict the future We don t really know But from the language here in your text the information you do know I think 40 million then is pretty concrete evidence of slope Do you agree yes Yes Anybody else want to chime in on this one that I haven t heard from Maybe from Elianna on Blue Bleaker I haven t heard from you Carlia yet What do you guys think How bout anything you want to add about Twitter Anything you want to add Greg go ahead Well what Lenny was saying I cannot beat and I agree with them That s it Ok thank you Any I agree with Star because as you mentioned what this does or hope is that they ll be able to Tweet via text messages And that s something that Facebook didn t offer So the more things that the more things that Twitter puts out there the other social networks is going to increase Ok so as Twitter grows you re saying the other networks might be slowed Who though is going to outperform it if it s a different type of graph Who is going to outperform Twitter for sure if Twitter is linear and the other one is a certain other graph we mentioned Facebook right Because Facebook is what Exponential Exponential Very good Ok So let s go now to AIM We re doing very well on time here AIM Who s going to start us off with AIM Alright Pink you can start us off Keywords and reasoning talk to me Some key words we worked was AOL lost their dominance Lost their dominance Okay Yep And then we put continuous fielding is growth today Okay And we said that it was quadratic equations because at one point it was really high but then as time went by it started decreasing but then it started getting more popular again Lately teenagers liked using it so it started going up again Ok Is there another keyword up here that would help anybody I think there s at least one more keyword that I haven t seen pointed up Elianna Is it comeback Comeback Where s comeback Beautiful Made a comeback and maybe even one more thing a little earlier Jermaine Thank you Sorry say that again Dominated Dominated very nice Jermaine So it started out dominating then had to make a comeback Does anybody want to add on to what Pink said about this being quadratic Which way Which way Would make it positive from earlier Positive what Talk to me about the equation now Quadratic is always going to Do quadratics always go up no go down too parabolic This parabola They always look like this no Think about inverses we learned through this year Raise your hand and let me know what you want to say Talk to me Do parabolas always open upwards Go ahead I just want to agree with them You agree that it s a parabola Yeah because in a parabola it says that it started off dominating but you re on top if you re dominating Then it said that it made a comeback That means at one point it would have to be decreasing and then to make a comeback they come back they come back up Beautiful Wanna add to that Go ahead I was just going to say the other end Alright so I just want to make sure I answered Purple s question in the back You asked which way Take a look at this This is what you re talking about Could the parabola be like this What would this mean if the parabola were down for the company If it was down then that means it s imaginary Right You re thinking of something about imaginary and it s not if it s down That has to do with a negative Right if there s a negative A coefficient Something else though What would this mean for the company s trend DeShawn Go ahead DeShawn They would have had a spiral at the bottom and then they would lift up And come back down Purple are you alright with that now You understand This would not have worked based on what DeShawn just said Here s my question for you on AOL Why isn t AOL an absolute value graph What starts high comes down and goes back up We did do absolute value functions right Turn and talk first and then you re going to tell me Write that question down somewhere I want to know why it s not an absolute value graph Oh yeah we did talk about these today if every five minutes they add ten members but every five minutes you re getting ten members then every five minutes you re gonna lose ten members so parabola is not possible Ok guys Bring it back I want to know why isn t Why didn t anybody say absolute value I m going to maybe put one over here and then I have one more really important question about these graphs for you and then we re in good shape Absolute value the reason I asked that is because that also starts high comes down low and goes back up I need some reasoning Let s change it around start with Gold and go around Go I don t think it s an absolute value graph even though it kind of follows the same kind of trend Because in the absolute value it s Y is equal to absolute value of X meaning that as time passed they would be losing and gaining a constant amount of people So like if you gained ten members every five minutes every five minutes you would be gaining ten members no matter what Every five minutes or when it goes down every five minutes you d be losing ten members Whereas a parabola that changes is not constant you can lose and gain power then they d be equal to join or don t join and you can t guarantee that you re going to gain that amount of members every time that amount of time passed So would it be fair to say it s too con 
 Two times two Aggregating rules smaller the denominator the bigger the fraction That don t work sometimes I know what you re thinking Six eighths okay One two three Hey look Four five six You know it s like division too Yeah that s Okay six eighths Versus what Six eighths versus three fourths Okay One two three four five six They re equal they re equal One two three They re equal I just did that They re equal Wait wait wait Wait That s what I said didn t you hear me say that I said if you do equivalent fraciton It is Divide by two Can we do it the easy way Nah cause this is basically the easy way I mean look Okay what if we didn t have tiles What if we didn t have Imagine if we didn t have tiles We d have paper and pen People back in the days they never had colorful They didn t have a pencil neither Oh yeah well you know what I m talking about They had clay and a pointy stick All right so where s the paper You guys want to use a pen or pencil I already got one So who wants to go first I ll go first I will Okay group members I can t really explain it You can t really explain it Then show me If I said four tenths and one third Okay so then how do you know that four tenths is bigger than one third looking at those fraction bars Because you add this and minus this It s It s one more than you need No because if you add one tenth to one third it s still going to be bigger Oh yeah All right but just looking at these two If I said one third and four tenths which one s bigger Four tenths Four tenths How do you know by looking at them Because Three four Like six Four tenths It s wider than one third Good it s wider than one third So now you guys just finished envelope number two and you guys have a couple questions to answer about envelope number two Who s turn is it to write Kayla Kayla s So why don t you read the group question for envelope number two Without using the fraction tiles how could you explain to someone why five twelfths is smaller than one half How could you explain it to them that five eighths is bigger than one half So what about that question How would you explain to someone that five twelfths is smaller than one half Just like we told you it s because twelve well twelve six is half of Six twelve Yeah six twelve Is half of a twelve And five is just a little bit smaller than six twelfths Okay very good What about what about five eighths is bigger than one half Israel what do you think How would you explain to someone why five eighths is bigger than one half Five eighths Yeah How could you explain to someone that five eighths is bigger than one half this question right here How would you explain to someone that five eighths is bigger than one half Because like more eighths one eighth is bigger than like one and like more it adds one half and one half So what number would eight as a denominator would be exactly one half Huh Which number which fraction with eight as the denominator would be equal to one half Four eighths Why do you say four eighths It s one half Can you show me with the fraction tiles Didn t you say not to use the fraction tiles I know but I want him to see that he s right that four eighths is equal to one half Okay guys okay good So then how would you explain to somebody why five eighths is bigger than one half It s one more one more you add to it You know that one eighths is equal to one half because they re like even numbers One eighth is equal to one half Four eighths four eighths That four eighths is equal to one half Okay All right guys keep on going Answer the questions for envelope number two and you guys can get started on envelope number three okay All right guys So you guys are on envelope number one Yeah We re done with envelope one we re just like answering this question You re doing what We re done with envelope one but we re answering it Okay so what is the question for envelope number one Anthony can you read it It is Someone in the class said that nine tenths was more than one third because the bigger the number the smaller the fraction Are they correct How would you explain to them where they were correct or incorrect So that s something that I ve heard a lot of people in the class say That the bigger the denominator the smaller the fraction Is that always true No No why Well because well the smaller the denominator that means like sometimes it could be like smaller smaller but sometimes I think like well actually You re doing good keep on going Well since like they re the whole Okay So like two pieces is two pieces one s shaving it all away and the other one is for So what does the denominator actually tell you about a fraction How many pieces the thing is cut into How many pieces it s cut into What does a numerator tell us about a fraction How many are shaded How many are shaded So then why right here why right here is nine tenths so much bigger or bigger than one third Because it s close to one whole Because it s close to one whole And how could you explain it with what we just talked about Savannah Because it s 10 is the denominator and three is the other so if there s 10 that means there s 10 of the small pieces and there s nine of the small of those pieces But there s nine of those pieces So how many of those pieces are shaded in Nine Good And what about for one third How many pieces would we shade in for one third One Good All right guys well keep on going Keep on going you guys are doing well Try to answer these questions and then start with envelope number two okay All right guys keep going All right so which envelope are you guys on right now One we re answering the questions You re answering the questions Yeah and now I m writing it down Four So what did you say What did you actually say for the second question Oh we like if you just I m not gonna say it exactly how she wrote it but we just we all agreed that if you keep Simplifying simplifying a fraction into its lowest terms and if it can t go any lower than like then it s one half or one third you ll know if if it s equivalent to one half Or you can find a common denominator You can find a common denominator and that will allow you to do what To see if they re both the same number To see if they re both the same number Yeah Pretty much the same number Okay why don t you guys start envelope number two then Open up envelope number two and see how you order these on the fraction line Let s try one half first First three fourths Wait Wait Yeah three fourths goes right there five eighths goes right here No no it ll go right here Wait It goes right here So why don t you guys use the fraction bars then to figure it out Because I know three fourths is half of one Three fourths is Half of wait No it would be more It s half of It would be more It would be right here Wait I want you I want you to explain that a little bit better for me You said that three fourths is half of one half I mean one fourth is half of one half OK one fourth is half of one half so what about three fourths then And three fourths would go right here because two fourths is equal to one half and three fourths would be in the middle between one whole and one half Right Also I was going to say that since we all know one half is right here three fourths would go in front of five eighths because one half of eight is four eighths and then that goes right here one half of fourths is two fourths and then that s not the same Three fourths of eight would be six eighths Good And how do you know that four over four goes right over here Cause it s one it s one whole Wait No that would be the same place as three fourths Wait yeah that would be the same place Why would it be the same place Because Oh it is You said it s an equivalent fraction can you explain what they said Why did they say that three fourths and six eighths are equivalent fractions Because they re the same Because because four times two is eight and three times two is six Okay And why does that make two fractions equivalent then Could you show me using fraction tiles I ll help you You can do this Four five six So how many of these do you need Six seven So what are you getting the six for I m getting eight six I already have six though Three fourths One two wait where are the fourths I believe right over oh Okay so show me show me using the fraction tiles why six eighths is the same as three fourths What do you notice We notice that they re the same length They re the same length And also we know that pretty much what Akosha said that if you multiply or if yeah if you multiply like if you multiply three times two and four times two it s six eighths because four times two is yeah four times two is eight and three times two is six Do you notice anything else about it here That two eighths equals one fourth Good Good All right guys let me see the rest of this Yeah How did you know that five twelfths was less than one half Go ahead Six is half of twelve and five twelfths is lower than six twelfths Okay Okay Why did you know that one third is inbetween one fifth and five twelfths Cause like we don t that the smaller the denominator the bigger it is and so one fourth would be in the middle So that would be on the other side of one fourth Okay All right guys keep on going You re doing good We ve over It s over So which one are you guys on now Four but we need help with one of the questions on three Five no we need help on number four Let s look at the question on number three that you guys are stuck on then We re not We just have a question on what it is A conjecture A conjecture So conjecture is something that we we ve talked about before in math If it says What conjecture it s kind of like what a hypothesis is in science 
 At the end of class I want you to be able to explain how to swing the bat faster so the ball will travel further Because the faster the bat goes the further the ball s gonna go And there s three things that we re going to do to make the bat swing faster Okay we re going to hold the bat at the end to make it longer We re gonna hold the end to make it longer A longer bat means a faster bat We re gonna use more body parts or muscle when we swing and we re gonna apply more time to our swing by stepping into the swing And we re learning to bat so that we can play more and more fun games in order to stay healthy Because there s lots of fun batting games you can play with your friends here at school and outside of school that will help you have a healthy heart and muscles And we re gonna do four different things today I m gonna ask you to talk to a partner I m gonna do a little experiment we re gonna play spotlight tag and then we re gonna have some personal practice And I ve created a little healthy a little helping worksheet for you that shows you what it looks like Now all these things will help you know and help you be able to explain how to swing the bat faster I want you to turn to a partner and tell them as many things of as many games that you can that use swinging a bat or an impement Go ahead Hey everybody let me get your attention If I pull your stick I want you to tell us a game or an activity that you can do that requires using a bat or an implement to hit a ball or something We re green No we re red Jeremiah where s Jeremiah Yes Softball Softball very good Raquel where s Raquel What Raquel Game or something you can play Do we use a bat to play soccer No No How about Stephanie Baseball Who said golf what about golf What about ping pong Do you know what ping pong is Yeah So all of these activities are things that we can play once we learn how to swing a bat Now we re gonna go around the blue house and you re gonna sit on the red dot until I say go and I m gonna do a little experiment to show you how these things can make the ball go further I would like you to walk please be careful Go Okay thank you for sitting Now over there I said the longer the bat the faster it goes The faster the bat the further the ball goes So I m gonna show you what I mean Is this a very long bat No No so I m gonna swing and see how far it goes Did it go very far No Now I m gonna make that longer Who thinks it s gonna go further Let s see if it goes further It went a little bit further huh Yes Now by holding the bat at the end it ll make it longer and it ll go further Now another way we make the bat go faster is by using more body parts and muscles So I m only gonna use a couple muscles here to swing the bat You think this will this go very far Yeah Yeah Okay let s see No I didn t use a lot of muscle Now I m gonna use lots of muscles on this step and I m gonna twist see how far it goes Do it again do a lot of muscle Anyone know of any other way we can make the bat go faster Hit from the bottom I had it written over there Does anyone else remember I want to make my bat longer I want to use lots of muscles and Alex That s how we use lots of muscles I want to swing the bat for as long as I can in order to generate speed Now if I start my bat right here and I swing it do I have lots of time to hit the ball No Do you think it ll go far Let s see what happens Now if I start way back here do you think I ll have more time Yeah You think it ll go further Yeah All right let s see So raise your hand if you want to hit the ball far Hitting the ball far will help you be successful and if you re successful you re going to have a good time But today we re going to learn different ways to hit the ball further by making our bat go fast Don t swing please tell me It makes the bat go faster Why does the bat go faster The bat goes faster the ball goes faster But what makes the bat go faster because it s short or long Long Longer bat means faster Okay rotate Rotate Dominant hand on top Step twist We re practicing what grip is the best How d that one go Fernanda what grip are you using Mr Holden can I go to the bathroom Hurry Excellent twisting Derek excellent twisting What number are you going to read it Try this one hold your bat with your hands apart Put your left hand on top I mean your right hand on the top Left hand at the bottom Spread your hands apart like this Now try it again How did that go Is that one good You think so Now hold it at the end see what happens It s right here Now hold your hands put your right hand on the top Right hand on the top your right hand on top All right Fernanda Big step let s see it Big step twist your whole body Get your bat back there you go Try it again Did the ball go further that time Okay sit behind your little cone and answer the question on your card Alright now read it out loud for me Which grip do you think makes the bat swing fastest Holding it at the end Remember when we talked about how long the bat is A longer bat can travel faster or slower Faster so when you hold it at the end it makes it longer and then you can swing it faster and then the ball goes further Is that what happened Yeah All right rotate Alright are you going to twist or not twist Back foot step Put your weight on your front foot Alright so pretend your feet are stuck in mud so you can t move them So we ve been learning all the different ways we can make the bat go faster so that we can hit the ball far because when we hit the ball far our game and when we re batting is more enjoyable We ve practiced we ve talked about and we ve discussed three different ways to make the bat go faster so that the ball will travel further When we re batting okay I have a sentence frame for you it says I can blank to make the bat go faster so the ball will go further Okay you re in your batting team groups right now When I say go I want you to use this sentence frame and discuss the three different ways you can make the bat go faster so the ball will travel further And then I m gonna pull our sticks and you ll get to share with the entire class how you think you can make the bat go faster So now is your time to use all of the intelligence and brains of your group to figure out your three answers Are there any questions No Okay I m gonna give you about two minutes Use the sentence frame discuss with your group Go ahead Alright how is your group doing Jesse you getting to share I might pick your stick Talk with Alex What are we coming up with Jeremiah How are we gonna make the bat go faster Do you remember Okay how about Alex Why do we twist Alex Alex why do we twist Alex sit up please When we twist we use more what Muscles What color were we Black or green Red Oh we were red Okay second grade eyes on me please Sit down on a number You ve had a nice opportunity to talk with your group to figure out the three ways we can make the bat go faster If I pick your name please stand up speak nice and loud and use the sentence frame and tell us one way we can make the bat go faster Let s see here Jonathan All right Jonathan stand up buddy Jonathan use the sentence frame I can I can hold the bat at the end to make the bat go faster so the ball will go further Good answer give him a round of applause When we have a longer bat it generates more speed and more speed with the bat makes the ball go further Now there are two other ways you can make the bat go faster 
 Are you gonna have any angles in there that add to 90 No so you won t have any complementary to worry about Is that supplementary though You will have supplementary Right You re not gonna have to worry about the outside You re just gonna look at your inside When you measure your angles you ll be able to see supplementary Yeah Then kinda go back to those parallel lines cut by a transversal rules to explain why We re supposed to draw a line Well I want you to see what s congruent sides Now you dont have to measure all your sides because have these so you ve got the same colors so they re all the same You re don t have to do angles Kinda figure out OK So they re all 90 degrees One of yours looks 90 So you know they re 90s So you got for the outside of your figure you got some a little bit easier work Yeah OK so you need to explain why things are 90 and what are congruent And then you re gonna get a lot more new stuff when you redraw and draw your diagonals in there Then you ll actually have to measure your diagonals and your angles So you know a lot about a square to start with Yeah the equal sides have to be congruent and certain sides so write that Then measure those angles and segments and see if you can t find some more rules that go with a square Oh OK So yes your first set of rules for the first page from here you know a lot You know that any point and what they are You know you have equal sides Then you don t have to measure these sides because you used the same color So you can explain it using the colors So you got a lot you know from the first part But then when you draw your diagonals here you re gonna have to measure your pieces See what happens to these angles See what happens to these diagonals And then see if you can t come up with some rules You re main part here you know a lot But now when we do this this will some of the new OK Square is the last one that we teach So you will be the last group up there today Right we re trying to get these rules today You can kinda build upon them so when you hear what these other groups are doing when you get up there Yeah There s just three of you OK How you doing Good What do you notice about some of these Corresponding is what I got here down here These are supplementary Supplementary because they re what type of angles Help him respond Well there are options focus on one If we were to look at If I was continuing these lines here they re gonna be same side interior Obviously yes so they re not quite supplementary So you might need to go back and do it again Sammy knows they need to be supplementary Same side interior Somehow your measurements didn t get there So go back and try to remeasure You realize you wrote the error That s good so you re using some of that previous knowledge and realizing your error Yeah so you need what we did on that worksheet the other day When you measured between 110 and 120 you read the wrong way You read 122 when it s going this way it s 118 So what you did is you read this way when you re going this way You said 122 when it s between 120 and 110 At least your teammates knew that we needed supplementary and worked it You said it was only off by one degree Any amount Then again to then explain your rules now what s congruent what s supplementary and then explain why like you were saying same side interior that s what you ll have Yes Do you have Chester Marlin Yes I do Please send him to the office OK What you did was perfect Because they re same side interior So you would say this Would you say equal angle one and angle four That d be fine because you can go ahead and when you re teaching it you can label those angles and that would be a really good way to do it So it s like angle one and angle four are same side interior Same side interior so that has to equal 180 OK bisectors are gonna come when you cut diagonals in there Your second page when you redraw the figure You re gonna draw the diagonals you re gonna see your diagonals cut each other you re gonna see if your diagonals cut your angles in half I ll be to Ashley then at Brandon s group in just a minute So make sure your congruent sides You don t have to measure your sides if you use your colors you can use colors to explain it So yeah you re exactly on the right track Here we re just gonna draw the same figure draw those diagonals in there and then we got a little bit some more things You might see bisectors you might not Some figures you do and some you don t All right OK it s up to you I love the way you put your letters there So you re getting really good with your letters You can say Since you only have one angle at each letter you can say angle J or angle H however you want to do that Could we just put supplementary and draw a little diagonal like that That d be fine Actually do all these and you ve got your congruent and your angles then you re gonna redraw the same thing over here put your diagonals in and measure again When you put diagonals in you might see some that bisect the angles or bisect segments You might not but that s what you re looking for So this is gonna be Well the diagonals We re not gonna draw one of them Oh we re not No we re just gonna look at our diagonals Otherwise you re breaking it into two other figures And that s a possibility but you don t have to I love the way that you ve lettered it here You re using those correct terms that ll be really good as you go up there All right Brandon What all did we mess up so far Let s see Well it s a four sided figure What should a four sided figure add up to 360 360 Does it No it s a little more than 360 So you might need to change things a little bit to remeasure it and one of your rules could be you know that they have to add to 360 There s some that I see really right away that s good It s like 370 OK so you re gonna try to make it work You know you need to make it work You know it s gotta be 360 so measure it a little bit better Can we just add one here and add two there Well go ahead and look to see what your actual angles are But one good thing you see you see that these angles are the same which is something you re supposed to come up with which is good Now if I was giving this when you re up there explaining it you need a way to explain and I know you said that the two obtuse angles are congruent and in your picture that s good But sometimes let s think for a minute If I gave you Write them out Yeah it may always be the obtuse angle So here yeah that s what I was thinking If you were to do it this way the angles that are congruent aren t necessarily the obtuse ones So what you ve found is good but in your picture it is the obtuse ones but if you can see as you move that it doesn t have to be the obtuse ones Let s look at a way we can describe You re saying that these two angles are congruent which is correct so instead of saying obtuse how can I explain that these two and not those two What s the difference between these two angles and those two angles They re 45 degrees Well it didn t have to be It could be 45 it looks 45 if I was to do this it s not It s the short side s angles It s where your short sides meet your long sides So the angles with the non congruent sides Or the short sides meet the long angles that would be perfect That would be a little better to explain it And even when you re up there explaining a good thing to do would be to move your figure to show how it didn t have to be And normally it s the bigger angles but it doesn t have to be Draw diagonals That s right and you re gonna look for all the angles again When you draw your diagonals a lot of times you re gonna see bisectors like segments might bisect each other they might bisect angles they might or they might not So that s what you re looking for when you do that And then you re gonna kind of come up to We just draw them like this Just like that that s right Then you ll measure all of those angles and all of those segments We won t be able to use the color to show congruent when we draw the diagonals on the inside because you won t have a piece that matches correctly for your diagonals so you ll actually have to measure that part with a ruler But again you re not as much concerned with the measurement as bisecting it or something else So that s what you ll do All right I ll be right back Yes So are we supposed to do this You don t need the angles that are out there I mean you could but it s not necessary What should of course our figure add up to The angles inside Uh huh 360 360 So make sure yours do What if they don t So I think if I was to look at your measurements here I know what I did I messed up I wrote these Good perfect that s what I was gonna get to you read the wrong one and didn t notice All right I ll be right back How are you doing So you want to make some general rules So the top and the bottom sides have to be parallel I wouldn t really want to use the words top and bottom because what if you turn it this way Yeah well A and B sides Yeah so you re gonna do that So you ve got your pieces What do you notice about your angles You ve got the angles that are equal but what if I was looking for supplementary Do you have any supplementary angles A and D A and D so you say A and D are supplementary what makes them supplementary What rule do we already know that was why they re supplementary They add up to 180 Right they add up to 180 but Are they same side interior angles Same side interior angles So you can say they re 180 because they re same side interior angles Then what you re gonna do you re gonna go to this page you re gonna draw your figure again but you ve got to draw your diagonals and measure the things When you draw the diagonals what you re really looking for is to see is there anything that cuts in half Do you bisect any angles or bisect any segments Some figures do some figures don t But that s what you re looking for So you re gonna redraw it draw your diagonals then measure you ll have more angles to measure You re actually gonna have to measure your segments because your little angle legs won t match your diagonals correctly You re gonna have to actually do the measurements and see See if the segments are bisected see if the angles are bisected That s kind of what you re gonna come up with It may be it may not be Some of the figures do and some don t OK I think I understand that We draw from angles to angles Yeah from vertex to vertex that s right So make an X in the middle All right you re good Yes I think we have about everything and then I think we have the other vertex Angle bisectors they bisect the angle number five All the triangles are isosceles Wow that s good I didn t think you d get that I m impressed He did it Good job And then diagonals make a perpendicular Perfect what I m gonna do is I m gonna give you another sheet make a bigger square 
 No I want you to swing the eighth notes Okay We re going to swing the eighth notes So remember when you swing you just make the first note longer than the second note So go like this Don t be stuck at the tip of your bells Here we go One a two a three and go Every single person here please make sure you re playing F natural Try it again Here we go One two and go Okay Now when you guys improvise you ve got to improvise off of this D dorian scale Okay So watch this If I was soloing and I was you know playing along with the music and I played this All I did was play the D dorian scale going up and down That s all it was It sounded a little fancy didn t it It really wasn t Did it sound difficult Yes It really wasn t I just did this like really changing the rhythm That s basically all I did Okay So it s really not that difficult I m gonna play some rhythms I want you guys to echo it Please sit up Thank you Nice and tall I m gonna play one measure and you re going to repeat exactly what I play We re playing this one on open D Only on open D Great now I m going to do two measures Okay Two measures and you ve got to echo it back to me This is still open D Here we go Wait for it I ll tell you when to go Excellent Okay it goes like this I m going to change it And go There it is Okay It s just four notes in the second measure So try it again And go Do this for me And go Try this I m playing D and F So the higher pitch that you hear is F natural So play this for me Great Fantastic I m only going to add one more note You want to play D F and G Okay With the exception of basses So do an open G okay So D F and G are your three notes All right get in playing position Okay So basically that s improvising I m giving you a lot of ideas for improvising Okay And you will only use three notes when you improvise D F and G You don t have to use all three but those are your only musical choices as far as notes When you improvise there are certain rules to improvising You can t just play any note because if you play the wrong note it will not be the right choice Okay So we don t want to play the wrong note So please make sure that you only play D F and G Do you see that tune that s on whatever page that s on for you guys There should be a page that s got solos at the top and then it has solo two and solo one to the side and then tune You ll pick the third one with the tune Do you guys see it Yeah Okay Make sure you re on the correct side I ll play the tune for you so you can hear how it sounds and then I m going to have you guys play it Okay Listen to my tempo Are you guys following along Okay Play it for me Here we go Watch your rests One two and go Much better Now Good Now play it again One two and go Good I want you to play it one more time I m going to play the piano with you though All right Here we go Great Now I m going to solo for you guys and I want to show you how you can do this Okay A couple things that I did in there All I did was play a dorian scale up and down and swung my eighth note That s all I did It sounds really difficult didn t it Yeah It was like whoa No I m just going I can make it sound fancy and make it sound really difficult You can do it too Okay So we re going to go around the room Each person is going to solo Okay Whatever musical idea you come up with Remember your notes are D F and G You got it D F and G Whatever rhythm you want to play within the rhythms I gave you So don t Okay Here we go Here s how we re going to do it We re going to start with maybe two measures We re going to start with Tessa and go around Maybe after Helen Then we go with Tallulah Priscilla listen carefully After Tallulah we re going to go around this way After Jada we re going to start with Sammy and we re going to end with Zoey Okay We re all going to start with two 
 But you re putting children in your sweatshops How are you gonna get more money How are you gonna finance the country still Both of you need to listen to Cambodia Because Cambodia I am awesome Cambodia is awesome What are you doing to fix this Well for the money problem I m not really sure but you can get loans for other wealthier countries and then as you re getting better pay em off and then for and then for child labor you make a law that kids have to go to school and learn so that way they can get better skills and stuff And then put their after that works and everything to age laws I m the only one with an answer I have no child labor whatsoever Whoa whoa whoa I thought we discussed that you do have child labor but Well we do have some child labor but it s more the grits going in and making your child choose the forms to get hired So what do I win as the only one with an answer How did you pull your country off child labor You need to be giving them suggestions and ideas OK what can we do what can we do to crack You told us some solutions the other day Right so that s why you guys are supposed to be discussing now OK China do you wanna go ahead and So China you know how to get rid of all your child labor in your country You have a plan you have your whole plan in place Pretty much What s the first step what s the second step what s the third step what you re gonna do Yeah you wanna hear it I do First we ll make it illegal for children to work all day And the other half they go to school OK but wait a minute but don t your parents your families depend on that income that those children are bringing in Yes but if they work half the day while they re at school they still earn money But then they re losing half their income But then on weekends they can But they work weekends right now anyway Maybe we could establish a minimum wage over there Oh Now there s an idea What They could establish a minimum wage Yeah OK so you re gonna establish a minimum wage Yes and going to school to get a education helps them get better jobs when they re employed so they can get more money with better jobs so then they don t have that issue So what are you going to do in the process because you are gonna have to have children leaving the workforce just starting to get their education that takes several years for that generation to become educated what are you gonna do in that gap You still have to have a plan for those 12 13 14 years What about programs like those they used in like the de de depression that s the word OK that s what you guys should be discussing those are some of the things you should be coming up with They could start Keep in mind that needs money But then they would get loans from wealthier countries and as they re getting stronger and more OK take those ideas and work with them You guys are on the right track you re rolling with it So put that down establish a minimum wage OK Cameroon what was your solution Say the children stop working and the adults get it well it would be taking money away from the family Not other than the ones we came up with on Friday like have countries send money What about that like education like half school half work campaign it s like where where you re working part of your wages pay for your school and then you take the rest home And then like with me in my country already go to school So I guess all those times you mentioned But they only go for like six years from age 7 to Wait I don t know OK anyway that would help with like the country being France for the win Like the same thing but more Coffee OK if it was our major export it would get rid of poverty and many things Where s your country Where s your country OK never mind I was thinking you move at the same time but no If we work together with the coffee export like If we combine the export If we produce Well I meant like from whatever we sell we could try to hawk them together to help each other create better education Y all can combine your profits in coffee and begin making schools You have an industry that brings in a lot of potential money correct Right OK but remember you don t sell that product to the customers you re selling it to the businesses But that s bringing money in to your businesses It s the businesses that hire people and you create jobs So you need to figure out a way to take that industry that product and expand it so that it s bringing more money and bringing more jobs Which is gonna help because then you ll have adults you have 45 income We can combine it so that children who are of suitable ages can have jobs What would be a suitable age Eighteen Eighteen This mine is not an easy job is it It s hard work it s dangerous down there To have twelve year old kids down there You re still United Nations correct Is that gonna be agreeable to you You can create laws that forbid businesses from running her product So whatever she suggests to you you have to make sure that that s OK because remember you can tell her sorry it s not gonna happen Yup Which means you have more money going out than coming in correct So you need to figure out a way to change that You need some money coming in So what are the strengths your country has That you could potentially build and grow when she s got the diamonds I saw a pendant on the internet and it had like a string and there was like three fat fond doves on one string OK that s a factory purchase but what you could make I don t know That s what you need to know What does your economy depend on I mean you have to produce something It says making foreign OK I have a question what is a foreign exchange It s Nestea s largest exporter so you are exporting product So you do have some products that you re exporting Oh you re Taiwan You have a lot of textile factories you make clothing Your country s the one that s got all the sweatshops So that s what you need you need to build You should be suggesting some ideas to her Giving her ideas say OK you ve got a product to export but you need to do this and you need to do this and you need to do this They need to find some way to pay Exactly Wait I have a question for the United Nations OK how you said setting up your steps well if there s not a lot of educated people then how are they gonna find teachers Well if you said exactly Well first You could hire people from Different countries Maybe if you like hired somebody from like the US that s educated they could do administry of helping like educating adults and then they re educated They re doing the same thing that kids are they ve been in child labor and stuff plus when they got older they re just working again so they haven t really changed anything so to change that I guess maybe if you got other countries to come and educate them and then after that they could the educate the children So you couldn t get the kids out of the work so fast because you still have to educate all the teachers And the kids have no where to go Well I say since they re already adults that we kinda like work on the children more with education I guess because the children are small So before you even take the kids out of these places You have to get all the people and you have to So you have to figure out some like you re gonna have to figure out a timespan of how long that s gonna take It s basically you re taking elementary schools you like I mean they could set up a scholarship That way they could go from like And even your country could help pay help pay the people that are teaching Because in the long run you re gaining that money s gonna be spent The population is gonna face it they get the cotton for the clothes and get the food for their teachers and all that If we can help poverty To help pay for some schools Yes that would be amazing We could also have all the adults work the rest of their life like insanely or something I m the government I can say hey there s laws now that a kid s gotta go to school and he can t work so many days of work so many hours of work 
 How s everybody today Good Good Okay we are gonna work our bodies real hard today and we are gonna play a game called Wellness Uno How many people raise your hand if you ve ever played Uno Absolutely put your hands down Do you know that there are four colors in Uno Who knows what one color is Alexis what is it Blue What s another one Um red Red What s another one Nate Yellow Yellow Green Green absolutely Okay we ve got the Uno cards spread all around the circle here first graders And what we re gonna do is in just a minute you re gonna come up here and you re gonna get an Uno card I might pick this one right here this one is a Green four Green four Okay I look at it and then I put it right back If you notice the gym is set up in four different color zones Point to where the green color zone is Boom you got a green cone over there stay right there watch Ms Miller The green color zone is the muscular strength and muscular endurance station So if this is you have choices when you come over here first graders Choice number one you can get a rope and you can swing how many times Four Four Swing four times Which rope would be easier to swing on Alexis The knot one The knot one cause you can hang on to it better that s right So you can swing or can come over here and you can do those bicep curls that we ve been working on in muscular strength and endurance Stand right here to the wall and do that four times nice and what Slow Slow absolutely And here s your last choice at the muscular strength and endurance station if I got what was my number again Four Four Look there s four hula hoops on the rock wall You would start here and you would go through hula hoop one then hula hoop Two three four What happens if I had a green two how many hula hoops would I go through Paige How many would I go through Two Just two Okay so it s either four whatever number that is that s the number of hula hoops you go through Then I come back over here and I pick another card Hmm did I pick this one oh I just picked that one Let s pick this one what color s that Yellow three Yellow three Point to the yellow color zone Absolutely the yellow color zone is the cardiorespiratory zone and guess what you have to do here first grade There is a cone here and it says yellow Add zero What was my number Three Three and if I add a zero to that what does that make that number Thirty Thirty That s what we re gonna have to do I have my choice I have to do thirty of something over here Here are my choices I m gonna do thirty oh gonna work my heart thirty step boxes Or if I don t wanna do that I can do the ball on the stick How many times Thirty Thirty And if I m really good and if I really wanna try I can get a jump rope right there on the wall and I can try jump roping thirty times Now I m gonna run back here and I m gonna get another card and I m gonna get this one right here This one is a Red six Uh oh Red nine Red nine it s a red nine see where that line is under there so that means it s a nine Red nine point to the red color zone Woo you guys are so smart I come over here to the red color zone and look what does the red color zone have on it Times two Times two so what was my number Nine Nine What s nine times two Say it Alexis Eleven Not eleven this is hard What s nine plus nine What is it Nathan Do you know What is it Ethan 18 It s 18 So we re gonna do 18 Ms Miller will help you with the math if you don t know so we re gonna times that one by two and here are my choices I m gonna come over here and I m gonna get a paddle and I m gonna this is a hand eye I m gonna use my hands and my eyes I m gonna put my safety strap on and I m gonna do how many of these 6 9 18 18 that s right 18 And first grade how can I challenge myself at this station If I wanted to make this station harder for myself how would I do that Courtney Um use your left hand Use your other hand Ms Miller is left handed so if I use my left hand I would use my right hand So if you want to challenge yourself you d use your other hand so you re gonna do that how many times 18 18 okay So that s you could either do that at this station or I love these these are the I call them the ice cream cones Look you throw that ball and you re gonna catch that ball Do it again that s how many Two Two And you re gonna do that all the way til you get to whatever number you have at that station That was using your hands and your eyes watching that ball right into that cup And now I m gonna come over here and I m gonna get one more and oh I just grabbed that one let s see what s oh what s this number Blue Blue six Where s the blue color zone point where s the blue color zone over there Hey the blue color zone is balancing watch Ms Miller over here You re gonna come over here and if you don t wanna touch the gym floor Ethan sit down for me you re gonna step on the stepping stones and you can either step on the sides of the ladder or if you wanna make it harder for yourself you can step on these rungs and balance all the way to the bleachers step up come across and then we re gonna go on this balance beam Hey first graders when we re balancing do we go fast or slow Slow Slow we go slow we don t wanna go fast at this station because we wanna have good balance and we don t wanna fall We wanna make sure we don t touch the gym floor So that s wait what was my number again I forgot Nine It was a nine red how many times would I go then Nine Nine times around there Or your choice is the hippity hops Now Ms Miller s a little big for this hippity hop but you kinda get the idea you just use the boing hop hop to the black line it s one and then back is how many Two So I would do that nine times Okay those are your choices so there s four stations yellow red excuse me green and blue Turn around and face Ms Miller now I wanna talk to you about something really quick it s something called personal integrity You ready back there Ethan Everybody sit on your bottoms sit on your bottoms Personal integrity and first does anybody know what personal integrity is do you think you know Maddie when you hear that what do you think that means Listening Listening okay what do you think Maria If you wanna go to one station that you really like and you get a different card you can t put it back and get the one you want Ah Wow do I like that definition Absolutely personal integrity this is the way I think of it is doing the right thing when nobody else is watching You said it Maria you know what my favorite I really like those swing ropes over there I really like to do that Would I have personal integrity if I came over here and I did this I got a card and it s like ooh blue I don t wanna go to blue I wanna put that back Ooh there s another blue I don t want that Would I have personal integrity if I kept picking cards until I got what I wanted No Can Ms Miller watch every person get a card No No so you have to have some personal integrity Whatever card you get that s the one what happens if I just got a blue card and I come over here and I pick another blue one What am I gonna do what am I gonna do Paige You put it back down and you get another one but not the same one No no no we re not gonna get another one we re going to what it s okay You just go back to the blue station That s right you re just gonna go back to the blue station and just maybe if you did the hippity hops maybe do the balance drill next time Outstanding okay we re gonna get started this is what I want you to do Oh I forgot one more rule when you get a card do you ever run across the Indian No Do we ever run across her because we wanna stay spread out we don t wanna bump into anybody Nelson do you have a question Do you have a question about something You d probably rip the card You would absolutely rip the card if you were to step on them or actually you might slide on them and you could hurt yourself Hands down let s get started I m gonna call months of the year And if I call your month of the year that your birthday is in then you re gonna get up and you re gonna go get a card Are you ready If you have a birthday in January February or March go get a card How bout April May and June July August September October November and December let s go What d you get Chris let s see man What is that talk to me Red eight Red eight do you know what eight plus eight is Eight plus eight think about that Almost 16 go do 16 of those good job buddy Hey Paige you wait on the end of the mat there until Alexis is done What s your number Alexis Four don t hold the bottom grab up at the top like Brian is doing that s perfect yeah What was your number One What was it One One did you do one Do you think you can do one then come back here and go get another card Ooh Steven Steven what d you get man What is it Blue seven It s a blue seven go Hey Ethan what d you get Now remember the line means what A yellow six Okay what are you gonna do with that yellow six Wait come here look at me you re gonna put a No you re gonna add a what to the end of that A zero and that makes it what number 60 Yeah let s go Woo look at these people over here at the cardiorespiratory station they are going up up down down they are getting their heart rates up What number did you have Maddie Um 50 50 holy moly Keep counting It goes like this Maddie up up down down that s one Every time you hit the ground that s one okay Woo Be careful That s okay just hold it up like this Watch watch you see how it whirls like this at the bottom There you go like that it can get pretty hard Yeah Chris I saw one card that was um um it was turned over Oh did you So I flipped it over Oh really thank you so much I appreciate you taking care of the cards for me Here you go five times two what s five plus five Ten Ten that s what it is Jamie what d you get Forty Forty Did you get four yellow Go Woo look at these hippity hops over here Outstanding Man are you guys doing a good job I like how you re going really slow at this station that s good balancing Ooh Chris way to get your balance back Slow down buddy woah Nelson I know Can you put one foot in front of the other Can you bring your other foot in front Wanna try it Ms Miller s right here in case you have to grab onto me Yeah look at that what a good balancer you are I balance on the monkey bars You balance on the monkey bars Yeah Woo Good job You did it good job All right what d you get buddy Blue four Hey are you supposed to have your card with you I ll go put it back for you remember to leave the card Hey Jane did you run through the middle of the Indian Did you forget Don t do it again go on stay on the floor Way to practice How s it going over here Paige and Ethan Keep your eye right on that ball Ooh Paige that was close Right on there good job How bout you come over here What is eight times two What s eight times two Paige do you know that That s a hard one Nine Eight plus eight Eight plus eight kids Six times two what s six plus six Six and six put the two sixes together 12 12 That s what it is Just keep going there s new music coming on there s new music coming on first grade Keep it going Way to go there Nelson I like that Woo Your arms hurt You re getting a lot of good muscular strength What d you get here let s see What is that Yellow seven What are you gonna do to that seven You re gonna put a what on the end of it A what are you gonna put on it A zero What does that make it 70 Go Woo Maddie you got a blue Nine Yes No kidding Don t go running What is that card A yellow four And what are you gonna add to that four 
 Look at your station one information And the question we posed in station one was does temperature affect the rate of chemical weather And yesterday you guys constructed a graph to show that data Why is it useful to construct a graph in science class Sky Because it s a visual way to show you information It s a visual way to show you information I have a case up here as an example Based on that graph what does that pattern reveal about our question Gabrielle The cooler the temperature the more the I mean more increases in time The more what increases in time The more uh weather Okay anybody want to restate that Rebecca The colder it is the more time it takes to weather Very good The colder it is the more time it takes to weather If we re talking about dissolving a tablet is that chemical weathering or mechanical weathering Logan Chemical weathering Chemical weathering So the colder it is the longer it takes for the chemical weathering to occur Would you agree Thumbs up or thumbs down Thumbs up I would agree Now I want to talk about so what Why does it matter to us Why does it matter in our daily lives Talk about it for one minute record your thoughts on your wipe board and be ready to share back We could consider where to build our stuff In what types of areas would you have to be specifically and particularly hot What about up north You ve got 30 seconds to finish writing your thoughts Okay it might dissolve faster in a warmer place Or what type of rock would I want to avoid Limestone why Okay very good very good Alright let s share some of our ideas with the class Info managers table three what did you find If you live in a cold environment there will be less chemical weathering than there is in a warm place Good point if you live in a cooler environment there will be less chemical weathering than in a warm climate Who s gonna be particularly concerned with this What for instance job field is gonna be concerned with this idea Forrest Construction That would be one area what else Statue building Yeah any kind of artist who s designing statues What type of rock would you want to avoid if you re living in a warm area And you know that chemical weathering could be a problem What rock would you avoid Patrick Limestone Limestone Do you guys have some proof for me Somewhere in your data as to why we should avoid limestone Which station Alex Station three Flip to station three for me At station three who can explain to me what the lab was that you did Someone I haven t heard from Colin We put one small piece of chalk into a bottle of vinegar and a small piece of chalk into water and we saw if the acid from the vinegar dissolved the chalk and if the water dissolved the chalk And the chalk didn t dissolve in the water but the acid made it fizz bubble and it was just dissolving And why did we use chalk What is chalk a type of What is chalk a type of Jeremy It s a type of limestone It s a type of limestone So your evidence showed that yes limestone weathers quickly with acid Why is acid a part of our environment How does it become part of our environment Andrea Acid rain Acid rain acid rain Now as we grow up it s important that you re environmental advocates That you fight for protecting our environment What types of things can you do in your lives to cut down on acid rain Give me two ideas on your wipe boards Two ideas Is that polluting our water our air Polluting the air and it s getting into our clouds Very nice very good So air pollution particularly because the air pollution contributes to that formation You are making worst case scenarios You don t have to consider the unthinkable It can happen alright You don t have to consider the impossible So we can unplug outlets when we re not using them We can turn off the water when we brush our teeth What about things in your house Electricity Cut down on your electric bills Remember you burn fossil fuels to make electricity So right now as middle schoolers the easiest thing to do would be to cut down on your electric use Alright I want every table to share one idea Info manager from table one give me one idea One idea is we can help the environment by taking a bus to school instead of like everybody having their own individual cars Good point Or even better you can walk Instead of having that carpool line going on let s take busses Table two give me one idea Save power by changing your lightbulbs to CFLs Yeah use those light bulbs that are like the twirly light bulbs they use a lot less electricity good idea Table three give me one Conserve water by turning off the water when we brush our teeth Now conserving water Think about what the question was How can we be environmental advocates to cut down on acid rain We can cut down on electricity by unplugging outlets Very good Unplug items from the outlets that s good Table four We could use hybrid cars Hybrid cars that s good They burn less fossil fuels good idea Table five Recycle Recycle How would that help acid rain Okay so it s cutting down on factory use that would be a good one Table six Cutting down on electricity Alright cutting down on electricity because to make electricity you have to burn fossil fuels Table seven is there any that haven t been said Carpool to work and school Carpool to work and school I love it You got something to add I was going to say instead of the bottles end up in landfills so you can keep bottles out of landfills if you reuse them Yeah very good A lot of times we focus only on the idea of recycling but it s good to reuse too That s a good idea as well So we talked about how the temperature will affect our chemical weathering We haven t yet talked about how temperature affects mechanical weathering Which lab would answer that question How temperature affects mechanical weathering Station four Alright look at station four Take one minute you don t have to write this one down discuss it What does station four tell you and how is that important in daily life Take one minute And it like ice wedges and then it ll make bigger cracks and then it will do bad stuff for sidewalks What were you supposed to be measuring In centimeters You measured in milimeters but you meant to measure in centimeters So how much was it in centimeters Well if you said it was at 79 which would be right there What centimeters is that at Around 15 Write down 15 Oh wait wait I had it going the wrong way and no one even noticed So if it was at 79 where would it be At 79 the tick mark right below the 80 About 16 About 16 and if it was at 76 where would it be at About 14 and a half Very good Alright let s pick someone at random who s the lucky person Andrew P What did you notice was the difference between the same amount of water when it was frozen and when it was left as a liquid When it was frozen it was taller When it was frozen it was taller What does that mean that it was taller Lucy Well the water was frozen to ice So it expands a little It expands I like the use of that word Water expands as it freezes Here in Louisville how is that a problem And it s been a particularly big problem this winter Ethan Because like the water can get in the cracks in the roads and then when it freezes it will expand and it will crack roads and buildings Soon the people will have the construction people will have to rebuild the roads Right very good point Now that affects us here in Kentucky because we have those cold winters What types of areas would it not affect Forrest Florida Florida areas that don t have freezing that s a good point Now we ve talked about climate as far as temperature goes We ve talked about the warm temperatures and the cold temperatures and how it affects the chemical and mechanical weathering What is the other aspect of climate other than temperatures Other than temperature what is another aspect of climate Patrick How humid it is How humid it is Which lab do you think would tell us how humidity affects weather Flip through Sky Seven Let s look at station seven Now during our labs the materials managers were always in charge of getting the materials ready A material manager Can someone explain to me what s the difference between the steel wool that was covered with a cup versus the steel wool that was not covered with a cup What would that difference be Lucy Well the steel wool that was covered well the steel wool that wasn t covered with the cup it was all like stuck together and it wasn t rusting and the one that was covered with the cup it had like stuff popping out like it wasn t all stuck together and it was rusting Okay so the one that was covered with a cup and moistened had a lot of rust And the one that was moistened but was just left sitting out dried and did not have a lot of rust Would you agree Okay what is the purpose of covering it Why do I cover that Otis Keeping the water from evaporating Yeah it s keeping that water in So is the covered cup a dry environment or a humid environment Humid environment A very humid environment I have a great map here that tells you a little bit about different areas and tells you what their humidity is like I m gonna flip off both lights to help you see it This is a tropical wet area tropical dry area semi arid which means dry arid then marine west coast Mediterranean and humid sub tropical These areas that are marked as humid sub tropical such as down in Florida those areas that are marked as humid what do they have to be cautious about If it s a humid area what do they have to be cautious about Don t see a lot of hands talk about it for one minute What do humid areas have to be cautious about Now think about this an area like Kentucky And our summers aren t just hot they re humid So we have to deal with cold winters which are gonna affect mechanical weathering and we have to deal with Yeah so we re kind of getting the worst end of both scenarios Yes we definitely are Good point Alright I need someone I haven t heard from to share let s see who the random card is Lucy What do you think They have to be careful about rusting like their cars and stuff They have to be careful of rusting Good point Because the more humid the air is the more likely you are to have what Oxidation Now there was another lab where we used steel wool What was the purpose of the other steel wool lab What were you trying to answer what were you trying to determine Jamiel what do you think There was the key word the what kind of water Salt water You look to see if salt water affected the oxidation rate You look to see if salt water did Silently look at your data and tell me did salt water affect the rate of oxidation Jeremy did salt water affect the rate of oxidation Yeah 
 This one is probably medium So this one is mine So this has to be a medium And this one has to be a large because My medium is half way up to here So it has to be a large So you make a prediction about how many small rocks it takes to make a big I think it s gonna be 12 small rocks That s a good idea Put our small rocks we have here so we make it draw two little blocks and if we have 12 Draw a rectangle and just put put your line through right here What do you think how many small rocks I think that there is going to be eight We have eight rocks So I think that there s going to be What about you I have 10 11 12 Boys and girls I had a good question If you ve got more rocks than you do boxes you know that we ve got how many boxes How many boxes Ten There s ten So at the top you can write since we ve been working with place value with tens and ones you can put ten We know that s how many boxes we have You could put plus six if you have which number 16 16 If you all had 11 what could you do You got ten so you would write plus one If you had 12 you would write you ve got 10 so what would you write above it Plus two So you can do it that way Good question Now what about you make a prediction of five then you ask us how many baby rocks we think that ten makes I think that there is going to be These can be large And there s one two three four four larges He s already told you how many mediums there are However you think Very good So you ve got yours sorted by size or you could see if there s another way you can sort your rocks We just did size first so we could do our work Very smart Very smart Tell me about looking at the graph how many small you had Diana How many small rocks were there Five Alright how many medium rocks did you have 11 And how many large Four Good good and you sorted them Oh you got some nice rocks Oooh Nice rock there it s pretty Neat Now this looks much better much better Medium there s one two three four five six seven eight nine Three four five six seven eight nine 10 Wait wait One two three four five Now we need five more to make 15 One two three four five six seven eight nine Four five six seven eight nine I counted 14 Put them together One two three four I d say like maybe it goes with the white Okay what about this one That goes with the white right What about this one Hmm I d say like what does it have the most of I d say probably white What about this one This one goes for tan This one is this one goes This one goes too This goes with the gray too This one goes to the I think it goes It goes with the white Now let s see I think it s a pretty rock Wait oh That one goes there I know it They all do Wait these go with the green No this one this one is gray It s still got sand in it This one is green and at least it looks a little bit greenish I d say like maybe green too We ll have all yes Okay now this rock Okay Diana Cam and Gaelin What I want you to do is you ll probably how about you just take the rocks Because I can t remember What s going on We re sorting them a different way You re sorting them a different way And what way would that be How did you all decide to sort rocks I thought we d sort them by color and now we re gonna do it by cut Tell me that again because I don t I don t know that part Now since we did the color we re going to do is we re going to do by texture What s texture It s by how it feels Oh well can you teach me Find out the texture from these two rocks I see how it feels And since this one feels very smooth I ll put it by itself Well can I feel it Pretty smooth Pretty smooth Have you felt it Feel it How you think it feels Smooth It does feel pretty smooth And it looks like a piece of meat It looks like a piece a meat Yes Better not eat a rock should I Okay where does this one need to go It needs to go Over here We haven t finished quite yet so Okay And this one is like I ll say pretty rough Pretty rough can I feel this one Oh gosh Whoo Yeah It does feel a little rough It does feel like it s got some sand on it You know a word that I can think of that makes me think of that Rough Rough or gritty You know sand is gritty feeling Well that s kind of gritty It does feel a little rough It can stand up It stands up I m gonna do it put it by itself Okay And we re going to keep on doing it Until all of them are sorted Okay this is a pretty cool rock how does it feel I ll say pretty bumpy kind of rock Pretty bumpy pretty rough Oh this one s very rough So rough I can hardly stand myself Look at the shell on it It does have a shell in it On the other side look On the other side turn it like right here it has another shell It does so what kind of rock would this be A two fossil rock A fossil rock And what kind are they what s it called If it has a fossil imprint in it Fossil If it settled and got a fossil Sedimentary It would be a sedimentary rock Very cool I m so proud of you That was definitely very rough Have you felt it This is What do you think On the back is kind of squishy It is rough Okay you all keep working you re doing a good job I m proud of you Okay Now you can put it with the rough the super rough I think this one is I can tell I say medium a little rough a little smooth This one goes in the middle This one is smooth This is super rough Let me feel Smooth I m gonna put it in the middle because I think Very good Arianna I like the way you One more medium rock than large Because we have eight medium and seven large Because you can see A smooth side and a rough side Because if you add two more together it make 12 Medium is seven and large is eight And I have an idea when you do your rock what about you trace it 
 Great job thank you for playing along It s so much nicer to play with live accompaniment than it is recorded Your assignment two weeks be able to play an improvised solo in this key in F concert utilizing the Dorian and Mixolydian scales We ll leave in just a moment just relax Utilizing the Dorian and Mixolydian scales I ll ask you to play live on this Bosaladera I also want you to outside of class find a Latin piece of music it doesn t have to be bossa nova that you can play along with identifying the Dorian and the Mixolydian scale that fits that key Pick a song that you can identify the key and that you feel comfortable playing in that key to bring back and play for us I want a recording here so you re going have to find a mp3 CD DVD something along that you can get to class So you can share this information with each other Questions Time frame is two weeks If you went through this quickly tell your buddy how long you got and what you have to do go That s a great question thank you Yes yes do it in vibes it will be wonderful You can do this it s in F scale it s in F scale is what it is And I saw your results and they were outstanding Very good let s all grab an encore thank you and I will see you tomorrow Keep the rhythm sync Soft As we do our solos here if you would take your pencils and when you hear the soloists play on these notes on the side of this changing I want you to put a mark beside that change where you are Put a count on it Each rotation will be different Sometimes they may play from the middle scale to the middle or the whole thing Wherever you think that happens I will be documenting it over here too All right Today s volunteers are beginning with the vibe player and then we ll just go through the trumpets the trombones and saxes and those others who are assigned to play today Here we go everybody got pencils ready And one one two three four Here we go Rockville On my mark One two ready One two and one two ready play 
 Okay guys good morning and welcome to class today We re going to continue our discussion on energy but we re going to extend it to cover some new points that we haven t talked about yet So what I d like for you to do first before we get started with out discussion is look at the big idea the big idea for just a moment So the big idea that we re going to talk about today is how do you think the sun is going to help you shoot the stretchy lizard across the table So everybody s got their little stretchy lizard Without shooting them we re not doing anything with them yet I d like for you to talk in your table group and see if you can come up with a big idea I m going to give you and then we ll just go around and see what you think Okay so 30 seconds to think about what s the big idea Do you know who your spokesperson is going to be Alright guys it s been 30 seconds I m going to go to each table If you could just have your spokesperson ready you could just tell me what your big idea is We re going to put it up here and we re going to come back to it at the end of class and see how we ve done Alright so how about we ll start with you guys back here since there s just two of you Alright what do you think Shawn are you going to speak The sun would warm up the lizard and make it go across the table Okay so the sun might warm up the lizard I just put L for lizard that s alright and make it go across the table Robert how about your table who s your spokesperson going to be The energy from the sun once it shines on the lizard it would give the lizard energy Okay the energy from the sun will shine on the lizard Right is that okay Who s your spokesperson We said that the sun might make the lizard melt and make it sticky and then maybe it would shoot across the table Okay so it might make it melt and sticky and that ll make it shoot across the table Is that what you said Alright Kendrick who s your spokesperson going to be Blaire It was unanimous Alright Blaire what do you guys have We were going to say things like the other people said that like the energy from the sun is going Is going to do what Like the energy from the sun would like shine on the lizard and it s going to make it jump Okay Shine and make it jump Nicole did you guys decide who your spokesperson s going to be Arrington Arrington The sun would gives energy to the lizard to help it sling Okay so the sun gives energy and I didn t hear the last part You want to tell me That helps it That helps it okay And last but not least Jada We think that the sun give heat to the and make it more elastic so it would stretch Okay so the sun would give heat to make it more elastic I m sorry what was the last part again Like make it more elastic so it will stretch more So it ll stretch farther good Alright so what I d like to do now is I d like to just kind of recall some of the things that we might already know about energy So if I call your number I would like you to think about what do you know about let s start with potential energy What do you know about potential energy So if I call your number just tell me one factor one thing that you know about it or an example of it Alright we ll start with 15 When an object is like still it doesn t move it s holding it in Okay still doesn t move it s holding it in How about number eight Robert Something you know about potential energy or an example of it The lizards Alright very good When the lizard is still When it s moving what do you think Still Alright very good It s stored energy Alright it s stored energy and I ll do one more number two Potential energy An example or something that you remember about it The pencil is still The pencil is still Alright very good Now I know we haven t talked about these topics too much yet but I know from your pretest you guys had a lot of background knowledge on it Okay the next thing I d like to know is what do you know what examples do you have what can you remember about kinetic energy So we talked about potential Now I d like to know a couple things that you might know about kinetic energy Alright so if I call your number let me know what you think Number 20 A car moving A car moving Alright number 13 A paint can being dropped A paint can being dropped alright very good Number 14 When you push a pencil and it rolls Alright when you push a pencil and it rolls very good And how about number seven we ll do one more Like the energy of motion like the The energy of motion Yeah Thanks Alright and if I didn t call your number and you want to contribute about either potential or kinetic Anybody have anything else to add about it Dylan Kinetic is when like the stored energy from the potential energy leaks all out and it starts pulling Alright very good and that s a great way to start into the next part what we re going to use the lizards for today Alright so what I would like to know from you guys is everybody has a bucket on their table right Um hum yeah Teacher Okay And you can raise your hand for this part how can you from your seat how can you make the stretchy lizard get into the bucket Anthony Shoot it You can shoot it You can just toss it in You can just toss it in there You could pull its tail You could pull its tail and stretch it You could drop it in there You could just drop it in there It s not too far away Anybody else Okay how about and I m not asking for a demonstration yet we ll get to demonstration I promise How about if I asked you guys instead of in the bucket at your table how could you get it into a bucket at your neighbor s table At your neighbor s table Javious what do you think You could toss it You could toss it Arrington You could sling it You could sling it Wilson That was your idea Alright Walk over there and put it in it Yeah that s true I didn t say you had to stay in your seat did I You could walk over there and just put it in Gavin You could like throw it You might throw it Is that what you were going to say Dana Alright Shoot it You could shoot it alright very good You could bend it back Yep you could bend it back and shoot very good How about if I asked you to shoot it from one side of the room to the other Jade I ll start with you Sling it You could sling it Lewis Like you said you could shoot it Yeah you could shoot it Anthony You could throw it You could throw it So we re kind of hearing the same things right We re kind of hearing Go ahead You could walk over and drop it You could walk over and drop it I didn t say you had to stay in your seat Alright What would be the difference though between the bucket at your table the bucket your neighbor s table shooting it across the room going out on the football field and going for distance What would be the difference between what you did What difference would you have between this bucket here the bucket at your neighbor s table and so forth John what do you think The amount of energy you re putting into it Can you just show me without actually shooting it for example Like if you re trying to get it into this bucket I only have to go like this or drop it in there If I were trying to send it across the room I d have to really stretch it out Okay The distance away from the bucket Okay so what would you do differently to make it go a different distance Stretch it more I might stretch it further is that what you two were going to say The more potential energy or kinetic energy it has The more potential energy the more kinetic energy it has So when you talk about the lizard what do you mean when you say the potential energy that it has How s it getting potential energy What does that mean Before you sling it it s just sitting there Alright so when it s just sitting there it s potential What about when you stretch it what do you think that is Kinetic Okay have you let it go yet No Alright so we ll think about that for a little bit What I d like for you guys to do is talk to your neighbors at your table or if you don t like what they have to say you can think about it on your own I d like for you to make a hypothesis and I d like for your hypothesis to start with I think and then think about what we just said about how you would get the lizard in the bucket at your table versus your neighbor s table What do you think you would do differently I think if I do what to the lizard it s going to go in the bucket at my table versus the one at the next table So make a hypothesis about how you could test how can you get the lizard in that bucket versus the next one By slinging it Yeah talk amongst yourselves and see what you guys think Alright I ll give you But then compare it to the next table as well What would you have to do differently to the lizard to get it in this bucket versus the next one That s what I want you to do Okay alright So let me just have Let s hear one table Gavin I kind of liked what I was hearing from yours Ready guys Gavin I liked what I was hearing from your table when I was walking around Tell me what you guys came up with for a hypothesis That if you were shooting it at your table you d only pull back a little bit but if you re shooting it across to another person s table you d have to pull it back farther Okay any other table have a similar hypothesis So their hypothesis then was if they want to shoot it into the bucket at their table and correct me if I m wrong they d only have to stretch it a little bit but if they wanted to shoot it at their neighbor s table they d have to stretch it further Did anybody have a similar hypothesis to that You guys did How about you guys what did you say Nicole We said that maybe we d have to aim our trajectory much different that we would between tables Okay so not only the amount of stretch but also the trajectory of how you aim it Alright very good How about you guys over there You d have to really aim and focus on how much power you put into it Alright very good And I know you guys were coming up with the same thing So we re going to do an experiment in just a minute to test that hypothesis about the amount of stretch Is the amount of stretch related to how far your lizard can fly Okay so if that s your hypothesis I think the amount of stretch that I give the lizard will make it fly a different length what would the manipulated variable be What would the thing be that you change between the different steps Anthony How far you pull it back How far you pull it back very good How far you pull it or can I put stretch also Good What would our dependent variable be What are you going to watch for How do you know if that stretch has made a difference Jada Alright very good and where else might it go Right but you re talking about your bucket and you re also talking about Very good So we re talking about Distance Alright so can I put that down for the dependent Yes Okay good How about some constants What are some things that have to stay the same Guys don t let that table do all the work come on now Alright Ada The type of lizard The type of lizard very good Would it be fair if I gave one table battery powered and the other table not right Alright very good Sierra what else The size and shape of it Size and shape of it very good Anything else that has to stay constant or the same How big is the container Alright very good How big is the container Wilson How stretchy it is Okay how stretchy it is Alright I m going to give you 30 seconds and what I would like for you to do with those 30 seconds is I d like for you to practice Alright I d like for you to practice at this point just at your table If you want to practice on moving the bucket to one end and you guys try from the other end that s fine but I would like for you guys to control the lizards so they stay at your area okay Alright go ahead Without hitting your neighbor Maybe move to the side Kendra Go ahead and practice and see the amount of stretch you give the lizard makes a difference Gavin See if you have some information when you re done besides that it sticks to your neighbor s head Alright hold on and we ll try it again I promise we ll try it again at further distances in just a minute Let s think guys Can anyone make a conclusion that starts with When I change the amount of stretch Can anyone make a conclusion that starts Good job Nicole When I change the amount of stretch If I change the amount of stretch far then it goes further Okay if I change the amount of stretch when I make it further it goes further Alright Lewis You might plan for it to go one way but the way that you shoot it really it doesn t exactly go where you plan It s all over the place But if we just focus back to the amount of stretch and the distance 
 So you re saying here why did you pick it why did you pick the two points that you did Okay why Are they random No you just tell me why you think those two What Okay average Okay So I ll come back here in a minute I m gonna tend to this table What okay what is I don t know what I would there Cause they have the what is the all right what is and what is You guys it should say what is the slope okay It should say what is the slope It represents the y intercept Yeah it said what is the That s what I m saying people All right I m just sayin it would Okay three Can I have your attention real quick please All right once you find I see most of you have yours in point slope would you also put it in slope intercept okay Because that ll help you with question number three okay then I ve got through question number three Go head and find your answer and Here we have what is this Linear Okay is that a line No Okay Were you supposed to draw a line through it Okay what does it say down there Okay why you did number five before you did number one it said draw a line through right This is like a not a line okay A line is straight so you wanna draw a line straight through there But before you do that I want you to answer and do one two three and four first Should we erase this Uh yeah but don t worry about it right now I want you to work on finding a what two points did you have Um Okay and why did you get that Because What s easy mean Like one plus one And what kind of slope did you get Oh you haven t done it yet Okay I ll get back to you all right But 72 s What s number two What is the slope What is the slope value What is the slope What is the slope And then I was gonna I actually had started out with what doesn t mean in a situation But when you Y equals one and x yep okay y 1x Now how do we find what s the ordered pair here Okay that s the slope intercept form Oh that s what got em mixed up So what is it though And you don t have point slope What is the ordered pair for y intercept Is that the one where you have parentheses with two n and then another one that s like No that s point slope Okay I just want the y intercept Okay 2 is the y intercept in this equation y mx b Right it s two What did that tell me That s what the y intercept is What does it represent the situation Okay now wait it s Okay is it for two people So is for people Okay now if you were to look at your graph which we haven t done yet And where would negative two cross Though I m not sure that s Now I m also seeing something here about Why do you have a two here Hello So 30 32 I know right Making me erase That s okay So it s three six nine 12 then all this other junk So you can get up there and get 33 Always thinkin Six is six eight is eight I m sorry Three seconds For every how many people For each person three seconds a person Okay no that s person according to your data So it took three seconds to pass from the church right Now what is minus 24 Okay that s a year you have y intercept is negative 24 and it represents Okay I want you to do one graph Okay yeah whatever your Y is starting at By the way this is a They want you to draw a line Okay so what is Time in seconds right Where does the y intercept It crosses x okay It crosses x The y intercept crosses The y intercept crosses y Okay the y intercept crosses the y Okay so y is gonna cross the axes that is talking about what Okay All right It s crossing talking about time okay It s supposed to say what is the slope the slope is wards for s You should move your line so that it follows the dots Okay I m gonna come back here What s the problem Time They re confusing me All right so number three you said the y intercept is six elevenths of a second is that what you re saying Six elevenths seconds Okay and you said that was what Okay All right what were the people doing People were passing books So six elevenths okay means that it took six elevenths were no people What was happening during Each person to pass So was each person passing the book at six elevenths That s how long it took for them to start passing Six elevenths of a second Okay So who passed the first globe I mean who s was that Angela Okay so he did what He had to run around and then to come back And here and turn a person Right He had to leave his desk Okay now is that an average throw Okay what s your average that you re talking about 14 seconds for every 11 men Okay so we might wanna just change that to a decimal okay So just find out how many for one person Just change it to a decimal And you might wanna change six elevenths to a decimal so you can have an actual Okay That s great all right That s okay does everybody understand what Jade was saying I think the reason why she did that was because We had to make a line Okay now Okay that doesn t mean make a line graph Oh Okay Are you Drawing a straight line a straight line Now we just wanna look at what you got here Okay what did you put One One And what does it mean I got 1 27672767 Okay and what does the slope on the line Now don t worry about your line right now just answer these questions What does the slope on the line your slope of one represent in this situation One second per pass Okay all right you re gonna do one second per pass Averaged Per Person One second per person to pass the book Get back right Okay So what does your y intercept represent If it s at zero with no passage that s what the seconds are that s what the point is Okay say that again If there s no passes like the time starts at negative two seconds I guess I don t know how to explain Did you get a negative Yeah Now is that possible No No Okay Why might you have a negative Sometimes it drops Okay but if you have negative time okay can you She d be like oh yeah that was negative three seconds ago Yeah negative no that was three seconds ago but it wasn t so you got a point two right seconds All right Now let s just think about and you said it was what negative two seconds but He wrote people Okay when was there a time when there was zero people I mean in this situation during the book pass When was there zero time Never When it s When okay When they start moving but somebody was moving I think it s zero passes No all right what does your y line represent Time in seconds Time in seconds So the y intercept rounded out that s what Time in seconds right So it s a time when was time when the books were not being passed Somebody had to all right walk over and pick em up and then somebody had to walk over and put them 
 Okay you guys based on the answer tickets that we took yesterday what we realized or what I realized is that there s still confusion on going from the general to factor General to vertex or vice versa on any of those three particular forms Also another objective we re gonna do is we re gonna figure out determine why each form is important So the first thing I want you guys to do is I want you guys to look at number one on that task card Can someone read it out loud I will Yeah Drew The Angry Bird was blasted through a slingshot at the initial height of 45 meters The bird s initial velocity was 14 7 meters per second Write an equation that gives the height of the Angry Bird as a function of time Okay so what I need you guys to do is I need you guys to write that equation on the white board Okay so now I want people to put it up on the board Okay Okay so can you guys look around to each other too I know you guys are gonna want to like show everybody what people are getting Yay Cool Okay guys these are the four things or the three things that I saw Okay so right here So if you notice a lot of you guys you guys had the first one Negative four point nine x squared plus 14 7 x plus 49 Can someone tell me in words how you were able to figure that out You just did it What was the question So can someone tell me how like relate this general formula to the story Since you ve read already I wants someone else to speak So who Okay Jamilah can you explain how you were able to get this equation So the height is c and the original equation is a x squared plus b x plus c And so the initial height is b which is the y intercept And then b is the initial velocity And then negative four point nine is just the random number that they chose So you guys is it random No It s the scale factor Is there any other terminology for that It s the starting point Hey guys do you think it s the starting point Is it the starting point Or what else It s gravity So wait what does this negative four point nine mean That s the constant Remember it s gravity So I heard Scale factor Okay scale factor but relatively to your projectile motion what is it Acceleration Acceleration So you guys It s acceleration So right now what I want you guys to do Oh actually once again right here here are different forms of an equation that I saw So right here what do you think Can someone tell me what s wrong with this particular one They don t have a squared and they don t have an x after the 4 2 Okay so Ravelle what s the problem with this one There s no y intercept or So once again I still notice now I want to go back to the original equation Okay someone tell me in words Ah Jamilah she did a fantastic job explaining relatively to the a x squared plus b x plus c but according to the story can someone refer to the story back to the general equation Can you rephrase the question Yes How are we able to get 14 7 here How did we get 49 here How do you know what stuff to use The 49 is the initial height in meters so that one s gonna be your y intercept And 14 7 is the initial velocity and the initial velocity is always b so Awesome So now what I want you guys to do is I want you to go to number two So I want you to put that on the white board Can I read it again Well actually no Let s have Fatima can you read number two What does the x axis represent in this story What does the y axis represent in our story Okay let s do that quickly I have a question Yes Did x never mind I ll wait until after this So let s look around So a lot of people are getting what X equals time Y equals height So Markeisha what was your question I was gonna say could x be distance as well Can x be distance people No No If it wanted to Why not Because it s meters per second not meters per So does that make sense All right So now what I want you guys to do So so far let s recap what we ve done so far Can everyone generalize what we ve just done in the first couple of questions We set up the equation and we figured out our x and y axes in the general form Okay right now what I want you guys to do is I want you guys to work on number four Okay someone read that out loud that hasn t read out loud yet I haven t So Leslie you want to read Number four From the equation that you got from question number one show the steps on how you translate the general form into the factor form Now what I want you guys to do I want you to turn and talk about the strategies you re planning to use to work out this problem Okay you guys I m gonna stop class real quick You guys I m gonna stop class real quick Okay so Mary can you just ask the question that you just asked me She asked me Okay so one of you guys ask the question that we just talked about So Markeisha Jamilah Can we use the box to figure it out Yeah you can Why How Hang on Put that back away So you guys So the question is Okay so Autumn just asked can she use the diamond and rectangle method as opposed to and why You guys You guys let s listen please Mary Sorry You figure it out by dividing negative four point nine by all the numbers So if you divide negative four point nine x squared by negative four point nine you ll get x squared 14 7 divided by negative four point nine is negative three And then 49 divided by negative four point nine is negative ten Okay I ll stop you right there So back to what I said Okay so the diamond rectangle method people So when you are doing this what are you finding We re finding the box You re finding the box So what are those things outside of the box here What are they called The factors The factors Okay Okay when you re using it seems like a lot of you guys are using the quadratic formula What are you trying to find then All right So right now So Autumn So you have questions on that right So later on So do you mind just moving over there real quick Because Leslie said that you got it down So you guys so take two more minutes We re gonna see both methods So are you done yet No Okay you guys stop Okay right now I m gonna put this up right here We re gonna put up the most common mistakes that people tend to do Okay so right now so how many people got negative five and two No no no So what was it Negative two Oh okay I got negative two and five My bad Okay so right now What do you think was the mistake that she did She didn t square it She didn t what She didn t square And then she re fixed it She fixed it Yeah she copied mine It s supposed to be negative 14 7 Is that what its supposed to be Yeah And is that what she s missing Yeah Okay guys so that s one mistake that happens quite a bit Also let s look at Hey you guys what form is this right here What method did they use Box and diamond method Box and diamond method right Okay so you guys what do you call these two items right here What is it missing The number at the beginning The negative four And what is that again What is the name of the four point nine again Scale factor or what Acceleration Acceleration So you guys if you notice this is something that tends to be missing also So now we will look at ah We have the same thing We all have the same thing So same thing same thing All right Okay So right now I think we looked at all the common mistakes that people tend Oh actually So now what I want is so how many methods do people use Two Okay so tell me one what was one method What was the method that you used Quadratic formula Okay Caleb What was another method that people used The box and diamond The box and diamond right So right now I want people to explain their thinking So what I want you to do is okay since Tiffany since you said you did the quadratic formula you re gonna go up and talk about it Just talk about the process of what you did How are you gonna explain the process All right So the Can we do it on this hard board Yeah Okay Let s do it on this hard board Make sure you talk to us okay Okay while you re writing things down talk about how you re going through the process So I used the quadratic formula So what are you doing right now I m writing it Writing what The quadratic formula Okay So you see instead of me asking I just want you to explain all the things that you re doing Okay So you guys need some visuals This will be your a your b and your c So you plug all this into this Okay so let s do it I have a question Yes What if the b is already negative That s a good question So you guys while Tiffany is doing the quadratic formula think about what common mistakes that we just talked about earlier and what mistakes that she may or may not have 
 Do not put any button caps in the center of the ridge Put them right on the bottom edge on each side of that felt Do I get a lot now You get what You can t do anything down here You need to help him roll that out He s going to need help right there You can put one in one side and then pull it down through there One right there When in doubt put a button If you re wondering if it should be in there it should be We re a little far apart right here You definitely need to put one right here So it s under Reach down right here and put one in This back end going to um Wrinkle Before you put a nail there Can I nail the top part of this Yes absolutely Because if I Your feet need to be on a button regardless on which side you re on you need to be on the button Please nail that one right behind you This sun coming out like this makes this felt Hot Hot and soft and it ll tear easily Now this is 30 pound felt it s not 15 pound felt So it s a lot thicker than what you got two common kinds you re going to be putting on Okay Okay how are we doing over here If you lay it up there the top won t fly down That s right That s good Communicate Communicate with each other right there Did that work out work for you Yeah Stand this way How many rinds do we need You got your left rind Now we need our interval going up to the roof Tell us what it is What you need to do on a three tab How far what is our interval here Remember Can you remember What is it Speak up Five Five Five inches okay Don t be scared You know it You shout it right out Five inches Five inches up Every five inches Be sure to measure from the top of the seam Don t measure from here It s got to be from right here Measure up five 10 15 20 Just go ahead and mark it up you re roof Get your layout there and your layout there Double check each other Check behind each other If the layout s not right and we have to tear shingles back off are those shingles any good No What No sir They re not any good Let s make sure we double check behind each other and get the layout correct Remember Team work just like on the job Anybody can make a mistake You have a couple of eyes on it Checking behind that s a lot better You can mark on this side It s not going to hurt a thing You can put a bigger mark on there so you can see it Alright Something like that Okay You can see that That s not small and tiny That s big Look at the difference right here Enrique My marks and your marks right here You can especially I mean this is relatively new felt This felt gets marked up and scratched up If you put a large crow foot mark on here you re going to know exactly where to hold that thing Make sure that you get it where you can see it We re going to cover this stuff right back up Now watch this felt as I pull this up and down See those bubbles in it Right here I got the bubbles at the top that means I gotta pull it down to get those out You want this stuff laying flat If it doesn t it ll probably show up underneath the machinery If I pull it down too far it pulls a wrinkle in the bottom So you want to make sure you get it straight and get all the wrinkles out of it I ve got them out and I m just a little bit below my line right here but that s okay It s more important that this is out right here that it s on Does that make sense Yeah So just make sure Now you want to come out here at this point and get you one right here Don t forget our nailing pattern that we discussed Here here here here and here You can feel right here where the plywood is You want to put a button right here and your nail line is going to be right in here on this You don t want to nail into the fascia board You want to come right across in here and put them every six inches And about every two feet right here and one occasionally Be careful not to step on the felt Step on the buttons so you don t end up sliding Just be careful anytime that you re stepping on felt You never want to step on loose felt Okay All right Go ahead and nail that off This one right here See how you re doing this shingle Yeah We re gonna come back with a starter right here turned upside down This right here is gonna have to be cut off So go ahead and just cut this off even that ll be fine right now This one over here don t nail that yet Hold on just a second Come here a minute You can do it that way That s one way that you can run it down and cut it or right here I can just take this soldier just like this and I can cut it off right here Or I can just lap it up there and nail it like it is The other soldier is coming down to right here So just come up here and cut this off Got your hook weight on you Yeah Take and cut one tab off of the shingle flush it up and nail it on and then go ahead and start your starter tabs up there It doesn t have to be straight right I just cut it Pardon Does it have to be straight Just eyeball it No it doesn t have to be perfectly straight just go ahead and hook your hook blade right here and pull it straight back That ll be fine Hold it down There you go Never cut back on your handle These right here we ll be able to use for the caps on top so don t throw these away Tabs always go in on these So make sure your tab s in flush it up and nail it off Once you ve done this you need to pull a layout and in the classroom we talked about layout on three tab shingles If we re gonna go off the end of the building what are we gonna pull Thirty 36 We re gonna pull 36 inches and we re gonna pull 30 inches Top and bottom topping your lines All right Does that make sense Yeah Okay so do that Once you nail this off do that and then run your starters You can go ahead and cut that off The inches right here you can go ahead and cut them come right here and cut it off right here on the edge of the plywood and then that will have you ready to put your shingles on in a minute You got a hook blade Y all have it You go ahead and do that then you can do the other side right here Go ahead and get your lines snapped put them on there and mark it and pop your lines Either way You can do it either way it doesn t matter but since we re gonna go ahead and start these they need to be on the 30x36 way out anyway Flush it up and hang it Don t pull that down If you do that s just gonna take and break that shingle off This right here is establishing the overhang that we wanted that inch and a quarter off the edge of the building so we want our finished shingles to come right here also When you pull your 30x36 for your layout on your three tab you want to go all the way to the edge of the soldier joist Go ahead and mark that at the top You need to keep them moving you gotta have it marked up there Go ahead and mark it up there and mark it right here Get these popped and then you can go ahead and get Darius to get you a shingle and have it ready to go and y all will be ready to put these things on Put your starter on it Here Thirty and 36 It s raining buttons See that button landed right there Y all make sure that you pick these things up when you re done You should be able to reach right here and nail this plywood on without any problem Once they get right here you can t nail it move down the line Hammering Talk to him what do you want him to do Put a nail right there There you go Brandon is telling you right Y all hold on a minute What does putting a nail right there do I mean you re about to put it right there It holds it center because that way no bubbles or nothing comes up It s gonna hold it right Keeps it straight So really you can start putting buttons from down there to here it s not going to affect anything Because he s got that button in From this point on we can t put any more buttons in it until he gets it where he wants it down here He nails it off Right but you could nail this Go ahead and start doing that Working together as a group to get the job done is what it s all about This is not a one man job you can t roll this stuff out and do it by yourself It s not a one person job If you want to mark that and pull that up to where you can get to it there s nothing wrong with doing that What you don t want to do is put your foot on that felt right in there Watch about cutting back towards your hand like that Just be real careful There ya go Mike put your hand on that roll for him I got it That may not be enough to cap that ridge off So we can roll it as far down as it will go and piece it if we need to You need a button in it now He needs help Help him right here Yes sir Where at Hold on come on the line right there Yeah come on right here Is that on right Yeah next put the felt right here As far as starting this next row you got a line on Thirty six inches You got a line on 36 inches and you ve got a line on 30 inches We want to make sure that when you start this next run that you re not breaking Let me see a shingle right here I want you to watch I ve worked on several houses the whole boxing fascia boards and all this is rotten on the house The reason for that was this right here They put their starter on like you re supposed to to allow for the throats of the shingles We have no water penetration down here But once you start this starter tabs up over to your 36 inch line if I laid this 36 inch shingle down and nail it off I have a straight avenue of water to get down to this felt This felt will only hold for so long It s going to get down here it will rot it out and there you re gonna be So you wanna make sure that you start this on your 30 inch line and then give me one more shingle Then when you butt this shingle up to this one now what I have is I got my break right here in the center of the full tab and I m six inches away from it That s why our nailing pattern here is important You want to nail above every throat in the far line slightly above in a three tab shingle Four nails 1 2 3 4 Just like we discussed on the PowerPoint Above the tar line Pardon Above the tar line I can t hear you Above the tar line It can be in or slightly above Most people are gonna put them in them or slightly above them Your video PowerPoint was slightly above but the main important thing here is that you have it to where If you put them in random if I put one right here or in the middle of these two I could possibly have a nail where I got a shingle breaking Or I could possibly have a nail in line with a throat that s gonna line up on top of the next one It s important to go here here here and here The purpose of this tar line is when this sun heats it and it heats up you have the next shingle on top of here it helps secure it down so wind don t take and blow it up and rip the shingle off So it melts down It ll actually seal and melt down to it All right you re doing good but go ahead and make sure that you do this with this hot sun out here today you will wanna keep these cut So use a shingle to square it up or your speed square Mark your line and cut it straight down right here You can nail it on first that will be fine Or you can go ahead and cut it before you nail it You see this shingle right here that s got the little slit in it That is exactly six inches is what that is So you can take this shingle right here Put your speed square up here take your hook blade and follow along it and cut that off Then you can nail it on if you wanted to do that Either way there s multiple different ways to do it The main thing is don t just take this put it on the 30 inch line nail it down and don t do anything else to it until you get up there Y all do it as you go These hot days like this cool that down and it won t get it s form back It ll look bad So we want to keep it looking good All right how we doing Good Good What about right here You need to put it along the edge if you don t follow along the edge There s three buttons if you started one at the top one at the bottom What s missing One in between so let s get them in there Jake you mind getting that one Is that going to be enough to roll all this If not we ll get another roll and finish it out Just go ahead and run with what you got That ll be okay that will lay down beneath Be careful about the top edge of that felt Run that y all can stand on this Get a couple more buttons in between here we re a little far apart right here I like to see two foot Go ahead and hop up here and stand on a button Get you a couple more in the middle and then cap that off Lay it right down the center 
 That s a start ok Devon and Sasha 3 1 3 what are the classifications Natural No not natural Rational Yes rational Real Yes Ok it s rational and it s real Now Brian you had first said natural Yeah I kinda because a fraction isn t natural Ok right a fraction is not natural Who else can tell us something about natural numbers then What do we know about our natural numbers They re the counting numbers Yeah Ok counting numbers what do we mean by that the counting numbers Numbers that you count with Like one two three Ok our natural numbers are our counting numbers So 3 1 3 again was just a Rational Rational and a Real Ok very good somebody else Ok go ahead Natalie Square root of 19 What are the classifications Rational Hold on one second thank you Can you show us your number So the square root of 19 Ok Irrational It s irrational I decided It s irrational Cause it s the square root of a nonperfect number Nonperfect square Nonperfect square Ok so Sasha and Christina both agree that it s irrational and Christina what else did you say I m not sure if they heard It s a nonperfect square Ok it s not a perfect square And it s also real Ok it is irrational and we wanna remember that an irrational number is also a real number even though it doesn t end or repeat How did you know without using your calculator that the square root of 19 was an irrational number It doesn t make a perfect square Ok and how do you know it doesn t make a perfect square Because I have no idea If you multiply two numbers you don t get it Ok very good that s exactly right You actually can multiply two numbers to get 19 It s just a decimal or Yeah it s an irrational decimal It s an irrational decimal ok So you can multiply and we looked at an example of that we did a little activity with the square root of 19 Is it gonna be two whole numbers that you could multiply to get 19 Mm mmm And that s what makes it irrational Compared with if you did like the square root of 16 what two numbers can you multiply to get Four and four Four and four ok good Ok how bout another number Go ahead The classifications of 1 3 Rational and real Ok rational real Anyone wanna throw in anything else about 1 3 Mm hmm The greater the decimal it s repeating Right it s a repeating decimal It doesn t end but it does repeat Ok so if it were If it was you could get a rational number Right and that makes it a rational number very good Ok we looked at several numbers How about someone ask a question Someone wanna throw in a question Ok go ahead Scotty What integers are also whole numbers Ok what integers and let s make sure everybody s having the opportunity to answer questions Repeat that again What integers are also whole numbers Ok so what integers are also whole numbers Two can be a whole and an integer Ok what did you say first Two Ok two is an example it can be an integer and a whole number Positive numbers Positive numbers Ok our positive numbers Negative numbers could be too Can negative numbers be whole numbers though No No It can zero Ok zero Positive numbers Ok who remembers what example did I give you when we re thinking about whole numbers Pets What can help you think about whole numbers Pets Ok Sasha says pets Who can elaborate on what that means The number of pets you have Count the number of pets you have And then we asked for a number or something They wouldn t say like I have 3 4 of a dog or something Ok so if you d ask somebody how many pets they have their answers are always gonna be what A whole number A whole number which and what are our whole numbers Zero one Zero to infinity Zero through all the way Ok mm hmm Zero and all Alright good Good question Scotty Let s have another question Go ahead Luke Is a negative number rational or irrational Ok turn that around so we can see So is a negative number can it be classified as rational or irrational It would be a rational number No A negative number is a rational number It would be both Yeah It would be both If you have the square root of a negative number It s an integer Take the square root of a negative number An integer is always rational so An integer is rational And a negative number is a is rational But his question let s see that again Is a negative number so it could be rational Can we have a negative number that s irrational Can somebody give me an example of that Negative pi Ok negative pi mm hmm The negative square root of two Ok the negative square root of a number Would the negative have to be on the outside or the inside of the pi Outside The pi I mean outside the square root sign So Luke can you conclude us what was your answer to that question Sometimes both Ok it can be both Mm hmm good Alright good question too What about another number What s another number Madison go ahead The square root of 144 Ok the square root of 144 who can give us the different classifications Real Ok Damian says real Natural Natural Whole Whole Integer Yeah Integer Any others Rational Ok it s rational Do you agree Madison Yes Ok very good So we looked at when that s if we look at our graphic organizer when it starts here with natural we read this going out that it has all those different classifications Good Ok how about another number Go ahead Amy What is the difference between these two numbers The negative square root of nine and the square root of negative nine Ok I like that question So what s the difference between those two So on the first example we see the negative on the outside of the square root sign and then we see it on the inside One s real and one s not Ok Damian says one s real and one s not When it s in the inside it s not real Because you can t take the square root of a negative number Exactly we cannot take the square root of a negative number So when we see it on the inside there s not a solution to it What about when it s on the outside You can take the square root of it and just add the negative sign Ok so what would that answer be negative square root of nine Negative three Right negative three Let s talk a little bit more in depth about when that negative is inside the square root why do we not have a solution to that So it was a square root of negative nine Because you can t multiply two numbers to get a negative Right exactly So if we had like the square root of nine what two numbers can we multiply to give us Three Oh nine three and three Three and three and remember how we talked about what is the inverse of taking the square root of a number Squaring it Mm hmm So there s not two numbers we can multiply to give us that negative nine good Alright let s have another number Go ahead Brock Ok 3 14 pi I m glad you showed that number 3 14 That is not pi It s rational and real It s irrational No it s rational It s not rational because it never ends or repeats It is rational Yeah but 3 14 ends Yes it ends It s 3 14 not pi That s not pi Pi doesn t end That one ends pi doesn t end Ok so are we all in agreement that the number pi is an irrational number that doesn t end or repeat Yes But what is Brock s number 3 14 3 14 so that number 3 14 Ends It ends So what are the classifications for that number Rational and real It s rational and real Now when we re working problems like area or circumference of a circle why do we use 3 14 Because it s easier Because it s easier Right could we use a whole number for pi to do a calculation No No way it s gonna end Right it would never end So when we re doing our calculations we use that 3 14 But Brock I m glad you had that number so you know there s that difference Pi doesn t end but just 3 14 does end Mm hmm Square root of negative 41 Ok can you show everyone your number So the square root of negative 41 Not real Ok not a real number But if it was real then and they were on the outside then it d be irrational wouldn t it Ok and why would that be irrational the square root of 41 Mm hmm no two numbers that can multiply Not the same two whole numbers Let me ask you a question about the square root of 41 What if your neighbor came and said I d like for you to help me make a fenced in area for my dog and I want it to be a square and I want the area to be 41 How would you maybe respond to your neighbor Make it 49 Ok Cause it wouldn t be a square It wouldn t be a perfect square If it was 41 Ok so you what did you say Damian To make it like 41 so you could have a seven by or 49 so you could have seven by seven Ok good Or make it a six by six 36 Ok I would tell him to make it way bigger because a dog needs a lot of space No that wouldn t actually be a very big area would it No that would be small Unless maybe it was a small dog Yes A really small dog like a teacup chihuahua Ok how about another question Oh Ok Are repeating decimals ever fractions No Yes 1 3 So you could have a repeating decimal as a fraction Yeah 1 3 Ok 2 6 It s a bunch of threes Yes Ok 1 3 definitely that was the number Damian had a bunch of threes And you said now two what about 2 6 It s repeating also Ok cause that will reduce back to what 1 3 1 3 ok Alright how about another number Ethan Square root of two Alright I don t know if you can see that but the square root of two What if you try to take the square root of two It s irrational Irrational Ok it s an irrational number but it s also a Real Real number good alright Another number that we can look at Maybe someone who s not answered Down here Nicole Five divided by zero Oh that s a good one we ve not had that How about five divided by zero It s not real That s not real Ok not a real number again Can we go a little bit further Why is that not a real number Because there s no longer a number you can multiply by it s zero Anything divided by zero is not a real number Ok I had several of you talking and I do want to hear everyone What did you say Natalie It s undefined Ok we do say that s undefined Michael could you add to that You can t divide anything by zero Ok you can t divide anything by zero And if you look on the overhead if I were to write that out and put five inside as our dividend and zero as our divisor is there a number I can multiply by zero to get five No cause anything times zero is zero So that makes it undefined Ok very good Ok another number Ooh Ooh Ok Cliff go ahead and then Brock you had your hand raised I ll come back to you The square root of 53 Ok hold that up so everyone can see Ok we have the square root of 53 Classifications for square root of 53 Irrational Irrational and Real And real very good Ok Brock how about your number Ok the square root of a prime number is always what Ok Brock s given us a question Can you repeat that again The square root of a prime number is always what Oh that s a very good question Irrational Ok so if it s a prime number and you re trying to take the square root it s always irrational Ethan you said irrational can you expand on that I said the square root of a prime number will always be irrational because you cannot make a square out of a prime number you have to have two for it to be a perfect square You have to have two numbers prime numbers and you have one and the number itself Ok only those two factors right Ok very good Ok maybe another question Mm hmm Is a repeating decimal rational or irrational So if it s a repeating decimal Rational Rational Yes Ok very good how about another question that we could discuss Madison True or false a terminating decimal means the decimal repeats It s false Ok it s false What does that mean Mariah if it s terminating It So if it terminates it It ends It ends right exactly Ok how about another number Anyone an example we ve not had many with integers I see you How about one with a negative number Anybody have one with a negative number Brian you do Ok I have the square root of negative 225 Not real Ok not real again why is that not a real number Because it s negative The decimal s inside Ok well not the decimal is inside but the Negative The negative s inside I wanna throw a number out How about negative 4 5 For the number negative 4 5 Rational Yeah rational Ok it s a rational number and it is a Real number Is it a negative number Yes No Yeah No Hmmm So negative 4 5 Wouldn t that be considered an integer No Because it s not a whole or a natural number Ok very good What do we know we haven t talked too much about integers What do we know about our integers How do we classify an integer That it s whole numbers and their opposites Ok whole numbers and their opposites And we used our number line in class Do we have any fractions or decimals on our number line No So what numbers are not considered integers Decimals Decimals and Fractions Ok so if they have that negative sign in front of them then what do we call em If they re not integers 
 and your ideas and we re learning from each other right Because a lot of times who do we learn from You Each other You learn from me but who else do you learn from Us You learn from each other Okay Kelly if you would move the book away from the projector so we can see the screen We re going to watch another weather forecast and as you re viewing this I want you to pay really close attention to how she Talks How she speaks Okay As a good listener and a viewer what are some things that we need to concentrate on while we re watching this How she her face her expression and how she moves and looks Okay and how are you going to find out if she does those things By watching her You re going to be watching her okay Sarah Watch how her body is moving because Watch her eyes Okay catch your eye And I like that you said watching What are you doing while you re watching Are you just staring at the screen No You are looking at them and you re making eye contact and you re looking you re watching their mouths because there are people who can t really hear so they would read people s mouths and that s really important to do Anything else that you can do while you re viewing this Listening Okay and how are you going to be listening We talked about this a lot How are we going to listen With our ears and with our whole entire bodies With our whole entire bodies Why are we going to listen with our whole entire body Naomi Because if we re listening with our ears then our hands are up here saying Oh I ve got something to say then you re not really listening you re not really listening competently All right can you go ahead and hit play for us please Yup just like you did yesterday Good afternoon I m Julie Wunder with your forecast A north wind five to ten miles per hour Tonight 28 it s going to be partly cloudy out and we can head to a 7 day forecast About a 50 percent chance of rain transitioning over to some snow overnight Saturday and into Sunday Temperatures fall next week what a cold forecast we have Coming up at 5 o clock we ll have the latest on that possibility of snow Turn and talk to your buddy We re going to do two right here two two two I noticed that under one of the clouds we had snow instead of rain Turn your face Okay and what kind of body language did she use She was pointing and So why do you think she was pointing like that Okay And because you saw her looking at you did that make you listen any differently Did it help you listen more or less When she looked away what was she doing Alright so why do you think she wasn t doing this Okay like you say she was like Why is that Would you be listening as well if she were making those faces Or would you her face Right not necessarily what she was saying but you were focusing on her expressions Alright guys let s come back in three two and one Okay you guys had some amazing things that you saw when you watched this little clip What kind of things did you notice Tell me what you and your buddy were talking about We used this chart If she was just like there she was pointing at it so then it made me understand more but if she was just like there When you did your presentation what did you feel like you were looking at My poster You looked at your poster the whole time Okay and the second time when you did your presentation again you said you were really focusing on your eye contact were you able to achieve that goal No No Why not Because I was looking at my poster again You say you were looking at your poster again Okay why do you think you did that Were you nervous What do you think you could ve done to ease that nervousness Take a breath Going to take a breath What do you guys think What could Adrian have done to maybe be a little less nervous when he was doing his presentation He could think about somewhere he was comfortable Okay think about somewhere where s he s comfortable Picture everyone else in their underwear Oh underwear Sarah Be himself and just act like it s just any other day The information we were presenting was it a little bit more in depth than what we usually talk about What do you think Was the topic you were sharing a little bit you have a little bit more information than if you were just sitting here having a conversation Yeah So that make some of us nervous that we have a lot of information trying to remember Yes And then was anyone able to get over that nervousness Okay Sarah how were you guys able to get over that nervousness I followed my goals and I just tried to be myself I just followed my goals and I just had fun Okay do you want to show us part of your presentation where you did that Mhmm Avril will you move the book away from the projector while she gets the computer ready Alright make sure you get to a spot where you can see Got it My project is about Legends of the I m going to start over with Werewolves people think that I don t know why because wolves howl at the moon This is a werewolf a full moon is sometimes called a Wolf s Moon since its yellow This one is my favorite It s about she calls her brother Helius to find her sister Herse The study of geography to the moon is called Selenology Okay this is This is vampires vampires are said to come out on every moon except for new moon I guess because they can see better This is a vampire person trying to get his girlfriend to become a vampire This is people people think to people that are aggressive and violent This is a witch from Okay turn to your buddy for a second Do you think she was able she said she acted like she was comfortable Like it was just any other day Yeah Talk to your buddy about that Do you think that she accomplished that goal Yes Because she s a pretty funny girl right Alright Let s come back together Let s come back together please Alright So her goal she said that she wanted to be more comfortable And she was just going to act like it was any other Day Did she accomplish that Yes Okay How do we know that she accomplished that What do you think Arizona Because she was really comfortable with her surroundings and those people just wanted to get their talking over with and done but Sarah actually talked like we were just talking face to face acting like the camera wasn t even there Okay And as a listener how did Sarah s confidence make you listen better Did it make you listen better or did it not make you listen better It did Okay Why did it make you listen better Levin Because it was fun Because it was fun Okay And what made it fun She was acting like the way she was acting The way she was acting Okay What did you think Dillon Because she s usually funny and she was being quite funny on this Okay And I like to Yup Alright anybody else What were some other goal that you guys created Sit up and join the circle please Alright let s see Someone I haven t heard from yet Isabelle what was one of your goals One of my goals was to stop making really distracting movements because I was like twisting it and twirling it and I was really nervous Alright so that was the first time you did your presentation you felt you were doing too many movements Yeah And so your goal was to cut down on that and why did you choose that as a goal Really when we watched my first video we decided that she said that she was kind of watching that and she couldn t really have her attention stay on what I was saying And did you agree with her Mhmm Okay so what did you do with your second presentation I really was concentr 
 We started testing out our theory that it s an exponential Cause we found out that the ratios Does that verify that it s an exponential equation We thought it did but it doesn t So why aren t you sure I don t know So the more disks I add I m eventually gonna have a cap on the minimum number of moves that I can make Isn t that a logistic function So logistic function would say that you re gonna have a cap on the minimum number of moves you make And it would say at some point you re gonna slow down the number of moves you re adding on Does that make sense based on what you ve done so far No not at all What do you think is gonna happen instead That it would increase And what would that be That s the exponential But the numbers are all really long decimals So I heard someone in here earlier say you were gonna scatter plot this So have you looked at your scatter plot Yes Okay What might be other ways to change an exponential function I can get it out of my backpack Based on what you had before what was your gut instinct with your ratio Before you did any of the arithmetic what did you think your ratio might be Small I don t know I didn t really think it was two automatically But two s in your head Why is two in your head Because doubling Because there s doubling Here s what I m gonna suggest to you guys You ve got your scatter plot on Marissa s calculator right You re thinking that two might have been the ratio Why don t you graph two y equals two to the X and compare it to what s happening on your scatter plot and see if there s a different way that you might be able to change the extremum It s increasing by a factor of 2 She s trying it in an actual game Normally I d want you guys to struggle with it right now but it sounds We re at 20 so what s your goal 27 28 29 30 31 Good job Caitlyn Good job Now I m convinced that that works You re seeing that the difference is doubling each time correct What kind of function is that suggesting Exponential And what do you suspect is probably your factor Two Two So that s what I want you to look at How could you verify that it s an exponential function using any of the tools you have here Once you ve found out this was an exponential function what did you do to figure out what the function actually is There is a little bit of a trick to this one It has to do with some of the other types of changes we do to functions Okay Figure out that When you get stuck again let me know and I ll be back So you think that s two to the power of X minus one Why did you get minus one Because with one it worked fine but with two when you try to put in X as the exponent two to the X so two times two is four So far X minus 1 is the exponent What I m hearing is that you re convinced that the factor is two And you re trying to do some transformations on this to make your y values fit with what you got here is that correct Talk me through again why you guys think that the exponent is x minus one and then why you re adding the one at the end Because there has to be at least one move We added the one at the end because we were looking at just the y values first Oh wait that doesn t work though If you have one so two to the zero is 1 And one plus one is two but that s Tell me more about this idea of the plus one at the end You said that had something to do with why you had to have a plus one Is it a piece of the function That would be really mean We were like well it has to double and then we have to add one on the end I think you guys are in a great place I think you ve got a good idea here which is to take y equals two to the x and find the transformation that gives you this table So try more with the transformation I also like this idea you guys have about how you have to have at least one move but I would think a little bit more about how to pattern your moves that s just that you need at least one move Alright I m going to leave you guys to think I ll come back So we found the equation but now we re stuck at number four Okay so talk to me about the equation and tell me how you found it The difference between I was kinda thinking of how this was relating to the difference so how it would relate to the y values We saw the two to the x we figured oh well two to the four to the 16 Well how do we get to 15 minus one This is going back to the algebra from last year So you saw that you had two to the x You noticed here that we have just two to the x and then you go back one using algebra You also talked about how when you graphed two to the x it matched up with your scatter plot Did it lie directly on your scatter plot No So what do you mean by it matched up It was close It was the same curve So how did you know that created a transformation Because whether it depends on the number or which value it is It changed the steepness of it So we just knew it transformed it somehow Like we had to have it It wasn t the parent function So what made you guys think about doing a minus 1 after two to the x instead of saying four times two to the x or three to the x How did you know that Because if you d done four times two to the x you would have stretched it Because it would have moved to the left too on the graph And what did that end up doing to your y intercept Okay so that would be my next question for you I agree with you guys that definitely there s a transformation I agree with your algebra and your understanding of tables you ve done a nice job with that So how does a transformation what you ve done is you ve taken two to the x what does the minus one do Does that move this to the left Move it up or down Well if you graph it It moves it up Okay So Jamie is saying that she thinks that changing the a value changed the slope of the function And you re saying that you don t think the slope changes Okay so you change the y intercept And do you have a change in the y intercept It s still zero comma zero So you just had two to the x Find out just two to the x What s the y intercept of the graph What happened to your function and how did the function get transformed to achieve that The y intercept moved down And does that match what we ve been talking about You take the function and subtract the value and move down one Alright you guys said you were stuck on number four Yeah Okay Why are you stuck So we figured out that you put But the minus one doesn t do anything Yeah the numbers are so big that it doesn t matter It actually does change the actual number a little teeny tiny bit But our calculator can t see that number It looks like the same number on your calculator So we have a number of moves If each move is a second then how long is it gonna take for the world to end Alright now you guys are also at the challenge question down here Which is based on the patterns you were seeing and how the pieces were moved Why is your function which is correct match the way the patterns that were made Okay And I ll be back in a little bit I m going to give you guys about seven more minutes You should answer question four before you try that So I got it kind of close Looking at just I did what you do to find a normal exponential equation I plugged in y two over y one and then to the square root of four And are you getting consistent ratios between those y values of yours No You guys are correct that this is exponential But if we re not getting a consistent ratio between y values then that suggests that your original thought which was to start with two to the x and do a transformation is on the right track So I really think you need to go back to y equals two to the x and find the transformation that gets you to these y values Okay I m gonna make a suggestion to you again stealing from another group Try finding the differences between all these y values and see if you can see a pattern between the differences and the actual y values you have Alright what have you guys got Our answer was 30 Talk me through how you got that function and how you know it works I realized that the table matches the graph of two to the x but minus one So you just have that in your head Did you graph it or did you just know those numbers in you head We didn t graph it We used the tables to confirm that it was y equals two to the x minus one Went to the table and it was the same numbers And I noticed here you ve got 2 to the 64th minus one What s that for That s from another number It s like a really high number One point eight times Two to the 19th While you guys figure out how long it s gonna take for the world to end with that really huge number I d also like you to think about the answer to the challenge You guys spent a lot of time looking at the patterns and how these pieces are moved So I d like you to think about why your function has two to the x Why are you doubling those 
 You each have your own set And I m going to ask you to put them out in front of you in in so you can see all the words Can we put them in two rows One Two three four five six Let s put them in two rows One two three four five six Now I wanna play Wait a minute show me I m going to ask you to point So get your pointer finger in show me under Yes under good Take a look at the word under good Wait

Alright Be careful with this one listen to my words Ready Show me Saw Good Excellent alright Show me ready They alright Excellent Alright Show me was Wow That s good Show me want Alright now You did a great job Now we re going to hide your words so turn your cards over all by yourself Now you can t see them right Keep them in the rows Good Alright keep them in a row Alright now oh your going to do it that way Okay wait a minute now Now we re going to take turns Let s see who s sitting nicely Alright You re going to turn over a card Lewis and tell me what the word is Put it down Want I want my toys I want my toys yes good You turn over a card Oh what s your word Under I see the cat under the bed alright Lewis turn over another card under oh you got under as well what s your sentence I am hiding under the bed I am hiding under the bed that s a good one Under the table Let s see Jessica go ahead do another one Now think look at your letters was Yes I was eating I was eating Good Look at your letters let them help you Don t help They There There yes There is my toy in the bed There is my toy in the bed Okay alright how about you Jess Oh what do you have There Good can you use it There is a car in my mail There is a car in your mail Wow That would be interesting Alright Lewis your turn Now look at your letters let them help you They Yes They was a cat in my car Okay this there was a cat in my car They tried to get the cat out of the car Okay They belongs means people They Okay Let s see what you have Oh look at you Today is the day Aaah this word is they The children that would be they Let s take a look at this word this is one we are misunderstanding They Jessica and Lewis they came to the reading group Okay They had turkey for Thanksgiving They have alright They came to my birthday They came to my birthday Can you think of a sentence for they They What did your brothers do They play basketball There you go they play basketball there you go that s better Okay You have another card to turn over But it s my turn I got mixed up I got Lakers socks You got what Nothing Say that again What did you say about the I got socks No this is saw This is I saw you when I I saw a movie I saw a big alligator I saw a big alligator I saw a dinosaur I saw a dinosaur Last one was was Okay Where was my friend Where was my friend good I want candy I want candy Okay Now watch what I m going to do I m going to put the cards together I m going to mix them up and I m going to turn them over We re going to play our matching game okay Alright What happened My brother put gum in there and when I point I can t get out of there Oh boy alright now Jessica you went first before right So we have Lewis go first this time Would that be fair Yes Alright Lewis you re going to turn over a card you re going now listen to me Listen to me This is how we re going to play You re going to turn over a card and you re going to read it Then you re going to turn over another card then you re going to read it Wait a minute wait a minute If look at me sweetie If you get a match you want to keep the pair You have to put the word in a sentence Can you do that Let s see Go ahead Okay take a look Take a look take a look Shh don t tell him don t tell him Was This word is was Let s see okay now pay attention Jessica so you can remember where they are Your turn Pick another card Lewis Oh it s so close What word is this Saw saw Okay Here is was Turn it over turn it over And here s saw Good Okay Jessica s turn Want Good want She read it They Not a match Good wait a minute wait a minute wait before you do that Wait before you do that They want They want candy Okay watch Lewis Who remembers what was this one What was this one No peeking Do you remember what it was Jessica Was Was good What was this one Saw What was this one They and what was this one Want Good alright They No its not they Careful take another close look Look at the whole word There Now sorry about that Good good They Is it a match is that a match No but we ve seen that word What s this word They Go to your chair now and sit Okay There and they I m going to hide them again Now let s see if Jessica remembers They and they Okay now stop You want to use it in a sentence Let s see how we do They have a dog They have a dog Good job Alright you get that one Okay Lewis let s see how you do Go ahead You can do it Oh What s that word Under Under Pick another one under No way Alright Under Okay let s see a nice sentence I m going to listen for a good one I am under my brother can t find me because I m under the table Your brother can t find you because you re under the table Can you give me a sentence for under Um I hide under the bed I hide under the bed excellent okay Now it s Jessi Oh Want Do you remember where it was Jessica Wow Now wait a minute let s see if you can think of a sentence Jessica first I want a cake I want a cake What would you want I want a brownie I want a ice cream Okay Okay alright try another one Oh Is that match No No what s this word Lewis They Come back over here and take a good look at it This word is saw Jessica s going to get it Now wait a minute maybe not maybe not saw uh eh eh ah uh was Was okay Yeah but that s okay those two we mixed up Let s take a good close look at them Which one is was Which one is saw Okay alright now listen to your first sound I m going to hide them again Let s see if we can remember Go ahead Lewis Your turn Was and which one Was There you go was Give me a sentence for was I was in my bed I was in my bed Let s hear Jessica s sentence for was I was I was in the bus I was in the bus alright Let s see pick another one Take a look at the first letter Saw Okay and what s that one saw Okay now a sentence for saw Wait a minute before you count your card A sentence for saw I saw something you see oh I saw a saw a candy You saw a candy where was the candy On the floor I saw candy on the floor Did your little brother dump it on the floor Okay I would eat it You have the last one They It s not they I want you to think again Look at all the letters Don t tell him don t tell him There Okay give me a sentence wait a minute give me a sentence with it There was a huge table There was a huge table where In my kitchen There was a huge table in my kitchen before you count your cards can you give me a sentence with the word there There is a snowman at the window There is a snowman on the window what a great sentence How many cards do you have one two three four five six seven I got six Alright we re going to do one more thing with these words to practice We have a word that we are having trouble with We re going to come over here Over to the board We re going to take a look at this word that we re having trouble with Thank you for getting her a marker I m going to ask you to write this word on the board Oh a line you know what she s telling you right Okay let s take a look at this word Are you ready This word is Jess that s good Alright This word is saw Let s see if we can write it Saw Jessica I want you to write saw Look at the word There it is Saw Okay 
 Everybody s using their directions they have their tools and their charts out We ve found today s date so we know where we re going to record today It s Wednesday March Ninth I know what numbers down of zero mean They are negative numbers That s what are numbers that are down from zero OK I have most friends with their hands on their heads I want to make sure everybody s listening and ready to move on We can keep all of our materials out so we can actually use them Excellent I m waiting on a few more people to have their hands off of their materials and on their heads so we can concentrate on the teacher In each group I have one team member that will be measuring temperature If you are measuring the temperature please hold up your tool that you ll be using Those of you measuring the temperature what tool are you using Everybody Thermometer Very good The people that are measuring the temperature with the thermometers please line up at the back door of the classroom When you get out there boys and girls are you going to be able to see the temperature as soon as you get out there What are you going to have to do Look at the thermometer And you can also compare it to the thermometer that s been outside so go out there and you can let your thermometers adjust to the temperature of outside If you have a windsock and you are going to measure the direction of the wind I would like you to line up quietly at the back door of the classroom You guys can use the compass and work together go ahead out and see what you observe If you have an anemometer to measure wind speed you may line up If you have a ruler to measure precipitation in our rain gauges you may line up You may all go And last but definitely not least if you are measuring the When we look at this our thingy goes away No yours is 61 No it s the Fahrenheit not the Celsius There s something in there What team are you 66 You guys we need to wait for how many seconds It s not ready yet You ve been doing it at home What is it that you ve been waiting How can it be 110 How can it be Now we are going to set the timer for 10 seconds and we are going to count how many times it went around OK So see where your is and get ready to start counting Look at the bee I ve heard both of these ladies say two What you need to do is you need to use that chart in there and see what it means What is the wind speed if the anemometer goes around two times in 10 seconds Look with your eye with one eye look at this one I can t see I think it s going West When you have completed measuring you may walk back to your group to record your data Quietly I got 66 Can we compare it to what s on the wall there and see what we have It got 66 then it got 65 and then it got 64 Victor could you explain it all to me why you think you thermometer keeps going down Because it gets colder And where has the thermometer been sitting all day In there And do you think it s cooler out here or is it warmer out here Cooler Exactly So our temperature is going Down Good So let s go ahead and look right here to make sure we can tell the temperature from our thermometer that s been staying outside It s getting brown What do we think the temperature is there It says the temperature is 46 degrees That s probably our most accurate reading since it has been staying outside all day long All right You can head back in and record I don t know which number to choose The one on the outside the whole time What s your Gym It s on Wednesday March Ninth It was West The wind direction was West The wind direction was West Very good I think that you have an accurate reading What s the wind speed It s cloudy Wind direction temperature Team Three is working together and Team Two and Team One Nice job working together I think you have to change it Temperature Victor What was the temperature 40 degrees 46 degrees Fahrenheit It was 50 What was the wind speed It s not raining So what did you guys think the was I agree with you Why would we forecast that it might rain What s the weather The weather is rainy West Put West It was West It was West We found out that the wind speed we said it went around about that many times so how fast is the wind actually going Minutes Miles per hour We don t go anywhere in a minute We travel like we said in cars in miles Right Go back to your group they ll tell you on the chart My thermometer s higher than the one outside We discussed that while we were standing out there Why do you think that that may not have dropped as far down or might even be going back up as you re holding it inside right now Because inside of you it s warm Because you told us that it was when you re holding the thermometer the thermometer only feels what s around it And if we re covering the thermometer it can t measure any more temperature only how our temperature is Very good So Linda if that answered your question that s why we compared it to the thermometer that s been staying outside that we check each day What are we going to say that the temperature was from that thermometer reading out there 46 degrees Fahrenheit Excellent so make sure you re sharing that and each person in your group use your data Linda I think you ve done an excellent job OK We have a few minutes left and some groups are getting to the point where they have finished recording their data after working with their team members on each type of weather and using the different weather instruments I am going to pass out your follow up questions and you re going to use data from last week and compare it to today s data to do some equations on here and you do not have to finish today We will do this in our follow up lesson in our next science lesson OK You may continue working Thank you Write your name and date and you can put it back in your packet when you clean up OK the wind direction Who should you be asking that to Today s Last Wednesday the temperature was What is the degrees between today s temperature and the temperature last Wednesday Write an equation Show your work Last Wednesday the wind speed was eight miles per hour What is the difference between You already have your paper I know We can do it by ourselves But it says to work as a team I like it Good job Keep working with your team I hear her saying Excellent I like how I see Brianna using her data And Grace starting to write an equation and Abby and Samaya have the date on their paper You guys are all doing an excellent job Who is the person on your team whose job was to measure what direction it went You should ask that person as soon as he comes back he should have his data on his chart What number did you put there We worked together and we figured it out I know this one I know this one I know that one One second 
 We are now getting into Earth Sun and Moon interactions We have done one thing well we have done several things all year on that first slide which you copied onto your board What is it The moon phases The moon phases You do the moon phases every day So you should be pretty familiar with moon phases what they are how they happen all that good stuff We get to move on Okay Let s start with something you do know What is a moon phase Tom It s what well it s technically when you look up in the sky and like what light you see in the moon Good What light you see in the moon Where does the light come from The green she s reflecting The sun The sun How does that work The sun shines on the moon and reflects back Good the sun shines on the moon and reflects back So that s how we see the moon Do you agree with that I see most of you agree Good Okay Then if we know that it comes from the sun why don t you tell me some of the moon phases so we can build on what you just told me What are some of the moon phases This one should be easy Waxing crescent Waxing crescent excellent Aisha Waxing gibbous Waxing gibbous very good Grillen Waning crescent Waning crescent Bailey Full moon Full moon Tom Waning gibbous Waning gibbous Ramos 1st quarter 1st quarter excellent New moon New moon excellent Last quarter Last quarter Third quarter Third quarter and last quarter very good When we talked in the last class some of you said Second quarter Then the second quarter is half time so that would be what moon phase What s halfway in between first and third What moon phase is that Full moon Yay full moon yay Yeah just start spouting everything out and then eventually you ll be right That works for me Yeah it s a full moon Get it half full Or not okay So we have all these moon phases How can you tell which one s which Why don t you just look up and say Yay it s a fingernail How do you tell which one s which Because different moon phases look different How does it look different Because It s okay Because different parts of the moon have light on it in different amounts Okay different parts of the moon have different amounts of light on it How would I be able to tell a waxing something from a waning something You re almost almost there Yeah I think you will because the moon has different kinds of faces Good very good Different kinds of faces One lights up on the left side and the other lights up on the right side Which one lights up on the right side The waxing How do you know that Because um Well you always told us it s light on the right it s wax iting Yeah it s light on the right it s wax iting Or what you guys like to do Wax on wane off Or wane off I don t know wax on Okay So I don t have a problem I don t think that you have a problem knowing the different phases of the moon I think you guys are pretty set on that How about what causes the phases of the moon What makes that happen You ve already told me light reflecting off the moon that comes from the sun but why would you have parts Why wouldn t you just be able to see the whole thing all the time Sean Because the earth blocks out some of the light that s coming from the moon Okay good Brenda Because the earth rotates with time and when the earth rotates the earth blocks the sun so you can see maybe at the top of the moon Okay good Tom There are other stars shining in different directions not just the sun Okay very good Stars shining at different directions Anything else Nancy Because the moon is moving and so Okay as the moon moves we see different phases So I hear a lot of that the earth blocks the moon the sun from reaching the moon Are you in agreeance Yeah A little bit Yeah yeah somewhat Okay Here s what we re gonna do You have won the experiment You ve done the flip camera But what I want you to do on your table everybody has like a big lollipop You either have the blue styrofoam ball you have the big white styrofoam ball you have a little styrofoam ball I want you each person in your group to have one of those styrofoam balls Okay And then you are going to come this way Down in your light paths You are gonna come up front and gather around my lovely light bulb Okay Come forth children And you might wanna squat down if you re near the front Yay I know it s bright Good Can t see Oh you can t see okay alright Oh Okay what I want you to do and you re already doing it hold it out in front of you I want you to look at your moon What am I holding in my left hand The sun The light bulb the sun You have the moon yay Here hold it out in front of you What moon phase do you have on your moon Aisha New moon New moon Why is it a new moon Because you can t see any light You can t see any light I can see lots of light It s blinding me Oh there we go But there s a light source Isn t my moon illuminated Becky It s illuminated on one side but since you re behind it you don t see any of the light coming Well then how do I know it s illuminated Because you can see other light Oh So I look across from me and I see Sean Sean you have a full moon Now you re supposed to disagree with me and tell me that no you don t Oh okay Um What moon do you have A new moon No you don t you have a full moon He has a waxing moon No he doesn t he has a full moon You all are crazy Look It s illuminated on the other side Okay Oh yeah you could do that But then wouldn t your head be in line with the earth It doesn t make any sense But that is one way that we can figure out that the moon is illuminated Not that we have 15 different moons or 28 or however many people we have But just because we re looking at a new moon doesn t mean that the moon s not illuminated it s just the other side So I look across and I can see full moon across from me What else can you see from where you re standing Tell me what you see and where you see it Yes Over there with Zack and Sarah I see fullmoon Okay good Over there I see a waning gibbous Really I see a waxing gibbous Uh Becky I see a full moon over at Zack Nice I see a waxing gibbous with Charlese I see a full moon Well I see a waxing gibbous Why Why do you see a waxing gibbous and I see a full moon Because we re in different places What s that got to do with anything I thought y all told me that we saw moon phases because the Earth s shadow blocks the sunlight from reaching the moon How can we see moon phases then Tiffany Ooo Kaitlyn Line of sight Line of sight What does that mean Um Besides your sight in a line It s um well Because sunlight s here it looks like a new moon but if the sunlight were like over there it wouldn t Huh Interesting Brooke Well I m just suspecting that Lauren turns kind of the moon out of view then like I couldn t see a shadow I could only see the new moon Oh because oh well oh Lauren s head is in the way Look at if the Earth was in the way that If the Earth was in the way would that cause a moon phase Yeah Is the Earth in the way of the moon all the time No What could we call Sorry What do we call it when we have the Earth and the moon and the sun lined up or if the moon is blocking light from getting to the Earth or if the Earth is blocking light from getting to the moon Bailey An eclipse An eclipse Have we talked about an eclipse before A little bit Just a little bit So is there anything in between me well is there anything between the moon and the sun In my No No vicinty because if I ask you you re gonna be like Yeah Lauren s head is in the way She s blocking all the light There s nothing in between me and the light source yet all around you re saying you see different moon phases Correct Mmm hmm Mmm hmm I want you to think about that Why you can see different phases on my styrofoam ball but there s nothing in between us Because the moon and the earth is at a different angle Ooh Cause the earth is at a different angle Because of our position Your positions Very interesting Here s what I m willing to have you do You all have a light bulb some work some don t I know there was at least one group in the last class that blew a light bulb So you might have to share but I m gonna have you go back to your seats Some of you have three people Some of you have four people Some of you have two Daniel you have three now I want you to set yourselves up in an arrangement around your light bulb where you personally can see four different moon phases or three different moon phases depending on how many people are in your group So you need to be able to see if there are four of you four different moon phases You stand there You hold it and if you get it raise your hand for me now Okay that was your challenge You don t have to fill anything You don t have to do anything Off you go Try not to blow it Alright move Michael Where do you think it s gonna be Put it like this Okay It doesn t have a switch It s just automatically on and off Yay we made it Nice Are we getting there Okay Okay since you have four people you re going to position yourselves differently than they are They only have three So you re gonna think think about a clock Where on the clock will you put everybody so you can all see four different moon phases from your angle Well one can go at twelve Twelve twelve six and nine and three Like a cross Do it I don t think we can put anybody over there And then tell me when you get it We can t put anybody over there So that ll be like twelve this ll be like Well we need a camera for it Right there we re not using a camera Okay Well now So Brenda can stand there Brooke can Or we can do like um like this kinda way I ll be here she ll be there and she ll be there and you ll be at the corner Yeah Okay So take your moon It won t move until you stand there and hold it No I see yours New moon No it looks like a waxing Excellent ladies and gentlemen I have a group who has it Ooo it looks like I have another group who has it Ooo I have another group who has it Somebody tell me If you equate it to a clock where are you standing Tell me what numbers you re standing on Jamie Uh oh Oh Forget about that For one moment we had it She s on number one She s sitting at four On a clock She s nine She s three and six and twelve Good So one of the ways you can do it is twelve three six nine You can do it that way Or you could actually scoot yourselves a little differently you could rearrange yourselves and see something besides What are you moon phases that you have Um that s waxing gibbous Waxing gibbous There s full moon new moon and this looks like I see full I see new and then if you re at nine and three I should only be able to see half What would those things be Mmm Go ahead First and third quarter Good first and third quarter I want you guys to see if you can figure out different arrangements to make it Okay Something besides those four And you got it too Okay we could Get a And then someone could be Could be right there and right there Yeah I see a full moon I see a full moon I just see a full moon Because your the light source I see a full moon and a I see a full moon I just see a full moon Do you see a half moon here I see a full moon Well Now do you wanna switch out Okay I ll take it Okay it s blinding Ooo yay Oh yeah I see a new moon and I like see a Everybody got it at least once Yep Yep Okay do me a favor unplug your light bulb and come back to your group Okay Was there anything in between you well actually your moon and your sun No No So does your theory or your hypothesis that the Earth blocks the light from reaching the moon still work No Carolyn says no Tom Technically it can work because when you have a I forgot what kinda eclipse it s called but it s an eclipse of the moon it goes like all red or something we had it this year and the Arth Earth arth The Earth is blocking it in a way worse Okay so is that going to change the phase of the moon nightly Becky No She says no Do you agree So what changes the phase of the moon Ben The way we see it from Earth The way we see it from Earth Agree Yes Ah interesting Now when you did the experiment before when you did it with a flip camera we re gonna re watch some of those videos I m just gonna do the montage so it s not necessarily gonna be your entire class but we re gonna go through and you need to critique each one You need to figure out do they do something wrong Do they do something correct Do you need to do something with that Do you need to re think your flip camera video Because we re gonna do it again after we get finished with this Make sense Are you sure Mmm hmm Are you positive Mmm hmm Let s watch the first one Okay Let me play it for you again See the phases Yeah Alright now I want you to tell me Besides being blinded What did they do correct What was right They were in a orbit not around the sun just a orbit Excellent they were not orbiting around the sun a k a the lightbulb What did they do incorrect They didn t call out the phases Okay they didn t call out the phases They didn t orbit orbit the camera They did The camera was in the middle So it went around So that s okay Think about that They went around There s even something wrong 
 About 33 33 so 150 plus 33 180 What d you get 180 180 so is that Did we double Went a little higher Went a little higher So you guys made a good prediction didn t you All right keep doing your trials nice work Heads up Madison Heads up Ah Can you stop it No you re good All right so what have you guys found out so far We ve been increasing but then we just It increased a little but I think we re gonna increase a little more Okay so you re measuring You ve all you ve raised your ramp to 10 Yes All right All right Now what was your prediction It would go farther based on height Because like from all the other experiments that we ve done Uh huh It s gone farther so And it has more force if the ramp is higher Okay Man that ambulance that thing moves All right what did you guys get Mary Robin when you measured We got 179 179 okay What was weird is that Like what s weird is that on the first trial we got 130 and then we went to like the like 50s and things Okay And then we went back to like the 80s and 90s Yeah All right so now we need to go ahead and do what You ve done your three trials what s the next Average Average All right let s see We got 182 172 and 179 533 533 and then what are you going to do Divide it by three Okay divide by three 177 666667 So we can round that up to To 178 178 Is that pretty close So you got Your trials are pretty close together 182 172 and 179 So you predicted that it would increase by raising the ramp Was that true Yes So your prediction came true Let s turn over the back side and let s finish the rest of that lab part So were there any trials that your team did not record We only did it We didn t do that one because it flipped off It like hit this chip card and it just like went whoo It went like All right that s a good one not to include Let s write that down We didn t include one because it hit a chip hard Yeah Yeah that s good It just like flew off to the side and it went all the way like Did it really Yeah it just That s crazy It was funny because It was also funny because it was going straight but then it just That s weird Turned That s weird that it hit that That that caused it to you know make such a turn But then like The whole time it s been going to the the right side Oh okay So it s been curving Yeah it kind of like tilted and That s a good idea Yeah that s a real good idea Okay so question two What was the average distance the Jeep rolled with the five centimeter height So the five centimeter height On the back side of that We got an average of 30 93 93 all right so write that one down 93 Did that surprise you it would go 93 Yeah Yeah Is that farther that s what you thought I never thought we d actually get to the end of it Yeah that s a But then we actually did with those little toy cars Yeah And this is actually an older looking toy car Yeah Because whenever I roll one wheel the other wheel rolls just a little Oh yeah Okay So you thought maybe the wheels would have something to do with it Yeah Okay But I never thought it would actually go that far Okay So you re now on number three right What was the average distance the Jeep rolled 10 centimeter height That was 178 Okay So 178 It looks like the next question is did the Jeep roll shorter or longer distance Longer Longer Can we figure out how much farther Yes What would we have to do The 10 centimeter average minus the 5 centimeter average and then your answer would be how Like the distance between Well why don t you do that Why don t you pull that up The 178 You know it s always better when you can incorporate those into your answers You know it increased by one Or it was 85 higher It s always better when you can show your answer with data When you can increase that it makes your answer seem more valid right All right so maybe can include that and then move on to that number five there Okay All right You guys are doing a great job Hey have you guys gone through everything you needed to do on the front side Did you read all these first You gotta read this whole section of your lab first okay Yeah so I would read this part first and then move on okay All right All right how you guys doing Good All right so you guys have done your first trial on this one Now did you do this one here I don t Let s look at our directions It says change the ramp back to five centimeters high Did you do that No sir Okay let s do that All right Sandpaper And then I think it Doesn t it say It says tile floor It says tile floor so we re going to measure on the tile I get to race it All right are we ready Now I m going to move over here Now what vehicle we got here You should move over there because it always goes over here Oh it always moves over here Yeah It has a curve Yeah How about if I move back over here Will that work All right you ready Right here Yeah that s good Oh you re right Good thing I moved I ll hold it down Hold that down Now in your first experiment Annie while they re doing this what did it When you increased the height of the ramp did it increase Yeah it went faster It went what It went faster because it had more force Okay so it had more force So why do you guys think by increasing the height of the ramp on the first lab it had more force All right It s more steeper Okay And the more steeper it is the more less friction it would cause so it could go faster Okay What was the force that was bringing it down the ramp Gravity Gravity So you can you conclude from your model experiment that when you increase the steepness of the ramp the pull of gravity is greater Yeah because it s going more Okay all right It s going down going faster Okay And then when it gets if it gets down safely it ll just go farther because it has more speed Okay Great All right so we re on trial two aren t we Yes Let s do it Go You do have that it does have that curved roll Oh it landed on the On the back of it There s like a cargo of some sort in the back of it Is it is there a There s cargo in the 113 Wait wait hold on Let s double check What I would do maybe is bring your Jeep over Yeah but then it s 106 No but then it s Oh you re on the Are you going to the front Yeah Okay 113 yeah you re right No but then you re going at an angle And you don t let it go Yeah I mean either way I think you re going to get a As long as you That s the way we re doing it from here Well you know as long as you do the same thing every time then you should be consistent right Yeah All right one more roll right One more And then we have it yeah One more roll Jordan Here we go Then we have to add them all up Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun Dun dun dun dun dun The only thing is that Is that farther Don t you think it s farther Are we ready Maybe it s because of me Do you think you have anything to do with it Yeah You do huh Go Fire 117 How far 117 117 all right 117 So now wait Now Thiago the math whiz has to do his math All right so how do you find the average again We do We do We add them all up and then we divide it by the number of times you rolled it Okay let s do it So we rolled it three times You ready Let s find our average Pencil please Oh you guys aren t even using a calculator No we haven t been We only use it for the division Oh you only use it for the division Hey I like that Sometimes sometimes Sometimes we still need it What do you guys got 10 That s zero 10 To zero add up the Four and three So 340 So you re going to take 340 and then you re going to divide it Divided by three And Thiago can usually do that You get 113 3333333 All right well check it out on a calculator just to make sure Okay How can you do that in your head without a calculator I don t know Yeah but how do you do that What did you say the number was Thiago It was 113 33333 All right here we go It s 113 come on Thiago 113 333333333 He got it All right nice job man All right so 113 Is that pretty consistent though Yeah Yeah because we had a 113 Yeah you did And that was your middle score wasn t it Yeah And really if you take the thing And then we gotta do this one No never mind I think if you take four here and you put it here Yeah if you take three here put it here then you have one more here Yep All right So now what we re going to do it says to add sandpaper to the bottom of the ramp Which we did And predict whether it s going to go We ll have to redo those won t we Yeah So let s erase those because you had the ramp at how high 10 centimeters 10 and we needed to We need to have an equal trial We need to have it at the same distance right Yeah So the question is Sit up for me Jordan I know we got a lot of space here What are we going to Do you think it s gonna go shorter or a farther distance It s gonna go shorter Why Because there s more friction Sandpaper s rough so it creates more friction Okay Slow down the thing Okay what do you think When it slows it down it may slow it down and then it says the car starts to turn just because Just because it s our car goes out to the side so it goes more to the side All right Than it usually does What do you guys think Farther or shorter I think it ll go shorter because The gravity may be pulling it down but the sandpaper is really rough like Thiago said and it would like stop it to make it not move anymore It would like barely get off the paper Okay can you guys like Say you re riding your bike And you ride your bike on smooth pavement and then you ride it on a rough surface Is it easier to ride on the smooth or the rough Smooth The smooth right So can we use that to help us make our prediction It actually could be faster on the bumps more because if you hit a bump If you re going fast enough and you hit a big enough bump you could actually go in the air Okay maybe All right let s go and test this thing out and see if you guys are right Annie while we re setting up this lab can you go ahead and write your prediction And it looks like you need to grab your sandpaper there Now I can t sit here can I This is the bad seat I gotta move Well I say you sit It doesn t go very far anymore on the sandpaper All right well let s set it up there That one there right And that one there Four centimeters more All right let s look We went 113 With the sandpaper how far do you think it s gonna go Let s make a prediction I think it ll go maybe half that or even less than half that Okay so what would half of 113 be What s that close to I don t know I think that would be maybe 500 500 and No you want half of it Oh five okay Half of it 50 I think there you go 50 yeah 50 All right 52 51 point 50 point like Okay All right are we ready for the first roll Let s do it Let s get our first trial Here we go We re ready Wait who hasn t rolled Has Emma not rolled Okay all right good I like the way your group s working together there All right Here we go Oh Should we use that trial or should we try a different one Try again Let s try one more Maybe we can get that Well scoot it right over here And we could even scoot the sandpaper like there Yeah All right you ready All right there it is It didn t even move off the sandpaper Let s give it Can someone hold that down Can someone hold that down please Here we go This is our test Is the prediction right The sandpaper s hard It is it s rough isn t it Yeah 49 Now aren t you on the front Yeah which would be a 49 Yeah but you mean Or maybe you re about 50 Yeah about 50 You guys were pretty close in your prediction weren t you Half It was like 50 Yeah Jordan said 50 1 2 All right you guys got two more trials right I said 51 1 2 You said 51 1 2 All right ready Yeah Oh man Really Let s like keep it down Or maybe we ll hold it down next time yeah Yeah I think that s the problem It s scooting back That was 50 47 Yeah 47 Okay Almost in half All right I ll hold it on this side Are we ready Here we go 
 You re not doing your job Follow the arrow Good Just a little bit Why Why do we say the wiffle Because it Because nothing in it It s holes Then is it the holes and nothing in it makes it heavy or light Light Light Good Next what do we have to do We have all our arrows down Good Exactly Okay Thank you Someone needs to hold this here I have a job for you Come hold the clip Hold this here Hold this here Come around here Come here sweetie Right here Hold this Okay now let s count Go to there and I ll help Okay Good Good boy Oh no Uh oh Put it in the basket Put it in the basket Good You have to help her count I need to hear you Should I could count 30 No No It s not far When this is 20 21 Good Is that more than the wiffle ball This one More than this Is this one more Sebastian Yes Good Good 52 Write your 52 down What s the problem What What have you done here Okay I see working on her turn She hasn t done anything Because we re not helping What Which one did you roll You don t need this You re not to this point yet First you re doing the rolling Okay You need to move to the side Now help her Okay Good Wait wait wait Oh okay Good Now it s turn Okay now You help her by holding the end No it s fine I can tell what it is You re doing a good job Someone needs to hold this end right here Hold the end right here Okay now Perfect Now we have to help her count So she can write her numbers down Okay start with the first one the wiffle ball How far is the wiffle ball Starting 10 here Is this 10 Where s the 10 Good You think that s how far it is Okay so write that down Put in wiffle ball I said I m next I said I m next I m looking now at asked about yours I think you have your numbers in the wrong spot Which went further Wiffle ball Which one Which one went far The baseball okay Because I think on our list you have them written backwards We ll fix them We ll find them with the right picture Okay let s see what the problem is The one s got to go on this side Please help her count where the baseball is Count with her 14 Is there a faster way we could ve done that By doing what By doing what Exactly by counting by 10s We could ve started here and gone 20 20 and then count from there You re right Good So who s next Steven Now what s going on here Sarah was saying something What s happening No remember you did this Together count them 20 Well let s look It does look like 3 Yes Good Write it on the board But you two can start And then you two can start You hold the Good Mark it Good Where does the ball go Put it in the basket Excellent Help the boys now You can hold the ramp It looks like it s about to fall Too late Wait wait All the things to say Now with the rubber ball Exactly This one s called the what Wiff Wiffle ball Wiffle ball What happened with the balls Hold it Let me look at yours You got yours done What happened with yours What happened with the baseball It went Which one went the farthest This one How about yours Which one of yours went the farthest Yeah the baseball Remember we talked about that The ball should be in the basket so it doesn t go under the chair counting What happened No but what happened here Someone has to hold it you re right Can you hold it Good That s better 30 This is 50 50 start again each one 51 Pablo Which one of the balls went furthest The baseball What did we talk about when we said at the beginning Which ball did we think was going to go the farthest The baseball Why did you think it was going to go furthest Because right Yes How about yours And Sarah s too Did the baseball go the farthest That far That was a hard push exactly That was a soft and that was a soft Which one was the softest Two Which one was a really soft push The wiffle ball Why Why did we say that Because the ball Just a little bit What happened when you weighed the ball When you put them in the balance The baseball get s heavier The baseball was heavier Baseball needed nine magnet weights you re right You remember It was heavy Good you re absolutely right Okay help him count to his wiffle ball Hold the end 
 Okay would the person who is currently writing please stand up Alright nice and loud What did you guys put And why Nicholas Carnatkey created the perfect tangent of calculating all the key transient effects on the core to predict to create the perfect amount of work Okay very good John nice and loud Marie Curie Okay Discovered that radiation Okay What about you guys Alright Two claps for these neighbors Sit down Pass the board one person What would be this is an opinion question what do you think would be the result if scientists didn t communicate their findings to the community at large Go Do we need to write this down on the board Just give a bullet sentence Do we have to pick a scientist for this one To prove it Nope This is just an opinion Just give me like a one word bullet would be fine Okay Pass the board one person And would that person please stand up Troy what did you guys have There would be multiple theories on how things worked Society would be stagnant and Newton s hypothesis Newton was actually asked by a college of scientists about the thoughts of gravity and stuff and he didn t think it was important So when he found out a few months before that he didn t publish it until they asked him about it and then he republished to them so they could hang out with everybody else Okay Excellent What do you guys have There would be no uniform units therefore there would be no real way to judge one s discovery and you couldn t really bounce one idea off another Okay What d you guys have We said that we wouldn t have the technology that we have today because scientists tend to go off of what other scientists have done Because I know that Celsius went off of Newton s ideas of how the poles were flat and so he went on an expedition and found out that they were Okay Very good Alright Two claps for all our neighbors Pass the board one person Okay I like this one If you could interview any of the scientists that we ve looked at today who would it be and what one question would you be sure to ask Okay Go Okay Stop right there Pass the board one person Please stand up Please stand up Who s going from this group Andy Super Okay Nice and loud Let s use active listening John who would you guys pick and what question would you ask Marie Curie I said it right And what question would you ask dear If she got any oppression from the male scientists Okay The oppression from the male scientists I like it What about you guys We would ask Thomas Edison What inspired you to create the phonograph Excellent Okay Back there Who would you pick and what We were also going to ask Thomas Edison to see how other people felt about his invention of light bulbs Of the light bulb specifically Okay Brandon We had Albert Einstein and our question would be how did he come up with all his theories if he couldn t pass high school math Okay What d you guys put We picked Oppenheimer and we would ask why he went into this If he realized what he actually made You probably can t see it but they have written on the board The Manhattan Project Okay Very good And you guys Oppenheimer What his thoughts were of the morality of the atomic bomb Okay This is a really great segway to what we re going to do next Big claps for all these guys Please move into your catwalk formation Find a partner Go In ten Without the boards Just yourself Just your bodies Nine Eight Seven Six Five Oh we have a partner whose hand is up Four Looks like there we go Three Two One Be sure to oh we need a real quick hands up don t we Hand ripple Establish who your partner is Wow That was emphatic Okay Be sure you re using active listening because I will quiz you Here s your question How are scientists affected by social issues Social issues going on in our culture How does that affect what scientists can and can t do or what they think The person who woke up the earliest will answer this question and then stand back to back Go When you re done stand back to back Okay Face me Since this one is kind of a shifting gears one I want to let you volunteer Did anybody have a really good answer that their partner gave Yeah Interference from the church Okay Definitely a social issue If they don t have their research believed they could not receive funding or just get shunned basically If it disagrees with what the society basically believes in Okay So you could be shunned you could risk your political or your religious beliefs Em Problems with morality like testing on animals Okay Did you guys want to add something down there No No You re good They said what we said basically Okay This question is for the other partner Why do you think scientists try to understand the natural world Think for a few seconds Why do scientists try to understand the natural world Okay Give your answer then stand back to back Go Okay Face me I m going to let you guys volunteer on this one too Who had a partner with a really good answer Yeah It s just human nature to question things Okay Very good Since we got the bigger brain with all the cool parts to it We just question Okay What d you guys have Because they re extremely curious on how things work and why certain things do what they do Okay So we re very curious creatures How to make things in everyday life easier Ooooh That segways to my next question Split apart Brody take the catwalk Logan take the catwalk Hey you guys were my first ones last time too Aw such love I was the first one last time Were you Yeah Oh I just remember those two catwalking together Okay Shift us down two Super Shift down two And a real quick hand ripple to establish your partner Hand Hand Hand Hand Hand Hand Hand Hand Hand Hand Hand Hand Super Okay The person who has ordered the most ID badges this year is going to answer the following question Shh Here s your question Five Four Three Two Thank you Here s your question What motivation is there to develop technology to meet human needs What motivation do scientists have to create technology that meets human needs Think about it Go Okay Split apart I m just going to randomly popcorn on this one Brandon what d you guys say We came up with make life easier Okay To make life easier Alright What s something you guys said Money and power Money and power Interesting What s something you guys said To decrease death Like medical science Okay So let people live longer Probably also live more quality lives Excellent Okay Take the catwalk Take the catwalk Shift down two partners once she gets down there Shift down two Super And a quick hands up Hands Hands Hands Hands Hands Uh oh There we go Hands Hands Hands Hands Hands Hands Hands Now everybody take three steps that way One Two Three Super Okay This time the person with the longest hair is going to answer the question What evidence can you cite from today s scientists that we ve discussed where something microscopic something you can t see was being sensed or manipulated What is an example of the scientists we learned today hold on just one sec What is an example of something the scientists we learned about today hold on hold on hold on I had a request to restate the question What is an example from the scientists we learned about today using sensing or manipulating something that is microscopic or can t be seen Okay Now go We certainly cannot see that Except on the macroscopic level we can see the results of it Brandon decided to use a lifeline called phone a poster So Brandon what was your answer I found on Thomas Edison found radio waves Okay Very good Face me please Emily what s something you guys talked about Marie Curie found radiation from atoms Okay Very good Erin what s something you guys talked about Okay Very good Take the catwalk Take the catwalk On the catwalk Alright PG PG PG Thank you Scooch down And hands up Hands Hands Hands Hands Hands Hands Hands Hands Hands Hands Hands Hands Super Okay The person whose last digit in their address is the lowest is going to answer this question Okay Here is your question We talked a second ago about the fact that scientists are naturally curious about our natural world but many scientists have learned to manipulate our natural world What is your opinion of scientists manipulating using for our benefit our natural world Okay Go Okay Face me Nice and loud so everyone can hear Brian what did your group discuss We thought it all depended on humanism How they thought the humanism in relation to all the other creatures of the world that they feel like they re higher than all the other creatures then they can do what they want to the natural world Okay So as long as it s being used for good I guess Okay With the benefit of humans or the world in general Kind of a socialist view The world In general Okay John what did you guys say Yeah what did we say Pretty much the same thing The same thing pretty much Okay So are you specifically looking at human needs or more global Human Okay What about you guys What did you partnership talk about That it was okay to a point There was a point when you should not manipulate the natural world Like taking a dolphin from one ocean and moving it to another Okay So who should decide what those points are I don t know Okay Alright That segways us to the next question If you were Let s see let s do this The person with the most buttons on is going to answer this question Okay If you were the scientific consultant to President Barack Obama what percentage of our National Budget should be spent on science and why Justify that amount Go It s a percentage So we re not talking a dollar amount What percentage Well it doesn t really matter Do you think half of our budget Do you think a third of our budget You think a quarter of our budget I don t know You could delineate that Okay I could tell by looking at you guys that we ve got a couple of folks that feel kind of passionately about this so spread back apart and face me What did you guys say Well I said that 15 is a good amount because then it puts enough money forward to get going and leaves money for other things that we need Okay Now you guys had a very specific take on it What did you guys talk about We talked about if medical if the percentage was accounting for medical sciences as well as it should and if it is then the percentage should be increased to help Like 50 to 60 if medical is included Okay So we have to look at the different kinds of research Are we just studying stuff to study stuff Are we developing a technology that will help human need Are we looking at medical Alright Very good Take the catwalk Take the catwalk On the catwalk They do their little turns on the catwalk On the catwalk Okay Of the science of the person We haven t scooted Oh scoot down I m out of order Thank you Scoot down I got so excited about the questions Scoot down Scoot down We will Okay Here we go We re creatures of habit sometimes Hands up real fast Make sure you ve got the right partner Uh huh Uh huh Uh huh There we go Okay The person whose third no The person whose last digit in their cell phone number is the highest

likes it s hard to say Let s clap it ready Synonym Let s try again Synonym Let s just slow down a minute Syn o nym Syn o nym Alright we ll keep practicing Okay now we need to read these sentences and find out which ones have synonyms Okay let s start with this one Nicolet can you read that The dog is angry The dog is mad Are those synonyms Yes Which two words Angry and mad Okay you want to come on up You re going to circle those sentences and that dog Look at his face too Okay if you re writing you could use the word mad That s kind of like I just call it a first grade word sort of You want to

soaked Yelled and screamed awesome Okay bring your fishbowls back over Okay how d everybody do over here Good Okay everybody choose one bowl and one fish Just one that you think you can make a sentence up with Okay So you can choose any bowl with a matching fish and you have to make up a sentence where you re going to use both words both synonyms Okay Barbara you ready What did you find Which two words Tell us your words first Friendly and nice Okay so are you ready to make up a sentence I am nice and friendly Okay you put them in the same sentence Does anybody have a way that she could make her sentence different because nice and friendly could mean anything You have an idea This time I m using friendly Okay I am friendly How about a new classmate Yeah a new classmate Okay so that s using friendly Now you re going to take out this word and use the synonym I am I am nice to everybody in my To the new New student Classmate right You use the same words in your sentence You just are going to change your synonym Okay good job very good job Okay Nicolet Show us your words first What do you got Doze and sleep Okay I m using the doze Doze means that I am You can put I N G at the end if you want Like dozing I am dozing out in the car Okay I am dozing out in the car And then I am sleeping in the car Okay did she do that right Um hum yes It makes me think of when you re on a long trip right Has that ever happened to you Um hum Yeah when have you done that I ve done that when we went to Charlotte Okay and you took a little sleep in the car Um hum Okay alright Fernando 
 who s done writing Okay Alright Ok couple of goals for this piece today Here s where we re at here One clearly get the notes and rhythms down because this Comstock piece ok and so is the second Middleston piece three the primo So we ll do both those today wanna get the notes learned the notes and rhythms learned but I also want to treat this piece today as though it were a sight reading piece just like if we were getting ready for contest in March do one of those little example pieces for sight singing So we ll treat this in the same manner as that Then I wanted to also as we re reading the piece take a look at how the structure of the piece can inform how we might go about learning it You ll see some things here in a minute Alright so if we take a look at the piece and we ve already written solf ge in We take a look at the piece what markings on the score can you see that might jump out at you that might be different Repeats okay even before that like right up by the title Canon Canon what s that mean The canon okay what s a canon It s a round It s a round right so you have one set of music and then the same set of music follows it later right We do that in warm ups okay Alright so a canon So you think soprano and alto are in canon It d probably be women and men Probably women and men good good observation So we look at the structure where might that canon begin After a P at the bottom of the page okay So pick up to measure 11 alright Okay so what kind of material do the guys have there It says we mix with the women s structure Exactly that same material that the girls do So in our rehearsal noting that this is a canon at least to that point how might we rehearse this or set it up so we can have success right away Girls and guys sing their parts together Girls and guys sing their parts together good easy So if we do that then what might something else be helpful for us to do We re singing parts together maybe pair up Typically we get together and we chant so let s do that first Let s do the chanting just like we do for sight singing so you can practice that Okay so what are our pairs gonna be Soprano and tenor so you have to move and bass and alto So starting at solf ge girls you start at the beginning guys you simply start at measure pick up at measure 11 okay Go on and move Yes circle up right here Alright who s gonna be our leader Who wants to start us off Alena Alena Okay you can start us off Who s going to start the you Okay there you go Okay good go for it Chant it quickly Let s start at the beginning we are on the pick up to 4 So 1 2 3 and 4 So so mi fa so do re mi Okay so now we got to the end of that go to measure 11 for the girls and measure 21 for the guys Go right there and start it again So now girls you go measure 11 which is right where you finished and guys go to 21 Same thing here that s a little bit different Alright 1 and 2 Let s all chant together in rhythm Stay in your groups Stay in your groups please but we re gonna start with the sopranos and altos and then we ll pick up with the guys at the bottom of the page So start at the beginning everybody 1 2 and ready and go Stop okay now guys you re gonna pick up there and girls you re gonna come in 2 beats later Here we go ready and go Okay go right on the coda please So we would ve done the repeat now we go back here Go right on the coda please right after the double bar ready and go 3 4 fermata cut off please Sopranos ready and go Bass Okay pretty good we ll come back to that That takes a little bit of fordating when you get together Okay go back to sections let s do right in the not your traditional sections Let s keep the basses over here altos over here tenors and sopranos over here So do two rows back in your sections Okay so we re gonna do just like we chanted we re gonna partner up and we re gonna sing it at the same time Okay at the same time So guys you re starting in measure 11 Girls you re starting in measure pick up to 1 Ready and Do do do do do Sing that first note please sopranos and altos and okay tenors and Basses okay let s sing all at the same time right where your canon first name of the canon is Here we go 1 2 and ready and sing Okay sopranos sorry altos and basses here we go Doo doo that s a mi Here we go start that again 1 and beginning and go Okay go back to the do Do mi so la Fa do la fa Sing that ready on the do 1 2 Do that again same spot 1 2 Okay good excellent reading good for you Now putting it together Canon lots of people think oh canons are easy no problem it s the same thing Except canons tend to be tricky we ll see how it goes Here we go soprano and alto first Do mi so mi do Sing your first notes girls ready and Here we go 1 2 and ready and go Okay good I was gonna stop you before then but you did so well so we kept singing Good for you Okay so what happens at 21 for the girls Well not sorry measure 11 for the girls Does what something different so what would we call it B or the counter melody of this Okay So it s kind of the same shape but it starts on what pitch class instead of do No sorry what did we first start at the beginning So and mi and this starts on do So different pitch class same shape but it s singing the fifth lower okay for soprano Okay good let me hear the guys please You did really well until we got to the B section Let me hear actually let s hear everybody do the B section So guys you re gonna start at 21 girls you re gonna start at 11 Basses it s just No it s not it s not different at all Do here is do Find your first pitch 
 Yeah Why don t we list that up here Okay Here is what you re going to do Go ahead and put your pencils back inside that basket for me really quick Put those pencils away in ten nine eight seven six five four three two one and just to make sure you haven t Now you have identified you have taken this work of art you ve seen what it is and you ve taken out all those elements of art and you listed them and you told me how they were being used Now we need to figure out what is that artist trying to tell you with those elements What kind of thought feeling is this artist communicating to you with these elements with this subject So who can raise their hand and tell us first what is one element that you found What s one Shapes Shapes What s another one Color Color Shape lines Value Value Texture You guys with those elements they re telling you something So here s what we re going to We re going to put on our thinking pairing and sharing hats So whatever I do that so you guys can pair and share together will you take your material with you so that you can use them for reference Thank you All right First question ready The first question is how does this man feel Now think for 30 seconds by yourself how does this man feel No talking Think to yourself Think Shh You ve got to tell me why too Don t just think about feeling Tell me why Two people look like they re pairing already Don t pair yet Now tell your neighbors what you think this man is thinking is feeling is feeling All right Now we re ready to share with the whole group So I m going to start with right here with Jermaine s group and we re going to go around and each person is going to get a turn or each pair is going to get a turn So first what was your group thinking How did he feel Sad Why Because the color blue is a sad color And he looked down So he had two reasons he had the body position because he s kind of looking down like this and he also he had a connection with what you learned in kindergarten good job he said that sad and the color blue go together What do you guys think How does he feel I think he feels happy He s smiling and he s playing the guitar Okay because he s creating music Maybe that s what makes him happy I heard Miss Webster had a disagreement when they were pairing Miss Webster what is your take What do you think he s feeling Tell me what you think he is Sit up tell me what you think he is I think he s sad because Okay Because why He looks what Say it again honey Don t be embarrassed It s okay to have a different opinion I think he is lonely because he doesn t have any friends There s nobody else in that picture He is by himself in the picture Maybe he s lonely We don t know Okay So we had a difference of opinion That s okay Next pair I think he s sad because he s looking down If he was happy he d be Whoa Wait a minute She just said this man doesn t have anything to eat Why do you think he doesn t have any Because his shirt is torn he don t have no pants and he don t have no socks So you re telling me he looks what Is he rich or is he poor No He s poor Okay That is very good insight on not only the details but also just what those details are telling us okay Do you have something else to add What would you say I said I think he was happy to sit alone I think he s happy because he just Okay So you think the guitar looks even though his clothing looks torn his guitar looks nice right Maybe he just puts a lot of value on keeping it nice Maybe he puts a lot of value on keeping his guitar nice rather than his clothes Maybe not Last pair tell me what you think he s feeling I think he s One at a time I think he s It looks like he s playing a sad song He s playing a sad song and he s playing Why do you think it looks like he s playing a sad song Because he s bowing his head down and his face don t look very happy Okay You guys next question I can see everyone sitting nice and tall in your seat Did you have something different than that Okay Go ahead I think he s sad because he looks like he s homeless Oh maybe he s homeless Now why do you think he s homeless Because his shirt s torn on the side Are there any other clues besides his clothing We already had Miss Marshall tell us about his clothing What other clues do we have that makes us think he s homeless without talking and making noise Jermaine do you have a clue why he might be homeless Why Because he s outside by his self He looks like me might be outside This might be a step that he s sitting on Next question Next question what do you think the artist is trying to tell us What is the important message put your hands down Think What is the message Why is the artist painting this picture of this man I have one person she s got herself in the thinking posture She s thinking Think please Think think think I ve got a good thinker at this table I hope you re thinking honey Okay Now pair up Ready Pair and share with your table mate Get paired up Thirty more seconds to share I hear some good talking so I m giving you 30 more seconds Why don t you share this time because you shared last time Okay So you re going to share this time Let s see you sitting up nice and tall We re going to share with the entire group We all learn from each other You guys we re going to start with the opposite way I m going to go this way Can you tell me what the artist is trying to tell us by painting this picture I m sorry just a second Could you wait until your classmates are showing you the respect you deserve You guys when you re listening to what he s saying he s trying to tell you what he thinks what his table mate thinks So you need to turn your body make eye contact and really listen to what he s saying okay Okay Go again I think the artist did this picture because he wanted kids to know how alone he is and how he s homeless He doesn t have any money He doesn t have any value Okay When you mean value do you mean value like art value or what kind of value do you mean Like he seems very sad Okay So you re talking about the color right Okay Next group I think that the artist is trying to persuade him Wait a minute Say that word again He s trying to what Persuade Persuade us what Persuade us to think what Persuade us He feels real mad or trying to do music or something Okay Is that what your team came up with You came up with something different than your team You had a disagreement right I think that I was not Do you think the artist wants you to be like him No What do you think the artist wants you to learn from him He won t have nothing to work You can have a better life right Okay This group could you put your feet down It s your turn You re going to share with us what your team came up with You can share Come on You can talk to us Remember that there s no wrong answer It s just what you think 
 Ti ti Okay why don t you come up and try that Click on the heart Oops It s not quite high enough Hold on one second Let me minimize it Okay now try to get it A little harder And you have Ti ti All right let s try the second beat Don t raise your hand yet We haven t done it Sing it and clap Locket Okay Let s see Hunter will you come and put Locket up Which one do you think it is Hunter Ti ti Good job That s fine Lost her Lost her Morgan Oops let s try it again You did it right Sometimes it s just a little tricky Thank you Pocket Pocket Bear There you go Good job Kitty Ashley Nixon sit on your bottom bud Kitty We re going in the second line beat one Try again Oops Sometimes it s a little tricky Fisher Griffin Oops I think that might ve been a little too hard Tap on it again Good Andrew Yep Click on it again Thank you Andrew And It It Riley Good job Now boys and girls I would like you to put your sticks on your shoulders and even though we re not finished with the heart chart I want you to clap your ti ti and your ta for each beat Make sure you re looking up here and you know which one to clap and say We re going to clap and say it Ready Go Ti ti Ti ti Ti ti Ti ti Ti ti Ti ti The eighth note or the quarter note Raise your hand if you know Maddox what does Holly s song start with Eighth note The eighth note and is that ti ti or ta Mason Is this ti ti or ta Ti ti very good One two everybody now Ti ti ti ti ta ti ti ta ta ti ti ta Very good Let s move on and let s oops no talking Let s open up Griffin s His song is called Jaws What does this start with Raise your hand if you can tell me What does this start with Bear A quarter note or an eighth note A quarter note very good One two everybody play Ta ti ti ta ti ti ti ti ta ti ti ta Now this one s tricky because we went ti ti ti ti So let s try that again One two ready go Ta ti ti ta ti ti ti ti ta ti ti ta Raise your hand if you can tell me how many beats does the quarter note get Chandler how many beats How many heartbeats does a quarter note get Two one One One heartbeat good How many heartbeats do the eighth notes get Two Lilly One One very good They both just get one All right let s try it again fixing the ti ti ti ti Going from here to here One two ready go Ta ti ti ta ti ti ti ti ta ti ti ta That was much better good job Okay let s move on to somebody else s song That was Jaws by Griffin Let s go to Lilly Dee s song Her song is Pink Butterflies One two everybody play Ta ta ti ti ta ti ti ta ta ti ti Excellent job Let s go move on to somebody else s Let s see Bear s song It s called Boom Boom Bam Bam Boom Boom Bam That s a funny name One two everybody play Ta ti ti ta ti ti ti ti ta ta ti ti Let s try to make that a little cleaner okay One two watch the board Ta ti ti ta ti ti ti ti ta ta ti ti Very good 
 Three two one stop Okay were there pairs of you who chose different things Um hmm And who wants to share I said if I had to pick I would pick the green cylinder because the white would overflow easy the pink you would have to reach down far to get it Okay Devon I would pick the pink one because it s like thin enough to be like a cup and you can do this with it And it would be a lot easier than just like doing this especially because if it gets on the bottom of the green one it would be hard to get it and the white one it might spill if you walk around with it Or you could trip Okay good Layla But well I agreed with Devon on the pink one but I would rather have the white one because it could carry more popcorn but it also is harder to hold unless you were to like since it has more area the white one has more area than the pink or the green one More area you re talking this way Yeah Okay so you re saying You take the popcorn and you could like you could make it even on the bottom of it so it wouldn t necessarily be overflowing unless you were when you walk for the popcorn thing Okay all right Brittany Me and Lani had the same answer we would think that it sort of relates to what Devon said if we picked the green one because and related to The pink one s gonna be hard to reach down to get the rest of the popcorn And the green one is wide enough and it can hold it can still hold as much popcorn as the pink one But it s still gonna be hard to get down the pink one and the white one s just gonna spill Okay all right Tiffany We thought that the green and pink one it doesn t matter because they re probably gonna hold the same capacity since they re the same shape it s just one s taller and one s shorter but the short one s wider and the tall one s skinnier it s tall but we thought that both of them can hold the same So you said either one of these two It didn t matter okay Kylie I would want the green cup because it s easier like to get your hand down it The pink one looks like really skinny so if you have big hands it would be hard to get your hand down it Okay all right Amani I think the green one becuase when you look at it the old popcorn container and the green one they re kinda the same although the green one is a little bit bigger so then you could get more Okay I said the green one also because the pink one is skinny and it if went to the same size as that with the same amount of popcorn it would be less popcorn in the pink one than the green one Do you know what I m saying Say that again Okay I picked the green one because say you fill them with popcorn and then you take all the popcorn that was in the pink one and you put it in the green one it s gonna be less popcorn in the green one than the pink one And the white one it s just gonna fall over cause it s too small it s too flat Okay hold on Josh Now Tiffany said that she felt they held the same amount Did you say that Mm hmm And why did you say that Because they re the same size paper except one they re just folded different Okay she said that because they re the same size paper they re folded differently but she thinks that they re gonna hold the same amount And you are disagreeing Mm hmm Okay she s disagreeing saying that the green one s going to hold more is that correct What you said I said yeah the green one would hold more Okay Josh what do you think I said I would rather have the green because it would be a lot easier to get the popcorn out and because it might have more volume than those two Yeah Okay so let s change our thinking here Some of you did think about which one is going to hold more It didn t matter whether your hand could get easier into this one or Devon liked this one cause he could tilt it up he didn t even have to have his hand in it at all which is an interesting way to look at it A lot of you said you didn t like this one because it would spill easily or whatnot Yes ma am But unless you did what I suggested and you like evened it out on the bottom Yes because you said you liked this one cause you thought it held more than the other two But you d have to like flat not necessarily like squish the popcorn so it s flat you d have to like shake things sideways so that it would even it out Like food in a pan you would shake it to even it out on the bottom Okay all right Well it s kinda like with the little kid packs there are things shaped like that and it has like gummies and popcorn in it and I don t like it cause like everyone would get the other ones it would have like more popcorn in it Okay Tiffany What I would suggest the white one is like even it s the same shape as the other two pieces of paper but it s folded so it s taking less up space but it s folded Because it overlaps here it does overlap here with the white you re right there But I disagree with Molly because the popcorn amount that s inside of the inside the square ones at Newtown is the same amount as one of the plastic ones The exact same amount of popcorn cause they actually use those as measuring cups I ve watched them do it And I ve watched them actually use those cups those hard ones to fill the other cup to fill the other ones So you think that this is going to hold the same amount as this All of them are gonna hold the same amount because they used the hard plastic ones as measuring cups All right Devon I agree with Layla like they re all the same I think it just depends on like who you are kind of like which one you want Okay but do you think it would be unfair to say a certain gender would have to have each one Yeah So if you could choose that would be a good thing Right hold on a second let s move on a second and I m gonna have MK come up here and help me We re gonna see if they hold the same okay I want you however on your paper to write down you know which one you think holds the most do they hold the same or if you think they hold a different amount put em in order like which one is least middle greatest why don t you do that real quick Why don t you put em in order which one do you think Okay this is what she thinks she thinks least middle greatest Here s what we re going to do I do not have popcorn but I do have cereal And hopefully hopefully MK can pour this Hopefully okay so you re I m gonna hold it Or would you rather hold it and me pour Wait yeah you might wanna pour it Okay and just make sure that the bottom stays Okay We are smellin the sugar up here Yeah Okay can you all see that it s at the top Yeah All right Now what we are going to do so this is this would be a full thing of popcorn for the girls We re gonna put this over top and you re gonna lift it up and see what happens And some of you have predicted that it s going to be the same right How many have predicted that they re all the same All the same Okay How many are predicting that the green is bigger Predicting that the green is bigger Okay What about the white is biggest Anybody predict the white is biggest Okay why don t you lift this up I ll hold this this time You gotta make sure that Pink s bigger Ooh Can you see Can you see So there s more room right There s more room in the green one Why Because the more space it has the bigger around it is the more cereal that could fit in it So what is that called around here Circumference Well this is circumference but at the bottom Volume It is volume cause we re measuring volume But what is at the bottom of this Base A base is that what you re saying That the base it depends on how big the base is Well let s look to see whether it ll fit in here Okay There it is Exact same room as the pink Well do you think there s the exact same room as the pink No I think the white has more You think the white could fit more Yeah Okay thank you MK have a seat But what do we know about this one now It s the smallest It s the smallest Do you think we could come up with a formula to figure out what the numbers are here and figure out what the formula or the volume is Like the length of it the length of the pink one Does anybody know what a standard size sheet of paper measures Eight by Is it eight by 12 Eight by 12 eight by six Eight by 10 Eight by 10 Eight by 10 A foot A foot Eight by 11 Okay it is actually eight and a half by 11 okay Eight and a half by 11 So our standard size paper is eight and a half by 11 Okay So for our pink one What is when we do this What is this The circumference Its the circumference What do we know about the circumference then for the pink one That it s 8 5 It is 8 5 So circumference equals what 8 5 The circumference equals 8 5 Are we then able to find out the diameter and the radius if we have the circumference Yes No You say yes Yeah I know what you could do you could divide it by 3 14 cause that s how you get cause you know how it s the opposite of times so that you would do it and you would divide that by 8 4 no 3 14 and then you ll have the diameter and then you can just take half of that and that d be the radius Okay all right tell me Brittany what is the formula for circumference Pi times d Circumference equals pi times d I m gonna ask someone to restate what Kiki said Does anyone agree with Kiki Yes I do And what did she say She said that you can divide the circumference by 3 14 Okay So we know the circumference is 8 5 correct And we know that pi is what Molly 3 14 3 14 and we re trying to find the the what Devon Diameter The diameter okay So both Kiki and Maya say you divide by 3 14 Is that what we do Treyshawn Yes So if I divide this side by 3 14 and I divide this side by 3 14 what happens to this right here India It would get smaller It gets smaller Yes if you divide it Okay what is 3 14 divided by 3 14 One Sure 
 And one more There s this one spider and he s around all day and then he comes and comes out Oh so it s waiting for him You know i ts like a trap It covers itself in the flower and like it sets in the flower It sits perfectly still in the flower and then when something lands on it it attacks it and eats it Wonderful so they re not really attracted to flowers they re attracted to the insects in order to ambush them Is that what you re telling me Yes Okay all right So and we talked about what is it that attracts these Well we see a lot of bugs we see humming birds and Jack mentioned this word pollen Do you know what pollen is Do you know what pollen is Ah Do you know what pollen is Are these things attracted to the pollen Yes Well not really though No not really Sometimes Sometimes I guess Say that again please It s an ingredient to make honey Pollen is an ingredient to make honey Oh nectar Yeah So bees are attracted to flowers because of their blank Nectar Go ahead Jimmy How would you fill this in The bees are attracted to flowers because of their blank Go ahead and write your answer in Oh okay I see some people writing pollen You have color They re definitely attracted to their color We have nectar And we have we actually have all of them here So which one is it Is it one of these or all of these All of these All of them All of them tell me more Tell me I think it s pollen and nectar because the nectar s in the pollen and the bees take the pollen and then use the pollen to make stuff or honey out of it So it s kind of like taking it to its So we say that flowers attract insects so we can connect these two ideas here And we ve talked about their color The insects were attracted because of their color and they re also attracted because of their Nectar Nectar okay let s put nectar right here And they re also attracted because of their good smell No Yeah Yeah No The nectar smells good that s why butterflies go to them Maybe look that up on Google Why do you think flowers take all the trouble to make them smell good So bees will go to them Why do people go to trouble to smell good Why not Because it would be gross Say that again Attention You want attention You want to be attractive to other people too Heck no Maybe you re too young for that Yeah when you get older don t you want to attract other people Sure Don t you want other people to find you pleasant Yes You know it s not a big thing but are these fragrances signals to these insects They re attractive right And we ll talk about I agree they are useful but that s not going to fit into my process just yet But all of these things do attract the insects right But what is it that keeps the insects coming back It s sort of like the color the smell you know the maybe the shape of the flower All of these things are like advertisements to the insects Why For the nectar For the nectar It s the nectar that s going to keep them coming back All right you see this bee here What s all this yellow stuff on the bee Pollen Pollen Does the pollen attract the bee No Does the bee want the pollen No Yes and no because the pollen helps all of the flowers to stay alive The pollen is definitely important to the flower right Mm hm The bees just spread it around The bees spread it around How many people are aware that bees spread pollen I see just about all your hands go up So the insects are spreading let s put that up here they re going to spread the stuff called pollen Right Of course the insects are really getting what Nectar Yeah so let s put they are taking or they obtain this nectar here right And nectar is another word for what Food You all understand that nectar is their food For the bees For the bees Just the bees No and hummingbirds And insects Us And hummingbirds Us us we have honey Nectar is technically honey So nectar is actually a food for us because we steal it from the bees right Yeah And we hide it from the bears yes Isn t there this one point where it has saliva or something in the bottom of it and it s in the shape of a picture and all of these flies and everything are attracted from the sweet smell and everything and they get into the water they can t move and everything they re paralyzed Okay it s a trap Yeah Like the venus fly trap Just like the venus fly trap Yeah I don t know what it s called Do venus fly traps have flowers No they have clear white The mouth smells really sweet That s because it catches flies Okay we re going to talk about that in a minute A lot of people when I was reading your paragraphs a lot of people told me that venus fly traps were one of the many kinds of plants that don t have flowers All right but let s look at this thing about pollen for a minute Why is it that the flowers want these insects to keep stealing their nectar What s going on here They want them to spread the pollen but why To make more food To make what To make more food You think it s to make more food What do you think Olivia To make like honey The flowers want the bees to make honey No they like need it to make more food Pollen is an ingredient for nectar to make I understand that but why does the flower go to all this trouble Do flowers just like bees No They say hey you re a nice guy We ll make you some To keep them alive I think To keep the flowers are making the food to keep the bees alive No I don t know That s okay that s okay What do you think Joe To fertilize other flowers Fertilize What s fertilize You mean to like give them like fertilizer on the ground Or are you talking about a different kind of fertilizer Different You re calling it a different kind of fertilizer Interesting How many people understand that flowers are related to fertilization How many people have heard that before Hands up here okay So if you want to ask what pollen is you might want to ask what flowers do All right and to answer that I first of all let s make sure this dandelion is this a flower or is this a weed Flower A weed Okay thumbs up or thumbs down Who says it s a weed Okay I see most of you thumbs up a couple of you have sideways or down Next how about this one how many people think it s a flower Okay How many people say it s a weed and a flower Now I see some people who don t know Well let me ask you this If you re to look at this here s a pretty good picture of it what makes you think it s a flower Are there characteristics about this plant that make you think it s a flower Yes I don t think it s a flower That s not my question Are there characteristics about this that make you think it s a flower Yes What would those be The petals The petals Excellent Anything else It s color It s colorful Anything else It has some nectar maybe You think it has nectar Maybe a little bit Have you ever seen insects hovering around dandelions Yes Who have seen who have seen Yeah it s very common Well you can actually see bees on top of on top of flowers Here s a close up of the dandelion What do you notice there That looks a lot more ugly It looks ugly Yeah Really No it looks cool It looks like water spouts goin like It does look like water What do you see on the side here Pollen Does that look like pollen What does pollen look like Just tiny balls of stuff Of stuff yeah There those tiny little like they look like little leftover pieces just hanging off the side of the stem and it s with the bees and it sticks to the bees when they land on the flower so it stays with them for a while A ball and then it sticks to the bee like if you want to see the bee it s got all the yellow stuff on his leg Yeah we had the picture earlier yeah Yeah I saw a bee on a flower in the summer and he had a bunch of that yellow stuff on his body Cool Actually that s the pollen So the pollen so it is picking up pollen So it sounds to me that I guess what I want to convince you is that dandelions are flowers They are Yeah they re definitely flowers Let me show you a picture of a dandelion A little video it s about one minute long and let s go ahead and turn the lights off And as you re watching it just tell me what you observe happening in the video Just go ahead and shout it out The flower is opening it s blossoming Okay this is time lapse so this is happening a lot faster than what it really normally but you saw the flower open It s dormant dying now And now it s closing up and it s dying It s going dormant It s dead How many people think it s dead No it s still growing It s dormant It s growing into that white stuff Say that again It s turning into that thing in the ball That s like Marissa s making a prediction It s gonna grow taller No it s going to break up Do you see the insects all over it Every now and then you can kind of see an insect on it Oh yeah Yeah there s one down at the root At the very base of it Yeah something s happening Something s happening It got taller on the screen Oh the bottom petals are starting to die What s that It s starting to look like an onion What s that thing on the top It s going to blow away It s going to grow into a dandelion That was the flower wasn t it That s the thing you blow on What s that They re seeds they re seeds Yeah you blow on them and it s really fun It s reproducing I m hearing Steven say they re seeds And Brandon oh that thing disappeared That whole top blew away That s the stuff that you like to blow How many people think these are seeds I know they are Ah Andrew s thinking So the flower turned into what A seed A reproducer A big seed No they re all little seeds No they re all individual seeds Are they blowing Yes Make a wish Can I have the lights on please So you have Like a month period Yeah that took a while And I think you ve seen dandelions you may not have you ve probably seen the dandelions in two stages Sometimes they re like gel flowers and later they turn into these little white puffy seed pods right You puff on them and they blow in the wind Yeah what does the wind do It blows them away and it starts reproducing So each seed is like a little parachute Yeah And it s dispersed to new lands Yes All right so if I were to say flowers if I were to make a connection between flowers and seeds what would you say about that What will you say What is the connection between flowers and seeds McKenzie They both reproduce They re both related to reproduction Okay uh huh One makes another Okay so one flowers make seeds or flowers produce seeds and there s that word that McKenzie was using reproduce because seeds grow into Flowers Flowers which then Grow into seeds Which then Grow into more plants What does that sound like Life cycles Wonderful wonderful these are life cycles What I m going to ask you to do right now is we re going to look at a seed very very closely I have some you know what these are Lima beans Oh I love lima beans You do really Yeah Oh I don t like lima beans I ve never tried them I like them in my favorite dish chicken pot pie My dad loves lima beans anyway I have some They have been soaking overnight in some water and they re going to look a little bit different because they ve been soaking under water What I want you to do is when you get one I want you to open it up like a book Dig your thumbnails into the side of the seed and open it up very carefully and I want you to look inside That s what the magnifying glasses are for I want you to be able to tell me what do you find inside the seed Everyone clear Go ahead one person from each table come up and get a couple of seeds How many Oh you know what Get maybe three of them in case one of them doesn t work We have a spare Three not unbroken nice plump seeds Take them to your seat I just want you to look at them They re bigger They are bigger aren t they What else are they They re sort of hard They look like mandarin oranges Why s that what makes you think they re like oranges They re not hard anymore They re no what They re not hard anymore They re not hard We grew them last year What s that We grew them last year Oh you grew these last year What do these turn into Farmer s They turn into plants What are we supposed to be looking for Well you tell me Don t break them open Here s how I want you Can I borrow this Okay I want you to go to the round part here and you notice it has like a seed coat Yeah Okay you know kind of peel that back Oh cool And then open it up like a book Okay I m looking at the skin Like this Yeah open it up like a book and look inside and see what you find There s a little surprise there What is this It s a bug It s located yeah Oh gross Mine s already broken so Well you have a good one right here This is perfect Oh I see it Look at that That s a really good one I don t see it Yeah go ahead break it Just like you did I can t open it And oh yours is right here Yours kind of fell apart Do you have another seed Be there in a second Okay Oh there it is right there Do you see that I don t have one Look at it very carefully with the magnifiers What do you have Let me see what you got Yeah right there There s actually part of it right here broke in half and that s attached and there s also a little bit here Perfect look at this Patrick That s what you want to look at I can t open mine See it see it there What do you see I don t see it Oh there is a little bit of green there isn t there Yeah Who else is having trouble Me I already opened mine Yes you did Are they supposed to smell bad Yeah they do kind of smell don t they Yeah they smell Did you see that whole thing right on the tip Look at that under the magnifying glass Okay okay look at my photograph up here Here we go This is kind of what you re looking at You have these two like little half circles little kidney shaped starchy figures but what is this thing right here It s a seed It s starting to sprout What is it It s a start of a lima bean I thought this whole thing right here It s the start of a lima bean plant This is like a plant sprouting out Is that what you re trying to say Steven What s that Is there anything about this that makes you look like a plant or makes you think it might be a plant Like that like the big parts might be like maybe like the soil or the stuff that needs to get bigger Like when we add water to stuff it starts to get bigger Well did you notice there are two parts to it Yeah Yeah it like goes down There is what s this right here It s the sprout Okay I heard you say it looks like a stem Anybody think it looks like anything else Uh huh Go ahead McKenzie Why are these pointing here Why are these pointed It s kind of new That makes sense Looking to break through Break through the The soil And what breaks through the soil What part of the plant breaks through the soil The seed The root Does it look like a root Yeah How many people think it looks a little bit like a root And this looks a little bit like a stem What does this look like to you A flower Let me see it looks like this and there s another one that kind of looks like that What does that look like to you Leaves Leaves What do leaves okay Do you ever see anybody draw pictures Whats that It looks like a carrot It looks like a carrot doesn t it Okay look at those leaf like structures very carefully with your magnifier I want you to look for a detail You see a little characteristic Oh I see it I see it What do you see I see like the veins of a leaf Wonderful I don t Oh yeah I do Wonderful you have little veins there on the leaf Yeah you can see 
 Three Oh it makes like a cubic graph It s like a cube Oh whoa that s pretty cool What about what if only two of them are the same It s like a quadratic All right so as we go through the investigation now we re gonna look at try to come up with conjecture for that Numerically why do you think that happens If two factors are the same Because it makes like because if you have two factors are the same that s the same as like squaring one of the factors What happens if you square numbers They become positive I believe So it s always positive for that section Very nice Okay keep on keep on going with that All right Just say A B C D E etcetera E is the zeros of the law I m on the first one Why are they the same They re squared Go to Google Docs See if you can do files The file is gray Okay so what s gonna happen is you re gonna have a factor formula Unlike the other one we had it instead And what you want to look at is look at the factors and look at the zeros What s the relationship between the factors and zeros You may already know what the relationship is Can you predict what it s gonna be That the factors tell you the zeros Like the numbers and the factors tell you what the zeros are And why would that makes sense to you Oh because when it s X and you have a number after that that s where it is on the X axis So that could be where the zeros in a set right maybe Teresa does that make sense to you You look kinda confused Like so X minus one is No that is wrong then Well here look at your flag Look right here It s sittin right here So X minus one So that s one So there s one one And then X minus two is the there too Oh so it s the opposite of the form So if you haven t factored form then you know that it s even zero Yeah yeah It would be equal to zero right Yeah you re right Remember in algebra one the zero chronic thing Yeah All right so that does make sense Does the end behavior make sense It s in factored form but what s the degree of that It s three It s the third degree And what does a third degree what did we learn last time It can intersect three times It can intersect three times Does it Yeah And what s the end date Down and up Down and up And it is right Yup So that makes sense That does make sense Why don t you try it with quadratic factor here And why don t you put in an extra factor Just edit that Just add that X whatever something we ve not used yet What s the F in this one The eraser But you added this one right Yeah So what do we except s gonna happen How many zeros are we gonna get this time Four What s the degree So what should the end behavior be Because you weren t here last time so let s see if you pick it up So if it s fourth degree what s gonna happen on the right What s gonna happen on the left Both Good Yay High five Get rid of the space after the parenthesis Which one Between the parenthesis and the F Yeah add a space There s not an F See the sliders here This F was there to start out with So just delete it then Yeah just delete that So X minus E is just that So we expect did it come out the way you excepted it to come out Yeah there s four zeros And if you slide those zeros go ahead and slide some zeros and see if it still makes sense Oh that s good Oh because it changes whatever the final one would be at So if we had like X plus something where is the actual zero Oh it is X plus something it s the actual place that it is instead of the opposite of the place So if we say X X plus three where s the zero Negative three Does that make sense Because X plus three equals zero Yeah All right what s the next question on there Does the Y intercept change All right so let s look at your zeros and look at your Y intercept As you change the sliders does the Y intercept change We can t see our Y intercept you gotta scroll out Mr Dillard would you get me me the mouse over there The silver one Yeah it s a lot easier to do this with a mouse I got it Other way Because the Y intercept is Now it might be really Yeah it s right there Why don t we try making some of these factors smaller so that we can see it a little better I got it Oh fine I see how it is Okay can you see it It s like at negative 15 Okay is there a relationship between that Y intercept and the factors Or the zeros Why don t you guys talk it over What are the zeros So the zeros are what are the zeros And the zeros are all the numbers that are they re the opposite of this So it would be negative two four and a half and one Wait what s the Y intercept It s 15 Two Yeah it s down here It s actually 18 And it s negative 18 Four and a half times two is nine times two is 18 times one It s 18 You multiply all the end numbers together and you get the Y intercept Well that s nice That is cool But why does that make sense Why would that work Why does that work Oh Because to get the Y intercept the Y intercept doesn t have an X value so you just in order to factor this equation you would just multiply all the end ones to get it Oh yeah because it s the numbers after X like almost zeros zeros Well are the numbers after X the actual zeros If it said X plus three The roots X plus three what would the zero be for that Negative So they re the inverse of the zeros The opposite The opposite yeah You have to be careful with the word inverse because it has a lot more meaning All right so if we know what the zeros are and we multiply those and we got the Y intercept right Yeah What about A What happens when you slide A around Does that change Slide A around I already know what should happen You can just use the mouse I can t click it Move Oh that s why It changes the middle one Did it change the zero Start with that Does it change the zeros at all No No No it doesn t change the zeros Well okay go back to It s not changing the zero Well actually Well it s just changing it s steepness Yeah it s changing it s steepness and the width but it s not changing the zeros Well yeah it does because when it s flat then every number s changed But when its flat but that s only If A is zero since they re multiplying everything by A then if A is zero everything is zero So yeah you have a zero degree polynomial at that point Yeah Yeah Okay so other than when A is zero All it s changing is the steepness of the graph And not changing the zeros So does that change the Y intercept Um yes it is changing the Y intercept But I think it still works out as um you can still multiply all of them together Does that make sense Check and see if it still works Oh whatever A is is A is the opposite of the Y intercept Because if A is four then the Y intercept here is or that might just be Well that s a good conjecture Check some of the other things and see if it still works Um try changing yeah Yeah no that s not right That would be cool It was just the way I had it And that s one of the nice thing with the sliders because you might see a connection but you can quickly see if it works for all cases and not just one case The Y intercept is six Yeah it s still ah when you change A it s still going to effect the Y intercept and as changing as multiplying all the numbers together and then multiplying by A Does that make sense Yeah So all those numbers multiplied together is still six Keep going with this because the next thing we re gonna look at is what happens when some of the zeros are the same When we use the factor more than once Okay Keep going Are we on six now Yes What happens when two or more factors are the same So make E and E I m gonna make them all three I work hard for you guys you criticize me Um the E the E Oh it makes the when they re the same Try changing one of them Try changing one of the sliders We figured that one It just turns out to be the opposite So go ahead and change one slider Just pick one other than A Pick B or something like that The opposite of that variable becomes the Y intercept That doesn t explain the zeros Now something we want to find out Is there a relationship between the zeros and the Y intercept Oh there is When you change the Y then the zeros equal the opposite of the Y intercept Okay what happens if you change two No it doesn t Oh yeah yeah it does Oh yeah zero does The one that isn t the same numerical I think The right most zero becomes it When you move them the Y intercept and the zero both change at the same rate Because if you move like C steadily to the left once C is two negative two Jacob said Half the time when you multiply them all together you get it Yeah that s what we re discussing The absolute value of the Y intercept and then the absolute value of the zero if two of the factors are the same that s in If all of the variables are the same except one of them it becomes the zero it becomes the zero and the opposite of the Y intercept So now as you slide you ll actually be able to see the Y intercept If you set all the variables the same and change one of them it becomes the zero and the opposite of the Y intercept Okay so on Dave s right here Yeah the multiplication in case you like if you multiply all the zeros together you get the opposite of the Y intercept Does it have to do with the factor formula Yeah Yeah So the absolute value of the If you multiply the zero So does it make sense algebraically Yes Why does it make sense algebraically When you find the factor with that new grouping you have to it becomes the opposite But Y intercepts algebraically Because the Y intercept is when all the X s are zeros so you re just left with the one that doesn t have an X on it And that is the multiplication of all the factors All the numbers 
 Can you make some shadows I see light how will you make a shadow How are you making a shadow How are you making a shadow Alicia My hands What is your hand doing Making a shadow How is it making a shadow I don t know How is it making a shadow Brandon Because your hand is stopping the light Your hand is stopping the light And it s small cause your hand is far away from your body and More light comes around your hand What happens if you move it close to the light It has it big because it stops more light because it stops more light It s stopping more light you re right Let s go see what these guys are doing What are you guys doing Blocking the light from the light in there You re blocking the light How are you blocking it We re going forwards and backwards to make it little So I see your shadow is changing How is it changing Because you re closer to the light and then you re When you get close it gets bigger It gets bigger And when you re far it gets littler Okay why does that happen What s happening when you re down here It gets big It gets bigger Why does it get bigger What happens to the light The light can t go through your hand And and and it s blocking it It s blocking more light What happens over there then It s blocking a little bit of light Okay So more light gets around it right Alright very good Can you guys make different shadows It s a turkey That looks like the red nosed reindeer The red nosed reindeer How are you changing your shadow You have to make shapes of the animals I don t know what to make That s okay make anything you want You guys go ahead make em big and small and I ll be back in a little bit Duwant is helping you Duwant What s happening over here Doing some measuring What are you measuring How come you guys are measuring down here and not in the window Because Are you able to see the box how come you re not measuring the fifth one Where s the sun The sun is on the other side Other side of the building Way over there So we can t measure the shadow sticks today can we That s why you re making shadow sticks on the ground Okay show me a shadow stick Okay Bristava you can handle the light what can you do Can you hold the stick up for us Julie to make a shadow Okay can you do the measuring Okay go ahead and measure it Put your hand down here so we can see the top Can we measure that stick No we re gonna measure the shadow You wanna measure the stick first and then compare it to the shadow Okay You gotta hold that real still don t you Is your light high or low Low It s lower what happens if you put it lower what happens to the shadow It turns big It grows It grows It gets longer What if we put it high It s gonna be fat Gonna be short is the shadow longer or shorter than the stick I need to you to measure it Okay let s record it You measure the shadow Measure the shadow Whoops Scuse me Let s measure the shadow measure the shadow Is that long enough or do you need another Hold it still Bristava Is that long enough Is the shadow longer or the stick longer Let s compare There s the shadow measurer and there s the stick What do you notice It s the same size It s the same size it sure is What if you did it down here though Would it be the same size if you put the ball down here No the shadow would be much longer wouldn t it Good work guys keep measuring Try a different stick use that pointer stick Or another stick Here s a stick Here s some more sticks for you to try I m done with these things already it s okay Okay what are we doing Can you guys guess what that is Scissors How did you know it was scissors Because the shadow Okay the shape of the shadow told you didn t it She put on some blocks Okay No Oh she says no it s not blocks Is she tricking you Yeah Sometimes the shape is hard to tell can you guess Adam no Take a look at this one Adam Take a look at this one oh nope not from up here What do you think that is Know what this is Bryce What is that one Can you tell from the shape what this one is Gluestick A gluestick you re right Good guessing how could you tell Shadow of the lid You saw the shadow of the lid Good job Bryce s turn Okay now are you guys gonna play the takeaway game Okay Remember she s gonna put a whole bunch of objects on there sit down and you grab a good long look and then close your eyes and she ll take one away and you ll have to guess what shadow is missing Okay Alright what are we doing over here guys What are we doing You re making shadows Shadows You re checking out different materials Yeah Okay So what is that one Shelby what did you find out about that one Goes through What goes though What goes through The light The light goes through so does it make a shadow Yes Which part of it makes a shadow Boys and girls check your voices please Thank you This part Okay that thick part makes a shadow doesn t it What about the thin parts Doesn t make a shadow does it The light goes right through What else did you try What are you trying Takori Tell me about it Show me Why don t you try this Trayshawn But wait Takori was trying something Just a minute What have you got Takori A tissue It s what A tissue A tissue Is the light going through it Or did it stop the light Stopped the light It stopped the light so it made a shadow didn t it Did it make a light shadow or a dark shadow A dark one Okay Trayshawn your turn what are you trying The box is it stopping the light Get back here so you can see Put it down here Can you see it What do you see about it It s making a shadow Which part is making a shadow The whole thing is that a dark shadow or a light shadow A dark shadow Is this part dark or light Light Okay why is this part light Becuase it is a light shadow Can t hear you babe Because it s a light shadow Why is it a light shadow Why isn t it a dark shadow What s happening to the light Some of the light going through it Mm hmm What do you think Cooper What s making that shadow Um the light Okay the light is making the shadow What are we using what is this A box Okay is it clear or colored Clear Okay so what happens to the light It goes through Okay it goes through it doesn t it so it only makes a little bit of a shadow Good job Did you guys write the things over here did you find anything new to write down Let s try that Shelby You and Cooper come over here and try that Okay Cooper you may go to the bathroom What do you see Shelby Sorry You see a light shadow Why is it light Cause it goes right through Is any part of that dark This part That part Why do you think that part s dark Cause it has a wrapper The wrapper and what s the wrapper doing to the light It s stopping the light and it s making a shadow Exactly Very good Shelby thank you Go right here okay What s our time We have two minutes left We might wanna go back and see Hey what d we find out Raja what are we doing here Measuring What s your shadow doing Can you change your shadow How do you change your shadow By moving By moving By moving the object How else could you change your shadow What about the light What would you do with the light Move it Move it I ll hold your stick and you move the light How is your shadow changing Getting bigger What else could you do Move your light some more Move it up or down Ooh what happened to the shadow It got shorter Oh now what s happening Got longer didn t it This is making a shadow that s easy to see Look at that shadow When the light is high the shadow is Shorter Short And when the light is low the shadow is Alright now measure that Measure that How many cubes lie on that shadow One two three four five six seven Is the shadow longer or shorter than the stick Longer or shorter than the stick The same Oh it s the same I think our 
 Okay so ready to go here Okay I d like to take you back to the fifth century To a time when Attila the Hun was uniting the barbarian tribes and he was leading his great dark horde to conquer the lands of Gaul or Western Europe much to the chagrin of the Roman Empire But where I hear you ask Is Attila the Hun himself Well I fear he has perished He died in a drunken brawl would you believe on his wedding night And who am I I hear you ask to be telling such a tale Why I am Mrs Attila the Hun and it has been left to me to guide the dark horde as we continue to conquer the lands of Gaul Javelins and bows and arrows those were very well and good for tacticians such as Attila the Hun but what do I know about tactics Not much So I need something Very little you are right Josh the Hun is right So what I need is to get some sort of a war machine Now let s first think about what characteristics do I need in a weapon that would help us against to help us conquer the lands of Gaul What characteristics do we need in the weapon What do we need it to do Hurt people In other words we need to have some sort of damage at the end of property or Force something else So a force we need to have some sort of force Range What else I m sorry Jackie Range Range the range would be a good thing especially if we can get beyond bow range right That would help out to get some of the castle walls destroyed before we even get far right Steph Efficiency Efficiency can you tell me more about what you re thinking Well being able to complete said task without much power used in maneuvering All right we need to be able to move the machine around to be able to get the job done We need to be able to not perhaps use every single Hun for it So efficiency in being able to load it and being able to use it Anything else that we need in a weapon to help us in our destroying and pillaging of towns and villages Yes Katie Possibly something that you could use again Oh yes if we only use it once that s kind of a problem isn t it We want to be able to use it repeatedly Good idea Other things we want to think about Joe Something that s mobile All right so maybe wheels might help or being able to be something that could be lifted or carried Okay those are good thoughts Jackie Accessibility like making sure it s easy to use and not like difficult to set up So if it takes a bunch of people and they re struggling to reset it maybe not a good idea Something that perhaps a few people might be able to handle All right so we ve had a good deal of ideas so far That s really good So I need some sort of a war machine Something that would have all of those properties in it Hmmm why what is this Message for you Mrs The Hun A message okay let s see Why it is news of a new siege engine called a trebuchet Ooh We have a picture of our new war weapon but here s the challenge I need to build the best trebuchet the best war machine that I can and I m not certain what properties what characteristics what parts of this machine I should emphasize How big they should be how strong they should be So I m going to need you to help me out I m going to make little groups of Huns in order to create a model of our trebuchet Each group can then test a different quality What sorts of things could we change to test our trebuchet to see what would be the best one Caroline Caroline The weight on the opposite end All right the weight the counter weight and the load Both of those things and perhaps the ratio of them could be rather important Josh Like the ratio of the arm on either side of the axle All right the lever arm and how it changes that could be an important idea Other things that we might be able to change to vary or test Anything else we might be thinking of Kate On the angle right there Ah yes the angle and the angle of launch has a lot to do with There s a little pin that holds the sling in position until the lever arm releases it So the angle of launch and changing that could be important Anything else we might try Anything else we could change We ve had some really good ideas All right so I d like to break you into your small groups and I d like you to decide on what exactly your group is going to test We ll come back together in several days in order to share the ideas and information So I need you to prove your loyalty me Huns Build this trebuchet and test it and if Attila the Hun were here right now he d say What are you doing laying your duffs Get to work Huns Let s get into our small groups and see what you can decide on for your trebuchet And you can choose whatever it is that interests you You can choose something that we did or something different But what you want to remember is that you have to decide what to do before any work You have to decide I m going to change this part of it and keep everything the same until we take data Remind me first of all what it was you were changing Counterweight Counterweight so you re leaving the same object that you re launching We re just changing counterweight So what is that your weight Yes Okay so what challenges did you have if any in building this to test your counterweight We had problems with the sling and the pouch Like at first we made it really long so like that didn t really work It didn t go anywhere it kind of just fell apart and then the pouch itself it s kind of like too long So like it So a little engineering before you could quite get one to work but you did then eventually get one by changing the shortening the string and shortening the sling Yeah All right So at that point then it looks like you had some data and you took several trials Was there anything just off the end any pattern you happened to notice just as you were taking the data We noticed that if the counterweight was too heavy it would just kind of smack down and then if it was too light it would just of like it would float and then just kind of fall So there is an ideal weight to counterweight that would make it Yeah like our data we went from light to heavy and then it went from like not so far to like really far to like back again What if I wanted to know not 600 grams or 650 but 625 How could you analyze your data to allow me to interpolate between your data points or to go beyond if I wanted to know what s going to happen at 775 Make a graph or an equation Yeah Actually either of those would work coming up with an equation or coming up with a graph To me the graph is a very visual way of doing it You could determine then whether or not it is a parabola or whether it s some other sort of a curve All right and that will allow us to look at other data points which I think would be very helpful So your job then between now and Wednesday is to come up with how you want to analyze this so that you can explain what the results were from your trebuchet without sharing all of the numbers but just by giving the ideas of what it is you found I think this is actually very fascinating that you found your limit and then it comes back down I think that s very interesting the fact that it s consistent So help everyone else figure out what would be the ideal conditions according to your data Okay All right We can do that Hello Ready to share trebuchet Here s our data Okay so first remind me what it was that you were changing or testing We were looking for the angle The angle okay and when you were trying to build your trebuchet what challenges if any did you have in trying to test this angle Well when we were doing it we tried to make the arm in a way that it would be really easily changeable So it couldn t be like super secure It had to be we ended up doing it with rubber bands and like popsicle sticks so it was really easy to move Okay It wasn t a super intense trebuchet but it works Yeah we built the whole thing out of popcicle sticks Now I m not certain they had popcicle sticks back in the fifth century but I think No like twigs Twigs We ll do it with twigs that s a good idea Alright so then it looks like you took some data at different angles and you figured out then the range that it went Was there any pattern or anything that you noticed while you were taking the data It s okay to say no Yeah we noticed you d want to start it like farther back like there d be really no reason for you to start it at a positive degree angle Right Because then it s Because if it was positive it wouldn t really go anywhere Starting with angles that made sense that you knew would give you enough energy to start it All right and then what did you discover about the angles that you did try That the farther back you went the greater length that it would go So the very farthest that you took it back did get the longest range Yes that was the negative 45 and that was the largest one Now what limited you or was there a limit You stopped at negative 45 could you have gone negative 50 or No that was when we hit the ground because ours was so small It wasn t like high up to go all the way back Ah okay all right You were commenting on being high up When we get together on Wednesday and we talk about conclusions we ll also ask about what could we try in the future and that sounds like another something that you could potentially do Where if you took the same model but just lift it up Lifted it up adapted it see if that would matter All right that sounds good So we ve got several angles to comment on If I wanted to make a guess as to what would happen at 35 degrees or negative 35 or at negative 50 is there some way I could interpolate between data points or extrapolate beyond Is there some way that you could analyze your data that might allow me to choose a different angle than the ones you actually chose Yeah you could probably think of an average you wouldn t assume that it would be like 100 accurate we wouldn t guarantee that but it would give a good idea All right so if you did some averaging work if you did some been thinking of Actually not so much averaging You could even set it up like Like side by side like triangles Okay okay So figuring out maybe the ratios Yeah that s That you should get here using your when you say your size and dimensions All right and that is an analysis that is so legitimate These are equations you can come up with You do have the option of doing it visually that is with a graph Where you have your angles one direction and your range the other Just see what would happen now with just the three data points you have so far You may find that there isn t enough data to be for certain of what would happen but you re certainly welcome to attempt that in case there is a direct linear relationship or something that s easily recognizable So you get to choose however you want to analyze your data When we come together on Wednesday I will ask you to come up with a conclusion if there is one Some groups will find that there s no conclusion that the So that everyone else could know what the results were without looking at actual data numbers So that s your job for Wednesday and any other potential questions or things that you might consider for the future if you were to do another test Also a bonus that we can measure data Okay All right thank you good job The farthest range It was 650 grams for the counterweight Six five zero Yeah Alrighty so that s good So we did discover that there was a maximum and then we have lesser returns after that All right very good Fifth group tell us about your data and your trebuchet Okay our variable was the angle of launch as well Angle okay that s good And we analyzed it visually basically and we found that the larger the angle or the higher it was the larger the range was The larger the angle equals the larger the range and did you have any limits to that Not really it just kind of continues As long as you continue to increase the angle you increase the range So you mean like the angle of release of the sling Or the like how far back the arm goes before you let it go How did you measure your angle Oh we measured the distance from the counterweight to our platform and like the farther that we raised it up the larger the distance was Okay so the larger the angle to platform Like what other angle could we have used The back arm Okay and this one was how far we pulled it back Yeah So isn t that the same angle then Yeah but we just measured it inside All right All right so slightly different perspectives we ve all found angles on All right our sixth group We varied the counterweight also Okay counterweight and how did you choose to analyze your data We made a chart and a graph Okay so you had a chart and then the graph and when you graphed what did you graph We graphed the weight of the counterweight versus the range That s reasonable The counterweight versus range All right and as you examined your chart and the graph data what did you come up with as a conclusion The more weight we put on the further the range was Was there an upper limit or not Not from the amount of weight that we tested I mean I would suppose that if you put more weight than the trebuchet could handle then it would probably would have bad results So that actually gives us a place to go in future If we were to try to add more to the slab that might be something kind of interesting to find out is what is the upper limit and at what point does the equipment fail That might make a difference with our big trebuchet We want the biggest one that was successful Were there any other questions that came to mind or any other things that occurred to you while you were either taking data or analyzing it or building your trebuchet Josh The angle at which the sling was released mattered a lot All right and in fact if we were to combine that with your counterweight we have a couple of variables we might examine at the same time for the same trebuchet Other questions or things that you thought about that maybe you would ve liked to have added to or varied Steph When the sling did release we could never really tell where it did and we couldn t really tell if it released it after the object was launched or if it released at the point in time that it s supposed to So you could never really tell 
 Okay So if you re having trouble seeing it you can go back in with a regular pencil brush Visible enough for you You can go back in and make it lighter But right now the mark makings you re doing is really good As you want to turn if you re having trouble making curved lines you can turn Oh okay All right that helps Instead of turning the tool turn the plate and keep pulling towards you Okay It might make it a little bit easier to make those curves Yeah they re really tough to do Other than that it s been fine Good Is that working now that you what we talked about yesterday with this little Yeah shadow I thought it was kind of Okay And the same thing that I just told Kim if you re having trouble with the curved lines you can turn your plate and keep pulling towards you instead of using the tool to curve All right but so far what you re doing is good You re adding all these different values Continue with that type of texture on the edges because that s working I m just going That s okay Be patient Have you decided yet how you re gonna treat this area in here No I m probably gonna do what you initially told me treating the light areas from start from this bottom half and doing Okay so adding a different texture Are you leaving the text I never I forgot to reprint it so if I do decide You ll just have to reverse the text Yeah I know and I ll right add it in That s fine I think I ll just decide it later Yeah finish your whole overall design first Yes exactly And then if you want the text in it as long as it s reversed so you print it the right way Yeah You can just reprint it Okay sounds good Awesome Yeah So you re just Yeah All right the way you re doing the crosshatching here is really strong so continue that to make sure that it s consistent Do I have to make it identical No Well what do you think Are these identical persons It s like supposed to be but I know I m not gonna be able to get the exact family on the other side but I think it would look fine if it was different I kinda want it to look a little messy You want there to be a little bit of a different expressive line on each one I don t think there s anything wrong with making them separate I know that they re trying to be echoing each other symmetrically Yeah But all of the textures can be different Okay to add some interest to it I think it would be difficult to try to get the exact same thing on the other side Right Don t you think that it might be more expressive to add different types of textures anyway Yeah definitely That s good How did you decide that you re going to treat the inside of the mouth area Are you gonna leave that dark or do you want it to be light Well there s supposed to be some tongue over here but over here I m gonna make it like I m gonna try to go solid black in some parts Like I tried to do that inside the mouth Yeah That s good That s good I want mine to seem So then all of those areas then will stay dark Yeah It ll create a nice shadow Excellent that s really good Are you gonna go off the edge Yeah Nice that s really good Keep it up And Emily how s yours coming Yeah the same thing All those little dark areas that you re working on inside in between teeth now that you ve carved out all that area it s gonna create a darkened tone And as I mentioned before all the different stippling areas that s really good It s adding some more dimension and more depth to the figure If you re finding that it s easier for you to pull it off of your initial drawing if you wanna get a white piece of paper to put underneath or use a separate sheet it might be a little bit easier to see than using the table Okay Good good This is good I m getting confused of where I m going because if I did the backgrounds this is the negative space that I do the crosshatching Then it would have to continue down here So you want to decide all the different types of textures that you re using in between all of it Yeah All right so you ve got a little bit of the crosshatching here okay and you re using illustrative lines over here So you wanna try and find something in between that s a little bit different Right Uh huh Well you haven t done any stippling texture yet I was working on In here Okay so in here s gonna be stippling So right then this can t be the stippling because it s gonna be next to it I was thinking of here kind of moving this pattern down and then maybe just sort of Okay I think that would be a good solution to that It s like this area in the background Okay Now what if you decided to leave it for now by following just some of the shadows that are there and creating textures just where these shadows are and then leaving that solid And then you can make a test print to see if you like the way that looks keeping it solid Then if you really feel that it needs to have more texture you can go back into it and add it again Okay Okay so in here like you said follow the movement of these objects Okay this is all the chain inside the bike So following that movement with your line would make a nice gesture And then in here just because you have all this texture in here you might not need to put anything else there Okay What s your instinct as far as feeling how busy it is now to add extra Yeah it s hard to tell because I m not sure how it s gonna look when it s printed but I think that might be good Because it would get kind of crazy I think it might be nice to have And you wanna still have it have a focal point So if you go crazy with other textures in here you might be taking away from the focal point of your art work Okay I m having a hard time seeing it so you I might need to get one of those blue sheets Okay The blue sheets are working I think you know what Emily s been using the table So maybe that helps her to see her white lines That has been helping So if you don t wanna use one of those blue sheets you can do what she s doing and use the table Yeah I ll do that I think I wanna lift it off of the book So you can keep it taped to this and then flip the book out from underneath to use it or get a darker sheet of paper to help you see all your lines Okay Okay You re still working on your design right Yeah I think you might be ready to go on to the plexiglass soon Yeah Because once you figure out what s going on over here Yeah I just have to Yeah and all of this positive and negative space is really strong So what are you deciding to do with all of the other areas Are you gonna fill them in too Yeah I think so Okay then did you decide what kind of texture that you wanna put in there when you start etching it engraving it I don t know I don t know if I should do really fine crosshatching Mm hmm But then should I put a new texture on these What do you think Do you want it to be solid or do you want to have the texture when you make the print Because I think if I texture both of them it ll be a little confusing so maybe these should be plain and not have texture Okay so you can texture crosshatching in the background and then if you make a test print first you can decide If they re too solid then you can go back in with a different texture Okay Okay So finish up the regular part of your design first and start working on the engraving part and then you can do a test print and decide if you want to add more later Okay Room 221 Students enter through a small entryway To their right are inspirational displays and to their left is the entryway to a traditional darkroom This classroom is shared by two teachers Storage space is limited In this room I teach three sections of Photography Advanced Placement Studio Art and Advanced Placement Art History As we open up into the main part of the classroom storage areas are visible for each class photographic prints a whiteboard is visible with posted assignments and storage space where students retrieve gloves and archival sheets for their negatives As I pan the room you can see heated dryers for prints and negatives clearly labeled and accessible Bulletin boards are set up for project instructions visual examples and critique displays Along the back of the room is a dry mount press and negative developing chemicals with directions and safety instructions posted throughout Hanging from above are art history displays created by students to aid in the analysis of modern art movements Cabinets along the back of the room are clearly labeled for easy retrieval of student supplies In the center of the room the printing press is stored for AP Studio Art and set up to allow for safe and organized used Along the right hand side of the room there is a drawing rack for students to store work in progress and a light table for the preparing and viewing of photographic negatives There is an exhaust fan here for safety as well as a paper cutter with a safety guard to avoid accidents The file cabinets are clearly labeled for storage of student binders The large cabinet in the back of the room is locked to safely store blades and other potentially dangerous supplies And at the front of the room are storage bins for students to retrieve missing work or work that they might have been absent to accept And at the front of the room is the computer for student and teacher use The projector screen lifts to reveal a whiteboard for demonstrations and instructions Some of you are ready to print so I wanted to go through the actual printing press process today Some of you might even be ready to try that today If you re not ready to try it right after I do the demonstration you can go back to your etching or engraving and then by tomorrow you ll be able to run it through the press Before I do that I wanted to share something with you that s a little exciting and the fact that I actually have a relative who was a professional engraver My grandfather was an engraver He started in the 1930s and 40s After World War II he was part of something called the GI Bill Does anybody know what that is Oh I do Yeah what is it They pay people to go to college Yes exactly Yeah After the World War II veterans came back from war the government paid for them to go to college And he went to a college called The Art Students League which I was just talking with Alex about and he had an extensive education in figure drawing and he chose the trade of an engraver I m going to pass some of these around These are his actual engraved plates that he lent to me to show you You can take some of those So you can see that the tradition of engraving as we talked about yesterday goes back a long time A hundred years at least or even more But this is from the early 30s and 40s these engravings And these were actual etchings done with the acid bath that I explained that we don t do here because of the safety You re doing a plexiglass engraving instead without the use of the acid So I m going to demonstrate how to do all that inking and you can get to see the difference between the copper plates that I m passing around now and then the plexiglass plates that we re working with today And it s kind of cool my grandfather gave those to me and asked if one of you would ink it up and print one for him while we were printing all of this So I m going to let one of you use his actual etched plates and then print it for him All right so the materials that we have out here include all the different colors of print making ink So for the most part we re going to start with black today but you can choose any color that you want So you can see some of the examples that I put up here from past students One student decided instead of putting black ink on the white ground he used white ink on black ground So that s another method that you might choose to do after learning the basic process So all the steps that we re going to go over are up here to remind you during the class period during the rest of the week It s going to remind you of all the steps So the first step after you ve beveled all the edges in your plate that I demonstrated yesterday is to get yourself some print making ink And all of these materials will be out for you in front of the room and take it to your desk when you re ready You ll take a little bit of print making ink and put it on the plate like this Just like that And you ll use a tool called a brayer And the brayer will hold your ink and it gives you a nice flat surface to apply the ink onto your plate So once your brayer is filled with the ink you ll apply it to the plate And I m actually using my grandfather s plate from several years ago All right so you ll gently apply the ink over the entire plate Okay just take a seat and I ll hand it out All right And after you have the entire plate inked you ll check and make sure that you didn t miss any spots All right notice that I missed a spot there so I m going to have to bring it back to the plate to get all of the areas covered Once you have all the areas covered And this is just in interest of time I ll just show you the next step Once the entire plate is covered you ll take a small piece of mat board I ll just use this instead Okay I have little pieces of mat boards for you Okay so you re going to take a little piece of mat board or you can use a piece of the wood that I have cut up here After you apply the entire ground with ink you have to remove it so you have the clean surface with everything except all the ink that s going to be on your inside lines This has a dual purpose It removes some of the ink for you plus it also pushes the ink down into the surface of the plate This has been prepared for you to take off the excess ink when you re done This will push all the ink in the surface Okay and then once you get most of it removed then you can take the cheesecloth I found one of my mat boards Here we go All right so you can use the mat board here to get off most of the ink And then you can take a piece of cheesecloth like this and you want to wad the cheesecloth into your hand like this so you have a nice solid piece of it in front This will lift the ink off pretty easily And after you do this process This is the messy process so you should take a paper towel and wash your hands after you re done with this before we move to the printing press I ll show you how to do that Sometimes a circular motion with this will help So I m going to show so you can all see Circular motion to get off all of the ink from the surface I m showing you this quickly all the steps but I have one prepared for us to print with Just like a cooking show so it s ready to go All right so you re going to use Flat on the table I m showing you this so you can see it but you re going to do all of this flat at your desk Get all of the ink off with the cheesecloth If you run out of space you could fold it over to a cleaner side and start again Then the last step before you clean your edges At this point if you want to go clean your hands so you don t get it on anything again you could go clean your hands as well We ll take a piece of newsprint a flat piece of newsprint and just buff the top of it again to make sure any last minute or leftover fingerprints are taken off of it with this piece of paper The newsprint works the best so I have cut up piece of newsprints for you also to make a nice smooth surface And before you re ready to print you could take a Q tip dip it in some water and then clean your edges So the beveled edge that you made of your printing plates you should take the Q tip to clean any ink off of that bevel because the idea is to make sure the bevel around your image is clean So this print was left up here for a reason It doesn t have a clean edge I wanted you to see the difference between a student that cleaned their edge and a student that didn t clean their edge Okay this has a nice clean edge This has a little bit of ink left on the edge So when you pull a perfect print you want to make sure you have a clean edge And the way you guarantee that is cleaning it off 
 Why do they keep getting colder Why do they keep getting warmer They add water to it Maybe they add water to it Okay what else The thermometer What about the thermometer They could have lights Lights well did they turn off the lights afterwards Okay at this point at that point Maybe after they took their first temperature they took out the thermometer Maybe they took out the thermometer and that has something to do with it The thing is ultimately are we gonna know what they did Unless I was video taping you during that whole process There are a couple things I wanna point out here in a second I think several of the ideas are possibilities What happens if you put your thermometer into the water initially What do you need to do As soon as you put it in there what do you need to do Do you immediately start taking readings Yes Everybody agrees We immediately start taking readings As soon as we put it down in there like the first second we start taking readings We take a thermometer put it in hot water and immediately start taking readings Like what s the starting point and the next temperature would be whether it increased or decreased from that point Okay so we need a starting point What were you going to say If you put it in there like if you had it at a certain temperature and you put it in cold water it would still be reading room temperature It wouldn t change immediately Yes so it goes 22 21 19 18 It s going down So what could have been the issue here They took it at the very beginning Good good They just didn t wait long enough Look at this one I saw this in one particular group Because by the way you guys realize you were doing some very very different things right As we were doing and collecting this data there were some major differences What could have happened What was going on here Just the obvious stuff Observation what s the difference in the pattern Yes Ma am The hot water is like consistent like it s just gonna stay at the current temp Hot water stays hot Right Cold water is doing what Increasing in temperature It s increasing in temperature The room temperature water is doing what It stays the same With this same group I just happened to catch this Cold water Luke warm water The person was doing this This is the warm water Oh laughs body heat Keeping it warm Insulating it What was happening Transfer of heat We re gonna be doing a lot of labs over the next several weeks This doesn t seem like a big deal right I mean would you have noticed somebody just sitting there going like this You ve gotta start thinking like scientists though Because that could be a huge deal if we re doing something with temperature right Okay good Well the obvious or the observation What s going on with the cold water It s increasing It s increasing okay Luke warm water Staying the same The hot water It s getting cold It s getting cold Okay What s different from the first slide Yes The hot water went past the room temperature of the cold water Did it actually happen to somebody Did it actually happen Yeah Let s do this first Let s go back to here what word would you use to describe what s going on here What s all this heading towards Room temperature It s all headed towards room temperature There s a fancy word that starts with an E We may have talked about this last year The fancy word The idea there s a word I want you to walk away with The word is Equilibrium Okay how does this show equilibrium Rebecca how does this show equilibrium With the hot water how does this show equilibrium Rebecca It s Sierra It all goes toward the same it s kind of like the hot is increasing and it s temperature The hot is what I m sorry I meant the cold The cold is increasing in it s temperature and then it s going towards the room temperature It s going towards room temperature The hot is Decreasing in temperature and it s going towards the room temperature also Is this what we would expect All right so what happened Because I don t have any idea What happened here Yes In some places of the room there are places where there is a lot of air coming out So maybe that one cup was under a lot of air We do have some powerful air vents What do you guys think Is that that s a huge amount Any other ideas Yeah I think they accidentally read one of the cold cups and marked the temperature down for a hot cup Is it possible there s human error here And they just they looked at the wrong thing Maybe when they were pouring the water into the cups maybe they accidentally mixed the cold up with the hot So there s mixing the water thermometers maybe just read them wrong So you guys think some kind of human error then Yes Yes Let s go back to this and let s go to the next step Kind of like what we ve done in the past I want you to think of this at an atomic level a molecular level what s happening here In order to do that we re gonna play with BBs I ve got enough sets of BBs here each group is gonna have a set of BBs All right So group up a little closer together Alright so you two maybe go around you guys Here s what I want you to do Within your group one half have one set Actually the two of you can Marcus Good here s what I want you to do The BBs will be what Atoms Atoms and molecules Okay are atoms and molecules just sitting No When we add energy are they gonna go faster or slower Faster When we take away energy they re going to Go slower Or rather than take away when they release it I m gonna give you a couple minutes I want you to talk within your groups I want you to be able to do three things I m gonna call people up here in a second I m gonna stick you on the overhead so everybody can see your BBs I want you to be able to simulate the top line the middle line and the bottom line So getting cooler room temperature staying the same and getting warmer I also want kind of a bonus would be to use both how would you show something going into equilibrium All right talk to each other real quick Some are getting cooler Some are getting hotter Some are staying the same temperature and how would you show equilibrium I ll give you about a minute or two All right everybody Take a look at your BBs Hands off BBs I got a volunteer What were the BBs again Atoms Atoms And we re trying to show what Movement towards equilibrium Movement towards equilibrium What Energy energy and movement how those go together Energy transfer is kind of a fancy way of saying it Okay everyone take a look at the chart Here s the graph Show me the top line And tell me what you re doing Make it faster because it s hotter It decreased because it s going down and getting less heat Okay so it s gonna start the BBs are going to start going fast and then Slowing down Slowing down Could you show us Yeah we re in an awkward spot Getting warmer the bottom part of that chart At first it goes slower and as it gets warmer the molecules move faster because it s getting warmer Thank you I m gonna do room temperature I think room temperature would be this and it stays the same Kenny what Well it s gotta be moving right Room temperature would just be this and I have to do what Oh I probably should have picked the same group The two of you working together how could you show us equilibrium Of going towards equilibrium She s going to do cold Okay and you re going to do hot Okay good now time out What did you do Or were you not done I started out fast and she started out slow Why did you start out fast Because I was hot And you were Cold Cold And Lauren what did you do The same speed which was getting close to equilibrium Show us one more time Good Who disagrees Nobody Good Thank you Here we go keep going A couple more things real fast Most of you guys had this going about six seven eight nine anywhere from six seven to 15 minutes of data If we did this for an hour what would this look like They would eventually all be on the same line for a while And it would be pretty boring So this would keep going well what would be the lowest point Room temperature This would be the highest point Then this would still continue the same What s the word Equilibrium Here s how all this started This whole lab that you guys put together and created It s a demo Here s how it all started I asked you a question yesterday a couple days ago Jar bag with some water in it scarf although I told you gloves and then aluminum foil We came up we felt all four of these things And you made a predic Well the question was If we put these outside left them there overnight you look outside your window 
 Where do I have more potential energy at position A or position B Matt Position A Why Because it s fully stopped before it s there it s already moving a little bit What else Why does this point here point A have more potential energy than point B So this is A this is B Does everyone agree that position A has more potential energy Raise your hand if you agree with that Okay Now who can tell me why why does position A have more potential energy than position B It has more potential to do work Why has potential to do work yes why It has a greater height It has a greater height Who mentioned gravitational potential energy at the beginning of the class I did Okay so going back to GPE When you have a pendulum swinging back and forth types of energy that are involved are kinetic energy and potential energy specifically We can say that the potential energy is representing gravitational potential energy If you focus your attention here What is that A pendulum A pendulum Similar to what you have here Actually you guys within the next week you ll actually be working with the simulation it s effect simulation they re online They re free for you to use and they re nice because they allow you to play I know you like to a play a lot I like to play Yes Matt You will be working with this but I just wanted to show you another application of this just in a different format When we swing the pendulum what s going to happen It s gonna move It s going to move and at point here And here let s say A and B what type of energy is being represented Potential Potential energy Who can tell me where kinetic energy is going to be represented You wanna come up Sure Between A and B So every place along the path between A and B Does everyone agree with Ali Yes Yes okay Where is gravitational potential energy at its max Wanna go up and point At points A and B Right so everyone agree on the two ends Where would kinetic energy be at its max Where is kinetic energy at its max Right here Why Because it s lowest What else So we said here let s label this point C we already used A and B Why is kinetic energy at its maximum value at this point here That s when the potential energy is at its lowest Great that s where potential energy the gravitational potential energy is at its lowest And if you remember or can recall the kinetic energy formula what does the formula state What variables involved in the kinetic energy formula Matt Mass and velocity Mass and velocity What can you infer about the velocity of the pendulum as it s swinging along its path back and forth from A to B What can we infer about the kinetic energy It s terminal velocity is Well we re not gonna say terminal velocity the object isn t falling it s attached What can we conclude about the velocity at point C any thoughts Garrett Greatest It s at its greatest When the pendulum is at this point it stops at each point A and B our two end points it stops for a split second because it has to do what Maddy did you say it Turn around It has to turn around When it swings back down what s happening to the velocity Is it increasing or decreasing Increasing so if the velocity is increasing what s gonna happen to the kinetic energy value It s also going to increase Now if I show you a graphical representation Who can describe the graphical representation Like a downward Okay Ali As it moves I guess it swings back and forth the kinetic energy when it reaches the middle point it s the highest and then when it reaches points A and B the potential energy gets highest So does this simulation validate the thoughts and ideas you just came up with Yes Yes and we see that through the representation of the graphical information of your potential energy and kinetic energy I can stop it at certain areas Sometimes it comes out better than others It is somewhat on its way back but just note that the kinetic energy is lower than the potential energy And if I m really good I can maybe try and get it in the middle Close enough it s hard to stop it right in the center But you notice that the potential energy does what Decreases and your kinetic energy will Increase Increase rather And you said that the kinetic energy will be at its max at point C One other factor that s involved here There is one other type of energy or form of energy that s involved can anyone think of it Celini Thermal Thermal energy Mechanical Mechanical Thermal Thermal Garrett you had your hand up Thermal Thermal Who agrees with thermal Raise your hand Wait actually no Is there thermal energy involved in the motion of a pendulum No That s mechanical Thermal If you re saying thermal energy what form of thermal energy is represented here with the pendulum What is the pendulum doing right now It s moving through the Air Air When objects move through the air what can occur Or what is present Air resistance which is a form of Friction Friction Is or is not friction an example of heat energy Is Or thermal energy Yes so is it possible for us to have some thermal energy present Yes Yes Now how come it s not showing up on the graph There s no friction There s no friction So what I like about this and like I said you guys will be using the simulation And one of the options you have is to change the value for friction Right now I have no friction so it s not showing up on the grid So if I increase the friction you re going to see how the value for thermal energy will change Also when you apply or work with the simulation you can actually change the mass of the ball or the pendulum in the length of the pendulum itself And those are factors that you will investigate and collect data on in the upcoming days So let s add some friction Let s go about halfway What s happening to the friction It s increasing It s increasing on every swing It s increasing with every swing And the pendulum is not reaching points A and B anymore And the what It s not reaching points A and B anymore Why what s happening here we have all these types of forms of energy what s happening The air resistance slowing it down The air resistance could be slowing it down Want a little more Falls away Lots of friction and what s gonna happen Ali Losing particles It s not losing particles I m not losing any mass We re not changing the mass we re not changing the particles if there s a great deal of friction It s losing energy It slows down Does it lose energy How many of you think it loses energy Raise your hand How many of you think otherwise What happens to the energy that was present We had colorful bars Matt said it s colorful We had colorful bars representing kinetic energy and potential energy Now we have these great big red bars representing thermal energy and the total energy is thermal right now What happened in this simulation Ali I don t know that but because in the definition of thermal energy that s the total potential or kinetic energy in an object So there is potential and kinetic energy involved yes Steven you wanna try and help him out The energy gets transferred to thermal Exactly the energy gets transferred to thermal energy What does the word transfer mean Or transform what does that mean You know the movie Transformers You guys are not too young for that right I had a Transformer I did Jessica It changes It changes If we were to come up with a new concept today explaining what happened what could we say that we learned about the energies involved What would be the main concept the thing you just learned which Steven and Jessica proceeded What happened to the energies who can restate what they just stated Matt Or maybe give a definition Energy is Transferred but not lost Okay energy can be transferred or transformed and energy is not lost So what you learned right now is that energy can be transformed into other forms of energy Would you agree with that statement Raise your hand if you agree And what does the word transform mean Bella Change Good change So you changed We began with what kind of energy at this position Elaine Potential Potential Ailsa it changed to Kinetic Kinetic it changed to Potential Potential Changed back to Kinetic Kinetic and we also have some thermal energy involved Is everyone clear on that concept What you re going to do with your group get out a sheet of paper a piece of scrap paper Or you could use the back of your packet is fine there s a blank spot on there One paper Per group Per group Okay what you re going to do I m showing you two objects I brought in props for you guys today Real life this is my toaster from home Aw Is it a brave little toaster What I want you to do you have two examples Stand and look at the fan because it is plugged in it is turned on the blades are moving What I want you to do to these two objects I want you to write down the forms of energy that you think are involved with these appliances or objects but what I want you to do is take it a step further I want you to tell me or place in order what type of energy do you begin with and then maybe with one to two types of energy or forms of energy that are transformed So you begin with you might have a thought what type of energy do I begin with in order for the toaster to work What type of energy did the fan begin with in order for it to turn on And I want you to list the types of forms of energy involved and then put them in the order of transformation You re gonna get about two to three minutes to do this I would like every person in the group to participate You all should be able to share your ideas freely Respect what other people are saying and then come to a consensus and write down your idea and your energies Any questions before you begin Any questions Okay See it like stops here Like that s potential energy and Well if you look at the fan I purposely turned it on So the blades are doing what They re moving Are they doing work Yes Base your forms or types of energy on what you see The blades are moving it is turning okay If you want to list the energy you begin with put an arrow put the next form of energy put an arrow Put the next form of energy to show the consecutive transformations of your energy that s involved with the two objects Is it turning right now Do you all agree on that I would spend a little time sharing some ideas about that Wait wait wouldn t they both be nuclear energy Nuclear energy Yes because it s Think about your definition of Here you put the energy for toaster I would write it down Sucked in I don t have the jolt in that look I don t have the toaster plugged in Don t burn yourself But let s look and observe Three of you do you feel anything Yes do you see all those little black pointy things when you put something in there and you turn it on I don t know what you call those things but they like The coil Yeah the coil yeah Yes they do That s how you generate the heat If you had the toast it would turn on How about in the oven coils inside what colors do they turn Orange They turn orange the same thing They turn orange So do you think that there s a form of energy involved here Yeah Magnetic That s right Oh But you discovered it on your own 
 Tell them what you wrote Describe your three pictures and then they re going to share what they saw and the three pictures they picked The cat I picked the roller coaster Man What did you get for what I only did two I think the Earth Y all did the roller coaster Max is that possible Why not what did you write There s no gravity So in that picture he s weightless but where is he In front of a building So he s on a planet right Yeah So what should happen if this was a video and we saw the next two seconds of that video He s falling He should fall right All right write that down next to that picture I don t mean to do that All right so let s look at the roller coaster He couldn t even fall like that because you got the gravity pushing down so that s why why he wouldn t fall like that And that s either like strange stuff But I don t think he could fall like that Unless he He can t fall like that That s impossible Get his weight and Yeah exactly cause he can t do that Yeah cause you can see his shadow under that And don t think he I think he got like a hoop or something So like a little string or something Or like he fall Yeah cause he can t do that They must have took that while he was Cause that s impossible Earth s gravity pulling him like that Unless he in space or something All right so why would he fall Because the force of gravity pushing down So why would he fall that way and not fall that way The gravity would push him down and not up so There s like there s gravity on Earth so like if you consider like how Newton found the apple when it fell to the ground Okay so you know there s something going on that s pulling you down And you say What if you were on the other side of the Earth Would it be pulling you up then If you were on the other side Or would it still pull you down to the ground It would still pull you down to the ground All right so on the planet what can we say about gravity Where is it trying to pull you To the center Ah to the center so it doesn t matter where you stand it s not pulling you down it s just trying to pull you where To the center To the center okay All right one more minute for sharing Make sure you have three pictures described on your T chart If you need to borrow an idea from your neighbor do that now And you got the Solar System Okay so it says planets can move because of gravity Where are they moving around the sun And what has them go in a circle and not flying away All right who would like to share what they wrote with their group Their favorite one their favorite picture All right Arquel which one was your favorite picture The roller coaster Roller coaster who picked roller coaster All right so let s all look at the roller coaster And Arquel tell us what your team wrote down and Sarah will add it to our list We had put that the gravity brings the speed to the to the roller coaster So if you wanted to make the speed increase you would want to bring your hill higher So therefore the the speed will increase and it ll go faster All right so Arquel says that gravity makes roller coasters go faster So if you want a faster roller coaster you need to build a higher roller coaster Did anybody write anything different for roller coaster Carlos what did you write Oh the same thing but the steepness of the hill when it s going down it increases its velocity and it s more G s All right so he says the steeper the hill more velocity more G s What s a G Let s have Carlos try first then we can help him out if he needs help What s a G You said G Yeah A G is a pull Okay so it s a pull Adriana you want to add to it It s a force pushing against you All right pushing against you Anybody else want to add to that It s a pull its a force it s pushing against you How do we get a G force What do you think Austin You have a push or pull you have excess friction air accelerates Push or pull excess friction Arquel All the forces together All the forces put together on you Okay So let s write G force down and put a question Cause we re still not sure what that is maybe we can get there So we re not sure quite what a G is But we know it has something to do with gravity All right let s pick another picture Who had a favorite picture that we haven t talked about that wasn t a roller coaster What was your favorite picture Greg The dude The dude who is the dude He has a name We know who that is Who is that Enrique Johnson It was Newton right What was Newton s first name Not John Isaac Issac there we go Issac Newton all right And what does the dude say Isaac Newton What s he saying What s his quote Not that dude this one Oh the floating dude Okay the floating dude He d rather talk about the floating dude above Isaac Newton Okay so let s look at the guy floating in the middle of the air He looks like he s planking Is this a possible picture if you just saw the picture No Greg why do you say this is impossible Because the Earth s gravitational pull right Okay so he says the Earth s gravitational pull what Like this wouldn t work because when you pull Okay he should be being pulled down to the center of the Earth Why do you say the center Cause that s where the gravitational pull s coming from Cause that s where all the gravity wants to take you and that s where all the gravity s coming from I like that answer Anybody want to add to it Vanessa But if you have pressure against both forces you could possibly stay up longer Okay so how could you get pressure to make you stay up longer Chloe Force Where would that force come from Your body So how could he if he s not touching the ground make himself float What s underneath you that you don t see Gravity Well we don t see gravity but what s underneath him It s around us right now Air The air right So let s think about the air If we could make the air thicker what would we also increase The gravity Not the gravity we re trying to go against the force of gravity The weight The force against our weight What s that called let s think about a boat Floating in the water Bouyance Bouyant force right So if you could increase the bouyant force of the air and Vanessa said if you could make that strong enough you should be able to float Does anyone know a planet where there s more thick clouds than we have here It s our neighbor Mars He has clouds Who has clouds who has thick clouds Jarissa Venus Venus Yeah is that what you were going to say Venus has super thick clouds right And if we could go there maybe there d be enough air underneath you that you could float in the air If they was pushing enough bouyant force on your body okay All right anymore for the floating guy Did anybody write anything different for the guy who looked like he was floating in the air I know that Karima and Anthony had a good answer What did you guys write down Anthony Put that I put that the gravity will pull you to the center of the Earth and it will like Like it would It pulls you to the center of the Earth and what did we decide about where you stand on Earth Like on the other side So what would happen if you went to the other side of the Earth Would it still pull you the same way Or is it going to pull you an opposite way The same way The same way where is it always going to pull you Down Towards the center To the center to the middle okay It doesn t matter what planet you stand on doesn t matter where you are it s trying to take you to the center of the object okay So why do we get stuck to the Earth and that the Earth s stuck to us in this picture Cause the Earth s solid and it doesn t let us go out into the Okay so he said the Earth is solid Are we solid Yes Hmm okay so maybe it s not that we re solid cause maybe there s something else going on What do you think Carlos The Earth has more mass than us The Earth has more mass than us Jenny what s mass Mass is well all of us then We all have it How would you give a definition of mass what is it about us The type of weight It s the type of weight Okay we re on the right track Who wants to help her out What s mass The amount of density Amount of density Okay we re getting better Jarissa The amount of space that it takes Well what would that be what s your space Volume okay So space is volume We re still trying to figure out what s mass We ve heard some density words we ve heard volume words what do you think Ky The amount of electrons Oh we re getting closer So it s your electrons your Atoms Ah your atoms So it s how many atoms you have inside your body That s your mass So now someone else said weight so let s go back to that How do you get weight So you stand on the scale How do you know your weight What is going on What do you think Hakeem Pounds We measure it in pounds Okay so how do me measure it How do you get pounds What s happening to your mass What happens when you stand on the scale What is it measuring Your weight Your weight So then how do we figure that out What s going on What s going on on a scale Carlos The gravity is pushing you down Gravity is pushing you down So what happens to your weight if you have more mass You re heavier You re heavier So your weight how would we give a description of weight now We know mass is how many atoms you have We know volume is how much space you take up So now what s weight Carlos has kind of said it for us How would we put it as a definition It s the pull of what on your mass Gravity Pull of gravity So let s look at the guy in the picture again If this was going to be true what would we have to say about his mass to be able to float Would he be allowed to have a mass on Earth Hakeem says no Vanessa says yes If you re going to float and there s gravity always trying to pull you down in order to float what do we have to do With our mass Decrease our mass okay So let s think about if we go to another planet with our weight Does your mass change if you go to another planet Yes no Do all of a sudden you have more atoms in you No Depending on the gravity What did you say You have the same atoms but your weight and mass changes You said the same amount of atoms so your weight and mass changes But if you have the same amount of atoms isn t your mass the same Yeah Okay so what s the only thing that would change Jarissa The gravity The gravity so then what would that change about your weight Would it change or would it stay the same It would change It will change So what can we say if we went to a smaller planet You ll become lighter You ll become lighter Why Because it has less gravity Has less gravity so less pull You weight less okay So let s put weightless next to G force as another word we should look up Ready All right so what I want you to do now using all your notes that we just took and what we just talked about I want you to flip your paper over And in the circle I would like you to try with your partner to write a definition for what you think gravity is I ll give you one minute You and your partner try to figure out what you think the definition of gravity is and write that in your circle back Make sure you guys share that okay A lot of weight or What s the other word of how many atoms you have What s it pulling on Very good so it pulls on your mass And think about where it s trying to pull Oh that s a good definition of gravity try to write your definition on your paper Make sure your neighbor also has a definition on their paper Pulls what Pulls the Weight You almost said it Mass Mass Make sure you guys share that okay You guys done Okay so what is gravity It s a force so that means it s a what A A short pull Gravity s pulling us right Okay so what s so what do you think is it pushing or pulling Pushing Pulling Ooh we have a disagreement Better figure out which ones right Okay so it s a pull So where is it trying to take you to And what is it trying to take about Your Your definition All right what are you having I wrote that gravity is an invisible force that pushes or pulls you towards the center Okay so the word I want you to make sure we say is invisible Cause we ll talk about that okay All right so let s share our definitions Who would like to share their definition first All right Ky We put gravity is a force that always brings you to the middle All right Gravity is a force that always brings you to the middle So Sarah can you add that to the circle Arquel what did you guys write Gravity is a pulling force that brings you to the center of the Earth and it wants to the mass Okay so you added mass to that Okay so it s pulling on mass What do you want to add Angel I want to add to Kyle s answer that it s invisible Invisible So let s think about what we learned about forces If it s invisible you can t see it Is it touching you Yes Or is it everywhere It s everywhere Everywhere So is it a contact force or a non contact force Non contact Why do you say that Israel Because it s not touching you It s not touching you So even if you re floating in outer space will gravity still be there Yes What do you think Carlos Yes You say yes So those astronauts will they still feel some gravity Even though they re out at the space station What do you think Angel Outer space has some gravity but greater than that s why they wouldn t feel it What do you think it depends on We have mass so far But the strength of gravity also depends on something else We have mass but what could it also depend on Vanessa Force Okay gravity is a force Angel was getting there he was saying that it s still pulling on you it s just not as strong The weight That s mass We talked about mass and weight Trying to get the other thing that s going to control gravity How big the planet is Okay so that s mass Let s think about the astronauts who are not as close to the Earth Are they weightless They have the same amount of mass their mass didn t change But they went farther away from the Earth So why are they weightless Why do they float What s the other factor going on with gravity Moving away from the center of the Earth So what do we call that Has to do with how the gravitational pull depends on We have mass and we re looking for the other factor we could change to change gravity What do you guys think If I m really far away from Jarissa am I able to grab her as much as if I was closer No If I go real close to her is it easier for me to pull on her Yes But what happens if I go far away I have the same mass my mass doesn t change can I reach her as easily now No So what s the other thing going on with gravity Distance Distance So if you re far away from the Earth can gravity pull on you as hard No No But the closer you get the little bit stronger little bit stronger So then why do we feel the pull of gravity here on Earth but I don t feel the Sun We re closer to the Earth than we are the Sun So we re going to feel the Earth before we would feel the Sun But now if we left the planet we started going somewhere else say I was going to Mars What would happen the closer I got to Mars Who would start pulling me now Mars The Mars center of its planet would start to pull me Okay So let s look at the picture of the planets Thinking about pulling to the center why in the picture of the planets is the Sun in the middle of all the planets Because it s the biggest Oh it s the biggest one We got a couple of different answers so let s share with our neighbor first See if you know why the sun is in the center You got 30 seconds It s got the biggest mass It got the biggest mass and it s the biggest So like it got the most gravitational pull That s why it s in the middle All right Marco Why do you think the Sun is in the center of our solar system Because I don t know You don t know Okay Javier what do you think You re his partner what did you guys talk about Based on what we just talked about why would the Sun go in the center It has more mass It has more mass So what does it also have more Gravity So he s always going to be in the middle right What if we had a bigger star come our way Like what about a black hole Say one of our neighbors blew up One of our 
 Get out your journal I ll read it aloud and I ll put the time on the timer Get our your journal We re looking at journal entry number 14 And you re not allowed to write I don t know take a guess if you re not sure but don t write I don t know So question 14 is very simple Why do you think an earthquake happens You can write it you can draw a picture So I m asking you why do you think an earthquake happens You have three minutes right now to write what you think Why do you think an earthquake happens Why do you think an earthquake happens and why do you think Remember there s no right or wrong it s what you think is the answer Remember you can draw a picture if that helps you Okay if you want to draw alright you ve got like a minute left so you can draw a picture Write down what you think I m gonna give you about 30 more seconds Many of you are still writing and that s fine but I thought before we talk about this let s take a look at a little clip because I realize maybe not everybody has experience with an earthquake So this one s kinda cool It was shot obviously on somebody s iPhone so it s not the best quality but many of you know that Japan has lots of earthquakes all the time they re very used to earthquakes So this person lives in Japan and so again they re used to earthquakes right So they weren t like panicking so he actually took his iPhone and filmed the ground So I want you to take a look We re only gonna look at about a minute of it but I want you to notice how the ground is moving okay And we re gonna use that idea to talk about why earthquakes happen So this is pretty cool So this was back in March 2011 So notice Now they re gonna go to another part Notice the ground in the back watch the back You ll see something happen Watch what s happening Alright so that s real it s not like there was a machine underneath there doing that So you guys we can solve what s happening so let s take that and let s talk about this through Why do you think an earthquake happens Why do you guys think an earthquake happens And remember when we talk we re gonna let one person go at a time and we re gonna make sure we talk loudly so that we can hear Alright so let s just start on this side We re gonna work this way Tony what did you write Why do you think an earthquake happens Well I think there s something wrong with the mantle that s coming out through the crust and makes it vibrate the earth and causing an earthquake Okay something to do with the mantle causes the earth to vibrate Also I liked how you used a complete sentence So remember if you re not sure there s some sentence starters up there Jheyline what did you write I think earthquakes happen because two plate boundaries overlap each other Excellent because plate boundaries overlap each other Jose I think that earthquakes happen when plates crash When plates crash Together Anybody else Adrian and then Dajana I think that earthquakes happen because plates slide Because plates slide excellent Dajana I think an earthquake happens from too much stress Also I think the plate boundaries overlap Ooh I like what you said and that s exactly where I m going next So in that video clip you guys saw the ground move I m gonna give you 10 seconds And that 10 seconds you re gonna share with the person next to you how did the ground move What direction was that ground moving So you have 10 seconds share with your partner next to you or share with the people across from you Go 10 seconds Alright finishing up in five four three two one zero Okay so I heard lots of people talking so I m gonna pull a name this time remember you can say what you said or what the person next to you said So what kind of movement did you notice in that video clip Let s see Now Neferly what kind of movement did you see They were moving apart Good moving apart what else did you notice Angel They were moving apart Moving apart what else did you notice Dajana Well it was crashing everywhere but I saw the Ooh kind of like water coming out of the sky Josh what else did you notice Oh so a little bit of up and down movement Alright so up and down movement Anybody else notice any other type of movement So you guys said up and down you said moving apart Oh did you see how that piece literally slid Yeah Alright so that s movement You guys know some words for this What are some words that we ve learned to describe movement and Dajana said a couple What words Jina Shearing Yes so there was some shearing happening What else was happening Rodolfo Tension Yes some tension pulling apart And what else did you notice Daniel Compression Yeah compression squeezing together Okay so we re getting this idea that didn t Dajana you said it was stress or you said stress Dajana right So something about stress being kind of important So we re gonna take that idea Give us a moment okay thanks Alright so sorry about the interruption So stress Dajana was saying stress So let me give you an example So let s imagine that this rubber band is not a rubber band Let s imagine that it s a rock And let s imagine it s a rock I know it s a rubber band but let s imagine it s a rock So I m gonna take I m gonna go like this it s a rock remember So I m doing this to the rock and then I m gonna stand here for an entire year and then a year from now I m gonna put my hands further apart And then another year I m gonna put my hands further apart What s happening to this rock or this rubber band What s happening to this rock over time What s happening Lupita to this rock It s stretching It s stretching what else Add to that Tucker and stretching it out stretch is added to it Stress is added too nice Victor So maybe it s getting a little compression Okay maybe a little compression too My hands are getting tired Tony Continental drift Ooh like okay so if there were other pieces like my hands were Africa and South America they d be moving apart Ernesto Thinner in the middle Thinner in the middle Sakura Tension So tension now I m gonna stop because my hands starting to hurt but what would happen if I kept doing that I m gonna have you take 10 seconds to talk to the person next to you What might happen if I kept doing that and I kept doing that and I kept doing that What might happen to this rubber band or this rock So 10 seconds to the person next to you ten seconds Alright finishing up in five four three two one zero Okay I heard lots of good discussion So if I kept doing this I kept doing it I kept doing it Moses what might happen It might crack and break It might crack and break Everyone what else maybe might happen Victor It will scrape the mountain and it will create an earthquake and it ll break Ooh oh I like cause you remember this a lot right Little earthquake excellent Tucker It s just like when you shove your fingers go all the way back it will break Oh yeah that would be painful Jheyline It d probably explode from so much tension and stretch everything Did everybody hear that word she just said Which word did you say it would Explode Explode wow That s a big powerful word but that s pretty equal to what happened right Big amount of power Or like when you were doing that with the rock like when you were moving it like it would get more thinner and get more it would kinda get wider when after all while it s still going it s gonna like Good so let s step back a little bit So who was it someone had said earthquake right You had said earthquake So it s sounding like what if that happens first So before the earth actually moves before what we saw in the video what did you guys think was happening And Moses had used the word for it too What was happening to the rocks over time So over time what was happening in that rock that would eventually lead to an earthquake What s happening over time Ernesto what s happening over time It s stretching It s stretching keep going with that Diego It was standing It was standing Tony It s spreading apart Spreading apart Jheyline Widening Widening Tiger Breaking Breaking so wait before the breaking though you guys were saying it was stretching it was pulling so what word can you describe it building up in here building up Stephanie Through stress Ah okay so it sounds like if we re gonna make an earthquake we need to have stress first We have said stress that builds right Stress builds and then what s gonna happen when the stress builds and it builds and it builds and it builds and it can t take it anymore What s going to happen Manuel Collide This is stress keep going Not collide what s another word that s kind of same idea So you said it when I was over here It s gonna keep stressing and stressing and what s gonna happen to the rock Rip It ll what Rip Rip what s another word you can say It ll explode Explode Adrian Break Break great so there s going to be a rupture Or a break And then is that it End of the story Nice day that s it Where does all this energy go right There s all this energy building up where does it go Yeah it ruptures it breaks and then is it over No No what where what happened Where did the energy go Where did that energy go Irma where d it go Plate tectonics Yeah it has to do with plate tectonics absolutely Where did that energy go Where did it go Rodolfo Plate boundaries Yeah plate boundaries So okay we got stress builds ruptures it breaks and then is that it No That s the earthquake What action Yeah Anna It becomes an earthquake Yeah it becomes an earthquake and so what do we experience Jheyline Shaking Shaking oh So it sounds like there s a rupture or a break and then that s gonna lead to shaking and that shaking is actually what being released An earthquake It s an earthquake yes and what is that shaking actually being released So the shaking is released what Victor All the stress Yes it s releasing all the stress What s another word you could say Releasing all of its Power Power is a good word or Diego Energy Energy right So it seems like all an earthquake is is stress building up building up building up breaks and then we feel that What do we experience the energy as So what do we experience think of the energy as What do we experience it as an energy That That what s that Shaking Shaking right Alright awesome So now we re gonna you guys did that perfectly So we re gonna write that down in our notes Woah I know that earthquakes release energy right So that s what happens as a result So we are not in any way done with this because we are gonna talk all about different You guys have made a good start on what s happening So we are gonna take two notes today They re pretty short I m sorry the first one s a little long The other one s super short But this is what you guys were just telling me except now we re gonna add the word elastic strain which is what you guys were telling me You were telling me that energy was building up you were telling me stress was building up and that s gonna cause elastic strain Yes Dajana The pictures that you showed us What It only cut through the Kind of yeah Yes So like maybe cause on the bottom that came out of the ground Yeah And then it just spilled it over then it came out of the ground Yeah so thank you for those of you who got started Rodolfo let me just read this off for people So our first topic today is earthquake energy And this is what we just talked about But now we re getting a chance to write it down and we re adding in a bigger word And that word is elastic strain So elastic strain is the energy stored as rocks change shape So elastic strain is the energy stored as rocks change shape Okay so that s step one in an earthquake Step two Energy is released when the rock ruptures or breaks So elastic strain is the energy stored as rocks change shape and energy is released when the rock ruptures or it breaks and released energy travels in seismic waves and we will learn all about those next week But you can still write down you just think released energy travels and it s felt as shaking 
 What are his tools Is that your hose Awesome Now what needs to come out of the hose to put out the fire Water Yeah What color is it Miley is helping you out Look there Good water What do you do with that thing Marissa What s the doctor going to do with that I can t hear you What You re right Listen to your heart Very good Do you remember what we call that Not a telescope a stethoscope There you go All right Miley what does your teacher need What tools A smart board A smart board Are you going to draw the smart board All right Are you finished with your fireman Did you hear Miley Do you need to draw anything else for your fireman or is he all good I don t know where the fire is You re the artist where s his fire It s your fire Marissa what is that bag for The doctor bag The doctor bag I love it What did you draw What is that Very good And what do you do with the stethoscope Check your heart A whole bunch of fire Well I m glad you re the fireman and you re going to put it out I love it There you go Good job That is one colorful nurse I see it It s great You re almost finished What is that orange thing It goes your mouth and what does it do Do you remember It takes your temperature It s a thermometer Good job What are you going to teach your kids right there Good job What about the kids She s on the smart board right now Very good All right just a few more minutes We have to finish up so you all can stickers A B C D E F G H I You did draw the shot You re done All right You may go Give me five Great job I love your fireman A B C D E F G H J J I love how nice you folded that Anthony Good job Good job are you all finished I love it I love it Good job I love your teacher She s very happy What are you going to do in art Make me a picture Can t wait What is this A stair bridge Wow Who s going to use it I love it Who has an airplane What s the person I m a teacher I teach kids Who flies the airplane Ask Aaron see if he can help you out Do you remember Aaron can you help him out Who flies the plane What s his name The pilot Yeah The pilot Good job Mary What are you You re not the firefighter What are you Who s uniform do you have on The cop The cop s Very good You re going to arrest people Why They re speeding Watch out Aaron Mary s going to catch some speeders He s arrested He s arrested What was he doing Speeding Speeding Oh no Look what happens when you speed You crash And who s going to come rescue you Who will come help you if you crash The policeman and who s going to help you get better Who did you see yesterday Who came to visit us yesterday Do you remember We went out and got to sit inside of it Ambulance Good job What s going on over here You re what Tacos How many Two Thank you Are they for me This is my cake Your cake Okay What are you going to do with your cake after you mix it up A chocolate cake Oh no It just came out of the oven It just came out of the oven It looks great Is there a special occasion for your cake All right That would be great I ll make sure nobody touches your cake It s fine It ll stay right there What are you going to make Cookie dough What kind You don t know Put your hands up she said You put it in the oven How long do you cook it Five minutes or five hours Five minutes Good job Oh no it fell I think you re doing a good job but I think you have it crooked Hang on That s an awesome cookie Thank you Great job What do you tell her What do you say Thank you Thank you You re working hard You almost have it Cross it Good job Great job helping Awesome I don t know where the lid is for this Did you ask Dylan if he s the one that had it out Dylan do you know where the lid is for the Well then you need to help her Show her where it s at She wasn t sure Thank you Oh hang on a second N O Is that an R No No Let s fix it R S Help him out Dylan what s after S All right There you go What s next There s your P Q R S V Then what What s going on over here You re giving him a shot Why are you giving him a shot What happened to him What happened to him that he needs a shot He s sick Did it hurt What was in that shot What was in the shot The needle The needle but what came out of it It was just in his hand So what did you give him Yeah medicine What are you listening to Your heart My heart Am I okay Now I m about to give you a haircut A haircut All right Julius don t run All right So how do you like your job nurse Good I see why you made your picture all different colors Your nurse uniform is all different colors Good job I think your next appointment is here Have a seat she can check you out Leave the chair right there That s a shot too There s a different shot Yes I m scared Ow Shots hurt Ow I think you only need one What did you just give me Medicine Medicine Is that my Band Aid 
 And I m going to look at what number that is and I see that that is Now your information that you get we re going to be writing in our chart here So do you see at the bottom of your page it has ramp with one book you re going to write the distance that your car moved Now don t write 20 inches cause yours is going to be different okay You write how far your car went for ramp number one Okay Hold on just a second Isabelle Now I gave you guys numbers And the numbers are so that we all get a chance to do every part of this experiment The number one person is going to set up the ramp So they re going to put the dictionary and the ramp get it all set up for the group The number two person is going to get to hold the car and let it go okay And then the number three person is going to measure the distance that it went okay Close attention Okay so you re going to all have a job to do Now this is with the one dictionary When we do the experiment next we re going to try it with two dictionaries and see how it changes okay But for right now we re going to try just one dictionary Are there any questions before we get started Miguel Like the first one goes first and then on the second thing like you try to set the number one does the second job and the second person does the number three and the number three does the number one job Yes so everyone is going to get a chance to do every single part of the experiment okay So we don t need to fight over who gets to do the car and who can get that okay Isabelle question But what if we do the same each of us what we do Oh if that s what you get if you get 20 inches on yours then you write that down okay Yes Angie When you took No we re all going to talk to each other in nice friendly voices that s right Okay Max last question and then we need to get started Are we going to use the rulers Yes you re going to use the rulers And I know I didn t give those to the groups but I m going to pass those out right now okay Can I have you guys please quietly walk with your papers and your pencil to your group Who s going to set up the ramp Me Okay you re number two Start it in the corner It s a meter Come on over here Okay get your paper No but watch out Don t do it Awesome Okay boys and girls once you get to your group you can go ahead and get started It looks farther And this group you may use this ruler Okay measure it One right here and then here Are you okay No from here From there there No Ms Sprano said from here Nine inches No 11 11 11 inches It looks like eight Wait is oh no it s eight Remember what Ms Sprano said No she said from the front Actually I said from the back Good listening Miguel So how far did the car go Eight inches Eight inches okay excellent So write down your information You ve got a pencil right here Okay so the next step Isabelle Miguel and Angie Is you re going to try it with two dictionaries Okay But number three is going to set it up Look up at the chart to see who s going to set it up So who s setting it up Um number two Okay let s figure it out Okay now go to your group for a second Okay now is this how far going to Yea till we go Well wait a second are we measuring from the top of the ramp or are we measuring from the bottom So you re going to put the ruler right up next to the edge of the ramp and then measure to the end of the car So how far did that car go Five No it s to the end of the car So how far did the car go Two Two inches Now do you guys think that because you re on a thicker carpet that s going to change your results It should go up like that Do you think that the thicker carpet is going to slow the car down and make it not go so far Yes Yeah Would you guys like to move to that part of the carpet Yeah Okay you can move to that carpet and see what the difference is And you guys will have to share that with the class okay So try it again with just one dictionary okay So then one Have to let the car go guys We re going to try it with two dictionaries Okay so look at the chart to see who s going to set it up next Oh my God this is going to be loud We re good Ms Sprano She said from the very back You set it up No I mean you let go Who s turn is it You re doing the first one Who s number three We all have jobs to do Who s number one Okay so your job is to set up the ramp which you did a good job on Number two person who s the number two person So Giselle I m number three No she was two It s fine she s number three So Giselle you re going to let the car go and look Esmeralda is going to measure Okay so Excellent Okay now put that down Now which side do we need to start with Very good And then we can spin it around there So now you want to move it over so that you can measure at the end of the carpet Can you scoot it over some Very good so how far did the car go Seven inches good Okay so let s write that down on our chart Finish yours Change this so it s seven inches Okay now what s our next step what are we going to do next I don t know Are we going to try it with two dictionaries Okay so now who s going to set that up Looks like the number two person so Giselle is going to go ahead and set up the dictionary so put one more dictionary on top Okay good Well number three is going to let the car go So now it s Esmeralda s turn So you guys what do you think is going to happen Do you think it s going to go farther or do you think it s going to be closer When you let go of the car right now what do you think is going to happen You think it ll fall down Okay well let s see what happens Woah did you see how far that went Okay don t pick it Now wait a second it s Edgar s turn to measure So let s see how far did it go Edgar So we measure to the 14 Wow that went farther didn t it So your next step is going to be to do it with three dictionaries Please go sit down in your group and raise your hand Let s go sit down at our group The car s there 15 and a half 15 and a half 15 and a half Who knows how to write 15 and a half So number two would get to measure the distance on this one okay Okay so let me see how you re doing here Okay well can we try it again Can we try it again So you re on the second experiment So number three who s the number three person He is Jose s the number three person Okay so Jose get s to let it go Should we move this out of the way or should we keep it here So are you number three No I m number one but number one set it up But then see Oh Okay so it looks like it s Jose s turn to let the car go So hand the car No he sets up ramp Can you go sit down please and I ll be right with you Got it Okay Jose try it It s my car put it right here and let s see what happens Okay let go Excellent okay who s measuring Me Okay so let s measure Now do we want it are we measuring with inches or centimeters No it s right we re doing it the right way Don t worry Did it go farther or was it closer Okay so then I have a question for you guys listen If we put three dictionaries here do you think it s going to go farther or it s going to go closer Farther You think it s going to be farther What do you think Jose Farther What do you think Farther Well okay we better check it out Did you write down your numbers So for the second one it was 15 inches Okay Now we re on the last part that means the number three person sets up the ramp Are you the number three person So set up the ramp where s your other dictionary Okay so then we have to use the dictionary okay Can you let go Okay it s oh wow that might be pretty cool huh Okay so Devon it s your turn to let the car go And I like how you re moving all the stuff out of the way Selena you want to stay there or do you want to move Oh okay So who s turn is it to measure Again No number one gets to You know what I think we mixed it up Now Selena lets go of the car And Devon measures this time okay Did you okay so maybe it s Jose s turn Okay go ahead Ooh look how much it turned Okay so measure how far it went Okay so measure how far it went let s see what happened Do we move the 17 Try it again let s try it again Okay let s see how are you guys doing You got all yours finished Okay good Okay well I haven t gone over that Okay boys and girls raise your hand if your group had a chance to do all three experiments All three Okay 
 So we go back remember this Do not breathe at the end of a measure unless you have a rest Okay What s happening is things are getting not broken up Another example of that would be measure 16 to 17 You would not want to breathe at the end of 16 Now I want to go back to 13 and I want you to do what we did yesterday where we changed all counted eighth notes to sixteenths and we get rid of ties So what that does at 13 is it should da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da daa da da da da da da da da da da da da dum Okay It s kind of funny to do that on the bass drum so just play the regular part on the bass drum okay I can try to Nah I d rather you not because it s going to muffle it s going to kind of muddy up what everyone else is doing Try it at 13 everybody Da da da da da da da Working on accents One two and ready and go Look at measure 15 Da da daa da da da da What s happening is some of you are changing 15 to this Tell me what s wrong with this Anybody recognize what s wrong with that Adrian You played four Yeah I played four sixteenth notes and then I played a note on beat four It s got a one and two three e and up Listen again here s the correct way Oops wrong finger Listen again Try that Measure 15 One and two and ready and go Again More accent That last note s really short and it s really strong One two 15 and play Now play it the way it s written but feel it the way you just played it That will give you the perfect subdivision of the dotted eighth sixteenth note One two ready and go and Okay see how it places it very crisply Let s go back to 13 Play it Break it down into the sixteenths Da da da da da da da Ready 13 we re going to go all the way through 20 One and two and ready and play and Now I m going to get to what we are beginning to learn today I m going to go ahead and put my tie up here Now is there anyone who can tell me what this is What is that Daniel A dotted eighth note This is a dotted eighth note Who can tell me what this note is Sedekia One sixteenth note It is a sixteenth note so we have a dotted eighth note and a sixteenth note Now remember our rule that we just went over this morning about the dot With that in mind can somebody tell me what the value of that note is Cole It would last for like three beats Three beats And then you would have a sixteenth note Okay I think you re on the right track it would last for three of something but not three beats Landon Three fourths of a beat It would be three fourths of a beat so let s think about this remember an eighth note in 4 4 time gets half of a beat Everybody what s half of a half One fourth One fourth so the dot is worth one fourth of a beat that means that this dotted eighth note is three fourths of a beat Well that sounds a little bit complicated but all you need to do is think about this and apply it down here So who can tell me what I would write for counts under this dotted eighth note Raise your hand Lydon Would it be one e One e because that s the same as having three of both and Jaylin what would go here a e Okay so this is just another way of writing this Let s do a measure of counting that Ready And go and One e and a two and one e and a two and one e and a two and one e and a two and Now I want all my first row to do that four times okay And go and One e and a two and one e and a two and one e and a two and one e and a two and Second row ready and go and One e and a two and one e and a two 
 Starter stopper opposite side Okay Everybody has their marbles How many trials are we doing Five Five trials If the first one doesn t work raise your hand I will come help you and we ll talk about why it doesn t work and what we re gonna do to change it What you re gonna do to change it Okay Timers Get your people ready Remember you re gonna say Ready set as soon as that go All right Go Ready Set Go Oh You re supposed to get it Right here This great piling direction Did y all s work Yeah Good Good Did you record the time Look Tell him You guys are ready to keep going Five trials Good job And we ll discuss why yours worked in a minute We gonna take Okay hang on Tell me what happened When it got here it stopped It stopped Why did Friction Okay the Probably because the speed wasn t great enough Okay So you think you needed more speed No I think we need to take this off Okay Let s try taking that off Where do you think you can put those to get more speed Up here Ok Now what is that gonna give the marbles More momentum Yes Let s make it bigger Three centimeters Is this our second one Are we gonna do a second try You re going back to your first one because you want to make sure it works So reset it Okay Try again Did it work Yeah Let s discuss why did it work this time Look how we gave them these By doing what By um Making it higher Elevation Ooh And what s another word that Altitude Yeah That s good Okay So it worked How long did it take Seven seconds Face the recorder Got it Okay Very good Keep going You re ready for your second trial Okay We re done Y all already done five trials Okay Well let s just stop for a minute What comes down Let s pull together here Let s talk I want you guys to talk about why you think it worked Because the big hill helped The hill What force is that The hill was enormous so it gave it more momentum Good job So gravity pulled it down What did you say I said the hill s bigger than the hoop so it gave it more momentum so it would go To make it through the loop Right And the force pulling it down was what Gravity Gravity Good Now talk to me about the order that you put it in Why would you you kind of just did We put the hill here so the hill would go faster to go in the loop To get more speed behind it Good And the turn would Make it slow down Yeah So what do you think would make the marble stop down there at the end Friction Friction Okay Very good We got all five trials You guys need a knee Start recording your information It went really fast Really fast Just three seconds Did it work on the first trial No Okay Tell me what happened on the first trial It was like that And it just went off right here Okay Why do you think it fell off What was going on right here to make it fall Twist There was a twist in it So you just had to fix it so that it went straighter And so you pushed it Renny put it like this like around here Pushed it in So it might have been a little to steep too That incline might have been too steep What order did you put your elements in Hill loop and turn Okay And why d you put the hill first Because it s higher And it would give more speed What force is giving it more speed right here Gravity Very good Okay And then talk to me about why you put your loop right after that hill and not your turn Why didn t you put your turn there If we turn there s not enough speed For the loop Okay Y all both said the exact same thing Repeat that to me so I understand If we put the turn first it won t have enough speed for the loop Good Very good All right Good job guys Have you got five trials It s all three seconds All of em were the same That s interesting Very good We ll talk about that after you each need a knee and record your information Anthony what was your job Record So you were the one that found that they were the same each time Make sure you get written down everything Okay guys Talk to me We got three Did the first one work No Tell me what happened on the first one becuase I didn t see it The first one we had this open and we had it sitting right there and we had the chair right here and when we set it down right here when the chair was right there it kept on falling off So it just dropped So you think the incline was too what Straight It was too steep There you go That s the word I m looking for It was too steep Because it was right here and it was going all down Very Good So what did you do to fix it We kept on sliding it down a little Did you have to slide it down more than once Yes Good job guys So did you get it to where you could do five trials Yes And we got three for each Three seconds They did too They got the exact same for all of em How about that But look at your coasters They look different Yeah That s interesting too Cause their incline is steeper than yours Lets talk about the order that you have your elements in What s first The hill because it gives more speed when it s going down a hill so you don t But that s on what force Gravity Good job And why d you put your loop right after that Because it would have the most speed to keep going and then the turn return it Because if we did the turn it wouldn t have enough speed to make the loop Good job Good job Need a knee record your information and start figuring your speed Have you guys got all five trials Nope Uh oh What happened It stopped because of the friction When it get right here it started getting out of friction Friction right here What s causing friction right here Can I watch it Its gonna work this time because we taped it down Why do you think it s gonna work Because we taped it down You know what I want you to use that one How long did that take Seven Seven seconds All right Do it again Let s look at it again So it was stopping right here It always was stopping right there and then I taped it down Oh you taped this down That thing could be higher Okay I think you should try that We can use this clock No we need some more I was gonna get one of them books Guys you can use any state So what are you doing to the hills Making it bigger So the speed will go more faster More faster So that it ll increase the speed All right Let s see what happens Let s see if this one works Angel what are you doing Timing Ready One Oh We use good team work You are using good teamwork I m proud of it Ready Set Go It didn t start from the beginning I did not start that one Let me ask you this Just to give you a different idea because you ve already tried to change in the elevation of your hill Maybe how big the loop is How do you think that ll help So the will go faster and will make it go through All right We re gonna try this Help her out guys So we re making the loop smaller and that s gonna So now you might want to move this up a little bit there You see how this is gonna have to go There you go What about your taping If it s will the Yeah Let s try again Wait We were gonna time that honey Now you re ready to go So what was the solution to your problem To make the loop smaller so it would go through much faster All right Good job Now you re ready to time five trials Ready Go Look how beautiful Good job guys How many seconds Four Four seconds That s good How many trials Three We got two more I want to know You got three seconds on each one So your speed was the same Where did your distance come from We did how many feet and then we found out how many inches And times it by 18 because it s 18 on there How long was each tube Six feet Six feet How many inches is that Let s work it out Make sure you ve got it right on here 72 So you ve got 72 inches We only did one tube And how many tubes are there There s three tubes So 72 What would you do next Times three Yes 72 times three How did you guys get 216 You did 18 inches instead of six I mean 12 Okay So now you ll have to go back and redo your speed Figure in your speed So how do you find speed I still got 216 Well then you were right That s right So you guys are ready to go on to make a graph Let s talk about the graph you re gonna make Let s talk about the graph Thinking about what you ve learned in math and what you ve been doing with graphs in math using this data table right here What is this right here Time I want you guys to think about what we talked about with graphs I want you to decide what kind of graph you should make Line graph because it s over time Yeah Line graph I decided Yeah we decided to put a line graph because it s time So any time you use time the line graph is the one to use Very very good Do we write the numbers on here Yeah How are you gonna know what numbers to put on there Think about it You ve got the trials the distance the time and the speed Do you need to use these You re probably just gonna use your trial and your speed So you ll label your line graph One will be the trial and one will be the speed And do you remember when you did the race car activity Not the race car activity I m sorry Remember the Stanley the Sluggish Snail What did that line graph look like It was a straight line Because it was a constant speed So what do you think this is gonna look like Constant speed A straight line Good Okay You ve got your trial You got your times Let s talk about your speed First we need to look at your distance How did you figure distance We need to divide by those speeds But your distance is how far the marble traveled right 18 Yeah 18 Yeah because you said each was six feet Six feet You re doing it in inches Oh So let s go back and refigure that I want you guys to talk about how to do that Cause we want it in inches So what is the first thing you would do Y all talk through it Y all talk to each other Let s talk about it After you re done erasing I was thinking like how many inches each Okay There you go Talk about it Anybody know how many inches are in a foot 16 Nope Try again If you have a ruler 12 Yep Good So that s 12 x 3 Good 36 Okay So 36 inches and then how many of these are there Three Uh huh 36 multiplied six speed So you need to do 6 x 12 6 x 12 is 72 Make sure you got it right I did it before It is 72 So now you will do 72 times Three Good Do it on your paper It s 216 inches Okay Now what are you gonna do Write it down And then what Multiply 216 to this So how will you figure speed now Divide Divide what Three to 216 Very good Can you tell me that again Jeffrey You re gonna do what Divide 216 into three And you ll only have to do it how many times One Because you got the same speed each time You can do three into 216 72 And no remainder That s nice Isn t it Now knowing what we know about graphs what we re doing in math Jeffrey are you listening Y all stop writing for a minute and listen Knowing what we know about graphs what we talked about in math and using this data and speed what kind of graph do you think you re gonna make Line Why did you say a line graph Because it s the same I want you to think about this right here Over time We discussed we need to use a line graph okay When you make your line graph which two columns there s only two columns that you can use on there Which two do you think you re gonna use This one and Well you ve already figured that out This one and which other one And speed good Right Because you were figuring all this for speed What do you think your line s gonna look like Straight Straight Because it was the same every time Good

six seven eight nine Eight Eight nine ten Ten eleven Let s do that one more time Alex Point to each one One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven There you go 11 What do you say I win You win good job Give me five Give me five Give Shanidra five Good job guys 
 I can go into group two because that Except this one is like these two are like both like pop These two are kinda like both pop Because water s not bubbly This one s bubbly and this one s Coca Cola Or Dr Pepper Do you have a secret rule to use We re gonna get like one of those blue ones and that could be like the bubbles Because they re kinda the same Okay And this one like So I m gonna make sure I m understanding what your rule is gonna be Does it have something to do with bubbles or does it have something to do with it sticks to the side of the container It s the bubble Bubbles and stick to the side Yeah Okay so one group is gonna be sticking to the side and one group is not sticking to the side Is that right Yeah Okay great alright Alright friends In order to be closer together to really see how this is going to work I m going to ask Anagelia s group to very quietly come and sit in these three chairs here Go ahead and bring your liquids with you Thank you very much And What we re going to do is we re going to set up our rule so that it s up here at the front So actually Anagelia if you don t mind Callie and Natalie if you guys could scoot down just a little bit and then Anagelia s going to join you on that side so we can see this front area right here Okay Thank you So we can set up one of our groups on this table and one on this table For your what s my rule okay So you re thinking of your property and you re going to put the ones that fit the property here and the ones that don t fit the property here Who would like to go first Who would like to start Okay so Ryan s group Ryan s group Come up and set up one that fits your rule Just a minute Ryan Isabella needs to come with you One that fits your rule here and one that doesn t fit your rule here Just one just one One in each Okay thank you You can be seated okay So we have this one fits their rule this one doesn t fit their rule I can tell Bryson s already thinking about what it could possibly be This one can fit their rule Hold on one second That s where we re going but wait one second okay Let s talk about what we see Any ideas so far of what might be going on here Bryson do you have one that you could bring up that you think goes in either space The bubbles on the top Okay so you think it has something to do with bubbles Do you have one that fits bubbles That one He s got a hypothesis Now Lena he s got a hypothesis about what he thinks it might be Do you think this fits the rule Yeah Okay So now we need to check in with Isabella and Ryan Does that fit the rule Yes It does okay It doesn t fit my rule So your rule should be the same as your partner s Do you remember what that rule was Ryan Yeah Okay great Alright so Anagelia thanks for raising your hand Do you have one that you think fits the rule or doesn t fit the rule Thank you Callie Callie will you check in with Isabella and Ryan and see if that fits Isabella does that fit the rule Yes Okay Anybody else who s ready to bring one up Oh another rule Another one that might fit or doesn t fit Rigo would you like to try Which one do you think would go with this group Which ones from the ones you have would go with this group Bryson giving you a hint No that one doesn t That one here So you think both of these fit The blue one just the blue one Because look at this one It doesn t leave white bubbles Okay so if that one doesn t fit the rule where would it go Rigo Where would this one go This one Over here right Just hold that thought for a just a second No this one we said does fit it Right Isabella and Ryan are we on track so far Yes Okay Anagelia did your group have another one to bring up Okay That one you think fits in this side fits the rule And Callie you think this one doesn t fit the rule Look when it shakes Doesn t do anything Okay okay Natalina do you want to take a stab at stating the rule for us What s going on here I think it s the bubbles and not the bubbles because that whole group when you shake it it has lots of bubbles That one doesn t Okay so let s go back a minute though because you said two different things Sit on your botton Rigo First you said bubbles and not bubbles And then you said bubbles when you shake it and no bubbles when you shake it Is that the same rule or is that different Is the shaking part important do you think to that rule Okay so can you state it one more time for us When you shake it if there s bubbles it will go that one If it doesn t go bubbles it goes in that one Okay And Isabella and Ryan is that correct Yup Excellent so the shaking was the really important part of that great At least for this one it s weird Right because right now this one has no bubbles But if I shake it it gets bubbles later Okay Excellent Can you remember which ones you had in your group Yes Can you come and get them I m not sure if I can I m glad you can remember Can you remember Rigo which one you put out there This No that one s ours No this is ours Um yeah One two three four five I think you ve got five These ones are originally from Isabella and Ryan I think Yeah Isabella and Ryan can you come back and get yours Great Alright which partnership is ready to tell to not tell but to do another secret rule I thought I brought a blue Did you think you brought a blue one You figured it out Okay Natalina s group Can you put one on this side that is fitting the rule and one on this side that is not fitting the rule Natalina you want to check that one more time make sure that s correct Okay this one fits the rule you guys told me about earlier And let s leave this on the table Anagelia can you remind what the rule is Stick to the sides Anagelia can you remind Callie what the rule is too Go remind Callie So these two do fit right Alright show us one that doesn t please Okay Careful with the liquids please You okay Alright We actually got a little extra help here now didn t we We got two in this group that fit the rule and one that does not Isabella do you have one in your group over there that you think does or doesn t fit the rule Ryan can you sit on your bottom again please Watch what Isabella is doing Oh cool See if you agree Ryan watch what Isabella s doing and see if you agree Okay I agree Natalina Callie and Anagelia thumbs up Is that correct Did she put it in the right place Yeah Okay good Bryson and Rigo do you guys have one that you want to put in Yeah more than one More than one okay Oh three Oh Go ahead if you think that s right I think that s right Rigo Rigo can you tell us why you put these two here Because it can bubble Bubbles in it Because they have bubbles in them Does this Does not Just a second just a second Callie Does this one have bubbles in it Yes it does So it s not bubbles and no bubbles You re on the right track though Take a look again Ryan do you have one that you can bring up and add to our groups here Stuff on the side And this one it goes away after awhile Maybe this is the rule Thank you Ryan So far so good Yeah Okay Yeah Let s bring up all the rest Oh Bryson you can go ahead and leave those there You can go ahead and leave those there I think we re okay actually If you have any other liquids to bring up This one Bring them on up And put them where they belong and we ll see if we can figure out what the rule is Bring it on up bring it on up Ryan bring that one on up and see if we can figure out where it goes This one s confusing Ooh a confusing one I love a confusing one do you know why Because it helps you think It helps you think exactly It makes it more difficult to figure out Would you like to consult with someone Do you want to consult with Ryan Ryan come here a minute Your partner needs your help She s trying to figure out where this one goes What do you think I think it goes in no bubbles because no bubbles is the correct one Now remember we just found out though that bubbles and no bubbles is not the rule Because look this one has bubbles This one if I shake it has bubbles So bubbles and no bubbles was our last rule Okay Thanks for your help Ryan Anybody else give Isabella some assistance here Well you know the rules already right Anagelia What do you think Anagelia Which one do you think it goes in Listen to Anagelia Rigo What s your opinion what do you think Does it go in this group Or this one What do you think Even though you know what the rule is can you help her figure out how to classify it Rigo are you watching What do you think It goes in In that one That one In this group right here Okay What do you think Isabella You want Bryson s idea What does Bryson think I think it goes in that one Because Because most of them kind of move when you shake them But when you shake those they don t Oh interesting Let s try that out okay Okay Ryan come a little closer to me right now please We re trying out something different Bryson just said the ones Rigo you can stay where you are you re right close by No Bryson just said something really interesting He just said stand on your own two feet please Thank you He just said that these ones don t move when you shake them and these ones do move when you shake them and that s how they re classified So I want to just double check that I make sure that I agree with what you re saying Okay Bryson Does this one move when I shake it Not really I can t really Try it out Okay See what you think It kinda does Does this one move when you shake it Yes Yes okay Oh it sticks on the walls Ah ha So are you amending your rule Are you saying that the rule is it sticks on the sides Yes So this group right here is Ding ding ding ding ding ding This group right here is the one s that stick on the sides Yes Ding ding ding ding ding Ring the bell ring the bell But we still haven t figured out even if we know that that s what the secret rule is where does this one go That one That one that one Okay Natalina Let s take your opinion first Rigo we re listening to Natalina And then we ll hear from you okay Go ahead Natalina I don t think it follows our rule It does You think it s totally out here it s separate It s not in either category No I don t think it goes in this one You don t think it goes in this one No I do think it goes Because Because it doesn t really stick to the walls It doesn t really stick to the walls Okay you wanna hold it make sure Stick to the Other opinions Other opinions Anagelia I couldn t hear you Could you say it louder so the group can hear you Go ahead It should go there because when you move it some parts stick to the wall and some parts When you move it It sticks to the part It does stick to the walls Yeah Okay It s dirty Isabella what do you think I think it should go in this one because it kind of It sticks to the wall at first and then it goes down So and then doesn t stick to the wall Okay it sticks to the wall first and then it doesn t so you think it goes in this one May I have it just for a minute One thing I m noticing that s a little confusing for me if I look at this one compared to all the others this is the only one that s not colored in this group Does that make it feel like these ones are stickier because they re colored somehow So this one s not as sticky because it s less colored maybe I don t know So you re saying it sticks at first but then not so much after that Can we tell how much this one sticks No Yeah Yeah It really sticks It really sticks How about this one can you tell how much this one sticks Yeah It kinda sticks That does stick Most of it Some of it That does So it sticks but it is Most of it goes away and some stays Some goes away and some stays 
 Negative x minus it It s one over oh wait oh wait wait wait wait How do we solve for X X is the value of R anyway X is the value of R What would you do for the one over X Wouldn t that be the first term X is the value of R What I would suggest you do is is that you could rewrite this as an expression Oh as the power Oh Oh okay okay I used Oh yeah yeah All right yeah I got it So it s gonna be negative X minus one okay Okay no I got it So the first it s gonna be so what Whatever Oh come on I just wanted to find where it talks about It would be one minus one Oh we have one Is one over x the sum Do you see see what I m saying Yeah I m gonna put it in there so negative X minus one cause later it s gonna change Wait you don t really have to do it out since it s gonna change the so it s higher You ll have to you gotta Yeah No no no no no don t don t don t don t Don t even do that Do you know why Because it s part of a Well Yeah yeah yeah Cause the whole thing is negative and then that s the Remember the He s a natural But now here s the question You guys kind of already answered this question Could you have found it They give you basically R is two X Uh huh And since it converges it has to be less than the absolute value of You got it Okay That makes sense Go back for a second Yeah you multiply both sides by a third So it d be one third times every single one of em And the interval Um Oh Maybe someone s It means it s gonna get shifted and then You were just scaling the Because it s like I d never I never considered Oh okay Yeah It s not gonna change the domain of the Oh no no I m putting plus negative The answer Yeah So the only thing I m thinking is it might be easier for you to just It might make sense somehow Oh how do you read Yeah how do you No no no no no no no no It doesn t reduce the time it takes for it to No man right Oh okay yeah One third Oh I get it I get it It only converges as you No matter what well no matter what One over X Three X five X two in two over X I think it does Thank you You re welcome That s what I m yeah that s what I m saying One over X Because what they want you to do now So you d say power series is gonna be written as a form of say geometric series Because now you ve got what What s the first term Yeah Right Okay what s the ratio Negative And when you write that out put around it Let him once show him Okay Is it saying three X I would be I would take the Are you sure you re working together Yes And I ll turn it one We got one minus X squared One over one plus X squared That s X to the fourth right Minus X to the sixth plus X to the eighth This is if you are indexing this This is your first term this is your second term this is your third term right Think about the first one okay We have left that in order to get that a two X Like the first R okay the first side of it And say it s the second term that the first time So it s probably gonna probably gonna be it Probably Okay At least on these simple ones Okay Okay leave that for Okay N minus one over one minus one x minus one would be zero which would be Originally we have negative one X minus one The right one so it s either gonna be Now you re expanding by three instead of zero six So it s like negative X squared switched So the negative that goes over here is negative X squared too So the negative is which Y I don t uh I don t know what I m doing All right look hold on Isn t it the same as the third one That means that the Y like the same one Y is the common one Right To the one so this would be X minus one And negative Just put in one here four all right What s the ratio here One you re multiplying the outside of two X Another one you re doing it as the two X That means you re moving the X to the inside If you take a function and you just scale it by a multiple if you take arcsine of x any function you want and you multiply it by scale like one third one fourth Ah but then there we said No Oh my God what arc what are you wait wait hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on There s gonna be another one I haven t there and one third after that is what we re doing here Our R remains the same It s the whole series multiplied by the factor of one third Okay yeah I m agreeing to that I m pretty sure that s right You multiply this out it s gonna be one over three plus three x minus one Why are you multiplying it out Just think of it as a scale It s not anything to do it s not gonna affect our domain outside the function It s only gonna affect the range And therefore you re not gonna have any remains cause the remains only matter if you didn t have but like one third of it so we re not doing it like that One third after it we re doing like a stretched version So it s not gonna affect the equation so it s negative X What No no no no no no That s the series for Uh all right I m just negative X squared Right No no no I m putting negative x squared It s easier cause then later on when you do plus No no no no no I The sine s been switching No no Yeah but you can represent that by saying Yeah it s gonna be smaller Well it ll be switching but like would you represent how would you represent X in the whole thing To the negative see the n minus one is put that s how I m doing it Wait how would you find the If it s the absolute value of x minus one it would be less than one Mrs Dockin Yes Is this is this is this X We re not sure where we are because of these coefficients that change What is X over R Take this series right here which is that So then integrate it We just though you integrate every term to get it Now you re looking for a general expression Right You have a general expression It didn t tell you to come up with no they didn t tell you to do that Oh okay okay Okay because in fact that s not a power series That s not a power series It is okay but it s a different form of a power series So you don t have to write em like this because you would also need to have what You also have to have Right yeah okay Got it Okay You flip it around One good yeah good what s R The negative of yeah you re the negative x plus one but it needs to be in parentheses So now you need your R okay Now you re gonna do them when you get to It needs to be a form of K over R Oh I thought we just solve for R You said the third nominated was R All right guys she said 1 3 times one whatever that is How do you multiply these Does it need to be on the Yeah so you do it again Yeah multiply the whole interval yeah Multiply the interval And this is not in the form of a series That one third does that impact the greatness of one That s the question you want to answer I m not answering it for you right now you need to figure it out So when it s asking for does the function of the This it s like that You didn t divide it by seven 
 So does percent always have to be 100 No Because I see none of the percents up here are 100 They re all lower than 100 So you think a percent can either be 100 or less Yes Okay okay So that means you think this can be called an improper Okay Ian Three fourths and the decimal 0 75 are the same What do you mean by the same One s a decimal one s a fraction Well I mean like they re equivalent Ah Equivalent So does that go back to what Alana said Alana which ones did you have there One half and 5 So you re saying the same kind of relationship is one and the same with one half and 5 10 Yeah Okay Alana no Well I did one fourth three fourths 0 75 and 0 25 because they re all part of quarters Ah you did one fourth what was the other one One Wait one fourth three fourths All right 0 75 and 0 25 because they re all part of quarters Ah Okay quarters I can think of money Quarters Or Yeah 25 cents 75 cents Yeah 25 cents is one quarter 75 cents is three quarters Three quarters one quarter Excellent Good good Ian Everything can be made a percent or a fraction or a decimal Oooh So you found a way to connect every single one of them So everything can be made into Say it again A percent fraction or decimal Interesting So you re saying that I can take this percent and write it as a just a percent Or as a What else Fraction and decimal So okay he s connecting all He thinks all three of them can become equivalent From the views before Excellent Ian Six fourth one fourth and three fourth they all have a denominator of four Ah yeah What does that mean that they all have a denominator of four Well they re all like sets of fourths What does a denominator represent in a fraction The um bottom number When we write it as the bottom number when we re literally writing it what does it actually represent What s that for How many equal parts it s split into Ah the number of equal parts it s split into So let me go back to Ian Ian is saying that everything can be written as also as a fraction a decimal and a percent So can everything be in four parts What if it s in five parts Does that matter I can do the five parts as a percent or I can do four parts as a percent Yeah What about what Alan said Percent is it up to a hundred and that s it No depends on the range that you set it So can you give me an example of when something would be more than 100 Well like when something you did in Earth Science we did to see if our grow dino grew over 600 Good connection Okay So what did that mean if it grew over 600 It like grew bigger than times Over six hundred times its size Yeah 600 times its size Okay So is it possible so is that an improper percent No but we sort of get stuck into thinking that percent is 100 meybe we can t go over 100 What happened here You tell me about that percent It s less than one percent Is that possible Can you think of a real life example when you d have less than one percent about growing something expanding over and over to 600 times its size Can you give a real life example of when I would have 0 When you fail a test Oh Well I could fail a test with 64 What does it mean if I fail a test with 0 Other than I m in big trouble at home What does it mean What would that mean if you failed it with 0 What would that mean about what you did on the test You didn t get anything right Yeah you got zero right nothing right Didn t get a single question right Can it be less than zero Is this less than zero Yeah No It s less than one So where is zero here Tenths is that zeros No Where s zeros Between Where would they go Would they go in the ones place tens place Ones In the ones place We have zero ones So is this less than zero Yes No No No because it s 0 1 Interesting okay So can I have less than zero percent No You can have a negative but If it s negative percent Can you have a negative percent What do you think Well I was going to say something could be like one point like point one percent less than something if you re comparing two things Okay your percent of increase or decrease have you looked at that in Earth Science yet Standard deviation Okay We ll talk about that somewhere else the percentage of increase decrease I m talking about a negative increase in or decrease in percent And whether that s below one or zero Okay so can you give an example of where this could occur Where I can have less than 1 It can occur I think with that fraction Okay but that s just a made up Can you give me something in real life that I could have less than 1 You can have an example of more than 100 So my question is does percent go from 100 to one or zero or is there anything less in between What do you think Like a gas tank in your backyard Okay Like when you call in to get it filled and it s really low The meter s low and under one Okay that s typically not going to be measured in percent it s going to be measured in how many gallons for your tank it s going to be a volume situation Oh Okay but we ll talk about that So let s keep that in mind We re still trying to find an example when we have less than 1 Think of one Alice Like on the labels and stuff on the vitamins less than 1 of your recommended day or something I just so happen to have here vitamins You re right And there are some examples when if I take this I m not going to get my daily 1 I m going to get less than that But there s some of these in here ooh like if I take one of these I get 100 of vitamin C Now I drank a glass of orange juice this morning when I took my vitamin What happened to the percent of vitamin C Where s it at It went over 100 Over 100 So there s a real life when I can get over 100 of something Anybody get over 100 on a quiz or test ever Over And how do you get that Bonus Ah bonus questions So we re good with coming up with more than 100 But we re still trying to figure out if we can think of an example where it s less than one percent So we ll go back to that Any other connections Let s see if we can connect the ones we haven t done yet Anything with the leftover ones One fifth and 20 are equal Okay Box right there They re equivalent to each other right How did you know they were equivalent Because one fifth of 100 is 20 Okay she did one fifth of 100 because we think of again we keep going back to a hundred for 100 is 20 out of 100 Excellent What else One tenth and 10 Ah what can you say about one tenth and 10 They re equivalent Again equivalent Going to go back to Ian Ian they re finding the percent and the decimal but there s no fraction there Fraction with a percent but there s no decimal Is there a third for all of them You said there s an equivalent fraction decimal percent for all of them No But there can be The decimal would be So what would you like to add here Ian Let s go to the which one You pick one Find the equivalent relationship and see if we can find that third piece we re missing Well 150 and six fourths is equal Okay Do we think they equal each other No Yeah Yeah Convincing but not yet you haven t convinced everybody Do you think that equals Okay four fourths would equal 100 And one fourth each fourth is 25 and if it s two over then I ve got two fourths left over And that d be 50 And they can also equal 0 5 So now we need the decimal piece 1 5 What did you say Alan Uh two fourths can equal 0 5 So what do you think six fourths give me the decimal that I ll put here We agree that these are equal 1 5 Oh so there is a decimal that goes there How d you get 1 5 Oh because one and a half Got it See where the half came from You said Ruby you had told us that one half and five tenths were equal So if we have that one half here we do the same thing we combine it here to get the 50 Okay So any others What s the missing piece Ian Uh you mean like another decimal to put in or do you mean like another Well pick two that are equivalent and give me the missing third piece One in one thousands One thousandths One thousandths and 0 1 Ah Are these equivalent No Yes No You re going to have to convince them Ian It s the day of Ian convincing I don t know They are Why do you say they are Because one percent over a hundred Well because that s tenth that s not thousandths It s not one tenth it s one tenth of a percent So here s another question then Are those equivalent No No So be careful That s not one tenth that s one tenth of a percent So could one tenth of a percent be the same as one one thousandths Yes Yeah but when you divide it by 100 Ah so we keep hearing divide and multiply by a hundred so when I convert from a percent to a decimal or percent to a fraction I m using powers of what Ten Ten So the question is Is that the equivalent to that Yeah How do you want to do it Ava Um Can you fill in the missing piece Can you give me the equivalent decimal to try to convince me to go from here to here with a missing decimal that I have I have the percent and I have the fraction but we think we re going to get all three of them Can you tell me what decimal that is Um zero and one thousandth How did you get that Um divide by 100 Ah Dividing by 100 What do you notice happens when we divide by 100 It goes back Okay when we divide it It moves two decimal places And the decimal place moves two places over So did that happen So are we convinced that these three are now equal Yes Can we see that now But you divide 0 1 you divide it by a hundred to get Oh yes you re changing it back because you multiply a decimal by 100 so you have that Okay Yeah Now that Ava gave us the decimal is it easier to convince ourselves that all three are equivalent to each other Yes Because now you when you read that you read it as what One and one one thousandths So are we convinced that we can find an equivalent fraction decimal percent for every fraction every decimal and every percent Yes So why do we have all three Why not do everything in fractions do everything in percents or do everything in decimals Why do we have in real life all three things going on Alice Because for some things it s easier to picture it in percent in decimal Okay so picturing a visual to go with it can you think of an example of one we use or in real life Well like with money It s like easier to think that it s going to be 25 cents or 0 25 than like 25 of a dollar Yeah wouldn t that be interesting if they said how much is that salad today Well it s something percent of a dollar Okay Ian Well with fractions one third is equal to 0 333 and keep going Ah so if we did with fractions or decimals we might have some repeating 
 Please freeze for a moment Gentlemen what did you think about your performance I wouldn t say terrible but were you accurately on pitch all of you No No Like as soon as the ladies came in you were like Whoo and then you forgot what you were singing Okay So don t let them distract you They re trying They re trying to have this beautiful sound and pull you off But hold firm men Hold firm to your position All right Let s try it again Here we go Sing noel sing noel noel noel Lock it in Sing noel sing noel noel noel Two parts Sing noel sing noel noel noel Sing noel sing noel noel noel Together Sing we all noel The support Sing we all noel Two parts Sing we all noel Sing we all noel Back to the beginning Sing noel sing noel noel noel End song All right If you were going to give yourself a grade what would you give it Alison As a class Like out of A s and B s and C s Yep I would give an A minus Okay and why the minus What do you think we think need to improve The pitch was kind of off at some parts Okay So there was maybe some pitch issues What about energy level It was okay but this But one of the things about African music is it is something that is like felt in their soul Okay It is traditionally when you listen I mean they are just letting it You know when we see any of the performances or listen to any of the CDs we ve listened to it s just very gut felt I feel like you re Sing noel sing noel noel noel So This is so pretty Yes we want SING NOEL SING NOEL NOEL NOEL Especially on that Sing we all noel That s me We re singing It s like you re telling people We are singing Not Sing I think we all noel Okay So let s make sure that we re right there on that One more time See if you can get a little more weight to your sound I don t mean make it flat I just mean with more confidence more security more support Okay Here we go Sing noel sing noel noel noel Awesome Sing noel sing noel noel noel Two part Sing noel sing noel noel noel Sing noel sing noel noel noel Support this Sing we all noel Sing we all noel Sing we all noel Sing we all noel Sing noel sing noel noel noel Good And stop there So you get the idea That was awesome Did you hear the difference Yeah Awesome I love that you challenged yourselves You pushed yourselves there It s hot Those notes are kind of high I know that And you just pushed right through it So good job Let s review the instrument parts we just got to touch on last time So I m going to come here so we can do our body percussion Real quick We are going to start with our bass part Ladies and gentlemen we are not going to use these right now because traditional African music is by rote meaning you learn it by hearing You learn it by doing If you are a visual learner these are our music stands by the instruments so this will help you And you know I want everyone to be successful so you use the tools that will help you be successful You be an independent learner where you decide If this is what you need grab a music stand Okay If you don t you don t need it Okay So there are music stands in each of the instrument sections when you pick Okay So basses first Let s all kind of scoot over this way So bass section first We have starting with your left hand Sing oh sing oh sing noel Sing oh sing oh sing noel And you have that crossover Sing oh sing oh sing noel Everybody feel comfortable with that Any questions You look good You look like you have it All right Then we have the xylophones This one s a tricky one So we have for that part Let me just double check on our words that we decided for last time So we have Sing noel sing noel Let s simply celebrate it Sing noel Sing noel Let s simply celebrate it Sing noel Sing noel Let s simply celebrate it Sing noel Sing noel Let s simply celebrate it Okay So the trickiest part is how many G s All right So remember we have low C and high C So you have C C C C C C And there s four Gs over that syncopated rhythm G G G G F E D Okay So it s kind of like One two three down the ladder you go Okay So let s try that C C C C C C G G G G F E D C C C C C C G G G G F E D Got it Got the idea All right Then we go on to the glockenspiels And for that one we can just clap that rhythm because I think on the instruments it will be easier to see to show because they re so obviously a little so it s not really like that So here we go It goes Sing oh yes sing noel noel Sing oh yes sing noel noel Sing oh yes sing noel noel Okay Got the idea for that rhythm So I will come over and help that section and some of you may remember that from last time Then we have our percussion section Okay We have first the conga drum A real quick review on conga drum playing Everything in you is going to want to tip it toward you If we can kind of spin back here so I can show you When you play a conga drum you scoot over this way a little bit And scoot over that way There we go So when you play conga drum you actually are going to hold it in between your legs and put your feet around the base and you re going to tip it out from you So that that way the sound can come out but you also have the correct play style Remember pat on the ends when you re playing And those are in You can pat this on your lap as well Right now practice on your fingers Okay So here s on this Practice with a good technique right now Ready Go This is the part of the conga drum All right You ve got the idea And that goes over and over each measure Then we have the log drum And the log drum And again the parts are right here on the stand if you need them You re going to have One side you re going to play Sing So basically And it doesn t matter with those Sing noel sing noel sing noel Okay So you can clap that real quick Sing noel sing noel sing noel sing Okay See how it fits Hello Welcome Thank you very much All right So Next we are going to have this part which is traditional African bell And this one you have Rest rest rest noel Sorry hi to low So it s Rest rest rest noel Rest rest rest noel rest Can you snap it Noel Rest rest rest noel Rest rest rest noel And you can try it Rest rest rest Hi and fast Noel Rest Get them up Noel Rest rest rest noel Yes Ladies and gentleman I m always spot checking to see if you have rhythmic accuracy when we re doing this It s really important that I see that participation Because then when we go to pick parts I m looking to see who has it Yes there s choice but also to check you off on including this rhythm thing Okay So let s try it again Ready Go Rest rest rest Rest rest rest Rest rest rest noel Rest rest rest noel You got it And then I love these shakers You are the pulse You are the heartbeat and the foundation of this song So it would really be nice if you could pulse with my pulse so we could all pulse together So again really important We might add in some other more African instruments They re kind of loud so we ll see if you can get the correct sound So what I d like you to do now Do you have any question All right If you really mastered the instrument that you got to start on last time I would challenge you to maybe pick a different one Okay If you were still working on it you re welcome to stay there But without any payoffs so just kind of selection I would like you all to go and pick an instrument part Remember we have glockenspiels basses xylophones and percussion So open Two glockenspiels open and a bunch of xylophones open Who was there first Who was there first between you and Ellen I was here You were there Okay So if you want to join the glockenspiels you can do that You can go to xylophones Oh nobody s up to the challenge All right Once you get there you can start practicing All right Hold up everybody All right Thank you Since we re trying to add in some singing over the top of it eventually if you have the green mallets would you especially for you guys switch them out with the felt mallets instead So here s a set Well you need those for that as well So we have one There should be another one in there Oh here right here Nope those are green You don t want those Oh here s another one right here Here here you go here s a set That s awesome Thank you Because that s just going to make it a lot softer and not quite as angry sounding All right So let s listen to each part so you can know what you re listening for Remember when you are playing in an ensemble like this if you can t hear the other parts what does that tell you You re playing too loud Yes you re playing too loud And remember again texture is everything We want to be able to pull out the different parts so maybe at the end we can talk about different ways we can set up a form to highlight that But for right now let s make sure that we can keep it soft Okay It s not a competition All right No one s going to win It s the whole class that we re trying to do this together So if we hear bass part first And let s go ahead and add at least shaker for right now and then we ll build in one or two sections One two ready go Okay Time out So you re listening for the beat She s watching me instead of the basses right Because you re doing their work a little bit and you need to keep it nice and steady What happened we ended up with three different tempos Did you hear that One two ready go Okay Pretty good And then we started to kind of get off where the beginning of the patterns are Okay One thing that will help is adding the singing to it Okay 
 From the top This way Starting from the top Woo hoo That went better Can we have a ruler Yeah 75 Okay make sure you record it 75 what 75 cm C M What s C M stand for Centimeters Centimeters Okay now we ve got to get the average I m gonna do the average Go ahead go to your next one I m gonna check on the next group Okay no you don t put 75 for all of them I m not Just on that one We knew it wouldn t go any farther Just put 75 for the first one Second part Trial two Now what do we do Okay go ahead Tell me what you found out What did you discover about bubble wrap sand paper wax paper and just the plain ramp On the bubble wrap it didn t go Because it was a bumpy surface Because all the bumps because it was too bumpy and had to much friction Too much friction okay And so what did you discover Sean I discovered that on the sand paper it got higher and lower What do you mean by that higher and lower and higher Can you explain that a different way to me well So what does that say about the surface Increase and decrease Spencer what did you discover So So it went farther on plain wrap versus the wax paper Yeah Okay so right now you re going to find the average right How are you gonna find the average Like 32 plus plus 30 plus 41 divided by three Okay you guys go ahead and do that Who s going to be the calculator I am You are Okay I might suggest someone else also be the calculator so you can compare your numbers and then I m gonna come back and talk to you about your results Okay Okay let s sit down Let s see what your doing It s not going very good on the sand paper Because it s just like the carpet Why won t it go as far on sandpaper Because it s like the carpet Okay what does that tell you about friction That if it s sand paper it doesn t have a lot of contact It rubs against the rug It rubs against the tires I think it doesn t One person at a time Paul Because it rubs up against the tires and it doesn t have a lot of friction If it did have a lot of friction it would go faster Okay so does sand paper have friction or not Yes or no No No Yes What is friction One person at a time It s like whoosh That s friction Hm Okay can you explain what is your idea Stephen Friction When a car rolls on carpet it s friction because it slows it down Sand paper slows it down too So far what have you discovered about friction and wax paper versus sand paper Wax paper Let s let Stephen tell me okay Wax paper is kinda like it s probably gonna be like the Look at your numbers and what have you discovered so far Because you already recorded them It s the highest so far What does that mean it s the highest so far It s the one that has the least amount of friction It has the least amount of friction okay And how do you know that Because we did the experiment And what happened It didn t go as far It didn t go as far on what Okay go ahead an finish your experiment Go ahead and finish on the plain ramp you have one more to do I see here Okay And then we ll talk about what we should do next Oh 39 That s showing you more about fourth dimension Let s talk about our results Talk about your results that you ve noticed Sh Stephen Tanner I need to be able to hear this group okay We found now that our total averaged out to 85cm for our total average Okay what does this tell you Look at your averages What does this tell you about friction That friction slows you down like the salt slows you down on ice Like the plain ramp is kinda like the ice It makes you go faster Right and you know what it s doing outside right now What is it doing outside right now It s sleeting It s sleeting it s snowing and the roads are very very slick So what do you think s gonna be a great idea because I know my husband s coming home from work tonight The roads are gonna be slippery What s gonna happen so they can create friction so the roads are safer What should the road crews do Salt They can put salt and Salt and sand Salt and sand Yes Why So it didn t go at all I wonder if it was small little bubble wrap if it would work better What do you think I think if they were popped Oh if they were popped I wonder if they would Maybe so Okay down here you have a graph that we re gonna talk about a little bit later But this is what I want you to do I want you to pretend like you re a teacher and if you were going to tell someone one thing that you learned today from this experiment that we did What would you tell them I want you to write it on the back of here What s one thing that you ve learned today that you would teach someone and then we re gonna talk about it okay I want you to talk about it when you re done writing talk about it with each other and I ll be back in a minute okay We can share when we re done writing Or we can share them as we write them So what would we tell someone I would say friction on the ramp would make something go slower What would you say I would say the rougher the surface the more friction I would say something about the same thing that you guys were saying except a little bit different I would say it depends on which kind of surface it is If it s bumpy it won t go If there s bumps and air all over on it If it s a smooth and soft surface it will probably go a lot faster So tell me what you are you still writing We all shared it Okay but I want to see it in writing Like I want to see something written down I said the bumpier the surface the more friction it makes Okay Spencer what are you gonna write Because I m gonna write kind of the same thing as Heather Is there anything your gonna change about it Or add to it I m gonna say the bumpier the ramp is the more friction and the less and the less further it goes Okay I like that I think you guys are learning a lot about this Sean I see your writing something a little bit different What are you writing I m writing the smoother the surface the farther the car goes You guys are right The farther it goes Because why Because the friction because the surface is too bumpy and it has a lot of friction so it was causing it to not go But on a smoother surface Barely any what What word is she looking for She said on a smoother surface there s barely any friction And I like what you said You said A smooth surface is like ice A smooth surface is like ice right I said the bumpier the surface the more friction Right but you also said something that if it was a smooth surface it s kinda like ice There s no friction to keep it from like if it s outside today if it s ice your car could go anywhere but putting sand down or the salt keeps it Less friction More it has more friction Okay Okay go ahead and finish What What do you want I wonder what would happen if you tried snow and see if it would run on snow and then we tried ice Oh so how would be do that I like that How would we do it When it s like an icy day or something and there s a little bit of ice somewhere we could bring the car out or something not like a real car Oh okay Just like a play car And try it out Try it out on ice and then they would put a little snow and then we would try and see if it would go faster on the snow or on the ice How could we change this experiment What could we do next time if we wanted to change it to find something different out I think you could use a plain surface and you could probably use popped bubble wrap We talked about that Popped bubble wrap and what else did you say The bubble wrap could be what Talk about that the bubble wrap could be what Guys I need you to not come in here You can use un popped bubble wrap and you can use the tile and you probably use like a grid with the marbles Instead you can like use a car Okay talk about that To see if it would fall off Now what would be the purpose to see if it would fall off With force and motion how does that tie in Well what I mean is will it like go far If you make a ramp and you try to get it on and wanted to see if it would fall off or not Like if it was on the It depends how fast it would go if it went faster would it fall off But if we re talking about friction does this have anything to do with friction Oh I love that So wood carpet and ice And we could freeze ice because we have big containers 
 Gina I wanted to test the amount of acid in different brands of antacids example Alka Seltzer Maalox and Tums can effectively neutralize Okay so far we ve been listening to this are we talking mostly the same equipment same supplies Yeah Right Maybe some beakers maybe some pipettes and some base Right Okay is this similar to Juan s This one is right So maybe we can start grouping these two together Christina The goal of my investigation is to determine which laundry detergent is most effective Tide Clorox or OxyClean by determining which is most basic Any concerns Yeah Adrian How do you know that the most effective detergents are gonna be the most basic Maybe there s some other factors that go into that and they re it s just basic ness Juan That some of them have really strong bases and maybe the vapors I mean Some of them have safety warnings that say like don t get too close to the vapors that come out Okay so there could be some toxic chemicals that are associated with these which is why we shouldn t use them Is that what you mean Yeah Okay okay we use them in our homes but don t bring them to school right Yeah I m a little concerned too about your idea that it s about which one is most basic Okay Cause the active ingredient in Clorox I think is bleach and bleach Sodium hypochlorite Is sodium hypochlorite Which has a pretty interesting smell I d stay away from that And then we have Tide right Tide is not bleach all right I m not sure what the actual detergent active ingredient is but I m pretty sure it s not bleach So this is probably going to require some cleaning up and making sure that we test something that we can test and that it makes sense why we re testing it Okay All right we ll come back to this And OxyClean is powered by Billy Mays so it doesn t matter it wins anyway I think he died didn t he Yeah he did it s too bad You know that guy must have made so much money I better not complain Adrian Go ahead I will find the molarity of one of the magnesium sulfate bottles in the lab inventory To do this I ll mix 50 milliliters of magnesium sulfate with 50 milliliters of one molar calcium chloride in a beaker I ll mix it to form a precipitate of calcium sulfate After as much precipitate as possible has formed I ll weigh the precipitate and calculate the molarity of the magnesium sulfate solution with the data collected Any ideas Jimmy I m kinda wondering why it s important to you like you said to make the lab meaningful Yeah it should be So Adrian do you have a response It s just cause bottles that don t have molarity kind of annoy me and I feel like I should there should be like a label that says the molarity I just kinda You know my room is open fifth period every day you can come on in and do these experiments and get them so that you know their concentrations I don t have a free fifth period After school s fine too That s cool that s cool What concerns me is I thought the theme was titration right Is the theme titration Okay where is the titration aspect to this Do you know what I m asking here Yeah I know I just didn t realize Because you re mixing you re doing a precipitate reaction everybody see it that way I think you re doing a precipitate reaction and so I just feel like you know this you had the wrong theme going on here Anyway we ll move on Nicholas Artel Artel Sirhan Sirhan although he was a bad man though I think right He was accused of being a bad man Go ahead The goal of my investigation is to see which of two pills have more Vitamin C per pills and weigh them to 100 milligrams and cut away mass as appropriate crush them dissolve in water and use a base to titrate it I would also use a pH sensor to see what the solution to see when the solution is at seven to see when it s neutralized Doing this will let me know which company I should buy from for my Vitamin C pills What do you guys think Vitamin C is ascorbic acid I don t know if you wrote that Did you No okay so if it s an acid you can titrate it right Is anybody concerned about like anything here Jimmy Don t the pills tell you how much Vitamin C is in them Like the bottle Wait let me make sure if you buy a Vitamin C that says 100 milligrams of Vitamin C my assumption is when you pull out one of them tablets and you crush it and you do this experiment it s gonna be close to that 100 milligrams So are you testing because you think they re not accurate Yeah Oh Okay so you re testing for accuracy on their part just to keep them honest Because I mean 100 milligrams it s kind of a non specific number All right Ian Actually another way you could look at it is that just because it says 100 milligrams that s how much of the Vitamin C is in it that s not how big the tablet is Being that sometime I mean you could have and say just arbitrary numbers you could have a 500 milligram tablet that has that 100 milligrams of vitamin C or you could have a 200 milligram tablet with that same 100 milligrams of vitamin C so you might wanna know which one actually had more stuff in it actually had more stuff in it per density Okay but is that what you want him to do I thought are you doing it because you wanna make sure that when they write 100 you don t care how big this tablet is unless unless what s the danger here Some of that other that tablet contains acids or bases in them then that would affect your results right One of them I have is pretty pure it s pretty much just ascorbic acid the other company I have does have some other stuff in it so I was wondering if anybody else had like one that was mostly Vitamin C Have you ever been to like the CVS and looked in the section I mean I could find one I just haven t There s a bunch you could even What d you guys figure out It s turning yellow Why do you think it s doing that Maybe the bicarbonate when it dissolves gets out some CO2 and turns it acidic I didn t think it would be that big of a deal because Wait Hang on so you mean so far what you ve done is you ve crushed these things you tried to dissolve them and you added some bromothymol blue Yeah And that bromothymol blue is not quite the color that you want That s right That s what you re saying Yeah What color should it be Blue I guess It s kind of green It just looks as if this coloring is just green dye Have you thought about using like phenolphthalein That has a distinctly pink color otherwise it s clear No we did not think of that You wanna try that Yeah Yeah that d be better So the phenolphthalein is gonna be it s probably going to be behind If it s pink it s acidic right No if it s basic Do the bubbles matter All right could I just stop and ask you guys did you guys get your color change you were looking for Yeah So the titration is working out Yep Very clean What So tell me what you got here This is a disinfecting Clorox we re just starting out we re just trying to measure out 10 milliliters That one we re done with we got it to the brown like it didn t stir anymore that was it That s as far as it went We put in 61 and that was it Now we re going to start this one And that worked with the one molar So is this oh so this is a different concentration Or how is this one different this is just a different This is a different type and it s a different percentage of the hypochlorate That s disinfecting spray and that s bleach With a different type of Clorox cleaning product All right Did you make sure that mixing some of these would not produce anything poisonous No we did not make sure But they re I just wanna you know we don t wanna create any of these strange gases coming out of here When we looked at the reaction this is the reaction that they showed on the thing And this was fine like it said it should be done in basic and everything Okay God bless you Excuse me How s everything going Not good with this one What s in there It s red wine vinegar But it hasn t changed color The treatment s too powerful Yeah we re thinking it s too So we re gonna do the white What s the solution to that then Why don t you just use less Less of the vinegar Right All right So we use five milliliters instead of Well I mean right If you use less then don t you think you ll be able to titrate it Easier Well you d need less base to get there Right Okay Let s go over here see what happens over here So squeeze that out What are you guys so you ve got Vitamin C crushed in there you used is this bromothymol blue what did you use Yeah we used BTB and now we re gonna see how much base we used Just out of curiosity why did you use a graduat what is this about 50 You didn t want to use like Cause that is are you gonna All the other ones were like dirty Yeah they were kinda And I think this is accurate to two sig figs which is our experiment s limit All right coming along okay it looks like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Hi You re adding 20 drops of bromothymol blue Yeah Is that too much Well has it occurred to you and it probably hasn t it s okay bromothymol blue itself is either a weak my guess is it s a weak acid it could be a weak base but all indicators are going to be weak acids and bases So we always want to use a bare minimum amount Therefore how about if you use something that has a distinct color change roughly at the neutral point like phenolphthalein Cause then it ll go from pink your This is acid These are acids so they ll go from clear to a pinkish color Okay okay but do you think the pink will be able to be seen Well Like the blue one You know the blue you need to use a lot more to get there although I don t know I suppose since you already did this one I mean we could remeasure out You may wanna well we don t want to run out of time here so right Stay consistent and then consider it how you can make improvements later Okay All right Now that s very nice You guys have questions What was your results in comparing what the company says and what you There was a little bit less since we used 500 milligrams and the company labeled it as pretty much pure pure ascorbic acid As in the first trials it was around 480 per kil to which is it s pretty close and the other one was around than what you re probably paying for But But that s then again it could ve been because Because not all the powder dissolved some of it was still settled on the bottom So they could be really accurate Yeah they could be you know dead on For the trials did you guys use different amounts of stuff for the two trials For the first two trials we used 500 milligrams of powder for each pill and then for the third trial we used 100 right A hundred And then for those trials like the third one you said you used a different concentration of NaOH Yeah Why did you use a different concentration First of all there wasn t much left of the 567 and also you know who s to you know maybe that could ve been contaminated it might not have been 567 so it s also good to use some different stuff sometimes Right You can t always base it you can t have it all on one thing Yeah that s smart How did yo actually figure out the amounts What was the math Oh We did the stoichiometry Yeah but we assumed that it was a one to one ratio one hydrogen ion dissolved from the ascorbic acid from one OH from the base And so we just calculated moles and changed moles to grams using the formula mass of Vitamin C Do you know with certainty that ascorbic acid is one H plus No we just assumed that for the experiment Maybe you should look that up Yeah Yeah The other thing anybody else So the other thing is and I just wanna make sure when you said 500 milligrams that s 5 grams right We did it accurate with Yeah cause that thing the scales here give you two sig figs right Okay I mean to the hundredths hundredths of a gram right So you crush this thing and you weighed out 50 Yeah That s what you did it How much was left in the I mean of one tablet when you you know what I mean When you crush it Yeah How much We had excess I mean one of the pills I had was 1000 milligrams so we you know we had about we had a like about It is my fault for Oh you were using 1000 milligram tablets And then my pill was 500 milligrams and then we weighed them and it was actually six five seven like milligrams That s how we removed So we had to we removed mass Oh well how bout this if it if they say 500 but the thing weighs six What d you say six or seven hundred Oh yeah Then aren t there other ingredients already in there Not that were listed like Yeah they weren t listed It just said it just said Vitamin C Because they might just list the active ingredient right Yeah In other words if the pill itself weighs more than the 500 that they claim my guess would be there s more of something else Okay Because here s another thing Don t you need possibly a binding agent to keep all the Vitamin C in a clump Do you see what I m saying Yeah yeah And they ll typically use some there s gonna be some certain chemicals they re gonna use that s in there So I have a feeling before you write the company be careful they re Yeah yeah They probably added other ingredients Yeah Because what I think might ve been even better is if they claim 500 then why don t you just crush the whole thing regardless of how much it weighs And then titrate that You see what I m saying Yes Cause then they re claiming there s the You see what I m saying So that would be taking further just simply Yeah that would be The experiment Wouldn t that be like the next Yeah Thing that you could try Same thing with 1000 right I mean if they claim 1000 Yeah Go crush the whole thing and see what 
 Welcome to our kindergarten classroom The library is the heart of our room where books are labeled and sorted by genre and reading level to facilitate student self selection This is also where we display author studies current student work and student made literacy charts This is where we have our writing center more level texts classroom volunteer supplies and a lending library Math work is on display and student portfolios are organized and easily accessible We have a few tables to facilitate guided instruction and small group learning Our schedule and calendar are housed in this part of the room and we have a message board which is portable and used for modeled and interactive reading and writing Our learning center s chart organizes student movement around the classroom and our word wall houses high frequency words and rich tier 2 vocabulary words But on the morning of the fair the little calf was nowhere to be found She had wandered down to Mud Pond by the cornfield to cool off When she waded into the muddy water her feet sank With every step she sank deeper and deeper and deeper The little calf was stuck in Mud Pond Get the hands Get the helpers the farmer shouted when he saw her All the farm hands came running with their ropes but the more they tugged the more stuck the calf got Get the big yellow tractor the farmer shouted He can save her But the big tractor just scared the little calf She sank deeper and deeper And nearby farmers began to gather around Readers I think we ve come to our problem in the story I think the characters Otis and the calf have a big problem Talk to your partner and see if you can figure out what the problem is Readers I heard a lot of good ideas I heard a lot of good discussion Miami what s the problem Who sank into the mud The baby cow It s called a calf Oh my goodness readers I heard everybody s discussions You guys were all talking about the big problem the calf is stuck in the mud Help me write that in the problem box Here we go The calf is stuck in the mud That s our problem The calf is stuck in the mud Let s see what effect this problem is having on the characters in the story Let s see how they re feeling now It tells me where to stop to ask you guys questions Call Fire Chief Douglas and the fire truck the farmer shouted They can save our little calf But the sight of the big red fire truck startled the little calf into the mud even deeper The farmer was fit to be tied If the farm hands and the big tractor and even Fire Chief Douglas and his fire truck couldn t save the little calf who could Oh my goodness Look at everybody What effect is this problem having on the calf and the farmer and the community How is everybody feeling I like Amir s raised hand How is everybody feeling Amir They feel sad Sad I heard you say another good word that started with W Worried Worried They re sad They re worried How else are they feeling Sad worried Scared Scared Scary what if they can t get her out Scary call a lot of people Yeah They re in panic mode They re trying to call everyone They re panicked Frightened Afraid Afraid Worried Worried So so worried So so worried They might call the other tractor The big tractor can t get her out He already tried Wait Kanye were you talking about the other tractor The red one Oh they might call Otis Maybe Otis could help That might be a good solution to the problem Let s see what they do Let s find out Suddenly the little calf s ears perked up Over the hum of the growling crowd there came a faint sound in the distance A soft rhythmic purr Put put puttity chuck Put Put Puttity chuck Put Put Puttity chuck The crowd turned and looked You hear the word chuck Who is coming Otis Otis Good Let s see what happens The sound became louder Put put puttity chuck Put put puttity chuck Let s all make Otis sound Put put puttity chuck Put put put chuck Put put puttity chuck All at once Otis put puffed from around the barn He turned and he headed straight for Mud Pond Otis put puffed down the rolling hill and pulled right up next to the muddy waters edge The calf heard her friend s puttering purr and bawled It was almost like Hello She s crying out to Otis Yeah She bawled To the sound of his gentle chuck and to the amazement of all the people in the crowd Otis slowly began to circle the pond He circled and he circled and the little calf turned and turned never taking her eye off her friend It looks like they might be solving their problem With each ring Otis made around Mud Pond the muddy grip loosened until the calf was able to stumble out of the pond on her own The two friends had found each other again It looks like we found a solution to our problem Talk to your partner about how they found a solution How did they solve their problem I heard a lot of good discussion How did they solve their problem You guys I heard everybody talking about it So Jabrielle how did they solve their problem What was the solution Who came and got her out of the mud I heard you tell Isaiah Otis Otis Ramaya how did Otis get her out of the mud just like Jabrielle said He rided around the mud Oh I don t know if you can hear Ramaya She said Otis rode around Mud Pond and got the calf out of the mud Help me write that Otis rode around Mud Pond It was called Mud Pond Otis rode around Mud Pond And he got the calf out of the mud That s the solution Now how is everybody feeling What effect is this having How do they feel now that they have their problem solved Nijyah Excited Excited Miami Happy Sherod Glad Glad Edward Yeah They re feeling great They re reunited Their family is back together Zion How do you feel when you solve your problem They are a little exhausted aren t they That was a lot of work Ismail They re feeling okay They re feeling relieved Relieved Wow Great job Let s see how the story ends Readers you are really doing a great job paying attention to the problem and the solution of the story It s really helping us comprehend the story better We re understanding it really well Otis led the calf right down the dusty road toward the village and everyone threw flowers as they went following them into town It looked like a happy parade No one needed a fancy No one needed a fancy blue ribbon to tell them that the calf was a special calf Otis was a special tractor And the two of them were special friends From that day on the farmer discovered that with Otis puttering purr beside the chicken coop his chickens laid more eggs At milking time with Otis gentle chuck nearby his cow produced more milk And on occasion Otis even got to join the farmer and the big yellow tractor out in the fields But often at the end of the day Otis would just sit with his friend under the apple tree and watch the farmer he loved 
 Scientist number two I want to know what your question is what is your variable that you re isolating and what are you measuring You guys ready Okay so table two Or table one Our central question is how does different types of oil stains clothes even after they ve been rinsed And our independent variable is going through the different oils that we used and the dependent variable is how they changed from before when we first stained them to after when we rinsed them Cool and you may be able to use the light probe to determine the intensity of that stain Tomorrow We also were planning on taking pictures from before and after so we could like compare those So you may want to do a scale like Marley did with the intensity of her hair dye as well okay But get it set up today make it really controlled with all your measurements and just change the type of oil Alright scientists do you have any Our experiment is we re going to mix oil and water and then try and separate the oil using positive and negative charges Okay using positively and negatively charged particles to separate oil from water I don t know I read your document I don t know what the positively charged particles you are but did you work it out Okay so what s your question then Our question is does charged particles affect the oil scum Okay does charged particles affect the shape of oil balls them coming together scum balls Okay good Table three what s your question Um how long does it take to make scum on the surface of the water like using what we re going to use mainly olive oil and toilet paper Okay Perfect And testing the independent variable is testing how long we re going to stir How long it takes to make scum and then our dependent variable we re going to take the observations of time Okay so the question is how long does it take to form scum balls Independent variable is the stir time and the dependent variable is the How long it takes How long it takes to do it Uh huh What are you going to measure though We re going to actually try to measure the surface area of the Cool so you re going to say how much is covered by scum at that point in time Okay that should be pretty easy to do with a camera shot Okay table four what s your question How does temperature affect the oil and water How does temperature affect the oil and water Awesome And we re trying to figure out how it will separate How can you separate it What are you changing in the experiment We re changing we re going to use regular temperature and put it on a Bunsen burner and put it in the freezer Cool and you re more than welcome to use the freezer in the back Good idea Alright table five what s your question Does heat affect the scum ball Does heat affect the scum ball And our independent s going to be amount of scum and the amount of water and the dependent s going to be heat Okay so your independent now you said heat and then you said the amount of water in whatever so your independent is really going to be temperature So I feel like you have two independent variables Why don t you just spend a minute and talking about which one you want to isolate Is it the amount of water and the amount of scum Or is it temperature Okay We were going to change the temperature Then keep the amount of water and the scum constant Because you can t do different amounts of water and scum and different temperatures It means you re testing for two different things While you could do that it s two experiments and we don t have time today So just one experiment Alright table six So our central question is is it possible to create scum balls in different shapes Okay And our independent variable was the amount of oil And the dependent was the shape Okay so is it possible to make scum balls of different shapes Independent variable is the amount of oil or scum dependent variable is the shapes While I m over here I just want to draw your attention to the back of the room That is the waste beaker which has scum on top of it right now It s every kind of oil that Copper used yesterday So if you want pre made scum I encourage you to use Copper s waste from yesterday So the bottom portion of it is a lot of soap and soap water But the top portion of it is just that less dense oily scum okay Alright table seven what s your question It s can we filter out oil from the water using the gravel filter Okay So we re trying two different types of oil and we re going to put it through a bunch of gravel in the container Okay and you may need to use two of the same identical filters so just make sure you re really consistent with your measurements between those two filters Good Alright I m excited about their project because Copper had one group that did a filter yesterday and their results were very interesting So check back in with this group later on if you want to see what s going on with the filters And table eight what s your central question Does oil collect some of the things in the surrounding body of water Does oil collect the most what Does oil collect the most of each thing Oh the most of each thing in the surrounding body of water Okay so you re going to look and see what it attracts And what are some of the materials you re going to use Dirt sand and pebbles Dirt sand and pebbles awesome So your independent variable is type of material that it would possibly attract How are you going to measure those results Mass Mass Okay cool You may want to work on a microscope slide just so you can have a little bit of an easier time measuring the mass If you get too big it won t measure on our balances Which brings me to my next topic which is safety talk Conservation of materials Did you guys get a lecture yet No because Sam is too busy with her Why don t you go over there and see what they re doing Go talk to her Thank you Alright lady scientists What s going on We re like I thought that we didn t need to do the middle one because yesterday we didn t have enough time so we just did the small amount and then the larger Amount Okay Now that we did the middle speed we re actually seeing a lot different stuff because the balls are actually coming together That underneath and we noticed also under here that everything settled to the bottom except the dirt and oil that reached to the top Okay And this is thicker than that one Okay let me get another group over here because they re also trying to form a scum ball and I d like them to see your results Terrence and Catherine and Maddy can you guys pause and come and check out this group s experiment I don t see scum It makes me mad Ooh this is so cool Why does it look like that I want it to look like that Come on over These guys are also doing an experiment on scum balls Can you guys talk about what s your independent variable What are you changing We re just changing the different speeds Okay and Yasmine what were some of the things you added that were controlled within all three The dirt oil and the water Okay and they used the black potting soil dirt Is it the peat moss In the plastic bag That s peat moss Okay good And Taylor it looks like you have some cloudy stuff in the bottom what s that Don t know Can you guys fill her in Toilet paper Toilet paper which makes sense because there s a lot of toilet paper over there Okay and so far your results have been they ve just done the high speed and the low speed right And they re like oh it s the same nothing happened nothing happened right They came back today and this is the medium speed and what s going on A lot of dirt balls are actually coming down and forming together Because they were all little pieces of dirt and now they re making big globs of dirt And that s weird So does time sitting overnight have anything to do with it That s what we talked about with these two Actually this one because and this one too because we didn t see a lot of carbon bubbles in the first one And then this one I just noticed that it s actually the toilet paper is on the bottom and actually attached to the bottom layer of the oil Okay are the highs and the lows working the speeds yet Have you tried to re run the highs and the lows today No Re run the highs and lows you have a good seven six minutes See if they start to form clump balls Not sure if you can use this one Can I go get a funnel Sure There s one on the table I am not sure if your choice of particles simply is inhibiting the formation of the scum balls or not If you want to add another part to your experiment to make it more controlled maybe you could add some toilet paper and see if that adds anything or you could leave it how it is It s your choice Got about seven minutes okay Thank you Yes cool Hey you guys have some diesel fuel on your table Any information research observations that could be made about the shapes of the molecules would be awesome The three of you all together Alright so We got 97 no 47 94 for all of them Okay let me put the camera on you four Ready Let s talk about it Is that okay Okay so you isolated your variable different types of oil You made everything the same same size same amount of water same amount of soap time soaking everything was super controlled right Okay and then you just did a light prep on all of them and the look was the same across the board Yeah it was 47 94 like it jumped between them two numbers constantly None of them like Consistent so it was consistent Alright so any initial conclusions Yes I said that since all the things were like a darker color and the oils were kind of close I guess in like how they felt and what color they were I guess that maybe if we used a white shirt maybe there would ve been a difference because it would ve soiled it more Do you feel like there is still oil in this fabric Yes Yes okay alright Let me hear your conclusions and then I m going to This one that had water on it is different looking than this one like the material looks more like Like dry or something right So there s some qualitative difference I know that this one needs to be flipped over Because then it s the same side of the fabric Okay so water That one s whiter Lighter okay so you feel like these are a little bit darker looking And your control This one is darker Your control was the same as all of them The 47 94 Okay And you Any conclusions yet Um I don t know I kind of think the sand thing is sand because I know the one we put on the paper like it went all the way down to 40 something so maybe the fabric was too dark to the point where it was Okay and Lauren what was your central question My central question The central question of your experiment Oh it was to see after we washed it how much of it was still there How much of it was still there Okay or if it would affect the fabrics differently Okay but your light probe is saying no they re all the same so maybe your eyes are off or maybe the probe is a little bit off or whatever Should I take that as data I think you should take it as data yeah And it s okay you addressed your question which was how does oil affect it different among shirts In your case with the soap maybe not at all differently I d like you to try one more thing involving paper towels And what you re going to do is you re going to see you re going to press down as hard as you can with a paper towel and see if there s any oil that s absorbed on the paper towels okay So that can be one other way to take data To see if there s still any oil still stuck in the shirts Okay Okay Goggles on Goggles on Goggles on What s the highest temperature we could put it at Are you guys boiling You can put it all the way up you just have to be really cautious Get your Hot Hands out the big glove Alright Heather s group I m coming over to you guys Ready Okay what s going on over here We put 10 millileters of motor oil in 150 mls of water and we added five grams of salt Okay ooh Salt when I was a waitress we used to put salt on our oil stains to get the oil out Maybe you could put a second Wait that s kind of like clay I was going to say flour because that s what we do if I spill What do you notice It s starting to kind of clump When we had the clay it was really really clumpy but then it It the uh Yeah like the clay just clumped And then we had to get before and that didn t really make a difference it just sat at the bottom My hands are sticky Oh thank you While you re here do you remember the charge of the particles of clay Positive or negative Negative Okay so negatively charged particles and now you ve added sodium chloride which dissolves in water You ve got an A plus positive CL minus negative And you re clearly getting a scum ball No What happens when you turn it off It just all settles at the top When we put clay in there for the first time it was all little clay balls that slowly rose to the top But nothing of the magnitude So that motion really helps it to stay together Yeah that s what we did We put it at 500 RPMs first and then we dialed it back down to 100 Let s apply this to the water treatment plant Was there motion at the water treatment plant Yes Was there clay in the water Probably From where From the sediment on the bottom of the Schuylkill From the sediment on the river Now remember the stuff that s going in the water treatment plant is coming directly from the home so it hasn t had a chance to go in the Schuylkill River yet Okay Would there be any clay in the homes Not in the homes no Not in the homes Not in anything flushed down the toilet Yeah So yeah there could be some like clay like sediment sand particles going through Or at the very least we could say that there s probably some negatively charged particles going through some kind of silicates Shall we throw away the fabric Sure Who knows what s in feces right Alright so what I think is cool about your experiment is the motion is really important in getting those scum balls to form Have you talked about CeCe s experiment yet No Go ahead and give that a whirl because they actually put peat moss in theirs and they started to get scum balls to form on medium speed Also Matt Ian s sorry Catherine s station is using sand specifically and I forget what the other material is It looks like peat moss and they re having no success So go ahead and do a little quick walk around And clean up Motion Can you let them give them a 10 second overview Yeah And then go Taylor pull it together you ll be okay You re good Okay Did you get any scum No we didn t we just got into lumps The fastest way we got a layer and then everything the soil settled on the bottom And then for the middle speed it actually formed big clumps of balls with the oil mixed in Clean up clean up 
 You re going to test and be coming up here for materials Okay go You just follow the lines If no if the lines if red lines are drawn on a white piece of paper the termites will follow the lines We should draw like a bunch of different circles and different colors and see which one they follow And we ll make it like this Well it s not going to be on a circle It can be like this and see if they ll follow that circle Yeah Would that be a good may I bother you with this I m just covering them up What are you saying Yeah well beside this one If termites we ll place on a red piece on a white piece of paper with a red circle and red lines then the termites will follow the lines in the circle Okay so you re going to use the color red line again What color paper would you use White White paper Yeah And I think since we ve already used colored paper I think that s a result of that Well again you could do yours and yours and tie them together Use different colored papers so what s the point of your test That depending on the colored paper we ll determine what the termites sight can do I would think it s the color of the line because that s what they re following So you think they re following the color of the line Yes Yeah but when they went to the end of the white paper they went to the black and they came right back Well no that s because they knew what it was that s because I like kept hitting them back Okay so you re kind of going along with the idea of color How could you prove that color was That color effects their You draw a bunch of different circles draw a bunch of circles about the exact same size but of different colors and see which one they go to I like that Nice okay On a white piece of paper Yeah Again I ve got colored paper The more tests you do the more accurate your results would be All right so let s do the same test but on two different types of paper So if termites are placed on a white piece of paper Put that on top of it just so we block some of the light out No that down Good and there you go So what were we thinking about testing Um putting tables in line using different color And to see if we re not going to finish the circle and see if they follow it around Oh very nice Yeah because we drew a line leading back to the thing and they followed it down They followed it down Tricky okay They went it s true So they didn t follow this part Yeah because it curves No because they We drew the circle They go like then they curve and go down And they came here and went back up They all followed Hmm interesting Thank you four You ve got about two more about a minute and a half actually What are we thinking I m going to go ahead and cover these up We were planning on doing um like we think they re attracted to the ink and I m going to test it with like a marker a pen and a crayon Okay To see if like if they follow the ink better than the other ones Nice would you use the same color of ink Yeah because it would be the control There you go very nice Um what color paper are you going to use Should we use regular White I would say white yeah All right good Okay sounds good Where are your termites Stop playing with them and we re going to actually cover them to kind of get the light out What were you guys thinking about testing Mainly if they are going to follow the red line then they must be attracted to red They must be attracted to what Red Red Okay so how could you test that they are just attracted to red We re going to make two large circles Two large circles And some other lines And some other lines But what are you testing again If they go to the red line then they must be attracted to red Okay so you re talking about the color red Um would you use so you tell me what you re going to set up I m trying to follow Probably just a black one and a red one Lines or circles Circles Circles Okay all right Yeah basically just for fun Okay okay just for fun all right Um you should be collecting materials If pens and things aren t working let me know Dude get the line What happened to your situations Well we put tape over this and now it doesn t follow it over here I think they like the color red None of them are following any of these lines How could you continue to test that they like the color red Put more red over here I mean we also put the tape there and it doesn t like the tape It gets confused And we have the red paper and it didn t follow the black lines Or the pencil Yeah that s what I mean None of them here are even doing anything They get tired and just start standing there twitching Do you need some new ones No there are still pretty lively Yeah So what are some of the conclusions that you re thinking Oh Terrance be sweet Ah be sweet Ah white on red They only like that Also they only follow that type of pen They don t follow any other type of pen or pencil Um they don t necessarily have an affiliation to red Okay how do you know that Cause they walked off the red paper Okay they walked off the red paper So you threw that one out How could you continue to say that they like that particular pen and not having to do red We tried black pen We haven t tried another color on white yet See look it stopped at the tape It s confused at the tape No Neal what I asked you is that a pen or a marker It s a pen It s a pen Oh he s following the other We drew it on the other side We drew a circle on the other side It looked like he was following it Is it something inside of them No Like what the ink s made out of How could you test that Using the red pen on this Okay Taking two different pens Go grab some more That s a good idea Red color pen red color pencil You killed the ant Gentlemen be nice to your termites Oh oh wait wait Here Neal let s get All right group here s a red pen colored pencil Oh look That one s alive Okay now then so what are you saying is going on They re still following the red one Yeah they re still following the red pen So it s not necessarily an affiliation to the color red So it is something inside the ink So how can you test if it s something inside the ink I just got the other colored pencil Take another red pen Go grab some It s right there That s a pencil It s the color red look Stick with the no you just threw out the idea that it s red Stick with the color stick with the pen idea We need a pen like this No I think we have the exact same pen No no the blue one like this They have a blue one like that Go see there s blue pens up there Hey can we borrow a red pen I meant blue you know what I meant Bam it s a different type of pen It s all right Different type of pen but it s blue now Did you get a blue one No I just got red ones I got bundles Nice Now they re going to follow it Now I thought we were going to get away from the red idea and go with the pen I think it s that pen I ve got the same pen They re still the red I think they are Okay try that one There s a hole there by the way If you press through it it will break Go Are you going to make it intercept the line Yeah I m going to Oh look he s following the little one Maybe it likes circles Wait wait I still think it s something inside the ink Draw a square See if it follows a square So that would be able you would be able to throw out your idea that it likes circles if you drew the square So draw a square see what happens Yeah draw a square I ve got another black pen I have all these pens Why not draw the square inside of there Inscribe the square in the circle Terms terminology You re a professor now Oh it s following it It is the pen Curves are easier It didn t know where the line was Okay five four Um we drew different lines in the different types of pens markers colored pencils Did you do it all on the same page or on different pages On different colored pages Why would you do it on different colored pages Ah to make sure the tests varied Okay did you use the same color of ink on each page Describe to me your experiment web The whole group can chime in too Um like we drew like a black circle on a black sheet of paper Okay To see if they could only like Please don t be rude Black circle on a black sheet of paper Keep going what else And that didn t work They could not see it or follow it or anything so we decided to go with an experiment that Christian came up with that take a white piece of paper and we drew like every kind of color their was all at once and they seemed to only the follow the blue or red circles None of the other colors What were the blue and the red circles drawn with I believe different types of stuff Mainly pen though And this was all on one sheet of paper Well we tried it on different sheets too Okay That s what started us off Okay Um did you have it all on one sheet at first Yeah Okay what did you realize was wrong with that They were pretty much getting confused As in we re going to have issues with what Maintaining A control A control good Only one independent variable nice Um Nick s group how did you go through the indentation We drew several circles using each of the utensils and then I think we placed the termites in the middle and they all sort of if they weren t in the middle sort of eating off of the wood or like just exploring around they were following the pen Okay um your indentation line did you draw that with just pens different types of pens did you draw it with markers did you draw it with a paper clip We just used the same color but we used different things Like we used pens Vis A Vis colored pencils stuff like that Okay and what was your conclusion with that They followed the pen because we thought it was the one that had the most distinct indentation Because they came the termites into that line because we saw them go up to the edge and because they would feel there is a drop and I figured oh well they must be blind because they can t see that there s a drop there Interesting point Why might you have used a paper clip as well to create the indentation instead of a pen Because it wouldn t have shown a color but it would have still left the same indentation as a pen Okay so any components within that pen color chemicals type of pen whatever if you would have used the paper clip and then followed that indentation you would have been able to do what Pen verses paper clip Pen would have looked I think it would have looked The paper clip would have looked deeper but the thing is like would it prove if you had it or not Had what or not If they followed the dent or not Not just like the color or the like smell or whatever Very good very good So by using the paper clip to create the indentation they would have been able to rule out any type of color from the pen that left the indent maybe the scent from the pen the chemical from the pen that left the indent By doing the paper clip just by itself we would have been able to say okay that obviously doesn t leave any chemicals it doesn t leave any color and if they re following that indentation we know that that s what they are drawn too Okay Carly your group had an interesting set up Um we well we kind of did two All right But the first one we have like a black piece of paper and we bordered it with like white pieces of paper and we drew a white circle in the black piece of paper to see if they would go away from the white to go to the darker paper And that didn t really work so we did the other one and um with like the different colors of circles on a white piece of paper and they only went on the red pen one Okay what could have been a variable in your experiment that you just described As in something that might have thrown off the results Paper I don t know Well notice in one of the experiments you used a what to create the circle The pen Okay you used a pen and in the other experiment you used a what Paper But you used a Oh white yeah you used a white colored pencil So by using a colored pen and then a white colored pencil what are those two things now Added on what Variables Added on variables Okay for one you re using pen and pencil another you re using colors So how could you have made your experiment a little bit more definite that would of maybe ruled out some of the other variables Gentlemen calm down We could have used colored pencils the whole time Okay could have used the same color colored pencil the whole time Good Um what group haven t I talked to Matthew explain to us the set up of your group Do you want to start I don t know what to say Oh okay then we started off thinking that they followed the color and so we drew with a different type of pen and it did not follow it so we decided maybe it s not color So we took a black pen a big one Um we took a black pen and then two red pens of different type and two blue pens of different type and they only followed the specific type of pen red and blue It was the BIC pens so we decided there must be something in that in the chemical structure of that ink that s you know similar to some sort of pheromone of some sort Um and the termites followed it Okay um did you think of the pheromone thing yesterday Yeah After school That was extracurricular All right so But we figured out the BIC pens We figured that out Okay good Excellent set up there Were there any variables that when I was over there earlier you had different shapes with the different pens You got this Yeah we were drawing with different shapes cause it followed the circle and then we were trying to get them back inside the thing So we drew a line pointing down there so they would follow it And they did follow it but then we realized it might not be the shape it might be in the pen or the color They don t really like sharp angles though We drew a square and they got lost Yeah They couldn t find the angle Okay interesting So um if any of you did do any sort of research you were able to find that the pheromone that termites emit and we learned that those were what Pheromones Enzymes Enzymes not enzymes What are pheromones having to do with We just spent three days on it Animal behavior Animal behavior communication their chemical signals Okay so we learned that termites emit these pheromones We might have encountered this last time and that s the same thing why ants follow a specific trail Um when honeybees sense danger they emit a warning pheromone that tells everybody in the hive to freak out that danger s coming But the pheromone that termite s emit to have them follow each other in the hole trails and all of that the chemical in that mimics or the chemical in the pen in Bic and PaperMate pens actually mimics the chemical in the pheromones which is why they followed certain pens 
 I m not gonna have no peace with that If you feel something I don t know something like done bothered me that done made me like brought me down to the point where I was crying about it The first thing he say I ain t gonna tell nobody but I feel where you coming from He tell me it shouldn t get to that point where you mad over something that doesn t matter If it s good or not that seriously don t matter That s in the past the past ain t gonna do nothing The past can t hurt you Okay Alright That s what I d tell him So really this kind of conversation should ve been held with what kind of friend A pretty good friend A pretty good friend or maybe even your best friend Nope Not your best friend Oh yes my best friend You already know who I m talking about He s my best friend Now he one of them people that he done did some stuff to me that made me mad I ask him Man why you doing this I thought you was different from everybody else But not once have I actually went out there and played the cards while I m at home How I m not gonna tell nobody and then come two days later everybody and their momma walking up to him and asking him questions Uh why you did this to her So let me ask you this So your saying you ve had conversations with your best friend before and then he s divulged information that you ve said to him No from time to time he might get mad and he ll say something then we have to have that one on one talk OK this was between me and you I don t want to hear this coming out nobody else s mouth Cause then I know point blank that you done said something Let me ask you this if you would have that conversation with someone is he truly your best friend Is that a conversation that Jay chime in any time If you got to keep reminding him that hey man if you tell somebody something and you gotta be worried about whether their gonna tell it to someone else Honestly are they really your best friend No Like I said before that s another acquaintance because you can t trust him like that man He telling you he ain t gonna tell nobody but he going back on his word He going to get a friend to turn on you in a heartbeat that s why I said it s about you Johnny No Between what you say I don t blame Johnny If he s truly your best friend He won t tell nobody He won t tell anybody But then you got like it s a boundary between stuff you tell You can tell your best best friend something deep but it s a certain boundary between that which you wouldn t tell him certain stuff I tell my best friend almost everything but certain stuff he don t need to know Right cause certain things we My business don t need to be his He have one of those days when he feeling down then I come over there Blah blah blah don t say nothing to me Then he flips out on me and he wanna tell something that s so deep to me that I m sitting there looking like did he really just say this Cause your shocked You re in shock and You don t never expect well anybody wouldn t expect their best friend to spill the beans or say something that s not meant to be told Me I would never expect Chris to say anything I tell him So far he has been a best friend He don t tell nothing I say I don t want to have to tell what he tells me because we got that best friend relationship Cause a best friend should be loyal all the way to the end Not when it s necessary or needed That s right Not when it s necessary but at all times right Yes ma am Okay Alright Let me go to the next scenario You decide you would like to take in a movie but you choose not to go alone You finally reach someone by phone who is just as bored as you and is dying to be in the company of someone pleasant You both enjoy yourselves so much you plan to do this again Where is that person at on the grading scale I d say that s a group thing because they interested in the same thing that you re interested in Group friend Okay Alright group friend Group friend Someone that you know through association Now in this scenario it s just you and that person And it could be someone that you met through the group Or it could be It s not necessarily your best friend You just started hanging out out of the blue You met them and when your friends not around y all started to talk a little and get to know more about each other then I d say that s a pretty good friend Pretty good friend I could say a pretty good friend cause I would hang out with a pretty good friend A pretty good friend you can take on the outside of school and you can go do activities that both of y all enjoy Yeah because a group friend is normally someone you hang out with in a group Kind of like we re together Because once again you know that person through association of someone else But a good friend is someone that you actually can call up and say Okay you want to go out Yeah You wanna go out Let s go It s nothing between you guys If its a girl you understand that she just want to see the movie and I want to see the movie We laugh we joke we go out eat pizza together but it s nothing else there We ain t trying to be boyfriend girlfriend You can t try to make it more then what it is Right Then if it s just a friend one of your dudes that you hang out with y all like the same movie Like I You know You can t call me cause we re not on the same level I m your teacher at all times Even though you know I like the same type movies you like and we always discuss the same type of movie we re not going to go to the movies together Cause you on the adult level we on the young people level Right and we re different types of Our friendship scale is different Is not even up here it s Right Okay Now Someone approaches you about going to see an exhibit at the museum You were glad to hear it because it just happens to be an exhibit that you wanted to see anyway So your parents tell you both that you can go and you can The exhibit is in a different city Your parents tell you both that you can go and you can spend the night over out of town What kind of friend is that Is that just an acquaintance That would probably be with like with my best friend I wouldn t go out of town with somebody that s not by best friend I ain t going to go out of town I got to go with somebody that I know is going to speak to me You know what I m saying mm hmm Got to be somebody I can trust I don t have to many friends I can trust I don t know why but all my friends is just the reason why I don t get too close to them I can t exactly tell you why I just don t Because I can t trust everybody Okay Alright Because you ll never know who will be your best friend today and they might turn on you tomorrow so you ll never know Okay So that s why this is a good piece to do Because we got to figure out who is just an acquaintance who is someone we that we will just see on the hall hi how you doing bye Got to figure out who is the acquaintance and then we got to figure out who is the group friend who is a good friend who is the best friend Because there s somewhere There s a fine line like you guys said there s a fine line between all five of them but you got to know the line You got to know where the line is drawn You got to know the conversations to have with all of them because there are certain conversations that you would have with that best friend That you want to tell somebody that you just met in the hall Right Right Cause there like you just telling me your whole business but you don t really know my name or nothing about me That s something The stuff you telling me I wouldn t tell you I would tell it to my best friend but as far as what s going on in my house I ll probably let you know I got sisters and brothers the basic stuff but not oh my momma s strung out or doing this and that Cause everybody s business is not your business Your business is not are you That s right We always got to keep that in mind because so many times I ll get calls from parents and they ll say So and so Just talking too much Especially when people are getting into a lot of issues or getting into confusion at school or what have you And a lot of that comes from the fact that they don t know when to be quiet or they don t know what to say or how to say it or who to approach Because if someone says to you stand up for a minute In the morning when you first come in and the first thing I say to you is what Good morning Good morning Good morning Vincent How you doing Good morning Ms Jenson How was your weekend I went to my cousin house I got to spend time with my Godmother and I went grocery shopping Okay so that Now you told me I didn t say what did you do Oh I said how was your weekend It was good It was good And that s basics of that conversation It should not be oh guess what My momma My momma and her boyfriend was fighting and they threw the cat out the window and then the police came over Because at that moment you have just did what Stepped out of bounds You ve stepped out of bounds You ve divulged way Too much Too much You done opened the book before it could be read Or you done read the book before it could be bought Because really I didn t buy into all of that I didn t want all of that You just wanted to know your name and how was your weekend I just wanted the generalities of it was a good weekend And then there are times that we could probably get a little deeper But you not asking for that You just asking for the simple That s right That s right Jeremy I m going to ask you Stand up for a minute Jay cause you re a pretty secretive guy Mmhm So normally we got to pull stuff out of you Cause I said to you earlier I said Your Dad called And what was that about I was stuck on the river And he said I was stuck on the river My first thought was Jeremy got a boat So I said You got a boat That s what I said right Yeah I was over there at the Wafflehouse over there by Brian Gates behind over there at the apartments I went to see someone And so he went to see someone but again sometimes you got to know when to hold your conversation and when to divulge it and when to divulge it Because even though he went to see someone he didn t give me no elaborate details yeah this honey she was Because a lot of times You don t need that I don t need that You just wanted to know where I was at Just wanted to know where you was at I want to make sure you was okay Make sure that your Dad got in touch with someone to be able to say Jeremy s okay Okay Alright Alright Yeah You can have a seat That was a good conversation Huh This was a good conversation This was a good conversation You thought this was a good lesson Today was a good day It was a good day Because some people don t know their boundaries of talking and telling it all Some people just give up too much information Some people around here got to even say what did to you and everything From here we re going actually the next thing we re going to discuss is conversations That s where we re going to go from here I wanted us to because the other day we kind of looked at friendship but I wanted to go a little deeper because I know I want us to realize that friendships they should be reciprocal Not always And when I say reciprocal everybody understands what I m saying The same No Should be the same like how I feel about you you should feel that same way about me I feel like you trustworthy but you feel like I m going to tell on you any chance I get Right Exactly But they re not always reciprocal but keep in mind that friendships are always changing Because who you put down on your friendship scale on Thursday It change It changed You gave me a whole different not a whole different set but you gave me some different people and you actually moved some people Where you had Yolanda as a good friend she became just a group friend four days later Okay and you had valid reasons and keep in mind that things do change Just because someone was a best friend last week Don t mean they going to stay your best friend They re not Nine times out of 10 I promise you guys When I was in high school I could there were three there was four of us and I considered them my very best friends Now I don t know how deep they would ve had my back but I considered them my good friends We talked on the phone we shared secrets we shared stuff you know when we was sneaking and doing stuff We shared those things but today I really can t tell you where they re at Now there was some friends that I met in college that we re still friends to this day They re friends that I ve had since I came into teaching that I don t know where those people are Because I ve been teaching when you think of teaching for 18 years people have friends people have come and gone in the teaching profession but I haven t kept in touch with all of them because there has to be a there has to be something in common that s going to keep you friends It can t just be I see if I see them just at school and that s all we ever talk about is school and schoolwork and complain and fussing and about lesson plans and stuff then nine times out of 10 those are just my associates Those are just acquaintances people that I pass in the hall We laugh we joke but we don t share any intimate conversation Okay I m glad this was a good exercise for you guys and next time we re going to look into conversations The type of conversations you have with each one of those type people 
 How old are you Five years old Five years old Blake is this a bear Yes Yes Is this a bear Yeah Yes Is this a bear No No very nice Is this a fire truck No No Is this a penguin Yes Yes What s your name Blake Walker Blake Walker Give me eyes Awesome Where s your eyes Where s Blake s eyes Here s the eyes Eyes Good job Eyes Where s eyes Eyes Very good Eyes Where s Blake s eyes That s the eyes Eyes very good How old are you Five years old Five years old Do you want the elephant No You want the ball No You want the book No Want the fire truck Yes Vroom Vroom Oh my turn fire truck Excuse me I train please I play train please I play train I play train please Train My turn train Thank you I play train Choo choo Choo choo I play with train please Train Choo choo My turn train Thank you I play train please I play train please I play train please Train My turn I play train please Blake I play train All mine I play please I play I play train I play train please Train He s traveling with the whole thing He is at least waiting until he gets closer before he starts Uh huh He s not repeating My turn I fire truck I play with fire truck please I play fire I fire I play with fire truck please Fire truck My turn I fifth please I fifth please I play the please Fish Fish please Fish Uh oh Fish broken Bye bye fish Let me see Now see Alright See I knew they worked All done fish Bye fish Right bye fish All done fish I fish please I play I play Fish Please Fish Fish All done fish All done fish Bye fish I play I play fish please Yellow fish Orange fish All done fish Done fish Bye bye fish I play I play with fish I play with fish I play fish please Fish Can you count fish one two three four Fish all done Bye fish I play fish 
 At first we put only tap water in it and then we all of a sudden changed it So but there s still tap water in with the oily water So you think that s why the control got messed up because it had too much Well that s not variables changed my only reason What s the other reason My other hypothesis for the control cup not growing was like the seeds were duds Were your guys s the oil ones That one s not yours No Ours is the one that s all grown Oh why don t you go get your cup and show people So this is oil Okay well the oil one did grow really fast and all of a sudden it died it looks like Kind of So like at first it was normal with that thing and then well I don t understand that chart Yeah me neither because it looks like It looks like it didn t grow then it grew really really fast then it went down Super What happened was it grew and then it over polluted and then it just died Looks like that Well like Well like what I don t get is I see the other oil one it seems like the oil one is growing bigger than the other ones It just like suddenly grew all of a sudden All the oil is the same with the control which you have all of a sudden all of a sudden also these diagrams Also in the control diagram that went back down to zero centimeters I don t know Yeah this chart might have messed up Because that means both these plants die And then the control regrew Yeah it doesn t make any sense It doesn t It turned white and then it died and turned brown because on my chart it grew point it grew it grew 0 14 and then 0 14 again and then 0 04 so like alive dead alive and stuff When it grew the second time did it grow or did it subtract The second time I think it died and then the last time it just kept on growing but the first time it started growing it grew second time it grew one centimeter What did you put in to help it grow What did you put in it to help it grow Oily water So did the oil or the manipulator control grow more The manipulative one grew more because it grew and then it died So why do you think it did that Because like I what I thought is that it was too much oil on it and then oil gets on the leaf it like it helps the plant grow or something Just killing other Doesn t the plant feed off the leaves So the oil got spread on the leaves and then it s feeding the oil then it died Look at yours compared to mine because yours is way more controlled ones than ours does because the only one we had was the experiment plant Do you I think the reason why the vinegar or the acid rain made it grow because like acid is good for you and it s mixed with water so it s not too bad for the plant But I think it got way too much acid and acid actually eats things It kills it and that s why I think the plant is all dead because like you said Nolan it did grow because acid is good for us but yet when we have too much it dies So that s why I think this plant is all shriveled over I agree with you because acid is part water and that s what rain is but there s a little bit of acid so water s good for you But acid it doesn t grow it s not good for you so Well actually it is good for you but not a lot I think you re Maybe just a little bit of water in it more than acid rain and then when we kept spraying the acid rain on maybe it got too much acid rain And then the acid rain overtook the water and died So it like decreased by a lot That s why I think it s just like the Red Bull because Red Bull is like gives you really much energy and then you just crash without any energy See right there Just like Red Bull It increases and then decreases What d you think Misha Well yeah I think like what you said Nolan because the regular plant grew just fine and then that the experiment grew like good and better than the regular one but then it like the acid overtook the plant just like Nolan said What else I noticed about my control plant it started big at first and then it decreased in size Then it got bigger so it s going off and on in size So it actually did kind of better than this because at the end it did better than that one and the last opposite It like died after the second one it only stayed for a couple of days or a couple weeks Yeah but it was only to a point it was living because when I did my second observation it was still kind of full but it was broken on the side So it started falling into a point where it fell in and got buried in the oily water basically It died My actual skin and everything the plant grows faster but it also dies faster and I figured from like the oils on my hand Why do you think it did that Because the oil on your hand Because the oil on your hand may not be the exact same thing as like oils in a car but oil still has the same base But how does it make the plant grow faster if you touch it with your hand I don t know Instead of wearing gloves maybe it s just the stuff inside of the oils and everything but it grew faster and also died faster Like the plant that we have now is dying faster but this one since it has water normally and everything it s healthy and stayed big the whole time But the other one is like that but it died If you have what you were saying earlier when you have oil on your hand and then it was you polluted it with oil don t you think you polluted that one too No well like it s my whole point is that it speeded up the process What speeded up the process Like the oil when I plant a bean or something when I plant bulbs for tulips or something and I touch it with my hands instead of my gloves Then it actually seems I may just be paranoid but it grows faster and then my mom put hers with gloves and it didn t grow as fast I don t know the depth of that part or something I don t get what you re saying Are you saying that you have a magic touch and you just make plants grow faster No I think it s just the oils of your skin So what would the oils in your skin do for a plant Like the oil for your plant here Is it the same like the oil that we used Like it didn t make them healthy but it just made it grow faster because this one took a little bit longer to get bigger but the other one Show me your data that suports that This Yeah What s your data that supports that The These ones Yeah the one the data that supported it was that oops is is it went with the control It already had grown and it was after a week and ours still hasn t grown And it was growing at 0 16 centimeters per day and then the next time it was growing 2 7 centimeters a day So what does that tell you That it was growing a lot faster but it wasn t necessarily growing as efficiently Okay What do you mean by inefficient Efficient What do you mean by efficient I mean like it grew faster but it wasn t necessarily healthy for the plant for it to grow so fast So was there other evidence that you would use that would prove that it wasn t healthy Yeah because the leaves now they re all gross and blotchy and they re dying and they re crunchy and not as soft and smooth as these And they have a shine to them because of the oil What did the rate of growth confirm that At first it was kind of spiked for a little bit and then it started going back down and now it s dying a lot faster than the natural plant because these plants it grows in a steady period of time With that it grew really fast and now it s dying really fast So what conclusion did you get That oil still makes the plant grow but it s not necessarily healthy for it Do you agree Yeah because me and Because my group my experiment when we did this it was growing super fast and now it s like dying and stuff And we think that the oil has a chemical in it that speeds up the process of the plant growing but then it speeds up and of slows down the process of the plant dying because On the grass a little bit and the number of leaves will only be like two and then it shrivels up and died And then the color would stay light green and kind of brown like how it is right now and then my data was according to my graph the acid rain plant grew more than I thought It grew 25 centimeters but it started to die because of It turns light brown and started to die The leaves increased from two all the way to six leaves by the end Okay My question was what would the effect be if I changed the water to salt water and I put if I change the water to salt I predict that the plant will stay the same height as the control plant I predict a number of leaves will stay the same as the control plant I predict the color will be white ish gray ish My manipulator variable is water to salt water According to my data I was correct because the height was the same and the number of leaves were the same The data shows the height of both plants were zero centimeters and the number of leaves was zero on both plants The rate of the growth was zero On the salt water there was crust on it and it was Restate that so that Jessica gets it and see if Jessica knows And then like we were saying Olivia was talking about maybe how it looks burnt and then like you know how water it attracts a lot of light and so people get tan Yeah Faster and then so maybe the shine for the oil maybe it attracted more of the heat from the light and it burnt the leaves so Like the glisten from it Yeah Maybe that s why it looks all burnt and Because it reminded me of when you see the old movies like how it s a burnt reel Piece of paper Something like sands off in the reel of a video and you just see a hole get bigger on the burning screen That s what it kind of reminded me of Because it has a brown wrinkle around it And then it s dark and then it s kind of brown and crisp so that s what it kind of reminded me of and that s what made me think of it Yeah and then how I thought of the idea of it attracting the light and heat was how Olivia said that when you re in water it attracts more heat and light to you so maybe that s how So that s how I got the idea of maybe that s what happened So do you have anything to add Jared No You Jessica No Okay Okay so I think the reason why mine didn t grow like before how the salt would have absorbed the water Because when Mr Kelson sprayed it all of the salt right here you could feel it It s all stuck to the top so the water can t get down to the soil and all that So it can t grow at all 
 Alright I heard the term velocity So I think that sounds pretty good Velocity of a skateboarder the more important you re going to have I like velocity Keep talking amongst yourselves I m just kind of here to guide you along Make sure the people here I don t want anyone to have their back to each other I know the room is difficult to do that but if you guys could try to make sure you look at everyone inside of the group I know it s difficult Wait The whole class Oh yeah I want the whole class to discuss this I thought you were doing like table and table No no no I want everyone to talk Sorry Okay You guys can talk just like I talk across the room Feel free to do so So someone when we ask their velocity You need more length to the tracks Steeper You don t have to raise your hand If you re looking in that person s eye or you re looking in my eye feel free to You need a longer track Distance Is it the friction I will tell you that we re not going to look at friction as part of the system Let s look back at that proposal for one second Just want to make sure I didn t miss anything It s always good to look at what they give us Let s see What science terms are in there Quantitative Qualitative Okay Energy Oh We got energy in there Energy transfer Oh energy transfer Okay So I think they want something to do with energy It said quantitative We should probably use the formulas for kinetic and potential energy right Do we have them Yeah We do It s half mv squared right And then What Christina said we re going to be collecting data quantitative we ll probably have to use some formula that associates with this I agree Okay Okay He gave us the formula E sub k 1 2 mv squared Energy due to the gravitational field E sub g mg Alright Let s make sure we know what each of these letters stands for M mass and the unit Kilogram G Acceleration due to gravity Lauren said force of gravity Okay You want me to write that in Which one is it Oh its the effect from the gravitational field Okay that s fine You will sometimes see textbooks that read gravitational force but what are the units for this Meters per second squared So that can be kind of confusing if they re calling it gravitational force and then they re saying meters per second squared because what do you think when you see those units Acceleration Acceleration right So I m going to put acceleration due to gravity Okay Good H is height Yeah h is height And that s in Meters Sounds good Okay So now we go over here Mass and kilograms and then velocity and that s in meters per second Good And then if you remember that force doesn t like careless errors so maybe we should make sure that we get from these fundamental units the derived units So what are the units that we re going to have for E sub g and E sub k What is it Joules Joules Oh that s right How do you remember that I m smart Okay That s good too Oh there was a pretest that had that on there That sounds good Okay Great You re taking that prior knowledge Energy is a jewel Energy is a precious jewel Alright You want precious Okay there s jewels There s semi precious and there s precious What are they diamonds and rubies So energy is a precious jewel Kilogram times a meter per second squared Newton Newton Good Newton times a meter A joule A joule Right Over here mass and kilograms Kilogram times meters squared over seconds squared don t forget the square Kilograms times a meter again is a newton Newton times a meter that s going to be kilogram times a meter over seconds squared is a newton and then multiply that by that meter and again you get joules Okay We want to make sure that we don t did everyone see how we got that joule there Meter times another meter right Yeah Because kilogram times a meter per seconds squared gives me a newton Times a meter remember this is meters squared because of that Oh okay Okay So you know the boss doesn t like careless errors so let s make sure that we have the appropriate units Okay I don t mean to interrupt you guys Why don t you continue with that You ve got some formulas here now For potential energy wouldn t mass and acceleration due to gravity be constants so height is the only one that that could manipulate So if the height is the greater distance from the Earth then it would have more potential energy because they re directly proportional Yes Let me ask you guys I can t help but interrupt once in a while right But I just wanted to If I put this marker on the table does this marker have potential energy What is the reference point Oh oh oh The table No The center of our planet Yes Okay So I heard a fight I think that s a good thing The more danger the more fun I thought right Yes They re going to wear their headgear Is this guy wearing any head oh he s wearing head protection Why is that important by the way So the force doesn t apply to your head Okay I like that Ah Inversely proportional right I like that yeah So it increases the amount of time decreases the force So yeah danger is an aspect here but this guy seems like he s doing okay He s got his headgear on but that s definitely if you re designing a park you want to make sure that the people that visit the park aren t going to be injured There are going to be accidents with skateboards but they ll wear their gear I m going to step back and let you guys continue your thought earlier Okay So how high do we want the If we want it to have a bigger potential energy transferring the bigger kinetic energy we might want to have the height from the reference point which is the ground and kind of higher I heard reference point Let me see if I can put a reference point on this I did just put a little click a button and get the reference point okay I think the thing should be on the ground Yeah The weight s like it s safer and it s possible Do you want me to just to extend the We ve got a couple of things going on here I m sorry A couple people said yes they wanted me to put that on the ground So if those people could say that again that would be great Say that again You want to put it on the ground And I think I heard a dissenting voice in the crowd Someone that said something else I did Oh okay I said that if you increase the height it s still possible to have it above the ground because you would have two supports on either side technically you d be able to go back and forth They haven t brought in the supports for this herculean innovation That s right I mean I don t think it really is going to affect the design structure so Whether it s on the ground or I ll just pull that down That s fine Yeah I don t think that s going to make a difference That might make it easier for the person to step off the track too when they re done You know this guy s going to get really tired There s no friction so he won t have to step off on the nice safe track But you notice how as long as the track is longer he doesn t go back up as high so if you have Alright One at a time I like this Someone said something Christina said something and I think Karuna wanted to add to that He goes just as high like there s no change because there s no friction So Yeah then he doesn t go up to the top I could put the pie chart in sure And can you start him at the top Alright So I m going to put the pie chart in and then you want me to he s going to climb up the ladder right There s like a pretend ladder here And then how s that Yeah Okay Now I noticed when I did that something happened The pie chart Oh yeah Why Sounds like a height there that s increasing reference point is greater I like that Okay I m going to let him go I don t know if I can do that actually but I will try Yeah we can play around with it Make the sides taller then he ll have a greater distance to travel and it ll actually be more I don t know if I can yeah I don t think I can do that I don t think it ll it only allows me to click on the blue dots there You have to add track to do that You want me to pull those off to the side Okay Okay So you made a little bit different half pipe Oh no Alright So you don t want to look there s some thermal energy What s going on with that Okay That might ve happened But why do I now see red in the pie chart Yeah There s a force that will allow for the energy to transfer Good Let s get him back on that half pipe and you know guys I don t think that it makes much of a difference in the design or engineering of this whether we make the bottom hit the ground or have it up So I don t really think that is going to make much of a difference But we do need to collect some data and start with this proposal so Where did we leave off I think there was something that we were looking to collect there Height Okay good Let s continue with that please Well measuring tape Oooh There is a measuring tape I don t even see these things Measuring tape oh It even says fet okay good So how s that look No no Well what do you want me to do with it Going to the ground That s not the ground From the reference point Oh alright I m right on the reference point Go up a little So what do you want me to measure Well where am I going to measure From what to what The reference point to the highest point Okay I think the highest point would probably be the center of him but they do have that nice little red dot Can we just agree that we re going to go with the red dot Yes Yeah Why don t we go there It can t be diagonal Okay Is that good Yeah Yes Shut the lights off for this measure Okay Now this measuring tape is a little tricky to work with I wonder if there s any easier way for me to get this Oh Oh that s pretty neat I suppose I could use a measuring tape or I actually have that so maybe that will help make it a little bit easier if it could speed things up So what do we want to say for the height Seven I don t know if I d say seven So we all agree it s somewhere between six and eight yes Yes I d say 7 2 And it does go over the seven a little bit so height equals seven point Two Four Six Zero You tell me or it s going to go forever Let s start over again Seven I don t think it goes to the half mark 7 1 Maybe we need a show of hands on this Who believes it s 7 Who believes it s 7 meters No one s raising their hands that s good How about 7 1 7 1 meters Alright I got one person there Now I m looking at this from an angle right And anytime you want to make a measure you do want to have your eyes right above what you re measuring and obviously I m just going to move over here just so I can get a little bit better And then what else can I do to try to really measure this well Pause it Yeah I think I m going to pause the animation Now if I was making an actual measurement I d make sure my eyes were perpendicular to whatever I was measuring What do we say about oh that s good What do we say about these measures that we make in science They should be you re only as good as your measures Yeah You re only as good as your measures What does that mean Kristen It means that if your measures are not precise and consistent then everything else won t be precise and consistent Can someone elaborate on that a little bit Or do you want to add to that No someone else can elaborate on it Okay Are you sure I can give you a little more No Okay Let s see Who haven t I called on at all today because I want to make sure I get everyone You haven t called on Jill Alright I m sure she doesn t mind repeating it for you I think you said you re only as good as your measures Because if your measures aren t precise then all your other work that you re using the measures for Yeah if you measure something for speed It would be wrong Why Well no if you It could be you re right If you make some poor measures and then you go to graph it No If you take distance and then multiply it by time then speed would be wrong Like if you had the wrong distance then speed would be wrong and then making it after that your graph would be wrong Well it would be wrong right from the perspective you said distance times time and speed is distance divided by time Did everyone hear that Yeah That s okay though You re saying we don t want to get off the main idea here If you re getting these distances wrong and then you re going to graph your slope is going to be incorrect yes So remember in science we collect data From that data we put it in a nice data table to organize it and then we look at trends and patterns graph it look at trends and patterns So if everything starts from our measures those next steps aren t going to be correct 
 Today I m going to introduce to you our new project and it s based on the concept of surrealism When you look at this word you should recognize a smaller word within it Does anyone recognize the smaller word Real Real that s right The word real And we know real is the way things really look when we see them or the way they appear But the word sur transforms that word And because this is a French word sur means beyond So now what the word surrealism implies is beyond reality or the way things really appear So what does that look like It looks very dreamlike It doesn t necessarily make sense A lot of different things go on in surrealism and I m going to show you a few examples right now These are the three characteristics that we re going to focus on The first characteristic is out of place objects If you look at this example up here what s out of place in this picture Can anyone tell me Trevor The guy s face What s over his face just floating there Can anyone tell You re up close Matthew You see what that is An apple It s a green apple okay And that is an out of place object Definitely surreal These are examples of surrealism This example right here What s in here Jordan Train There s a train coming out of a fireplace Okay again an out of place object These are two examples of one of those characteristics of out of place objects Another characteristic that you see are unreal scenes Scenes that do not make sense They re beyond real What s going on in this scene Kurt There s like giant butterflies Yeah The butterflies grew They re huge Now they re like the props on the windmills What s going on in this Can anyone tell What makes that surreal John Like huge makeup Yeah the si again the size of such little things grew tremendously and they re filling up the room Also the interior of the room is now looking like the sky So what made these unreal is the artist changed something that was small and made it really really big The last characteristic that we see in surrealism is there it is Normal objects acting abnormally So in these examples I ll go through real quickly Do you see these clocks They re not acting normally These clocks are melting they re dripping they re stretching they re falling down You can see that In this one the artist drew a person looking into the mirror but does he see his reflection No No The mirror s not operating normally It s surreal It s beyond real What it s doing is it s showing the back of his head And again in this one it s kind of hard to tell but there are three swans and the reflection is of three elephants So the reflection in the water is not acting normally These are three characteristics of surrealism all right So why surrealism Why this style of art Does anyone have any guesses of why anyone or why these artists created something like this Yeah Because it s like a modern form of art Okay yeah That s actually a very good definition Cara Maybe to make it look interesting Okay good To make it look funny Okay good Guys those are all excellent excellent answers Here is another thing that went into surrealism Like lots of art it s influenced by what s going on around it or what happened before it So these three boxes represent three other styles of art that influenced the ideas of surrealism And the first style of art is known as Dada art This type of art is where the artist took things and they tried to make something that wasn t considered art They took random objects like a bicycle wheel and the stool and put it together and said Okay this is not art And that was an example of the style They also took a famous painting like the Mona Lisa scribbled mustache and a beard There it is That s not art And that was really the whole idea of Dada It was like anti art Another thing that influenced surrealism was symbolism Symbolism was a style of art in which the artist tried to depict an idea of something And in this example it s the idea of death There s this dark angel depicted over this man who s already halfway down in the ground All this white snow that symbolizes life around him And it was just the idea of what that might look like using symbols And that s what that one depicts The other example or another influence of surrealism is metaphysical painting This one s very very hard to understand and that s what the idea was with the style It was to kind of paint an unreal or illogical situation Basically one in which you do not know what you re looking at You don t know what the objects are You might know something but you don t know why it s there or what part of it it is And it s very very illogical and doesn t make sense These three styles of art in the boxes influenced surrealism So when you look at these three styles of art you can kind of see what they led to They led to this style of art which is known as surrealism So now where to start Here s what s going on today Today you are going to start with and you can open your folders up and you ll see this slide What we re going to do is we re going to start drawing today We are going to start by making a connection all right And if you look at this example up here on the board or and you can look at your slides too What we re going to do you can just take your stuff off Leann leave it back there and then join your table okay What we re going to do is I want you to come up with something that means something to you and that s like your theme to start with Maybe it s a hobby an activity a memory anything that s meaningful to you that s your starting point Then what we have to do is we have to give it an element of surprise So these are our options that I just discussed Those are the characteristics Do you want to move it around change the location of it Do you want to make the sizes different and create an unreal scene Or do you want to make objects in it doing something that they shouldn t be doing Let me give you an example Lily what s your favorite food Strawberries Strawberries What s your favorite holiday Joe Christmas Jacob what s your favorite animal A dog Okay So this is my surrealist example to you You have a Christmas tree but instead of a Christmas tree you have a big strawberry standing up with decorations on it and then you have dogs putting those decorations on it So that s kind of an example of taking things that are meaningful to you and putting them into a surrealist example These are some examples that I have that I did These are some of my drawings This first one and sometimes you don t even know where these drawings are coming from I wanted to take an object and stretch it I wanted to make it act abnormally So I chose a spoon And what I did was I thought well a spoon needs to catch something So this spoon is stretching out trying to catch the raindrops Why Because it s really dry wherever it is You can see all the cracks So that was kind of like my first idea The second sketch that I did was I wanted to do something with a tropical type of a setting An unreal scene in an unreal place So what I thought was well pineapples are tropical Why not cut open a pineapple and there is my tropical beach with all the little palm trees okay You re probably wondering what we re going to do with these Today is sketching but what s going to happen is this is going to turn into a watercolor painting This is an example of what the painting might look like when it s all done I chose the pineapple one all right So we are going to be doing a watercolor painting but today we need to kind of come up with ideas of what that painting s going to look like Up here on the board I think this is going to help you a lot This is a bunch of different examples of surrealist paintings and there s a variety of different things that the artist has done They might be food they might be animals they might be instruments they might be people they might be landscapes There s lots of things to look at I want you to use this as your primary resource to help you and guide you through your drawings I m going to give you paper right now Use this sheet Start with making a connection all right Start with making a connection and then look at the different options and ways that you can make it surreal all right How do you draw hands Hands That s okay hands You know what This is just a sketch So this is a detail that doesn t or this is a part that you don t really need to worry about So tell me what s going on What makes this surreal Um That s what I want to know Because it s the birthday party in the present Okay So which of these options do you think you re focusing the most on This one Okay and why Because a present usually doesn t open Okay so the present so the party is within the present So the present gets opened up and then there s a party Okay What else can we do to make it like maybe a little bit more like bam something going on That s the only thing I was thinking about you know Like maybe Like balloons and Yeah balloons Like they re com they re flowing out That d be really cool All right that s good What should I like do for like for like the face The face on a Baseball Baseball And what are we using for the parts of the face So this is a baseball bat Okay And I Okay These are the baseball bases Oh the bases okay Yeah And this is and this is Okay So you re combining you re combining A lot a lot of different things So why freckles Because like I thought putting more into it would make it more interesting Okay You know what I think would make this really more interesting is the background What s going on around the face Um Think about it Think about it What could we do Where could this be In the sky I don t know So what would represent the sky What could you draw to represent the sky Clouds Try that Maybe draw some clouds I think I think that s going to make your picture more interesting Something like that Because like someone hit a home run Yeah okay And maybe some action lines around the ball You know like a little Yeah That looks really good I like that I like that one a lot A dog eating pizza Okay Brittney Yeah I don t know how to draw horses A horse Yeah Why do you need a horse Because I want to draw like a horse What were you going to do Like A horse A horse with a farm inside of it Inside of it So what do you mean inside of it though Like in here do like a farm and cows and Well here s a suggestion because I like your idea a lot Why don t we we can use this as a resource Why don t we draw I ll help you with this just the back of the horse okay So we ll just work we ll focus on like the neck and the back and then the tail kind of coming down like this okay So you see where I m going with this Now what I m thinking is why don t you draw your farm scene on the back Like almost that it s like kind of been placed on there like a little miniature scene Like so maybe on here you could draw the silo the barn and everything on there Good Eyes on me One two three Okay guys you re doing a really really good job with your sketching and everything and I don t I want you to keep going But we do need to stop for a minute And based on the drawings that I m seeing I see some really good examples of surrealism and you re showing me that you understand it I bet you that if you saw an example of surrealism with some other styles of art you could pick out the one that represents surrealism Take a look up here on the board I have three Tabasco sauce posters okay One two three and four Show me with your fingers holding them up in the air which one of these is an example of surrealism Think about it for a minute While you think about it I m going to wiggle my mouse so I can okay What s an example of which one is a Jess Okay everyone had four That s good Why Why that one Why d you pick that one Because like Nope hold on I was going to let Jessie answer first What makes that one surreal Think about it Michael go ahead The sides are like coming off the bottle Okay And the pepper s like putting out the sauce Okay good Anything else Erin It s like out on this like island Yeah definitely definitely Like a lot of things make this one surreal What does surreal mean again Who remembers Me It means like not like like not real but like in a different form Right Beyond real Beyond real Okay And this is a great example of that Beyond reality Okay Here s what I need you to do now okay I have one more Oh I might have to re I have one more slide that I want to show you up on the board and if you open up your folders you ll see this You ll see this slide And I printed it out for you What I m going to have you do right now in the next couple minutes I m going to have you switch your drawing with someone at your table You might have to switch three ways or four ways or one way And I want you to assess the drawing that you get Now if you get one that has lots of drawings just pick one of them okay Here s what I want you to do on the sheet This is easy First thing What s the first thing that you notice about the drawing that you just received Write it down Maybe you noticed a big basketball Maybe you notice whatever it is write it down Then I want you to check these little circles Whichever of these options that you see that that person used I want you to check them out Okay Michael And then I want you to write This is the one that everyone stumbles with They re like What does this mean All I m saying is what do you think that person meant in that drawing What do you think the meaning is If you don t know put a question mark All right And then what suggestions do you have for that person Maybe they you know if you did a background it would look really nice Or maybe you know what Maybe you ve got to lose something You ve got way too much going on I can t tell what it is So this is not going to take you very long but it s important because it shows that shows me that you understand what you re looking at and it also helps the person get a better drawing which is going to be used for the painting So I want you to switch drawings right now Everyone switch And I want you to use the sheet and I want you to fill it out based on the new drawing that you re looking at okay So you re going to do this independently and I ll come around and I ll check with you in a little bit That s the first thing that you see Write down the first thing that you see all right So Lily what s the first thing that you see in your in this picture Okay What do you think it is Okay What do you think this is as a whole Don t say anything because I know it s yours But this is good because this is going to help you to make it better if you need to So what s the first thing that you know That you th what do you see Just maybe you recognize it just as water Anything else Maybe a blanket Okay Write that down Okay that s a good start What s the first thing that you saw Almost everything is crooked That s a good ob that s a really good observation Because everything is crooked Good So what options do you think were used in this Now which one did you select Normal object acting abnormally That s right It s clearly these objects are acting abnormally That s good That was a good that was another good observation So you just keep moving through Did you write down your first reaction Mm hmm Okay And okay So normal objects acting abnormally 
 Okay Look at your music We are doing four parts obviously With them take just a general idea for the whole thing Raise your hand if you see or have any eighth notes in the whole song Raise your hand if you ever sing eighth notes Sopranos where do you have eighth notes Shelby tell me Measure nine Say it really loud so they all hear you Measure nine Measure nine very good Audrey where do you have eighth notes Measure thirteen Thirteen good Reese where do you have eighth notes Measure nine and measure Measure nine and thirteen Hey what do you notice about the soprano part and the bass part then Same rhythm Almost the same rhythm all the way through Tenors where do you have eighth notes Braden Twenty one and twenty two Twenty one and twenty two So getting toward the very very end Altos tell us something about your part rhythmically Raise your hand Give me a summation of what you do Jamie We don t have any You don t have any at all You only have quarter notes half notes and some whole notes So how many beats does a half note take up everybody Two Two make sure you last long enough through that and then look up at the whole notes Solf ge what key are we in Where is Do Brady F F major So the first pitch that the altos have is Do Do Sopranos what s your starting pitch Mi Basses what s your starting pitch Do Tenors Sol Very good Look at it for a second there are some jumps in the very beginning They don t mess around right away we ve got some eighths and some intervals Chant on solf ge your part One and two and three and four and Very good Go on Two three four On the second to last measure on the first page bassists and altos will move Stepwise motions so you ll they both go up one step Be aware of that Notice that we have some repetition Do you see some patterns that are coming back So if you miss it the first time you get a second shot Where if you get it right the first time remember what it sounds like so you can do it again Continuing second page One two three and chant Freeze Let s go back and join the basses with us at measure nine Do re mi Everyone measure nine and Okay Sopranos careful it might screw up your voice Why did you have an issue there Why did you miss it It s a skip Because it s a skip in the melody And why else A practical reason Here to here Because it s hard for you to look from the edge of the page down to the next one Top of the next page measure seventeen A little faster and go Sorry seventeen Sopranos fa altos la tenors fa basses fa Ready Hey everybody has fa that might be a good place to find the measure La This will help You re right sorry except the altos Listen right there when you re actually singing for that and go You ll have to hold this for a very long time Go back to the beginning The rule is number six Jesse repeat the last step The last step Oh never quit singing Never quit singing Look up find your keys points Okay Second key Do mi so mi do so do Sing your starting note One two three four Good Now I have two minutes to try to fix and try to correct to do as much as we can to do a little bit better with this Take a second and look through the piece and hear it go by in your heads Do a quick run through because it s hard to know I cant remember what I missed I m still freaking out about the whole thing Take a minute replay it in your head Find areas where there were problems for you Overall you did extremely well You listened to each other You could hear that it sounded like music If you weren t sure about an interval you would sing it and then you would go Oh this is right yes and you were affirmed And I think you got more confident as you went along Problem areas Raise your hands if you had one Chelsea My problem I had was with measure seventeen Seventeen Sopranos do to fa that s a like a little bit of a tricky leap and some of you hesitated a little bit there So then you heard it and you were able to go on and then I liked when you got it again when you got back to nineteen Finding fa that s a strange function in the music Yes Patrick Measure nineteen fa to la Okay nineteen fa to la Just making sure that you know where you re moving Fa to la Where Oh nineteen Yes sorry My eyes were at seventeen Good Bass hands Excellent thank you Grant where Twenty Twenty Yes and what did you do I couldn t figure out the notes I mean I couldn t figure out the I think it surprises you because you move up by a step You were fine so la and the ti you weren t willing to actually sing ti because it s not very often that you sing it Stepwise motion so la ti do You did an excellent job basses throughout then returning to so and do when you had it You had some issues with fa and la Colin Six and seven Where we were going from la to fa and then back to do and then we had an eighth notes Because of that Okay So being aware of when you have eighth notes And chances are there isn t ever a point where you have eighth notes that other people don t So when you hear it then you can move with them and it s always by step when you have eighth notes And it s always ascending So you don t have to worry about going down anywhere but yes fa and la continue to be icky I didn t time it We have to sing it again I m so sorry Okay so we fixed the things that we missed We re going a little faster so it sounds like music and not just this exercise Listen across the room to each other Do mi You stayed very well in tune Do mi so mi do so do Set your key Remember you always sing with the very best tone that you possibly can If you look up basses I m trying to help you out some with my hand signs every so often Sing your first note please One two three four Have a seat And now evaluate yourselves comparing the first reading to the second That means you need to think about how well you did the first time versus how well you did the second time and if you haven t had any thoughts or wanted to share anything yet it s time because this is opinion time and there s no wrong The room is going to tip over from the hands on this side There are four sections Jamie Well sometimes they re like a step away from each other but something like I know they re like one long and sometimes I Okay So there are a couple little slips with stepwise motion that time Okay Hannah I thought the sopranos the first time did a lot better than the second time I would agree The first time you did better than the second There are a couple of reasons for this Raise your hand if you feel like when you think back on how well you ve done both times you did better the first time Why Why Emily Because you were so focused and trying to get it right so the second time we ve already gone through it so we relaxed a little and little things slip up Okay Some of you may have relaxed just a little bit too much What else possibly Colin I think some of us got a little too over confident Ohhh that s an excellent thing to check Just making sure some of you don t get a little over confident Although basses the fa s and la s were much better this time as an overall section Amanda If the first time usually there s a few problem areas for me then I try to focus on them way too much and then I see the spots where it might have been tricky for me like that jump from la to do So I freak myself out about that even though I got it right both times You get stuck in your head a little bit Yeah Okay So doubting yourself and then not being sure What else can happen Ariella Along with what Emily said about how we sometimes get over confident because we ve already seen it and we just fly by it because we re not really trying to pay attention to it too much Okay Ryan Measure nine It s the so so mi I went back to the so because that s what we did on the first page Oh okay because you re remembering now the patterns that you had You get the patterns mixed up when you actually start to sing it the second time That s a good thought too Michaella Between the and because we to sing notes over and over again over and over again I didn t like it It s kind of hard I didn t get the first two notes right and finally on like the third note I think I just figured out what we were doing Patrick I think that sometimes because we ve already sung the music and now I think that we kind of know what s going on 
 Okay so They re equal because of Right Angles Theorem You are skipping a step Again Trevor tell him the definition of an altitude You tell me I have an altitude You have to tell me then what s the consequence of an altitude Read the definition of an altitude Say it The definition of an altitude is that it intersects the opposite side of the angle at a perpendicular angle I don t know how to word that right but Somebody help him out He s making sense but somebody Yes Alright It goes through the opposite vertex and it intersects the opposite line perpendicularly if that s a word Don t say through because an altitude is bounded It starts at a vertex and it goes Okay so Now Isaac What should be the consequent step two there Right here Yes Whatever they gave you in those definitions Trevor s and the improved definition by Trey nobody said anything about congruent angles What did we talk That they re both right angles That they re right angles No we didn t That BD is perpendicular to AC Ah ha That s what I got Nice That s what it is So just write on top of that honey Right here Yeah the step two you should have that Right You have to go with the definitions when you have a justification because that s what reason says It comes from a defintion And why is that because of Tell him Why is that Definition of altitude Definition of altitude Okay You see how when we were working with the picture we put those boxes on the triangle What did those boxes say indicate That they re right angles They re right angles okay So that should be And why do we have right angles Somebody tell me Why do we have right angles Definition of perpendicular lines Yes That s a consequence if you have perpendicular lines So I m going to write ADB and CDB are right angles Yes Yeah Okay You guys the rest of you might have started with the fact that it s an angle bisector right Yeah Yeah And that s okay if you started with that It s okay Doesn t matter You could have started with the BD is congruent to BD You don t have to start with a given but that s traditionally the way we do it I can t believe I got this It s because of It s the definition of perpendicular lines What s this Okay wait Breathe in and out Now let s go see what s going on Okay step to the side ADB and CDB Okay Still you need to have an angle a side and an angle Do you have a congruent angle After all that work I m going to do that now Okay what are you going to put Angle ADB is congruent to angle CDB because the definition of right angles Nope Right Angle Congruency Right Angle Congruency Theory Well I haven t What is the definition of right angle That all right angles are congruent What s the definition of a right angle 90 degrees It measures 90 degrees Yeah yeah All right angles are congruent is the Right Angle Theorem that he s writing Okay let s see what we have If you would number them that would help That s one And what s the consequence for after one I m trying I am old and somewhat blind from here But I know Is that a 2 right under that At the perpendicular line you have 2 What is that AD is perpendic No after that Angle ADB is congruent to angle CDB Wait He wrote it It s all jumbled up and it s all there so But wait a minute Let s make sense out of this because it has to flow okay You know when you have your perpendicular line What should be at the perpendicular line The direct consequence if you have perpendicular lines is what That the angles are Somebody somebody That they re right angles I want to say that but then I just don t want to say something that s wrong No you re fine You were not here yesterday And it seems you re doing great Hey so take the blue marker so that everybody can see Take the blue marker because I would like to re number it so they can see it okay So re number them again One is the given the altitude So you want me to write over Yes And then that s two Now what should be three Don t put three on that one What should be three Somebody tell him What should be three The angles The right angles Yes Okay now honey after you have right angles what are you going to say That uh Definition of Right Angle Theorem No Okay so right angles What happens after right angles Because remember angles are angles I need to talk about angle congruency But you haven t said that You talked about right angles So now what are you going to say You have it there honey Angle ADB is congruent to angle CDE Okay so that should be the next step That s four Okay you remember Good Great Remember when I asked you at the beginning when we first started doing proofs to keep track So you have mentioned an angle congruent to an angle Yeah right here Not yet we haven t touched that guy yet We don t even have a number for that guy He s just floating in there What angle is congruent to what angle Have you mentioned that one angle is congruent to another angle Yeah ADB is You just did right Okay go cross out one of the As I don t think you specifically did this but I ve noticed that some of you I ve noticed in Abby and I would notice in a couple of you Taylor that you were always After you prove something you found it within your proof You would kind of cross it out in here Okay I found this Or some of you would come over here and actually write it here It s like you re taking attendance I need angle for an angle I already have an angle Keeping going See what I m doing here I showed you this way back Yeah He s probably getting confused because of number three How he put ADB because it should be ABD and DBC instead of ADB Wait what what what Number three The original number three Yeah The B should be in the middle instead of D It should be ABD and DBC That s right That s why That s why Yeah I didn t noticed that Yeah I thought he put that You guys are smart Yeah that s how you got confused with everything else Okay so now segment BE is congruent to segment BE because of reflexive property so that s another side And then it s given that BD is an angle bisector so that means angle ABD is congruent to angle CBD Okay but the issue here is he hasn t listed that as a given right Just like people say Well you re making that up How do you know that And you just say It s given but you didn t write it Yeah he did Yeah yeah he did It s right there It s number four He just did it wrong It s backwards It s all there So that should be step Wait a minute One two three four five Four should be one Whoa Three should be two One should be So there s a one two three four and then five Wait five right here Six right above it six seven Okay can you change the numbers Fix the numbers Yeah please fix the numbers It s there Okay we got it We have an angle bisector the consequence of an angle bisector We have an altitude the consequence of an altitude We have reflexive property so do you have them all Yeah So what could you say now The triangle I m going back to the black marker Okay let s get him out of the hot seat okay Micah Yes Micah You tell us is he finished with the proof No Why Because you said no Who said no You But okay you re supposed to tell me if there s something Well you have to put that it is the I don t know Frank to the rescue He hasn t proved that it s isosceles yet And how do you prove that it s isosceles I don t really know That sounded so tough Frank Yes Okay you say segment AB and segment BC are congruent by C Wait how do you say it CPCTC Corresponding Parts of Congruent Triangles are Congruent I always mess it up I can t do the CPC I can t do that I say the whole thing Okay now Frank is he finished I think Is he No Not yet No he s not Okay why Tell him why Since you have the two sides congruent and the isosceles triangle needs two sides congruent then you can say that the triangle is isosceles now because AB is congruent to BC So what should be his number 10 Triangle ABC is isosceles And that would be the definition of an isosceles triangle Yes I m so proud It keeps getting better I told you it would get better Teamwork I was stressing last night because I was like it s so hard Okay you guys understand what this means but I m trying to hurry it Good job Isaac Yeah Isaac a good job Very good Isaac One big clap for Isaac one two three Alright Yeah You did good Okay so You know what This is the proof that the new program where I give you because I want to make sure you get it enough information to do this on our own okay And then I m not going to write it out We re going to talk about how to do it And then you re going to complete it tonight at home So what do we need to do What is given there Jonathan What s given The middle one This one honey CB is an angle bisector of ACB CD is an angle bisector of ACB Okay what does that give you Once you have an angle bisector No that s not it Don t look at that one That s a totally different proof This is one that I m going to give you tonight So what does CD being an angle bisector of angle ACB mean 
 I think that Igneous and Metamorphic they re the least there are two books that don t use em cause they re Well my Igneous Yeah it Igneous and Metamorphic cool off and react And only a few particles came off but I was Yeah it s just awkward because mine was boosting most of yours Well yeah When I did my alien on my first try it was 42 grade Then now when I m measuring it again it was 22 grade It Mine never changed all it did was lost a little bit of it s rice crispies That was mine But I feel like Igneous rock like 20 Well yeah Cause the weathering does a lot of things to the rock s outside And Mine was the same as Igneous and metamorphic And so if I d shake it like through weathering a bunch of rock would fall off I haven t done anything yet It was three I can t wait to Oh I have to say the one with the marshmallows cause it s Well for my Sedimentary it was harder Yeah mine too What Cause when I did mine only one piece of my Sedimentary broke apart and The Sedimentary My Igneous rock It has like almost It might be a little inaccurate since these are not real Sedimentary rocks You have to keep that in mind Well yeah So but what if they were real Sedimentary Would we be able to tell what they are Yeah Obviously Do you know any Sedimentary rocks that looks like a granola bar Yes I saw them in my yard They re called a granola ball No That was probably granite which is an Igneous rock For Jeanie do we write just how many lasts Cause mine must ve had Okay so when I when I did the blendering of my Sedimentary I lost only three grams off of my Sedimentary rock So I m not sure what would happen if I add these two Because of the heat out of the cause if you were to put heat to a rock like our little blue Metamorphic rocks what would happen was the heat would melt it and it would give pressure to stick down to the tinfoil Yeah that s how that happens because this is probably the farthest off we have from a little while Yeah Like last we and like have you ever heard of a rock that s called Metamorphic rock Yeah It can be greasy Let s talk about why we use the models Obviously you re never gonna be so lucky as come across a rock that s like the taffy Why did we use the Laffy Taffy for our model Because the heat and the pressure the heat and the pressure would like stick together but like a Sedimentary rock We use our fingers to add that heat pressure We had to simulate it somehow we couldn t do the actual Earth process in the classroom Do you agree with that Mm hmm Okay so you understand why you understand why we use that material for our model Okay Right it probably melts And why did we use the microwave for the Igneous rock Because What were we trying to simulate there From Magma is a really hot substance and this is what Igneous rocks can form from Could we actually manipulate and touch magma in the classroom No No Could we work a marshmallow Yep So we understand the connection there We re trying to use materials that we can bring into the classroom but that will still simulate lava magma the processes Okay So pressure I think it has less effect of all the It had a lesser effect going through the processes of Of both Weathering And erosion And erosion okay Now you guys can think about this if you didn t like the samples and examples up here that I used you could always do it different Food material To make up your own experiment later Okay Let s talk for a moment Why should we measure again after our rock samples have been through weathering and erosion Why are we measuring again Look at your rock samples do they look the same as what we measured in here No No What happened You have to measure the difference The difference and why would there be a difference What could we do to our rock samples Changed dramatically when you did the weathering on them Let s use the same what did you use when you pre measured I would keep it the same Why would I keep it the same Because it s Can we compare centimeters to inches Yes You can Think about that because later when you have to come back and do the difference how are you gonna do the difference with some centimeters and some inches How can you compare those two measurements You re telling me you wanna go centimeters here but inches down here I would keep it the same They would make it mathematically You working on your difference Your difference in mass This your pre mass Explain to me how you got to that Where are the books They might add on to another sedimentary rock cause it s like never ending For some reason my Sedimentary and my Igneous rock They both lost a half inch in length Yeah mine too In my igneous rock grams it lost 20 grams and my sedimentary lost 10 grams Mine lost no grams Mine gained grams Your gained grams Yeah I had 17 grams I had 17 grams and then it came back to 21 And this one went up one Because when this one went up three Maybe you should check that over Cause it weathers and erodes away Well I m guessing that most of the bits and pieces of the other people s stuff went into mine and made it bigger Cause it can do that it can See Right there All around the Oh I see it See Other bits and pieces of other people s went into mine and made mine bigger With mine a bunch of bits and pieces And mine started to melt Because your observations say it crumbles apart it s breaking apart and moving Okay what about these gaps here These gaps Yeah how you gonna do that For some reason my Igneous rock Into the sample It made it bigger Made it heavier Did it have more mass after the Your protective sleeve s coming off That s a good possibility that might throw your measurements off Did it happen to anything else Any other sample Now you re working on a difference in You gotta find the difference in length and width and you re gonna find the difference in mass That s interesting you could explain that away right there Mm hmm isn t that the one Igneous the one you were saying got the strange results You can talk to me then Well that s probably how they make the canyons bigger Maybe because some of the rocks after rain and the sandstorms they could just pound together and make a big old rock So Okay so if it erodes off another rock I m listening are you talking about real life rocks when they really erode away Mmhmm And it starts to rain cause a lot of times it s like wind and rain A lot of times it takes the sand away from the rain with the rain and here s another rock which makes a bigger You re thinking sometimes with real life rocks you could have actual sediment mixing in with igneous rocks Right do you remember how we talked about how igneous can morph back into sedimentary Those bits and pieces are melding with igneous rock when you have that blend where igneous is morphing into sedimentary rock okay So that would also cause reason for your measurements I like where you re going with that Try to make that connection You know Unis was giving me a hard time earlier about how metamorphic rock s not made of Laffy Taffy So how s this go back to rocks in real life Think about that Some of our videos that we were watching About what salts quartz in these two processes You have to let the water go down Cause the heat inside of it could ve frozen Cause they heat over there we had it kinda Whoa what s the answer 19 grams 19 Igneous Igneous How could you make that Explain it to your little sister She s not gonna be able to understand that she wasn t here What could you put on your rock cycle diagram Okay So you re gonna have This is 17 17 for what Igneous What about sedimentary Tell me how Sean needs help Um he needs help with Okay where he s trying to find the mass of the sedimentary rock What do ya mean No I was saying that it may have gotten darker Darker because of the heat Yeah A lot of rocks do that Yeah But it could be jus the pink Yeah it could be I could write down that it could be pink Yeah what happened to my metamorphic rock is I can Yeah that s because of this thing in between our finger and Mine it didn t get darker than mine though So you could add that to what you put in So how would that affect our measurements How did it affect your width Igneous and sedimentary rock could Now talk to me though if it s in You wanna know why those are there Because a lot of rocks don t have protection that doesn t help them And a lot of kids drop theirs inside their bag which mixed with the Sedimentary It could And sooner or later if it just stays in there and rolls around guess what it would do It would also become a sedimentary It s just like the rocks it s just like the rocks in life It s more similar to real life Yeah The eroded bits would stick to other rocks So I just added like bits We have bits and pieces See if I was to shove this in my bag and just roll it around in all of this this would also become this because this isn t on the mat This would begin to stick And when you ball it together it makes it appear coloring to it that show that it s inside there I think that the igneous and the metamorphic rock After each sample ones that were weathering and erosion So you re gonna compare your two measurements pre measurement post measurement to see if there s a difference for each rock Hmm Hmm Do we have to subtract Do we What s your key word that could tell you what to do Difference Go show me I know you re thinking You just told me what key word tells you what to do Where were we Finding the mass After we ve done the weathering and erosion Okay are you gonna get started Yes Yes Jack are you finished with that scale Can we use manners please Can we use manners Can you say please pass the balance Talk to me guys just for a moment about the differences in those in your We ve got Ashley s igneous we talked about that I figured out for the metamorphic that changes did actually happen because they put the sedimentary came on to the metamorphic So we can see again how just and it probably had a lot to do with our service and our bag that s how those pieces of sediment got attached to our metamorphic rock And I think it became darker because the heat because of the pink And because of the pink Yeah Okay think about in real life sedimentary rock when those levels when those layers are smashed together Okay don t some of those layers change the color with all that heat and pressure Okay that was your metamorphic Yes Brooke And also you get the igneous in there it sticks to it and you can just put it inside there cover the layers off and it actually gets inside the metamorphic So you all noticed how your rock samples are very true to real actual rocks and how they could combine with one another and result in a completely different rock Okay So on your next page where you get to make your rock cycle diagram maybe you could use those observations and those understandings when explaining your outcome Not the candy rock cycle the real one It says that you could use a diagram okay Using your textbook Level Readers Science Journal or the rock cycle experiment that we just completed Anything you want to be able to explain the rock cycle Okay My igneous has gone down just a bit 
 We have been talking about being a good speaker and a good listener And in class your teacher had you do an activity in your classroom where you sat across the way from a student and you read them a paper that you had written about dingoes And then you had to stand up in front of the class and you had to present that Do you remember that Okay So we talked about what it sounds like to be a good speaker and what it looks like to be a good listener and your teacher and I worked on a rubric and you got a grade for some different things about speaking Do you remember what any of those things were that you got a grade on Do you remember what she was looking for Posture Posture What do you mean by posture Not moving around Okay So when you re standing up in front of the class what would you look like Standing straight Okay Not leaning against the wall Okay good Do you remember what else we talked about being a good speaker looks like Voice Okay What about your voice What should your voice do Use your presentation voice Yeah like a presentation voice Does it sound like this What does a presentation voice sound like Kind of loud but not like an outside voice Yeah kind of loud but not screaming right I like how you said not an outside voice All right What else for speaking Do you remember what else One of them I know didn t really have to do with speaking but it had more to do about your report And it was did your report make sense Right Did what you write make sense What about if I read my report really slow Is that good I can t remember It starts with an F Fl Fluency Fluency Good And what does that mean You re not reading slow or too fast Good not too slow not too fast just right Okay So we have posture voice makes sense fluency do you remember what the last one was You re not doing it right now Eye contact Good All right You want to make eye contact right Right So when you re reading you want to be able to do what See the people Yeah look at the audience right Kind of look over your paper and make eye contact with people Okay now if I m a good listener if I m the person sitting in the audience how can I show my classmates that I m being a good listener No distractions Okay So don t distract them What else Don t be distracted by someone else Okay So you want to focus on the speaker All right How can you show them that you re focused on them How would they know Look at them Yeah look at them Right Okay look at the speaker And what else What about at the end when they re done Ask questions Good Ask questions Anything else Sit up straight Okay Good Could you tell them maybe how they did What do we call that Like feedback What they did well on or maybe what they could do better Right Okay Put a star next to the ones that you think you already do a good job at What do you think you do a good job at Okay You re focused on the speaker All right you sit up straight Okay You don t distract others That s good Okay Now out of these two which one do you think you need to work on Which one could you do a better job That one Okay So maybe you could ask more questions at the end Okay All right What about speaking Which ones do you think you do a good job at already Posture Okay You do a good job on that one Make sense Mm hmm Eye contact Mm hmm Okay so out of your voice and fluency which one do you think you could do better Which one could you work on The voice Voice All right So what do you think you need to do better with your voice Speak up louder Speak up louder Maybe a little bit closer to like that presentation voice Okay On your rubric it was what five four three two one Do you remember what you got on your volume Three A three okay So Miss Welch thought you could do a little better too so maybe next time you could get a four or a five Okay So we have been talking about famous African Americans and you had said that Walter Payton was somebody that you had thought was interesting Right All right So we are going to look at some information about Walter Payton and then see if we can maybe do better on asking questions and maybe working on your volume Okay Cool Okay So Austin the other day you and I met and we did a videotape of ourselves giving a little speech about Walter Payton and the first one was I was speaking and you were videotaping me And then we flipped it and I videotaped you So what I want to do is have us watch those and see how they turned out And then we re going to use this rubric that you use in your classroom to kind of grade ourselves and see how we did and talk about what we can do better in the future Okay So we looked up some facts about Walter Payton and let s watch my speech first And I want you to be thinking about while you watch me how did I do on eye contact How did I do on my volume How was my fluency Did it make sense And how was my posture Okay on a scale of one to five five being Woo hoo Miss Suzer you did a great job and one meaning Miss Suzer I didn t even see that at all Okay All right you ready All right Let s see how I did Walter Payton was one of the best running backs in the NFL He played for the Bears after going to college in Mississippi Sweetness has over 110 questions But he died in 1999 of liver cancer He s one of the best football players of all time I wish I could have seen him play He was my favorite football player All right So let s see What do you think Do you want to use purple or blue You want to be purple Okay So how do you think I did on eye contact What do you think You think a four Okay why do you think a four Did I give much eye contact No No Oh you re saying yes I only saw myself look up once so I m going to give myself a two I don t think I did a very good job You re too nice Alright How was my volume Pretty good Okay I think I ll agree with you there How was my fluency or my rate Good Okay I think I m going to give myself a four because there were kind of parts where I thought maybe I could have talked a little faster I don t know All right Did it make sense what I said Yeah Okay And how was my posture Was I standing up straight looking ahead Okay I wasn t like swaying or rocking or anything All right so it looks like overall I think I need to do better on eye contact And you thought I could probably do a little better on eye contact And I think I could do a little better on my fluency I think I could have maybe spoke a little bit faster It sounded like I was kind of in slow motion Okay So now let s watch how you did And then we ll grade you Okay All right so here you are Okay Let s see All right How do you think your eye contact was A one Why did you give yourself a one Because I didn t really look up You didn t look up at all did you Were you looking at your paper What were you concentrating on Paper The paper Okay Yeah I would say it would be good maybe if you held your paper down at your belly button right and then you could look up All right How was your volume Not evident Okay I m going to give you a two and a half for your volume because we could kind of hear you I think the reason we couldn t hear you is because you had the paper in front of your face I think your voice might have gone out a little bit more All right How was your fluency or your rate What do you think I didn t hear myself at all Okay All right I thought it wasn t bad at all I thought it was pretty good because when I could hear you I thought it was probably like a three and a half or a four You weren t reading really fast You were reading so that I could understand you It was just kind of hard to hear All right Do you think your facts made sense Why did you give yourself a two I don t know I had some in there and I don t know All right Because you could only hear parts of it You think if your volume had been better you could have heard more Okay All right I m going to give you a four because I think it made sense All right What about your posture How was your posture Man you re being hard on yourself Why did you give yourself a one Because I wasn t I was like Wiggling around a little bit Yeah Okay Well I m not going to be that hard I m going to give you a three Okay so if we were going to do this again maybe in front of your class or in front of your teacher or something what would you do differently next time Now that you ve seen yourself what would you do differently Maybe the things you got ones on right Okay So maybe looking up over your paper Maybe your volume Yep Maybe working on your fluency or your rate maybe a little faster right What about your posture what would you do differently Stand straight Okay Try to stand still All right So it looks like we have a couple things we could work on right for next time Okay Sounds good 
 That one hurts It says volume by use the formula to find the volume Okay so I got 53 when I added up the numbers Yeah I did too I took it and divided by three 17 6666 Just do 17 6 No 17 point three sixes So we ll just Just no Hayden we have to find 17 666 cause all six of them put 17 6 I know but we are now let s just round it up one to 18 Okay Yeah So with average it s 18 Okay So now we have to do based on our average how close were you to your guess so how close were we to our guesses so like I was close by seven I was close by nine We have 18 here how far was nine and 18 I don t know Nine Nine plus nine is 18 right Oh yeah So write nine right here I was by five Okay All right based on our average how many drops would it take to make one liter 18 000 What Oh yeah You got us correct a few times Multiply it by If we had it to drops times 1000 cause that s how many milliliters are in a liter we get 10 000 Okay so now we do water disposal Follow the directions to find the volume of three marbles using water fluid So first we have to add milliliters of water to 100 milliliter So we have to add 20 milliliters of water into this So Giselle you wanna do that No Okay That yeah Pour it so this gets to 20 okay I ll pour it then Oops whoa okay Try not to put too much I ll pour it out Let s try again it with a dropper No you re supposed to do it with a beaker I know but if we re really really close and we can t do it with a beaker then we re gonna have to do it with a dropper So we just do this Okay we re at 20 I think that s 20 We re at 19 I got it Okay Just Don t drop it too fast cause I okay Okay So now we have to add the three marbles so We ll bring em on this side Yeah you have one Hayden has one and I have one No let Alina have one You do Alina poured the water So it s you Amy and Hayden Okay Okay so we have to like tilt it to roll down the cylinder I think I can do it Yeah I know but it s the easiest way No not that much you don t wanna don t wanna pour some out Sayonara sucker Okay the water level now is 26 exactly All right so it went from 20 to 26 So the difference in volume is six and the volume of the three marbles is six right What do you think Alina Yeah How do you think I got six I don t know Well subtracted 20 from 26 Because it s 20 before the marbles and 26 after so the marbles must be Okay Kay How we doin over here Pretty good All right I m gonna ask you a couple of questions about volume What have you learned about volume so far Whenever you Alina look at the board that I made for you okay Whenever you drop drops of water into the graduated cylinder what s happening to the volume What happened What happened to the volume of the water It was at 20 and then 26 It got higher It went higher It went higher okay so we can say then that volume does what What did it do Rise It rose okay Volume rises okay so the volume rose good and what did you find for the volume of the three marbles using water displacement Did you get that far yet Yep Okay We got six because the water was at 20 before and then after we put the marbles in it was at 26 so it s six cause you have to subtract the 26 minus 20 Good okay If you can switch places with me I wanna be able to hear Alina Okay All right so I m gonna ask you another question When you were doing if you got six if the volume of those three marbles is six milliliters according to what you have we need to change that to a solid measurement okay This is the solid measurement cubes that we use to measure solids Marbles are solids So Alina can you can anyone tell me how we transfer that six milliliters to cubes To centimeter cubes Each one of those is a gram and if Each one of these is a gram that s correct And if one milliliter is equal to one centimeter cubed and all and in that case it must also be equal to one gram so that s why for this I wrote that the difference in volume was six grams and the volume of three marbles is six grams I could also figure out that these are our three marbles and we have six grams then each one of them is 15 grams Okay but grams is that a unit of volume or is that a unit of mass Mass Mass Good Alina it s a unit of mass So what Hayden said is correct One centimeter one milliliter is equal to one gram one milliliter of water is equal to one gram but what do we know about the cubic centimeters We need to put the units in this term So if you got six milliliters for the volume of the three marbles then how can we change it to centimeters cubed How many milliliters is this is one centimeter cubed Do you remember one It s a one to one ratio like Eli told us in home room So six milliliters must also be equal to six centimeters cubed So and this is the unit of volume but you re also right the mass must be it will also be equal to one gram but we re talking about volume not mass So it s the weight it s the volume Yeah It has to do with three times three times four But you have to explain why Because So how do we know this But why do we do that You don t know the answer right now Because it said that Three cubic centimeters And a height of three cubic centimeters I don t know if that s really a three with a height of four Yeah with a height of four So we have to do our work Cause we built the work right there And like Height from a And the height Hold on So So Summer three times three and then Yeah times four I m up to three times three That s nine and then times four gives you three times When I did this it was four times three I know that Is So three times 16 No Three times three is nine times four is Okay it s three times four Okay it s nine times four Why would that be 60 36 Yeah so we did three times three we calculated nine times three So that gives you nine and then because there s a height of three you multiply by four which gives you 36 because it s a basic math problem And it gives you 36 Okay So explain why you know that And then And then we go on to number two But wait for her to finish I am I m just gonna be a little Change the length width and height of the rectangular prism without changing its volume Try and it and explain Of course not because we re gonna feel like I think is something s wrong Well we can Well I guess if No we can t cause you can take that one off the building height No we could tip this over this way and solve for Why would you do that What We re done with problem one So now So I guess we could Yeah But no but in we d still have we would still have the same volume All right so the next problem is can you change Summer are you still I m fine I know but we already read it though She can read she needs to read it Ryan So what say we couldn t because the numbers we ll have to do the oh wait no No we could No because like we won t We re doing the height and we turn it sideways Yes we would It s true Okay So So How are you guys doing For number two we wanted to we had it like this and we wanted to turn it sideways cause that would change the height around Okay so let s talk about number two that s the one you re on I m completely knocked it over All right so the question is on number two can you change the length width Can you change the length width and height of the rectangular prism without changing its volume Try it and explain Okay so first of all the first rectangular prism you built so this rectangular prism okay was one centimeter I mean three centimeters long We did three times three it was nine because it had a line So three times three is nine then times four times height of four I don t know Okay so this is the rectangular prism you built for number one correct Okay and then you just multiply its length times its width times its height and what did you get Summer I got 36 36 And I m thinking that more than one thing can equal 36 like if we had Okay so how many cubes did you use to get this Two for 36 This 36 How many cubes were there in all In all that was 36 It was 36 you had to count out the cubes right So can you use the same But have like a different height But have a different length width and height Well yeah the answer would be yes because more there are multiple pieces you could do six like well you do two three and six Okay Two times three equals six six times six equals 36 Two times three times six would equal 36 Right as long as the three would be height So six could be this Okay Summer what do you think They think you can change these numbers and it still be 36 cubes Could you still use 36 cubes build a rectangular prism and but get different numbers here You can why do you think so Because it has to change it from then like the 36 would still be the same 
 Anything else So what composter would you want I think we would want maybe like a three tray or four tray vermicomposter And I do now admit it would be helpful to get one that would be cheaper Maybe you guys have a different idea Maybe I was thinking that maybe we can make one because I printed off some directions how to make a vermicomposter So again that would save us a lot of money just to make it Like this might cost 20 to get all these supplies And I know some people have supplies at their houses that they could bring in to use for this And this might cost 20 when a store bought one off the internet may cost 100 Yes but the store bought one s are quality and a professional makes it So they know what they re doing I doesn t really matter I mean it has the same purpose it does the same thing I just matters on the worms The only thing that we really have to buy is the worms Dylan and Ben I got to admit I do agree with Claire Buying one would be a good quality and what do we know about I know it says what do we know about Now where are you guys in your conversation We re deciding to do wood metal or plastic But he said that the wood would rot and the metal could rust It could rust because of the moistness of the compost Okay It s not metal We re not talking about metal So we might do plastic On what If we make it Purchasing one No if we make our own But this one is award winning Seventy dollars All right and did you know what website you found that so you could share it as a class This is buying a vermicomposter that would cost 70 And what did you say about yours This is about like 20 because we need two of these eight to 10 gallon plastic storage boxes And we need two of them and it says the cost is about five dollars each And that would save us a lot so we could get Weebly pro tools and then maybe later on we could by the reusable bags So what are your thoughts on helping the whole community I think we should build this because it s better and we would have more money left over And how would you spend the other money left over I would spend it on like stuff that we need for composting like for tools Okay wait we have multiple conversations going here in this group So let s wait I would spend it on the tools Weebly Pro and if we have some money left over we could probably get more from the compost And then we could get that tea thing that gets the tea out And that way you could get more money And then we could get something else What s Weebly Pro It s like an extra you can search it up on Google Isn t it a website It s 26 compost and then you can have a many slides as you want videos And then we can sell our compost on the internet and that would help a lot So how is the Weebly Pro better than the Weebly that we already have Because you were the webmaster on the class website on the composting website And you want to what do you want us to do We can have buy the six month plan and then the guys for next year they figure it out And how would us buying the Weebly Pro help the community It would help us to sell it and to inform about compost Okay any other comments or thought We could it could maybe inform the people more because we could make a video of how to compost so they could make their own Okay inform who Be more specific The viewers of the website All of our guests Yeah There s a greater chance it s not gonna fail Guys we re not playing the what if game I not saying but we have a chance that the cups might break because they re cups and they have an easier chance It has a bigger chance of not failing We have to take risks We have to Plus you would have the pride of making your own If we make our own and we mess up then we re just wasting money What if what if what if what it I m not doing the what if Cause remember last time when we built a If you make it there is a greater chance you will fail Maybe instead of cups we use PVC pipes I mean they re that cheap and I mean they would hold longer than styrofoam cups Shhh too many people That s better quality I do agree with you Adam but I also do agree with Dylan and Ben on two different subjects Guys why don t we just make everything We can make the compost bin But if we make everything reusable bags Why don t we buy the vermicomposter and then we make the bags The reusable bags are more like for people to buy if they want to have an easy reusable bag And then the tools we might really need later on when we don t need the reusable bags We might need the tools or we said we might need to go buy this now and it might be too late already What s the major difference between the vermicomposter and the reusable bags Jessica what s the major difference between the two In vermicomposting it keeps reproducing there s three products While the reusable bags when you sell them once and that s all you get from that bag And with the vermicomposter it keeps going It s very unlikely almost impossible that all the worms are going to die in one night Plus why would you buy the bags if you can make them Cause my mom has a friend that makes her own bags out of store bags like Walmart and Target bags And she melts them down and puts them into a bag Why don t we buy the vermicomposter so it s a better quality and we make the bags They re easier It s very hard to find a perfect vermicomposter that s plastic and won t break Most of them are terracotta and they ll shatter if somebody knocks it over It s also wood and wood will start to absorb the smells of the compost and then it will start to smell bad How do you know we re going to do wood Compost things on the internet are using either terracotta or wood Terracotta shatters really easily Okay so we need to do more research on this I found a four tray bin that s plastic for 89 99 But still why would we pay 100 when we can pay For quality a mere 20 I know but the materials we use aren t made for composting Listen to Carly for a second What Carly Because if we do what Ben s mom s friend can do you could easily save more money like you do if you make the vermicomposter Do you think you could get your mom s friend to come in and teach us as a class on how to make our own like she already does I think we should buy the vermicomposter first like buy it or make it and then buy the reusable bags So just like Ben s mom s friend s bags But we should make them both because then we will still have some money left over to buy other things like tools Like a new aerator If we make the reusable bags we won t get to put our symbol on it which I think is part of the bag We re thinking about doing ovens Cause it s like one two three four five six If we made it we wouldn t have a guarantee that it would work because we could screw up the way we make it Or we could just mess it up in general But if we bought one it would be kind of guaranteed to work But sometimes we miss a part or a tool that we need to put it together How do you know that sometimes what experience do you have that sometimes all the parts aren t always there Because when we were making the other one and forgot one of the tools so we couldn t do one part of it And then it just all got all messed up It just threw us off So from your experience you know that sometimes when we order something we don t always get it This part is the leading thing right there it comes built All we have to do it put the plastic bars together and it will be kind of easy Cause it just like goes Yeah and you can work as a group to make it Because it s like those styrofoams where you pull it together And you can just see where it s put together the sticks Like the couplers on the sides So we have something to be proud of that we made Everybody said that we wanted a see through one so we could actually see the dirt And this one s not see through So if we made our own could we get a clear tote cause the worms don t like light So you can lift to look And the worms don t like light so when you look at it lift it up look at it and then put it back down That s a good idea No one else has thought about that Christian And how do you know that the worms don t like light Because we looked it up on the internet And then one time I was in my house and I saw a worm out in the street and it was kind of like rattling rattling in the sun So then my sister kicked it in back in the grass So then it was much happier and I re research that Okay but do we have to do vermicompost No we don t have to do it at all It s going to be our class We need to vote on what s going to be the best for the community What about reusable bags I think the reusable bags are And why How is the reusable bags different than what we re already doing If we sell the if the people next year sell them at the Holiday Boutique then if we sell compost then it would be the same customers And if we give the customer something different more people will come because they ll yeah and they need bags They could buy bags to put their stuff in that they buy And for backpacks and stuff for when they go grocery shopping they need something to put them in instead of just wasting all those plastic bag They could use the reusable bag I have an idea I think we should stick with our old compost in our tumbler And then we should get the bags And we should have the compost and the bags of compost tea And then they could buy the bags and they could buy the compost and they could have the compost tea in the bag and they could carry it so it s not that hard So we could use our bags as the packaging for the compost Yeah that s what I was thinking It s gonna cost extra And then make it just a bit more expensive cause then you get to keep the reusable bag and the compost You know if you put your money in the bank they give you money This would basically give you money because you can make the compost yeah the interest yeah So we can get the money from this and then we can buy the bags for the high level tea But that has no holes for the worms The sun is coming right into But would it fit in our room So we need to get more information on this Remember we were talking about the internet could be wrong about its size Yeah but normally they don t do false advertisement This is like in a this the bottom is like this size of a desk You could compare this to this vase or this container that they would put the plant in It s like a shower it s like the size of a shower Yeah you guys need more information We need more information before you can make a decision on that A lot of information on this already But we won t make tea if this one would have really worked cause it s made You know the more it costs the better it works Do you agree with his comment No Yeah that s what Cara said Can anyone give an example I don t agree with that because when I was real little I bought some toy cars and they didn t work as well as I got some that were cheaper And the cheaper ones worked better than the expensive ones Okay you guys continue discussing that 
 Okay Dylan what song will you be playing Playing B A and G Okay and line number Four Four okay Let s get your left hand on top Okay and whenever you re ready as soon as you start on the note B Give him a hand nice job You can have a seat Dylan thank you Okay Christopher I m doing number four playing the note A Playing the note A number four okay Left hand on top Christopher That s all Okay let s give him a hand Number four playing the note A Great Let s give him a hand Elise Number B playing number one Playing B number one okay great Make sure your left hand is on the top Okay that s your left hand and your right hand goes along alright whenever you re ready Let s give Elise a hand Playing the note B1 Okay Let s give Jessica a hand Dylan what are you playing Hot cross buns Okay go ahead whenever you re ready Let s give Dylan a hand Christopher what are you playing Hot cross buns Okay Okay Christopher try it one more time pressing your holes a little tighter From the beginning Thank you Christopher nice job give Christopher a hand Okay Drexel so what are you playing Hot cross buns Okay Let s give Drexel a hand nice job Okay now Elise what are you playing Hot cross buns Okay whenever you re ready Let s give Elise a hand nice job Hot cross buns Okay Jessica Okay Jessica try it one more time pressing your holes tighter and blowing really soft Yeah that middle part is where it gets tricky Jessica Let s try it one more time going from just the middle of the song and the four G s press tight and blow really gently There it is give her a hand Thank you everybody 
 Okay What s the next one Zach Jen you can put on a 50 line poem on that one here if you wanted to I got that You have Okay what was the main What was the summary What would be a good summary sentence Well they competed in a game known as the Memoriad Uh huh You guys had that one don t you You have the names and faces there That was great The game Are you doing the vocab though No Okay So wait hang on Should we do the pictures or the vocabulary words You can just do anything from that article The pictures were just to get you thinking about it That s why we did the words And the vocab was just to help us understand So it doesn t have to go off the vocab But the vocab kind of connects with an idea So it may kind of work out that way You ll have to let Zach see because you took what he had which is great and you added to it Do we put the name of the movie I m doing It s a song The croak part is a song Mm hmm that was part of the Okay I was getting There there s the song I was stuck on the reading one too Got one left Zach what s the text structure Sharpening his pencil Just go like that So was the Puppet in 1970 Or was it Yep 1970 That must have been old 1968 is when the Yellow Submarine came out Yep All right Do you guys want to put your pyramid up there Zach do you want to help do that Do you agree that he was right on the text structure Yeah See if you can build it I tried to size it just about right as close as I could get So it should fit in there pretty good I don t think it s sized up very well What I just got it as close as I could Zach It may not be 100 perfect And then the person that didn t read the story can read us what you guys put for your answers That means we got to do another one You each got a chance to read Yeah that s the tone one We need one more detail Did I make it a little too big or is it pretty close It s a little long Could be a little long huh Had a little extra at the bottom Next time I ll shrink it up just a little bit We still have one more That s fine And who read it Was it Zach We ll let Zach read those when the girls get done Okay Do I read the summary Do you just want me to read I don t know if he knows Start with the details Memoriad is an unforgettable competition Memoriad games is memorize 50 line poems People compete in the games called Memoriad The game is to memorize it Memorize names and faces and memorize a 50 line poem Very good And what was your text structure Description Description because they were describing all about He just talked He did the talking you did the writing Somebody gave you ideas Kinda maybe It was a good partnership The girls are just about done We ll let them read theirs And then we ll do our Jeopardy Can we tape the Jeopardy game Mm hmm yep We have the same people in Jeopardy that were in here Yes it is the same group Okay let s not have a sword fight right now She has one more task there She s got it all grammatically correct Okay Let s just Judy over here Do you mind if it s off to the side There s another one There s two of them Oh did it fall off Well we can put a little piece of tape over it Oh here it is There you go that should hold it up good All right see if you agree with what the girls have here Are you listening Zach Got a pyramid all set up Our text structure is wait do I start at the bottom Start at the bottom and the details kind of add to the summary The movie they were talking about was the Yellow Submarine starring Is it starring or staring Starring I bet Starring the Beatles The Beatles okay Their song called Being Green was made in 1970 Summary the television was made in 1953 Kermit was in 1970 Stoplight was made in 1920 They all had one thing in common They were in a color Very good I love that last sentence They all have that in common they re in color Text structure is sequence Sequence because It tells the order of them All the years very good Okay one of you guys go grab a marker board one from each team And I ll go get Jeopardy And you ll need a marker to write on the marker board I will pull the screen down All right Zach Zach Where are the markers You can grab one back there There s one up here As long as you got one or two for your group you can take turns Now these questions I think will flow pretty well today Whoa I can t even see it I think the yellow is better I know with the lights on it s a little harder but it helps to have the lights on Did we run review What Did we run review Text structure My music didn t come on Confucius says Vocab Text features Features Thank you Zach Yes they re different Confucius says Yeah Okay who started first last time Was it the guys Yeah Okay we ll let the gals start today So do I do text structure Oh you re gonna win Text structure 500 Text structure 500 Yeah what s the Confucius Says We had done these little matching things way back at the beginning of the year when we did this unit they were little sayings and you decide just which text structure they go with So that might go with text structure Yes it ll be a text structure question yeah Is that what you guys wanted was text structure right Yeah Okay In our state dams have been built Zach on many rivers These dams are used to product electricity we need But they also create problems Scoot your chair closer to your partner Scoot your chair back Prevents the other wildlife near the rivers Therefore we should not build any more dams Instead we should use solar energy or energy from the sun to produce electricity This will help us protect our wildlife and enjoy the natural beauty around us Hmm which of the five text structures We think it s problem solution Problem solution correct Give yourself 500 points Because it said problem in there All right what would the guys like Hey Sorry Zach what do you want They did text structure 500 It ll pop up yellow after I click on the next one Vocab for 500 Vocab for 500 Want to read that one Zach You should take some time to ponder the question before writing your response Hmm what does ponder mean You think Ahh perfect To think about Give yourself 500 points All right what would the gals like Should we try the Confucius question Yeah For 500 Okay Confucius says for 500 And Marissa can read this one Confucius says A beautiful sunset is treasure for the eyes This is one of the five text structures Description Yeah description Description very good And I ll just set these out I got something that might help you guys since a lot of these have them you just kind of have your choices right there What would the guys like Very good Text features Text features 500 Text features 500 Which text feature is an alphabetical listing of subjects people and places you find in a book Index table of contents title What do you guys think Alphabetical listing What do you think Zach Index Index Index would be correct Good job guys What would the gals like Oh 500 Yeah I just did that 500 Should we text features for 400 400 okay All right Judy can read this one What text feature gives definition for vocabulary words Wait what is it Wait Yeah what do you mean for that Oh I didn t that one doesn t have the choices like the other one did It would be an index a glossary or a title Glossary Glossary is correct I put the choices on the other ones I just must have missed that one Very good All right Confucius says for 400 Confucius says for 400 Could you go for Mrs Lloyd s for just a couple minutes Okay I wanna go tell Mr Debush That s all right I ll just get you guys a pass here in just a second We ll do a couple more questions here All right whose turn to read It s Zach s Zach s turn Okay Confucius say First feed the lion then enter cage Hmm Sequence Sequence Do you agree with him Yeah Yes very good Sequence All right what would the gals like What one did they do They just did the Confucius says for 400 I want to do that one for 400 or for 300 right I think yeah Confucius says 300 Okay Yeah Okay all right Oh man basketball Whose turn to read Confucius says Net in soccer is much larger than net in basketball Compare and Yeah compare and contrast Very good All right so they did this one Zach What would you guys like You want to do vocab for 400 Vocab for 400 Yeah vocab Vocab for 400 Okay Many professional golfers first began playing as amateurs Very good Just a second What do you think First players Okay the first players You re exactly right Oh my gosh People who have done something for the first time and they don t get paid They re amateurs All right what would the gals like They did vocab Structure Yeah Structure 400 Yeah They want the big point ones Is it my turn Yeah I think so Living in the country is very different than living in the city A city dweller need to be careful of traffic and other people In the country there are fewer cars and people In the city many people can walk to the movies stores and other activities In the country people must drive to get to places Compare and contrast Yeah Compare and contrast And she agrees Very good All right what would the guys like What do you want Zach Vocab for 300 Vocab for 300 Oh it s your turn Zach I depleted my savings when I bought my new basketball shoes What do you think Hmm what do you think One for depleted Oh I know this one Drained Drained yep Empty gone you used all your savings And basketball shoes can cost a lot of money so I can see that happening What would the gals like Confucius oh wait no no no Did they do text structure 300 Nope he just did the vocab Okay I want to do text structure for 300 Features for 300 No text structure Oh text structure I can go back Structure for 300 The eye is made up of many parts The white part of the eye is called the Sclera sclera and the colored part is called the iris The iris comes in many colors including brown blue green and hazel The iris is covered with the cornea which is clear and round Description Do you agree Yeah I should know about the eye because my stepmom s a she works at the eye company Wait did we just pass text features Oh she does They just 
 Our goal is to find the answers to your questions so we can fill this column what I learned in the KWL chart Okay So that s our goal Our goal is to find the answers to draw a conclusion to our month long experiment Before we do that why don t we take another measurement I would like you to measure your plant if you have any And I would like you to count the number of leaves on your plant on one of them Go ahead Scientists take your ruler Take your ruler and measure I like the way some of you are holding your rulers It s great that you put the lower number down when you measure Great If it helps you can pick up your plant Okay After you have your measurement and the number of leaves make sure you count the numbers the leaves too you may put your plant down After you put your plant down I know you are ready to continue Could you touch your head with your empty hands Good job John Touch your head with your empty hands Wonderful I see that you re ready right Katie Put your hands down I also took pictures of your experiment Your pictures will serve as data That means the information you collected This group picture were from the people who conducted the experiment to see if seeds would grow with soil water and sunlight Sunlight We have air all around us so we all have air I would like you to use good listening ears Day one Day 11 That s what it looked like Day 18 day 24 and day 32 We even have a ruler here a primary ruler that s easy for kindergartners to use Now looking at the data and your pictures What do you think the conclusion is if you did this experiment If you planted the seeds you planted your seeds with soil water and sunlight could you please raise your hand Good we have some eager participants Could you please come up here with your experiment and a ruler and explain to us My experiment was if plants will grow with sun soil and water and I put them near the windowsill Why did you put your cup near the windowsill To get some sunlight So your seeds received sunlight Did you water your seeds Yes I did Okay And you did put soil Yes in the cup Okay What do you think your conclusion is If plants will grow in sun soil and water And what is your answer Um Did your seeds grow Yes Did you take a measurement Yeah May we see how tall they are How tall are they One inch Did you see how Kieran measured his plants He has the end with the lower number touching the base of the plant That s good scientist Now how many leaves do you have on some of them Four leaves And how many did you have last week Two Two So what do you think is happening They re growing They re growing because you have more Leaves Wonderful Great job scientist And now let s look at the next experiment boys and girls This one is planting seeds without water Did seeds or plants grow without water I would like you to look at the data This is your data just in case you don t remember Sometimes we don t remember what we did but pictures help us Day one day 11 day 18 day 24 day 32 Hmmm I wonder what the conclusion is Oh John you want to come up and share Great Take your experiment and your ruler And I really love the way Thalia listened My experiment was if plants will grow without water And I put sun soil I gave it sun and I put soil and I never gave it water How did you give it sunlight I put it by the windowsill Okay so what is your conclusion My conclusion is plants will grow without water Will grow or won t grow Won t grow Very good Thank you Thank you very much young scientist Great job And let s look at the next experiment Did seeds grow without soil Here s day one Again scientists look at the smart board Day 11 day 18 and day 32 Now who did this experiment We would like you come on up Rachel Bring up your experiment and tell us all about it I did an experiment if seeds will grow without soil And I put seeds water in it and I put it by the window And I gave it sun And they didn t grow What did you not use Soil You did not use soil And where are your seeds By the window They re in your cup right now In my cup Uh huh Would you mind showing the class what you have there Tilt it down Boys and girls take a peek This is what Rachel s seeds I can t see Okay So now what is your conclusion Rachel Seeds won t grow without soil Very good Thank you scientist We have nothing to measure in Rachel s cup And the last one Oh boys and girls this is a very interesting one I really would like you to look up here Look at the data first Did seeds or plants grow without sunlight A lot of your cups were by the window so that they received sunlight But look at this one Day one Do you have anything No No Day 11 No Day 18 look at the number Look at the numbers on the ruler Day 24 I want you to look at your data And day 32 Well that s some interesting experiment I know some of you did this one Quite a number of children If you did that experiment and you would like to come up and talk nicely and loudly Juliana would you please come up with your plant and your ruler if you would like Come on up Okay John you re going to show Juliana what a good listener you are okay Go ahead buddy I planted seeds without sun And I put them in the closet Did you cover your seeds with soil Yes So your seeds have soil Soil You watered them Watered them Every week you watered them And And no sun And you did not give them any sunlight because you put them in The closet In the closet and the closet has no Sun Has no sunlight It has no windows Right John Now Juliana tell the class if you ever had any sprouts I did have sprouts And what do you think happened They died How tall were your sprouts at one point One inch One inch and why do you think they died Because they had no sun And do you think the sun is important for plants to grow So what is your conclusion No seeds won t grow without sun Very good Good job scientist You may go back Now boys and girls I m going to ask you to think about your experiment Think about what your question was What you wanted to find out And the steps you took to do your experiment And you are going to turn to your partner and ask your partner what they wanted to find out You may say What was your question Or What do you want to find out And here s a big question mark And after your partner answers then you may ask What did you do What steps did you take And at the end we will like you to ask your partner What is your answer How did you know that s the answer They have to tell you their evidence what they used to tell you the answer Okay now turn to your partner and talk to each other Remember how we work as partners What did you find out What was your question My question was Take turns Gabby take turns Boys and girls let s take 30 more seconds If you need to use your plants as your evidence feel free Okay boys and girls turn around Please put your hands on your lap so I can see your empty hands Alright Let s look at the answers again Our whole experiment and let s look at the questions Will seeds grow without water What do you think No If you don t think seeds will grow without water shake your head Great Cameron will seeds grow without water No No good Okay next question Will seeds grow without sunlight No Let me see you touch your ears if you don t think seeds will grow without sunlight Okay let s see Will they Cameron No Touch your ears so I know you understand Next one will seeds grow without soil Yes or no Yes No Will seeds grow without soil NO No Touch the ground touch the rug Okay great The last question Katie is will seeds grow with water sun and soil Yes Good Then make some rain drops Make the sun and form a cup to hold your soil 
 Tyler pushed the ball Okay well how does that how does that affect the ball It makes it go faster And make it fall So why is that a problem Because she ran because she because she pushed it I know but why is it a problem that she pushed it Because it goes faster And that s a problem because Because why She didn t win Oh what do you mean win She win the game Oh did you all make a game out of it Uh uh we didn t turn a game into it Okay well what are you doing then He s playing a game what are you doing Kylie He s rolling and see not playing a game Just rolling and seeing where they go Wait a minute what Rolling them to see what How many sticks it takes So did you push all of them or are you all taking turns doing each one Taking turns Oh okay So do you think that to find out really how far they go everyone either needs to push them or everyone needs to not push them Not push them So is that what you re saying it wouldn t be fair if she pushes hers but no one else pushes theirs Because pushing makes it go faster you said Okay Alright so it makes it what Makes it go farther okay Alright so do you wanna do you want was anybody else pushing theirs Rebekah Okay do you want Rebekah and Kylie to do theirs over again Alright show them how you and Todd did yours so that everybody can do theirs the same Now I guess I m gonna have to get our ball I need ball number two We need a Captain Miss Henderson can I be the Captain We don t need a Captain You re all doing what you re being what We re not being Captain s we re being what Scientists Scientists So work together Wait don t pick up her ball She hasn t measured it yet Five six seven eight nine 10 11 21 sticks Where is 21 You looking for it on the hundreds chart Are you looking for it on the calendar You can get up and point to it I got 18 sticks for my ball I can t find it anywhere 18 sticks I m going to see how many sticks I got for my ball Okay how would you find 21 on the chart I don t know Where could you start By one Okay 20 Oh you found it Do you need more sticks honey 17 yes Okay go ask another group can you borrow some sticks Another ball 12 So it takes half of 14 Because she said No I m using it And she and I said I have a idea and she said no What was your idea John I was just trying do it on my head like on my back of my head then down Use your head as a ramp Uh huh And where did you have the ball hun In her pocket the whole time Why Em Does the ball belong to you or to the group Group So if you re not using it should you let someone else in the group use it Okay go ahead Roll it on my back And now roll it If it does it Right here No I mean like right here Where do you want them to where do you want them to start the ball I think is what they re asking In my head somewhere like right here Because a ramp starts where On the top Up high And goes down So if you re using his head I would lay like this Oh Did that work Yeah What do we do with it after we do our balls Okay you can just keep experimenting with the balls and the ramps and we re gonna clean up in just a second Put your name at the top of your paper please We used it on this one You re supposed to do all four of the balls Ball number one ball number two ball number three ball number four We would do ball number three Number one is this one How about number one But this one Which number is that one So get number three we ll have a race and we ll So what are you all doing with the ramp now We re putting it on the chair And whoever gets it whoever gets down to the bottom first We were actually gonna roll off it Well why won t it roll off that ramp Because why What stops it The block The block stops it okay So How much does it go Try the little one Whoever is in front of me move I got 10 Miss Henderson everybody is taking our balls Okay guys I would like for you to clean up your things please I saw some great science learning science work put everything back in your basket and then please meet me on the rug Put your paper at your seat Quickly Let s see how quickly we can clean up Id like for you to come to the rug and share some things you ve learned John you have to put everything back in your basket buddy All the sticks and balls please And then you may put your basket on the art table Thank you to everybody who s moving quickly Thank you to everybody who s moving quickly Okay let s come to the rug and let s share some things that you learned today Move that way please I said put your paper at your seat for now Miss Henderson Braxton said this isn t whistling Okay well we re not gonna debate whistling right now Okay thanks so much for everybody coming back to the rug Okay I would like to know who learned something about balls or ramps or forces in your science work today Tell us something you did something you figured out Bryson If you push the ball it goes farther If you don t push the ball it goes not farther Okay alright Who else learned something else through their science work John That when you put like a stick in front of it and then you put another ball in front of it and then like you roll the ball and see how much it goes And then you try another ball and see like if it gets to the stick and if it doesn t get to the stick then it gets farther and and we tried whoever gets to the stick It goes it s the same height then we just rolled it and then the green ball got the farthest Okay the green okay Todd what s something you learned today through your science work If you push it it ll go farther and that s it Okay alright anything else we haven t mentioned Eli There s a block in front of it and if you move the block a little it it will go past it If you make a ball if you make a block go all the way across it and you have a big ball it might bounce across it or it might stop So the block stopped it sometimes Yes Sometimes the ball was going fast enough to jump over it Yeah But sometimes it stopped it Okay Grayson Well sometimes what I did was I kinda put the ramp like that and a little block across and then I was rolling this big ball and once it hit it it kinda like jumped up in the air and went Harleigh And moved in And for like three blocks for three sticks Okay Preston what did you learn today If you like if your hand go fast the ball goes fast If your hand goes slow the ball goes slow If your hand goes fast what do you mean by if your hand goes fast Like if you re at the bottom and and you do that And go like that it goes fast What is that called that you re doing Pushing the thing So if you push the ball fast it goes fast and if you push it slow it goes slow The force Interesting The force of pushing okay Chloe I learned that when you lay it diagonal it goes When you lay what diagonal What is it called again What A diagonal line When you lay it down diagonal it goes down faster What is she talking about Eli the what She s talking about a ramp Oh the ramp when you lay the ramp diagonal Uh huh The ball goes fast When you lay it straight it doesn t go fast it just sits there Oh so if it s if it s less If it s a lower ramp it goes less If it s a higher diagonal ramp you re talking about then it goes farther Interesting Brody We tried it with our heads like down and the ball goes down like that So you made you made ramps with your bodies So did it go 
 What It s a dark color So what does that mean We think the sun might hit it or light might hit it faster so it might melt faster Keegan how are you going to figure out how much it weighs Maybe it will melt faster because the water What about that explain your thinking Because You ve stolen her even Now we got to count it One two No now you re taking them all Three we got to count four five six Here Seven eight nine 10 11 12 Freeze for just one second Let s switch and have the boys keep on You stopped at 20 Boys finish counting They stopped at 20 finish counting 21 22 23 24 But they re not counting they re just putting it in It s not working They re just putting it in in the same time So freeze gentlemen So how do you think you could fix that Put it back in You might want to try to remeasure Definitely want to Miss T look Guys we need to take a bunch of it out because it s not really getting weighed You might need to use something heavier Oh remember you re not supposed to touch that nob on the back That s not how you how would you figure out how to weigh it What happened What s going on Daniel Tell me what the problem is It has too much oh sorry It has too much water in it Yeah Well can we change that scientists No What can we change We can take out a lot It s too heavy It was reaching on that side Six halves This is heavier Wait say that again Brayden What did I just hear you say I said it s heavier This is heavier than the blocks so we put more in Oh Yeah we re going to put more in Oh way too much way too much Whoa look Uh uh Ms Teacher Ms T I think it s six and a half What is six and a half The measure Oh is that your predication that s your what That s my hypothesis Oh how are you going to find out if it s true What do we do Can you maybe explain to Teagan what she needs to do Just balance it They re like working on it There we go got it Got it Daniel what were you saying We were going to like We just figured out how much blocks it weighs Hang on it ll get there So what did you discover We discovered we had we discovered we had to take We had to take one two three four of the blocks out Five Five of the blocks out to make it weigh So how much does it weigh So let me count the blocks One two three four Do you want me to hold the balloon so it doesn t fall Five six seven eight nine ten How many does it weigh Okay I ll start wearing this I mean I ll start writing it No I got it What are you doing there Abigail Well I m weighing and it s not showing up yet What are you using that tool for What tool This tool To see how cold it is So did you already weigh it We have to hold it from the top Oh so do you think it s going to weigh more now that you taped that to it What s your prediction with that Do you have a prediction I have a prediction that it might be really cold And that s going to tell you that But have you weighed yours yet No And it s going to turn to ice So but should you keep that thermometer on it while you weigh it or do you think it ll change how much it weighs I think it will actually change how much it weighs Can you explain your thinking Because because the thermometer is heavy too and it would change how much One pound it was so we should probably get the thermometer One pound So we can so we can so we can weigh it and then we can put it back on My hypothesis is it s going to be 20 degrees My hypothesis is this is going to change it because it s only one pound Oh so what are you going to do to test that Weigh it Okay Put it here put it here Oh are you guys discussing What are you guys discussing Where we are going to put our balloons So first talk to me about your balloon Why did you choose this color Because it was a light color and we think it might melt faster We will think it will melt slower We think it will melt slower Why Because Because it s a light color The sun is attracted to the dark colors so that s why we picked pink So what are you doing right now Doing a hypothesis Oh can you explain what s your hypothesis Teagan It will be warm because we re going to put it next to the heater That s what I was going to say too And so what s your hypothesis How will that change the balloon Because maybe you said we re going to put it in the freezer and then when we take it out we ll put it in the heater and we think it ll melt faster Okay What about us It s almost in the middle take out one more Now I m going to count What were you guys just doing down there She was thinking about the weight What does that mean Like in the middle Okay so how will you figure out how much it weighs We need to take this out and we ll count them and then we ll write it on the paper 32 32 12 13 14 Brayden Brayden Hi Hayden Is there any group that s measuring the length of their s 28 29 30 31 32 Almost there 43 44 45 46 47 It s there it s there What does that mean So it means that they weigh the same thing Okay Now we have to count them Let s let Will only do it Two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 64 64 Teagan be working in your group 23 24 25 I measured my balloon by using tiles like tiles when I measured it Tiles What should we do now Mrs T My balloon is filled with matter Why do you say that Because everything is matter Well there s water inside the balloon so it s like solid and liquid Why is it solid and liquid What were you saying What were you saying No keep explaining your thinking I have a question One second Water is a liquid and pushes on the weight Oh so is that kind of tying in to your hypothesis Light turns into water solids and liquids My hypothesis is my hypothesis is if we like if we If we lose the like point it will not melt faster Why It s a darker color And when you think about it dark colors will melt faster on their own Is that cubes the has the cubes No that s the weight Pass it on Have you all measured yours yet Yes How d you measure it With the tape thingy Would you mind showing me what you decide to do My hypothesis is that it will melt faster because we re putting it by the sun Did you make a hypothesis by the length of it No Ours was six and a half inches How do you know Because we measured it with the measuring tape Can you show me how you did it Oh there s an extra one Will Did you say not to touch the balloon without the thermometer Now do we draw a picture of what it looks like right now These have bigger numbers you know So what are you thinking there Abigail I m thinking that not really But what were you saying there with the bigger numbers I didn t understand You held up the number line and you said those have bigger numbers I mean like you can see them very well and you also can tell 30 30 30 he should start now So how big is your balloon We got to start at one Oh why did you change it Julia from your first measurement Because we accidentally started from the 30 Oh And now we have it upside down Okay you got it It was it is move your finger for me It is Now let s send this back here Okay I think we should do my idea for taking that thermometer off Yeah Yeah I ll hold the thermometer I m trying to take it off My hypothesis is it s going to be warm but then not attracted to the light Cold water is in there Because sunlight can only make warmth Right 
 Anybody tell me how much cases usually run At Radio Shack they re 30 dollars Okay you know what So we ll factor that in in a minute But Alex you had your hand raised So I d like to hear from you I was just gonna say that the 199 tax is gonna come in anyway so What if you got a deal about it that paid the tax and shipping Okay hold up Cynthia But even though Even though if you use 12 you re only gonna have a couple dollars left over With the economy these days things are not cheap So you can t buy something with five dollars You re not gonna get a case for that cheap That s probably right I m gonna hear two more of you and then I have something I wanna drop into this conversation that several of you talked about and I think is really important to point out So I wanna hear what you two have to say and then I m gonna go back to something several of you kinda mentioned Go ahead It s better to have more money than less money because if you exactly calculate it to then you d still have zero dollars left but it s better to have equal or more money Okay that s you know I think you re right That seems like it just makes sense right And one more yeah Actually when I bought my phone I got a case just for about five dollars on ebay Ebay so you got a used one And it paid for shipping so I didn t yes I did Okay well you know what I wanna talk about that because that s actually what you guys just said is really important and several of you others mentioned it Maybe we don t want maybe I don t want to have the exactly the price maybe I want to have at least And if I say I wanna have at least 200 dollars is there a way to say at least with math symbols To make that equation change so it says least Cause right now it says equal Is there a way to do it so it says at least Colin If you you need to get the iPhone and the case in the same shipping order or else it s gonna cost more for shipping Oh okay So yeah I need at least a certain amount Yeah So you re gonna Wanna jump in on that guys You need to put the greater than or equal to sign But what does that look like The greater than sign with a line under it Okay And what s the word in English that we have for that symbol Yeah say it again Alexis That least It is So now how much do I need to save to get at least 200 dollars right So it s okay if I have exactly or more than So that kinda talks about what you guys are talking about Maybe I need more money if she wants more more than just a phone I m sure she does right With the What about the just come with the phone Just that or does it come with something else Like a Charger battery or even a case itself So again you re saying I need at least 200 dollars right Depending on what comes with the phone like a Christmas special Like half off or something What you can Also think is where you gonna buy it And where is there s no tax and stuff So it depends on where you re gonna buy it If you want no tax that means like on Ebay or something but It might be 50 percent off and stuff like that Okay interesting I m just saying it depends where you re gonna buy your phone Okay no I like that a lot When I was doing my equation I got 121 So you would still have a dollar left over And you know how Cassidy said that she can get it on Ebay that much Most people they I understand that it s cheap and most people want it like that but I bought stuff off the line before and some of the stuff does work good and some of em you drop them and it breaks So it s not always good Somethin to pay attention to All right I m gonna change the conversation a little bit because I think you guys are doing really really well Let s go with what you guys said and say I need at least 200 dollars If that s true is there any way to find out or to answer the original question which Nick brought up How much money do I need to save each day based on what we have so far Where do I go from here There is a way to solve it You grab 200 dollars and then you subtract 80 from it Okay I m gonna stop you right there I don t mean to interrupt Katherine you re watching this and I saw your paper what do you think about what Najeem just said Like Okay and why is that I don t know That s how you solve it in equality Okay so can you repeat what you said You subtract 80 from both sides Okay I m gonna go ahead and do that right now And what does that leave us with 120 And you know what I have a question What does that 120 represent I mean if 200 is how much the phone costs what s 120 about I m not sure How much you need to raise until then Okay okay And Nayanna Can you comment on what you think might be the next step Divide 12 from 120 Again Divide 12 from 120 Okay And somebody else jump in The answer was The answer would be 10 because 12 and 120 equals 10 Okay and Katie you were ready to say something What would you say I was about to say Equals 10 X equals 10 and X equals at least 10 Oh it was so you re not liking what I wrote over here Alexis At least cause you have to keep the all the way down Okay Katherine what do you think I agree with Alexis because it can t just like change because When you say it can t change what do you mean the side Oh Okay that s good I didn t know what it was I m just asking And then you have to put what X means Oh Oh Oh so what is the label What are the units we re talkin about Ah the blue tooth If you wanna have a little extra money you could have more and plus if you get a little extra money one day but you have the same another and you get a little less the next day you could raise up for another day Oh like if I m going to collect cans and I don t collect as many cans one day but I collect extra the next day Yeah like that Nayanna you had your hand raised When you have to add 40 to 200 for the Bluetooth Ah that s an interesting idea So maybe we so tell me what to write Instead of this how would you change this to incorporate what you just said 80 plus X equals 240 Okay are you pleased are you okay with that I disagree Cynthia I disagree with your answer on that one I don t agree that it s 10 because if like they were saying earlier if you wanted some extra money you would You should You should do 11 for a day because if you do you ll get 132 and then you ll have extra money Okay But that s the problem What do you mean when you say it s not asking Well it s not asking for extra money or anything it s just asking how many How much money you need per day Anthony I noticed you ve got some stuff written down What do you think about I wanna go back to what Nayanna said She says she s gonna change the equation here and she put 240 up there why Why did she do that and do you agree with that Yeah cause then you would have a little extra money left A little bit You would have a little bit of extra money left Okay like the Bluetooth in the case maybe Okay Isn t this another problem Another problem not a part of this one yet Yeah cause they re not asking how much extra money do you need This problem this question s not asking how much extra do you need for a Bluetooth also Okay How much are the phone and Bluetooth it s just asking for the phone Okay I think because The question wasn t asking to bring extra money into it We just brought the extra money to round the make the equation easier and round the and extra money is okay but we shouldn t change the equation Cause it s not asking you to Okay This question isn t saying anything about case or a Bluetooth yet it s a yes question And this question talks about Bluetooth Okay so what I kinda like is you guys were doin this problem and a couple of ya jumped ahead to this problem which is no problem at all Let s jump ahead just for a minute and assume that I did want to get the Bluetooth Would this be the equation to represent And before I answer this question what I would like to do I m gonna call on Olivia and then I m gonna have everybody switch so the pilots go back to the co pilots and the pilots come up but not yet Let s hear what Olivia has to say Would it be equals 12 X if you wanted to get it before Christmas Or would it be after One more time I could barely hear ya Would we still get that before Christmas or would it be after Before before So would it be 12 Comments on that I agree with that Thumbs up if you think 12 thumbs down if you think no we don t need 12 on this one Okay Adrian you have something We need to know how much money you earned each day Well that s What do you guys think about that question Well that s what we re finding out right now I know but how much you earn That s how much he has to save Pilots switch with somebody in the back All right here we go So now I have a question for you Can everybody turn around for just a minute please Thank you Question for you If I wanted to graph our first solution on a number line what might that graph look like So will you guys agree that okay we need to earn a minimum amount And at least 10 dollars a day but if I wanted to graph that put that on a number line represent that graphically what would that look like It would be like a It would be But the circle What kind of circle I didn t hear you Shaded So you want to put this up here Yeah Amarra I d like to hear your opinion on that I don t I never understood the shaded thing I don t know why it s shaded It s shaded because it s not I think if it s not shaded it means greater than I mean greater or less than But when it s shaded I think It means equal to or less than or With Okay Tara do you wanna contribute to that Well whenever it says greater than or equal to the dotted means it could be 10 because it could be equal to or greater than which is over 10 But greater than or less than can t be that number so it has to be open circle And than greater than or equal to Anybody have an example of a problem or words that we would use to put an open circle unshaded circle In real life what might we say for something to represent an unshaded circle Go ahead Al Fewer than 14 students have mechanical pencils A little louder I got fewer than 14 students have mechanical pencils So in that problem could 14 students have mechanical pencils if you have fewer than 14 No So that would be unshaded Cause 14 doesn t count So in this question Amarra the least number of money I should save per day is how much I think 10 is a good answer because it does go into the number And so would be shaded or unshaded Shaded Oh is that the only number amount of money I should save each day Is that it Are their other possibilities out Yeah you could do
