 This is a classroom where I push in for language arts This is a morning meeting area and this is also the area where any whole group instruction would take place Over here is the area that the assistant sits and works with children and does phonemic awareness activities Here is a word wall and where the students keep their folders with their reading books in it their book boxes Here is where the classroom teacher does word study This is the independent work station And here is where I sit and I m responsible for the reading instruction This is where the guided reading groups meet This is a little reading area over here Where the students can do some independent reading You know what Jane told me to do that I liked also Looking at the word and chunking are good things to do Jane said go back and reread and make sure it sounds right and makes sense And that s something Jesus I want us to start practicing a little more When we get to a word that tricks us Put the book flat Sarah please We want to go back and reread and check and make sure it makes sense Okay here s something else I want us to do today with this book Rascal I want us to think about what happened in the story today And we re going to do it this way I want all eyes up here We re gonna use this wipe board It s a big wipe board It is and you have a little one And you will probably get a chance to use it too But first I m gonna write on the big one Okay The first word up here Jesus I m gonna ask you to help me read it I m gonna chunk it because you know the first part of this word Child Some Okay Jesus is gonna help us Okay Jesus go ahead and help me read this word Some Can you try body Somebody good job You see how he broke that into chunks Do you see that Jane Somebody Let s think about the story Hands down I want you to think about the question before you put your hand up Somebody Somebody s in the story Who is the somebody Who is this story mostly about Kelly s gonna help us Kelly who s this story mostly about Put your hand down Sarah I think is Josie s taking Rascal to the vet You re right Josie s taking Rascal to the vet So who are we talking about in the story Are we talking mostly about Rascal or are we talking mostly about the vet Hands down let her think She ll ask for help if she needs it Who do you think the story s mostly about Um Rascal Rascal I agree Thumbs up if you agree Thumbs up if you agree Sarah do you agree I agree do you agree You do I see a thumbs up Okay So what did you want to say about the title of the story Maybe the story was mostly about Rascal because the title Jackie did you hear what Sarah said She said that s some good thinking Sarah She said she also knew it was mostly about Rascal because the title was in it I knew it was mostly about Rascal because I read the story and they talked about Rascal a lot in the story Rascal Rascal Okay Rascal s in the story Alright Rascal now there s a problem At the very beginning of the story and I m gonna go back in the book and look and see what it is Sarah what s a problem in the very beginning of the story I read the words and it said he didn t want to go in the door to see the vet He didn t want to go to the vet Why do you think he didn t want to go to the vet Jackie How come Why do you think Rascal didn t want to go to the doctor Let s listen to what Jackie says Cause he s scared He s scared How did you know that he s scared Jackie I agree How did you know that Because the picture shows he s looking like he s upset or sad And I like how Sarah said she read in the story Eddie she read that he didn t want to go to the vet Turn the page I see other things happening I m gonna ask you about that in a minute Okay so somebody is Rascal And Rascal the problem is he didn t want to go Rascal didn t want you know what Kelly come up here and help me write Cause you can write the rest of what I m gonna write Come up here Didn t Oh I m gonna do the want part Didn t want Rereading helps me think about what I want to write Rascal didn t want what To go Can you write to go Don t forget to space Rascal didn t want to go to let s have a bigger space Rascal didn t want to go to the I like how you re all looking to see You re good that s fine Just keep going Good thank you Rascal didn t want to go to the Who wants to try vet Sarah you want to try That s a word we haven t written before But I know that she can think about the sounds in it and I bet you she can do it Good job Thank you Sarah Okay Rascal didn t want to go to the vet But but what Eddie but what He didn t want to go But He went and he was scaring the animals Oh my goodness Rascal didn t want to go to the vet but he went anyway and scared the animals Hold on a minute Jane cause I know you re gonna help me But he went anyway Hold on one second then you can tell me and scared should we say I m thinking about how this should sound I m thinking about what happened in the story but he went anyway and scared the other animals or other animals or the animals He did scare cats who else did he scare the mouse Can I have a quiet hand for someone else He scared the cat the mouse Jackie who else did he We can always let Jackie help Let Jackie help let s look Jackie let s go back and look And you re looking at the pictures Jackie s gonna help us Jackie I see the cat that Jane said What other animal do you see in the picture that he scared the parrot and the rabbit Oh okay the parrot and the rabbit Okay he went anyway and scared a rabbit I m gonna put this mark here cause I have a couple things I m saying a cat and I don t have room here so I need to erase this word so I have room to keep writing He went anyway and scared a rabbit a cat and what s the last thing I need to say Kelly And a what Parrot Parrot And I wanted to say Okay what did you want to say I want to say that I really know about these I know their names they call commas You re right thank you Kelly helped me because I didn t say what these were called She reminded us that those are called commas Thank you Kelly Okay one moment Jane I want us to think about the story and I want us to think about what s happening Rascal didn t want to go to the vet but he went anyway and scared a rabbit a cat and a parrot So we have a big problem we need to find a solution We need to find a solution What is our solution to the problem Sarah Can you sit on your bottom so you don t fall and hurt yourself my solution is that at the end of the story right here he goes in to the vet so he doesn t scare the other animals Okay I like how all of you went back to check the solution and you went back in the story to help you understand what happened Jane I like what Sarah said and I m thinking about how I can write that Sarah was looking at this page and she saw how he went into the vet and now he won t scare the other animals Okay Can I read this page Yes and in fact Jane wants to read it and she s gonna I want all of us to read it with our eyes because I want us to listen to how that sounds with those dark parts the author said Go ahead Jane are you ready I love how that sounded and I saw you were practicing that too Kelly Let s all practice that to ourselves The big dog growled grrrrr Rascal ran Jesus how did she know How did Jane know to say Rascal ran How did she know to read it like that The author wrote it in dark and big He wrote it in dark and big he sure did And he said something else Eddie that I want you to look at He wrote it dark and big and what else did he put there at the end Remember what that mark s called It s a big fancy long word That s okay Sarah s gonna help us This mark right here Eddie is what we re talking about Comma Nope but it looks Somebody that s talking Yes and when they re loud go ahead Sarah An exclamation mark Yeah That word is a very long word and it s new to us Eddie so we re learning it Do you wanna try and say it after me Exclamation mark yeah That shows they re excited You mean this Yeah Oh I though you were this Oh well no wonder I was tricking you by accident I m so sorry Eddie Yes I was talking about the exclamation mark Okay Rascal didn t want to go to the vet but he went anyway and scared a rabbit a cat and a parrot And so the end of the story should say that it s a solution Sarah was He ran into the vet What made him Why did he run Because he was scared Of what the dog Jesus did you hear what Sarah said So let s think about that But but he saw a what Big dog Come over here and help me write Me and Jesus are gonna write this together Come on over here Jesus Lemme move this out of your way I m sorry Okay go over here And turn around so everyone can read come over by me But he you can write the word he Go ahead Write it under here Thank you Now I m gonna help you give me the marker Jackie I need you to look over here so you can help us if we need it Go stand over here for a second But he oops he saw you go ahead a a what He saw a what Jackie he saw a what A big dog A big dog And those are words you know go ahead Now come down here so we don t go too far up Dog Oops something s tricking you Go ahead and turn that around Thank you go ahead give me the marker back Thank you Hold on But he saw a big dog and what happened What happened Sarah He Yeah ran And he ran Okay come over and help me write that then please Come on over over here And he ran Good Go ahead and sit down and he ran where Into the vet Okay I m gonna just finish this And he ran in Into is easy because you know both of those parts And he ran into the into the vet Or into the vet s What s that place Let s put that office or room Let s put room But both of those are good choices 
 Inner circle number two Again this was a question that was asked in a multitude of ways and this is where we re going with this Why did the accident happen The accident of May 10th 1996 Why did it happen Any questions Yes the May 10th 1996 thank you for clarifying where everybody died well not everybody but a lot of people died Why did it happen Because Okay so I think the reason the accident happened was maybe those people just weren t prepared for for the climb They thought it was going to be they re just going to go up with a guide and some other people they were just going to go to the top and come back down and it was gonna be an easy thing and they didn t expect the challenges that they were going to face I agree They probably thought it was gonna be a walk in the park Turns out that they weren t ready and it was no cake walk and it turned out that some of them it was their last day on the mountain You were talking about they weren t prepared and all that But they also said that the guide had never been through a storm like that and that that wasn t normal And I was kind of taken aback by that because I was like if there s a guide who s going to be guiding me on a life threatening thing I would want them to be seasoned trainer you know Exactly I would think the same thing That the guide should be prepared for that kind of storm unlike how he was and it turned out fatally for the rest of the crew I agree with all of you but during reading the article Krakauer also mentioned that he said that it wasn t really anyone s fault because people were so not in their right minds They were tired and injuries and how thin the air was they couldn t breath very well So when they looked at the sky and saw the storm coming they didn t expect it to be as bas as it was so nobody could really prevent it Anything to add to that I agree and I think that they were just having so much fun that they weren t really paying attention I think that they would ve all been prepared if they had been watching the clouds I know you mentioned the clouds but why weren t they watching them Why do you think they weren t watching them they didn t think that they were actually serious enough to actually I agree with Matt that they were so they wanted to get to the top so much they weren t too worried about looking at the clouds Oh okay we can make it back up and make it back down maybe before Not expecting trouble along the way Yeah I agree I think that they weren t really prepared They were too wrapped up in what was going on to think about the downfall and what was happening They re tired and probably weak they didn t have safe they weren t really all there to think about what are the consequences of this and what would happen Like the guide if it were me I would have made sure they had this that you re gonna help me out more than not really being able to Anything you wanna say Krystin Well I said that this quote at the top it says that Ambition has a steep price And I think part of like how you guys were talking about how like the guides weren t too prepared and weren t qualified but I think that well and the author mentions this too that climbing this mountian is it s taking a risk and your ambition for going up this mountain already when you re putting your life on the line there s nothing really anybody can do to tell you the qualifications that you have to have to survive it s just basically putting your life to chance and so that s what I really got out of it what do you think I agree I think that then not as many people would ve died They should just listen to what they re told and and not risk their lives to do something that I agree with that No but I think that what Krystin said makes a lot of sense that people were just too tired and I agree but I think it s understandable because just the thought of climbing the biggest mountain in the world is extremely cool and I would definitely want to go up there soon as possible and not worry about the weather like go all in or don t go at all I agree with lost or injured I mean but I m like half way there go ahead and accomplish what I set out to do and I think that would ve caused anybody to not really notice the weather and the risks involved in what we re doing I agree with what Ellie said a little while ago heard they should have turned around but they probably thought that this was going to be probably what could have been a once in a lifetime chance to be at Mount Everest I mean it says that they caught about safely but they should have have taken it more serious and not kept going risking their life One thing I noticed is that they relied a lot on each other but they didn t go back and check themselves and I didn t understand why they didn t go back and and like when the one guy says there s no oxygen here there s no full tanks Why didn t they go back and check that themselves I mean I would trust that person but yet again if my life on the line I would be checking it Does anyone else think the same way If my life were at risk I wouldn t be relying too much on other If my life were at risk I wouldn t be relying too much on other people I d be a little weary about something like that I don t so much disagree but I came up with something a little bit different I didn t really think that people relied on each other that much at all Who knows if all the deaths that happened could have been prevented but people were too tired or too injured or there was always something and everybody was more concerned about getting themselves down the mountain In a way I would say that it was selfish mission but in another way I mean if it was my own life I would be out for myself rather than trying to help somebody else and I think we saw that at least I saw that a lot happen throughout the story It s a choice between am I going to help that person and risk my life and they might not really pull through this does it matter Or am I going to get down this mountain and survive Some people were relying on others like at the end someone was trying to help was trying to help he tried to help her down she grabbed his arm and he tried to pull her down But she just let go and died I agree with Erin too I mean I think that right now wouldn t be able to You would think about yourself more Whenever you re out there and and you re with the same people for that long of a time and you re doing the same thing that you become sort of closer They would mean more to you then than they do right now You d be more willing to sacrifice something to survive to help them give them another chance to get out alive too That s definitely shown at the end of the article when he s talking about how he can t live a day without thinking about the lives of those people that he was so close to that were lost and how he couldn t even come to grips with their deaths for a very long time I agree with Erin I think there was a lot of at the end I think he was talking about the there was a lot of blame involved and why couldn t we prevent this and it brings me back to what you guys said I think they really wanted to help each other and I think that they wanted to do something but there was nothing that could be done in some cases I thought it was kind of sad actually dealing with that kind of grief where you couldn t prevent someone s terrible death Tyler what do you think about this Like did he grieve or even just the fact that who they were relying on Well what strikes me All right outer circle what d you notice What d you notice I noticed that people were and books and just kind of in inner circle and I felt that that really helped them to get the instructions Okay Blake what did you notice I just thought that it was more and more like Erin really led the conversation and Krystin really led the conversation and I think that those were like the two main ones but like Levi and Elliot and Alex they all also communicated a lot but there wasn t just one person who was talking Okay so there were definitely two leaders but there were other people that were contributing as they went along Okay good Anthony There were some well developed conversations Well developed conversations what do you mean by that Like Erin would say something and someone would build on it then someone else would and then another topic and new questions and another topic Yeah did you notice what was the question they started with Yeah we got a little off topic No you didn t What what was the question you started with What caused the disaster And then you went into something totally different but did you have good conversation about that Absolutely You guys really started focusing in on that life and death and relying on somebody else for your own life Okay I really like how I mean it wasn t like you were talking about cookies and then all of a sudden you were talking about climbing Mount Everest It was definitely very connected to what you were saying Dorothy what d you notice I noticed the conversation just kept going and it didn t stop or anything it just kept going from one thing to another Right it kept bouncing from one thing to another You could see like steam coming out of your ears they were all impulsive Blake I thought that also remember Erin said you re relying on someone and Krystin s like well I don t agree backed up Erin and other people backed up Krystin and there was people who didn t Yeah Is it okay to disagree with the people that are sitting around you Absolutely But you need to do it respectfully Like Krystin did Krystin said I don t exactly agree with you Erin then she proceeded to say Why And Levi was over here he was nodding his head and shaking yeah All right great I thought they did a good job of not having any dramatic pauses they always had something someone would pass on to someone else They paused occasionally but it was not pregnated pauses You guys ever heard that before It wasn t a pregnant pause it wasn t a big spacey gap okay Anthony Pretty much everyone talked Pretty much everyone talked Yeah pretty much Yeah did you notice that They built on to what other people were saying okay They agreed I still heard I agree a lot but then they told us why they agree with what they said All right Anything else you guys noticed Yes I think that we looked at our more because they had wider subject that they talked about Eventually it became narrowed down that is was kind of like you have to look for specific details It wasn t the whole story it was more like a paragraph or two and so you need specifics to deal with that All right Anything else 
 Can you think of what what images are coming into your head about the Holocaust that relate to this Um people dying in the gas chambers Okay and and how did that happen He convinced other people that they were awful and then that s really the only way you can get people to do something as cruel as that Okay so you re saying Hitler couldn t have carried out all that evil himself so he had to convince other people that basically the Jewish people were what Nothing They were just less than just a lesser race of people You re on a good track I ll check back with you in a second by stepping on another group of people So the other groups would actually help them Like we have to remember that the injustice the injustice is what causes us to want to go and help and restore justice and it s not just injustice anyway you have to want to help and not just sit back and do nothing Well outside people like in Atlanta and Birmingham like in there like in Birmingham were being persecuted while people in Atlanta weren t really doing anything Well I mean look what s happening today I mean we have a volunteer army and people are volunteering and going and trying to stop the injustice in Afghanistan and so that was practically the same thing as what Martin Luther King did for Alabama So you re saying you see a connection in the real world news That sort of our soldiers the fact that they volunteer would be an example for number five Is that what you are saying Yeah Had y all talked about number five yet Uh we were just going in order and seeing which ones that we could And yours is read me your quotation Um Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere Okay good Well you re just being to come up with things Okay go ahead I m just going to Okay so what s the first question Explain the context in which um Martin Luther King said this and how it applies in that situation Okay He doesn t want people to sit back and not do anything about a problem he wants them to go and help and stop It s almost as if their problem is his problem Is his problem Good I like that But even though he wants them to help well he doesn t want them to do it in a violent way Always need to underguard MLK with that don t we And that sort of ties into It s wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends Do you find yourself as you re discussing any one of these the others layer on there Yeah That s why it feels so important to have gotten this whole document as a whole Think you ve gotten enough from them Brianna for that one Yeah I think so Well I guess Clyde s already said that there s already one for the current news Yeah that we could put down So the volunteer soldiers Volunteer army Volunteer army I ll check back with y all good job are they more reluctant to like um listen to the lower class bunnies cause they felt like they had a better rule of it Yeah I think that s it Okay so in Watership Down the higher class rabbits did not want to give up their superior how do you spell that because I think I spelled that before privileges Privileges You know what to be honest with you every time I am typing I let spell check do it because that d and g always messes me up I was spelling superiority Superiority I m sorry Okay so what group have you chosen Colleen and what what Uh privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily and groups tend to be more immoral than individuals And I hear that you re using a Watership Down example which My idea Your idea good for you And what is the um what Warren are we talking about The very first one um Sandleform Sandleform yeah Yeah go ahead and tell me about that Yeah it s like um the higher class rabbits didn t want to give up their privileges of superiority to listen to the lower bunnies Does that make sense to you India That s a good example I really like it Okay have you gotten anything else Um we did the one about the time in history where this quotation applies What was the time in history Bish Um Number two Where this quotation applies is the Holocaust Um during Nazi rule people felt better about discriminating against the Jews because many others were also doing it So what was the privileged group that were reluctant to give up its privileges Um actually I think this one was grouped to be more of an individuals rights Right so the whole group of what The whole group of um Nazis the Nazis and the pretty much anyone that favored Hitler and the Nazis But maybe they wouldn t have carried out those atrocities alone but kind of got into a mob mentality is that kind of where we are with this Yes Good well y all go ahead I m just going to watch a minute So I ll finish writing the Watership Down one the higher class rabbits did not want to give up their superiority to how about admit that some of the lower Number four would be easier to connect to a teenager s life that one actually fits for both of those What does Um for telling a time in a teenager s life um both of these the two parts of the quote would apply because it s like when you re getting like verbally abused it feels much worse coming from a group than it does from an individual So if there s a whole group picking on you then that makes it worse and the privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily So say say someone has a good cafeteria lunch table and someone who s sitting over by the garbage cans wants to move over there so they ask Hey you don t have to sit over at our table but can you move somewhere else so we can sit there just for a day They ll probably say No because they won t think of another place to go besides that table that those other people left And they don t want to go by the garbage cans Nobody wants to I think that s a good connection A good very present day connection Good I ll be back Yes of course Um Allison would you like to I have no clue would it be okay to write about like how people in foreign countries use like the sex trade as an it an I it relationship Certainly Mr Gallant s class We just had to make sure it was all right with you before we started just writing it down That s okay that s okay that seems very real to me Okay fictional things so if it s fictional it doesn t have to be people I didn t say that we could use um what s that Watership Down I said we could use that did I not All right let s see Okay whatever I said we can use Hazel and the Warren for oppressed people that are not But I think we should do Efrafa because the bunnies like revolted and they got free remember Yeah That s what I m thinking I m hearing an argument where both of you think Watership would be a good connection but we re debating which what Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever Which Warren would like be better I think Efrafa Which one did you say Um the first one that came to from what was it called Sandleford Sandleford Okay tell me why you think that Because they were they had freedom but it was like they were just they couldn t do what they wanted all the time They could just do certain things in a certain vicinity They couldn t go out or go anywhere and they were just stuck against their will for that long of a time until they um like revolted against their Warren and left What were you going to add Michael Oh like it was like a routine everyday like it was the same thing they followed like a routine like they went out and then ate and then slept But I think Efrafa is like that except for it s a lot worse like they didn t even get to go out like they got like feeding times and they would have to feed like right here and they d have to go right back into their Warren I think they re both good examples but I think Machi s is more able to be explained by that because they did but in his you know uh uh Hazel and Big Wig and all them broke away and then they went to go search for They eventually got what they wanted In Efrafa they didn t get what they wanted until someone came in to And not everybody in Efrafa got out But not everyone in um Sandleford got out most of them didn t But I mean the group that we re talking about the main But the main characters got out and achieved what they wanted where they wanted Because no one else would listen Let me tell you something the main reason we re doing this is so that these quotations and these philosophies and that kind of thing will inform our later life It doesn t make me sad that you have two examples because when it s a little bit wrong or when it s a lot wrong because when you notice it when it s a little bit wrong sometimes you can keep it from getting a lot wrong so it kind of pleases me that you re seeing it at two different levels so I think use Efrafa and Sandleford and you ll have the best answer Okay Okay what are we working on We are trying to debate whether we should pick Cuba or Egypt as current events for for privileged groups so we can get Well let s hear your arguments Cuba Fidel Castro has been a tyrant for Metaphorically he s about to die He s still in power okay Egypt s been resolved already No Well they re arguing that it s not in the news but it s going on right now Well I think it would be best if we did something that was going on in the news that we ve like talked about in class that s really really really And we all understand it What don t you understand about Cuba though Like there s nothing that s really in the news right now Cuba they still have the same old thing just like every other country that s happened just a little bit worse Here s what I m hearing You have a great example but your group is wanting to go with the Egypt example and it doesn t dis uh disvalue yours because it s important to be able to understand that it can happen over a long time and sometimes when he s talking about apathy when it s happened for a long time people don t less and less and less revolt Okay Could we possibly do Cuba in the history one Oh I think you could Work on that that s a great idea How are we coming Good we re done Good done I think we are finished I want to hear your uh everyday life one All right our for our teenager Yes All right we re saying like if there s a group of popular kids and they re like calling names and putting down a group of the not so popular kids and they re just not treating them like they re normal people too they re just treating them like lesser people Less than human They might they might not pay attention to them also they just In the way you wouldn t necessarily recognize a theme but in a way you would never ignore a human or we would think should never ignore a human being Okay great So I want you as you re looking back over yours make sure that you ve given your reader or your listener enough information My shortest one was like three sentences and there s nothing magic about the number of sentences just check yours because you re a little ahead of everyone else for thoroughness and see if there s any details you could add Okay great How are we coming Um good Pretty much done Awesome awesome You ve got three of the four Which ones did you do Um the tell us a time in history when the quotation applies and the fiction quotation and the teenagers of life And your quotation was Oh we did um it is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends the last temptation is the greatest treason to do the right deed for the wrong reasons Thank y all for choosing that one that s a very hard one And we put And the third one great Now will some body tell me what your fictional one was Um we did why don t you explain this one Isabelle Okay I did Peter Pan Uh huh Cause when Peter Pan he persuades or he offers to take the children to the other place and it sounds wonderful to them but he s doing it for the wrong reasons What reasons do you think he s really doing it To have a mother for the children the lost children And so he s not really thinking of their well being he s thinking of his and the lost boys well being Right What a great connection I m so proud of y all That s awesome And did you do news Uh we did history History what s your historical one Uh we did uh when the Europeans 
 It s big Okay And that s all and the little blood cells and I drew one on there in kinda like a magnified and there s little blood strands they re blood strands DNA strands Now those DNA strands are only in the blood Are they anywhere else in your body They re in your hair and in your fingernails in your skin they re everywhere Okay so it s not just in the blood But you usually get it from the blood Blood Okay alright It looks like you ve got a couple questions You can call on whoever you want Me Are these questions You guys are these questions for Ryan Okay How do you know Chuck was right What Well he s a pretty smart guy Who Chuck my uncle Oh okay Maybe Even though there s a bunch of DNA on the strand what does that have to how do you know that a piece of that DNA came from either the mom or the dad That s why because DNA comes from both of them The dad gives the DNA and the mom provides the DNA Okay David It was in the blood right You said it was in the blood right Yeah Yes but couldn t blood be transmitted to another person because they had the yeah it could be transmitted to another person so that s not really a trait Sure when someone gets a blood transfusion Yeah Right Like if you re in the hospital and you re injured and you get blood transfusions If your eyes are blue and you get a blood transfusion from a brown eyed person does that turn your eyes brown No It could if Okay Does it give you a widow s peak when you have a straight hairline No Okay If I get a blood transfusion tomorrow hopefully that doesn t happen but if I get a blood transfusion tomorrow is that going to give me a cleft chin No If the person had a cleft chin But how do people die when they get when they get blood transfusions Carlos can we talk about that later maybe Let s stick with how we get our traits Do we get it through the blood Okay not really Girls what do you think over there I was sure it had something to do with the blood but that s between your parents and it has nothing to do with the traits so I don t know Do you want to come over here too I want to come over there with the boys Yes I You guys are you guys haven t even said anything yet and already they re they re joining your group Okay should we hear from the people who think I ve got a large Lorenzo do you want should we hear from you Or are you thinking about coming over to this group too You re set okay Let s hear from Lorenzo Okay Lorenzo what do you think I think that it was that brown eyed people have more traits than blue eyed people because I know more people that are brown eyed than blue eyed and I think I read somewhere that usually brown eye is a dominant trait over the blue eyes So for most of the times brown eyed people if you have brown eyed parents you will get brown eyes but how is So you heard something about a dominant trait Okay any questions about that dominant trait Brown eyes being dominant trait Because a lot of people have brown eyes like that and not many people have blue eyes True Blue eyes are more rare Okay Lorenzo whoever you want to call on you ve got two people So like what you were saying right now something about your parents then you would get it from your parents Hmm What Because when he was when he was saying that about the traits he said you if your parents have brown eyes or blue eyes that you re gonna get that trait from them So from your parents so Interesting Do you get what she s saying What She s she s saying she s sticking with this group because it s coming from your parents Okay That s why they say it s half and half Okay Also I m in your group too but what s it called Yeah I see more brown eyes but still they always get their traits from the parents not only But a lot of people have some people still get blue eyes and then others it s because of they still get the traits from the parents and some of them don t look alike so What about what about some people have both of the parents have brown eyes and some of the kids turn they have their blue eyes though Yeah that s great because that s a great how many of you guys have seen something like that I have seen it Where two parents have one trait and then their kid has the opposite trait Like brown eyed parents blue eyed kid You guys have seen that Why does that happen What do you think I m not really sure I know my parents have brown eyes and me And you have green eyes Yeah Your parents both have brown eyes right And your eyes are blue Yeah Okay so why does that happen Lorenzo since it was your idea let s hear from you If I m correct there s more brown eyed traits so you get if you have a brown eyed parent and a blue eyed parent you get a brown eyed trait and a blue eyed trait but because brown eyed is dominant most of the time you get brown eyed But you still have blue eyed traits so even if you have two parents with brown eyed trait if they both also have the blue eyed trait you could get blue eyes I have a question for you Lorenzo You keep using this word dominant trait Does in your mind does dominant mean more More When you re saying more traits in your mind does dominant mean there s more of it Yeah Okay what do you guys how many of you guys have heard this word dominant There s recessive too which is Recessive Okay does dominant mean more Anyone know that It means power over the others Like an overpowering trait he s trying to say Are you trying to say more Are you trying to say more or are you trying to say stronger Stronger Okay so this group the group you re sitting in the group one right now is someone who thinks that there s more traits come from the brown Do you think that You re not sure Say yes But you know something about dominant Okay I ll stay with my group Yes Can I make my own group where it s like Yeah Good yes What are you thinking I m moving Maybe it s just maybe that nature decides what something will look like because I don t know my parents have brown eyes and I have blue eyes and we don t really have anyone else who has blue eyes You re picking the Wait a minute Fiona no Olivia Yeah nature Okay nature makes so you ve got blue eyes nature had something to do with that not your parents Yeah Okay Anyone want to respond to that Ryan How does nature do that How does nature choose your eye color Doesn t it have something to do with your parents Of course how could you just a slot machine where it s like ching and then the eye colors roll around and stuff Oh you got blue eyes I don t know Let him respond You re not sure No I m not sure I m still Any other questions Oh yeah And like you know how I was gonna ask this what if you get it from your grandparents or your Grandparents have black eyes Or from your aunts or something I really don t know If your aunts and sisters Yeah what if his aunt and sister has blue eyes That s right What if somewhere way back someone in your family had blue eyes You guys better I don t see how that How does that happen Does anyone know people who look like their grandparents Yeah my cousin does Lorenzo My mom said that I look like my grandparent because I have a mole or something that s in the same spot as my grandpa If that s the case for you does that support what he s saying Nature decides Or does that keep you in what you re thinking It keeps me in But I have a question Okay How do people one eye is blue and the other one is green Oh I know that one That s a mutation No no some people have really Yeah like All right let s refocus Let s refocus We haven t heard from this group We haven t heard from the few groups that have the most amount of people in them Okay so let s give them a chance to talk Ladies can you start us off You guys read it I have to read it We agree that people get half their traits from their parents We think this is a trait from both of their parents Also for example that What For example if one person has one parent has Because for example for me I have my dad s eyes and I have my mom s my mom s She has traits from some from your mom and some from your dad okay Yeah It looks like you ve got someone who wants to say something about that But if what if you get more if you get some traits from your ancestors too and not just your parents What about your That would just go back a generation though Does that still support what you re thinking Yeah No because we re talking about the parents How they have half Yeah but you then also get from your parents some of them so some people don t look like their parents at all but they look like someone else in their family I m seeing this issue come up again What about grandparents Kids who look like their grandparents How does that happen Does anyone here wanna any of you guys Go ahead You still get it from your parents because your parents if your grandma has it then that trait is somewhere in your mom or your dad It just doesn t show up as much so it can transfer back to you What can we call that That there s a trait in you and you just don t see it Does anyone know a word for that Invisible I heard it over here Recessive Yes recessive okay Who else has heard recessive Raise your hands Scientists call a recessive gene a gene that does not express itself It doesn t mean it s a little gene that s quiet It just means that it s a gene that s not showing Or a trait sorry a trait that s not showing That s called recessive You also want to talk about this more a little bit more let s stay on this topic I think it will help us figure it out Yes Ryan Like he was saying it s probably about the DNA strands when they when two people combine in different parts or put in different pieces of it like maybe one like maybe the blue eyes is out and brown eyes goes in there Or maybe when they have one of those recessive genes the recessive genes get it goes into the strand too Maybe when Tyler said that none of neither of his parents have blue eyes maybe his grandpa or his grandma or their grandparents maybe one of them had blue eyes and it was in his mom or his dad and it went into the strand that he was created from It didn t show up in the mom but then it popped up in the kid Yeah Okay David I don t know I think I don t know if I agree with him but I think I kind of do because like he said it was dominant but he still has he still has a little bit in him so it s kind of like a well because you still have some of your traits or your parents still kind of have a little bit How are okay how are how is this idea that brown eyed kids have I m sorry brown eyed there s more traits in brown eyes right Is that what this idea is about All you guys right here How is that like this one That we get half from mom and half from dad Or how can we use some of this thinking and layer it onto some of this thinking so they re both right The question is how are those two the same Right How are that one and this one the same How are pieces from this how do we use pieces from this idea that Lorenzo is bringing up dominant and recessive how do we use pieces from this and combine it with pieces from this group over here Let me get you to talk about that with your group Let me ask I ll ask that question one more time What s right about what these guys are saying and how can we add it to stuff this group is thinking What if the kid is born blind right Or what if the kid comes out deaf and blind some express themselves and some don t Woo That you just gave me a brain scan because you read my mind Say there s two DNA strands One in this hand one in this hand They combine The dominant ones from each of these take over and make one of all the dominant ones that were in them Can you give me an example With Tyler maybe there was a dominant gene The blue eyes was dominant Maybe it was passive before it started whatever it s called recessive and then it became dominant but over time and then it went in Tyler How can a dominant gene become a recessive gene and become dominant again Maybe every time it gets passed down Hmm Like with us we get bigger What if your if your mom had two blue eyed parents but Ryan here today And they combine I found it All right are we ready to pull back All right I didn t get to hear from all these two groups but I did get to hear from them I think what this group has is something good and I think you guys want to hear it you re gonna be the spokesperson for that group Great We agree that people get mom and 50 from their dad We think this because if there s two people who made the baby then it s logically should be split in half But all every time someone has a baby all of their genes of both parents go into the baby Only some of them decide to express themselves and show Go ahead Say I have two DNA strands from two different people Say Mary and Joe Mary and Joe both had grandparents that both have blue eyes and that gene got passed down to them Now they combined to make one gene Say Mary had blue eyes had a blue eyed gene and Joe had a blue eyed gene Those two genes combined to make one dominant blue eyed gene and it goes in like what Tyler like with Tyler Right so we Tyler he used you as an example Your parents both have brown eyes right Mm hmm And what were you guys saying about his parents both have brown eyes but something they had something else too Yeah Because everyone kind of has a little bit of everything in them it s just some some color or some trait just decides to show because it s more dominant You know the movie you know the movie that movie They went to some place and they went to go get found out they got the book from some person and they matched it up to ours and it was different colors so they had different kind of genes for like for things So if you compare a baby who has blue eyes and one who has brown eyes it s gonna have it s gonna have different things with the eyes The DNA thing will be different Maybe those DNA genes that in a DNA maybe they would look different for a blue eyed person than a brown eyed person Yeah Did you wanna say something Maybe the DNA of Tyler s parents for example if their grandparents had blue eyed DNA accumulating in them it might have been passed down through them And then when they got to where they were forming Tyler inside their his mom s stomach it might have the blue DNA might have overpowered combining those two blue DNAs by getting it might have overpowered the brown eyes which made Tyler get the blue eyes 50 It could be like 50 That happened in my family They re saying what color eyes are your parent s Tyler What s your mom s eye color Brown Oh Yeah what you got on your mom s side From my brown eyed mom Brown So what about your mom s mom What about your dad s What about your dad All right you guys let s talk Let s talk for a second If we ve got an example of one person in science you never hang everything on one person Let s be careful about that And we don t want to have him be the reason for all But this is a good example Do we think that people can have genes in them that aren t showing but then they can have a kid and then those genes pop up Yeah because if the two genes Did you want to say something about it Lorenzo Yeah because I think that if a parent had brown eyes and one had blue eyes but the brown eyed parent also had some blue eyed genes then the baby would probably come out blue because it has the blue eyed gene and then half of the blue eyed gene from the other parent How could we figure out how we get our traits for sure Because we have a lot of ideas but what in science class what will we do What kind of activity could we do What kind of research could we do How would we find out We could go on AskJeeves com and we So we could look it up on the Internet Okay guys one resource we could look at How else could we figure this out We could take a survey Didn t we do that the class We did No But we could whole school so we have more to research or more I don t know Make a larger sample size Then we get information and we find out that X percent of our students have brown eyes and X percent of our students have blue eyes How does that help us find out where those traits came from It gives us more of an idea Their parents and their grandparents too And their great grandparents We d have to ask people to we d have to ask people to do some research on their families Okay so we could do some family research Sonja We could make up an assignment Sure Okay 
 Today is Wednesday Yes I would clone myself Good why Why would you clone yourself Because everybody deserves a second me So you would just And I would clone a woolly mammoth for my clone to ride on Honestly What would some of the negatives to cloning something like that Well it s another me But it s still good because you know I m me and I m good and bad Do you know your clone is not going to be like set right You re gonna have to wait for it to grow up So I have to raise a little baby clone of me Yes And it ll look just like me when I was a baby Pretty much Oh that s wrong Oh my God There are so many possibilities Alright So let s start off with I ll get it a baby Raise your hand if you can remind us like what is cloning There s only one of you Like taking the DNA or like I don t know like whatever out of one person like trying to like duplicate it into another one Okay great We re all well was there only like one type of cloning What were some of the different types Well one type of cloning is only tissues and organs only and another one is let s see animal and livestock cloning Anything else you want to add to that Gady So what s one way they do the cloning So they take the DNA from one animal what do they do Do you remember what parts they used Like what kind of cell they used Nucleus They did take the nucleus And they used The eggs of the other animal Okay it s kind of interesting You can take the egg from one animal and completely change its DNA So now when that turns into a new organism it s an identical copy of the animal that it came from And if you take you can bring back endangered species too Because remember that or whatever then they put in the cow Yeah But they were like related in some kind of way so it wasn t like weird That s true It was probably a decendent Do you guys remember that from the video They had tried to take an animal that was almost extinct in fact they couldn t actually do the tests on the animal Remember they were saying that there were so few of them that they couldn t even do the tests on them Right How long did last Does anyone remember Three days Yeah it was about three days right But it was the first time So when they couldn t open up that cow the cow died right I don t know that for sure but I m guessing that they were not that interested in the cow medically They were Oh no I was just wondering because there s a cow sitting there with a giant gaping hole in its womb That s true That does happen I mean I don t care if the cow died honestly That s another hamburger for me But that Goward That Goward That s swole You can t get any other animal like that Anybody else in here agree that it s okay to do that testing to save endangered species Well yeah because if there s like a hundred million cows and one whatever that thing was called So we should probably try and get more of them Yeah why not Okay We should clone pandas Let s hear somebody else though Is there anybody else that has I said alligator try and bring it back That s true What happens when there s so many I mean how many of you have ever watched the movie Jurassic Park Oh my God I ve seen all of them at least twice So that s a good question So if we can bring back something that looks like a cow fabulous What happens when you want to bring something that looks just as cool but has bigger teeth Well you see it breaks out of the cage like in Jurassic Park the Lost World and it starts attacking all the Great Well yeah it kind of started eating people That was wrong Fabulous but what could be some of the downfalls on that Like any negatives to cloning animals that are endangered or almost extinct Well hardly any of the You need to The DNA might get messed up Yeah but remember that when we re messing around with the DNA yeah maybe there could be a mistake What happens then It could die It could die yes I would say One good thing about bringing dinosaurs back is that you finally get to study them the way we want to That s probably what scientists are thinking Wouldn t that be great if I could study something and actually be able to touch it and see what it does Because a lot of things they tell you about you know dinosaurs is what they think they do Well we think they eat this and We think this is how they lived Wouldn t it be great if we could actually study those What if dinosaurs were never real Well they found skeleton remains so they re pretty much sure they were around They also found Because you can t just stick an animal in an environment and maybe it will survive because it will mess up the chain of life Anthony has a really good point because what s going to happen if we have dinosaurs We can t just stick them somewhere for them to roam around Because they don t have anything they can naturally eat anymore And they don t have any natural predators anymore That s why you just bring back T rexes and velociraptors And what not Then you just feed them cows You don t know if they necessarily eat cows though You don t know that Well it s meat It is meat but that s also your food source Well that s not going to be Maybe eight or nine Maybe 25 for a T Rex You re underestimating the size of some of these animals But the same thing applies to actual animals instead of just dinosaurs What happens if we have animals that are going extinct because we are building new houses and we re expanding our cities So we re moving into some areas where there are some animals and they start to die off because we are taking over their land So yeah we could make a hundred copies of these animals or whether it s plants or birds or certain insects But that is a good question where are they going to live if we just bring them back Wildlife park So that is a good thing And again remember that you all add because if you put them somewhere that a park they won t necessarily survive So you might need to think about all the other stuff that goes with that So yeah the food chain Interesting how everything s connected Raise your hand if you d like to share one of your questions from yesterday We ll start with Anthony Okay so like say me and this lady get married We both can t have kids so they take my DNA and they make a clone of me I m married to this person Would that be only my child or would that be our child And if why Maybe yeah But what if you re married Well does it require two people that has your DNA I m sorry I didn t hear you Maybe it is Maybe it s totally the environment Who s to say Maybe if you raise it and you re like This is our kid Well because of that case then there can t be any more like if we depended on cloning there woudn t be any well there d be less drama in the world because we wouldn t be doing stuff the natural way And like people being knocked up in bars and stuff and random places and stuff and like not knowing their father in life you know But you know what I m saying right Do you think it would be hard Like what if people were 100 dependent on this There would be a lot less problems Eventually if you keep cloning yourself and then your clone cloned itself and your clone clones itself You d have the same group of people You d have the best group ever Yeah but how would you know because you wouldn t be here That s dumb that s what that is That s interesting We can t have just a bunch of the same people That d be one stupid That d be dumb man I don t know Walking around seeing all the same people That s stupid You re not going be like Like the Matrix everything repeating Other questions Let s get one from a female this time We got the guys questions Let s get a girl Don t all shout out all at once Mayra what s one of your questions I said like if they clone a sheep and it s like sick wouldn t it or let s say there s a regular sheep and they clone that wouldn t the clone be sick too What did she say Not necessarily No because it s like you said it s two entire different bodies of life A lot of things can go wrong in one person So how could it just be the same thing two different Unless it s like a problem with an organ that the one had and then Well I want to say that like a disesased kid Maybe What about remember you just did genetics right If it s in your DNA what would happen If it was in your DNA It probably would get it If it was something that it caught it probably wouldn t get it That s true So it depends I guess maybe what it is Right So you have this sheep just cloned it and because it has something very serious with it and if it s genetic then yeah there s probably a chance that that clone would probably have the exact same disorder later on I think they were showing Remember when they were doing Dolly and they showed some of the animals they had cloned I think they were talking about the sheep Dolly and then they had some mice that they had cloned They had said that the animals they had cloned does anyone remember what any of the side effects what they ve noticed Sometimes they can t breathe right What else Sometimes they died really young So just because it s a clone maybe we haven t quite figured it out yet Because it seems like maybe there are some issues with the animals actually coming out healthy or normal if they re dying younger or having problems growing Other questions Hector what is one of your questions Or if you don t have your questions ready or you feel like your questions were answered maybe you just have a comment You have none What do you think about cloning Do you agree with it Or are there are certain places or times you would agree with it Um I agree with it Like the pros I would agree with it like for food For what Like cloning for more food Oh like the chickens Right Cloning to make more chickens Wouldn t it be great if I have a perfect chicken and I could make a hundred copies of the same perfect chicken I ve had all types of chickens They all taste the same That s true Everything tastes like chicken But have you ever gotten like a really tiny drumstick and then you got like the nice meaty drumstick Well like a tiny little drumstick They still taste good True but what one gives you more food You got a point there Okay so maybe right But still you could put them together In the case of KFC the reason why their chicken s so big is because they put hormones in them to make them big Yes That s the way they approach that That s the best way to do that right there Not really People get cancer from that So would this be a good solution So instead of making eating our cows and feeding pigs and feeding chickens these extra vitamins and extra hormones to make them larger and grow faster would it better to just take the large big cows and just clone them Or make chicken and make copies of it Yes No Does anyone see any maybe This sounds really great like we re going to make these big meaty chickens so that everybody has a lot of chicken that they can eat but is there any downside to that No Honestly no I don t think so Not for you Great Is there anybody else Money Money how They could cost more to but they could cost less and be more affordable which is what we want Good Money is a good issue right People won t have to think about money issues I don t think there d be a money issue if you were cloning chickens because you can always just get you know take a syringe and like But that s what he was saying that maybe it d be cheaper if they could make it without using as much stuff Yeah Mm hmm It would take longer What do you guys think about the cloning for body parts Can I go back to the chickens for a second Sure go for it Wouldn t there be a lot less farmers so then there d be a lot less jobs because you know like the whole That is true Like a lot of companies will go out of business because I don t know I feel like there s like a monopoly on it More private industries are going to go out of business and that s going to destroy livelihoods Because all the big livestock companies like KFC and McDonald s well they re not a livestock company they re fast food But they re going to be selling it to those right They re going to let it go off of Just by show of hands who in here might have a problem eating food if they knew that it had been genetically messed around with That s just because you guys are okay with dying Chris not sure or does it just kind of I don t care really What was the question Oh I said would you be bothered if you ate genetically modified food No before that The one before Anthony started talking We were trying to see if there was any downside of cloning chickens We ll get there I know the question We ll get there I want to say something We ll get there Alright Erica Medical the cloning the body parts like if people are sick and they need a new heart or new lungs or a new kidney Ms Scott I wrote the name of it It s called Therapeutic Cloning They refer to it that way So that s what it s called when you do that So when we re using it for cloning for the organs for individuals who have issues whether it s like just a few cells or like nervous cells for people who had spinal cord injuries what do you think about that I think it s a good idea It s a good idea Do you have any reasons to be worried about that It would be better than nothing Any concerns Anybody else Have you heard of of a book called What was it called I don t think I have What s it about That s okay Levon is going to have to read it now because he ll be like What It s about like in the future will people if parents don t want their kids any more they can like they can give them a like they can take their other body parts off and they can take their other body parts off of them and stuff so they like your body parts are still alive so one arm could be like your real arm and your other arm could be like Interesting I ll have to read that book sometime Now when they re doing the therapeutic cloning they re not actually creating like a whole new human and then the body parts up There s a couple of different ways they were doing it Do you remember what they were using to how they were growing the organs That is true But what were they trying to do with the cloning How are they trying to avoid that Do you remember Does anybody remember How is cloning supposed to help your body to keep from rejecting Because Do you guys remember what happened to the woman Close Very close to that So remember when you get a body organ like the lady with the kidney right Who d she get the kidney from Her aunt Yeah so she got it from her aunt Somebody she was not even related to that just happens to be part of the family Like they were a match She had to take remember all of those pills she had to take To make sure her body doesn t like get rid of the kidney And then unfortunately it still did So they re looking at getting making kidneys and I think that they were growing them inside of a cow I think it was a cow Might have been a pig It was a big animal So you re going to grow human kidneys that are functional Mm hmm On a cow They were using another animal and they were actually growing it like not in the animal It wasn t part of the animal They were using the animal as a place to keep it growing and functioning So on the outside of a cow there d be kidneys Underneath the skin Yep And then they would take take them out and transplant them into humans This is like that episode of South Park where it s a little bit inappropriate but not too much Then let s not go there It s a little too inappropriate then let s not Nevermind Nevermind You re going to watch it for yourself Fabulous But they are also trying by cloning because remember a lot of times they re trying to find animal parts that might match Like for example did you know a pig heart is about the same size as a human heart So you could have a pig heart They were thinking about taking pig hearts and transplanting them into people that needed new hearts The problem is of course is it s a pig s heart which means the outside of the heart looks like pig cells So your body would know that it s not a human heart It would know that it s a pig heart And your body probably won t want that in its body So they were trying remember they had trying to grow new pigs I think they had little piglets running around The pigs had human DNA in there to make the outside of their hearts and the outside of their lungs and kidneys all kind of copy what a human cell would look like on the outside So that when they keep those body parts if they put them in a human your body wouldn t recognize it as being something different Did you know they ve actually done that My dad s friend s daughter has pig intestines 
 And why face changes are different at different pressures And so I think that at a certain pressure they re so close together that they aren t a gas anymore and they become a liquid Cool Because the difference between a liquid and a solid with the atoms is that the solids or the difference between a liquid and a gas with the atoms is that the gases are more spread out And the liquids can still move freely but they re more close together so Okay We thought that in a liquid they can t move as freely as it can in gas Yeah Yeah Well another gas has to expand well it does expand to fill its container Yeah So does that have anything to do with how they move Well you said that some tried to sometimes they don t always expand as much as they can but I think they do My guess is probably the distance between the molecules is based on how big the space is cause you think of pressed gas What are you guys all thinking about of what you re hearing Well Do things sound reasonable Yeah Is this a question that we need to maybe think about a little bit more Just how spread out do things have to be to be a gas At what point does that matter or not matter Uh huh Okay We re gonna keep that one on the books for something we need to check into That s what I want you to do to prove to me that you understand that beyond just telling me what you know maybe the book would say Beyond just a definition right If you re going down the right path here and you know what that is I see you re making a nice Venn diagram here comparing and contrasting that s great What I want you to do is on this sheet here cause this is what you re going to need to present to the class in a couple minutes Put down these thoughts these words that you ve got You can even draw your Venn diagram on here But explain what that means What does that mean bubbles floating inside the lagoon What does that mean It s escaping off the top When we think of matter what do we actually think of in our heads Conceptually we re thinking of a chunk of matter a beaker of liquid so there s some space and what else And what So matter has mass and volume What s matter made up of Okay Atoms molecules If it helps you you can decide okay let s think of this in terms of water Just so it s a known right Okay good Yeah that s a good way to do that So draw some pictures When you say it s escaping off the top what does that look like Okay so try to get it into some visuals Okay I ll come back Matter like I don t really understand The definition of heat Yeah Okay so what is heat It s what Heat is like the transferring of energy from a warmer thing to a colder thing right So you want to separate what something is from how it behaves So you re saying heat is the transfer of energy Transfer is how it behaves right What is it It s just energy It s energy right So heat is a form of energy and you re absolutely right It can move around in the environment between systems in and out of the system So let s say you ve got a beaker of water sitting on the counter and it s hot right It s sitting in a cold room What do you expect to happen What will happen to the temperature of the water for example It will Okay so the water will get colder and the air right around the beaker will get warmer til they level out Yeah Okay equilibrium good So you understand that heat is energy And you understand that it can move around So the question here is how does adding heat energy for example matter cause changes to temperature and changes of state So not that it does but how So what you need to do is think about your ideas about matter What is matter Something with a mass or volume Occupies space has mass or volume You know You just said it Okay Yeah see you know Okay matter has volume it takes up space right And it also has what Mass The property of mass Do you guys have any kind of a conceptual model of matter like if you think of it Obviously this is matter right but if you zoom in on that is there a way that you think about what matter is Do you guys think of matter as being made up of smaller things Yes Okay atoms molecules What would happen if you had one atom and you add some energy to it Remember this isn t rights or wrongs this is what are you thinking right now so that you can make sense of this So what if I have two atoms and I add more energy to them What if I have hundreds of atoms and I make them all move faster Well I mean that s what I m asking you guys to think about as best you can How would that occur We said if the molecules have more energy and they move faster then that leads to And they get warmer Oh that s the same thing as adding more energy right Then they move faster and that leads to changes from liquid I would say add some pictures I think you guys are thinking some good thoughts here about the structure of matter what it s made of So why don t you draw me some pictures of what that would look like in say something that is changing state Maybe take a chunk of something solid and then draw what you guys see as being a series of steps getting it from here to here So start with a lump of solid matter okay something like that Take it all the way to a gas Okay How do you see that matter Okay Okay alright let me give you guys a couple minutes to do that Start with an atom and build like a box So folks I want to take a couple more minutes and then have you guys share your thoughts with each other Theorizing is good Why don t you draw me some pictures of what might be happening here Yep Did I take your pencil I m sorry Okay we have a pencil thief So you re saying there s some specific temperature in which all phases can exist at the same time Water would be evaporating ice would be melting and vapor would be condensing So I just want you to tell me a little bit more about your theory How would that work in the environment in terms of the physical conditions that the ice and the water and the vapor would be under Yesterday we talked about some things that affect phase what were they What was one thing that we said affects what phase of matter something is in Okay temperature Anything else Pressure Pressure maybe so is there a way that you can describe to me in terms of pressure and temperature and the matter itself how that would work Okay you may need to mentally zoom in on matter What is it what is ice what is water what is gas If you zoom in and we look at it beyond just a chunk what do we see on the inside What s it made up of at a very small level Does everybody here see matter as a collection of atoms or molecules Like you can visualize that So bring that in here If you do that then show me how your theory would apply to that Try Okay Okay How s that sound Okay a couple more minutes Seems like you guys have gotten your thoughts wrapped around this and you re working on presenting it Okay How am I supposed to do this Oh god I can t draw cups Remember you have to explain to everyone what you re drawing s showing so it doesn t have to be perfect Oh okay Don t worry about perfection You re gonna get to stand up there and say this is what I drew And they just have to believe you Okay that s how bad it s gonna be Okay so there s like the water I think I have the difference between the molecules Okay so that shows that that s gas and liquid What is the big red arrow It s like going up out of the liquid What s it The molecules Okay molecules Yeah that s what this is supposed to be So the only thing I would like for you guys to add to your explanation here is something about why like why or how What are the factors in the physical environment that are allowing or not allowing the things that you re drawing to happen That s up to you what you think is making I think that s quite good actually That explains it to me really well The things that you think are having an effect on what s actually going to or not going to happen Like this amazing flame Like that amazing flame So you might want to label that or make sure that you explain that Label it F L A M E You ve vibrated those are actually quite good vibrations That s our gas They re awfully close together These are closer together here than they are here Is that something that you intended No There supposed to be really spread out It s up to you what you re going to write I m simply asking you a question because it seems like between liquid and gas they got closer together We didn t mean to do that I can draw more What do you think So we ve shown them closer together Do we want to revise this or do you think it doesn t matter So they could be closer together They could be closer together as long as they re moving more Okay So I think being like spreading out and occupying all space available So if you re thinking that you should include that somehow and it seems like then you and Katelyn and Ignesia s have different ideas about this And that s important to acknowledge because those are two different things so we want to think about What are you doing Oh you re adding to it So I hear Lindsey s saying that you thought they d be more spread out occupying more space and I hear you guys saying the spacing of them doesn t really matter So that s worth thinking about because that s two different ways of looking at this That s two different ways of looking at this Anyway we don t need perfection right now We need your initial thoughts but somewhere I d record that discrepancy I would record here that you re still thinking about that issue You think one thing you guys think another That s important So you guys I think I d like to have groups Don t worry if you re not totally done I would just like groups to kind of explain what they ve got so far And we re going to go in numerical order So I am going to ask everybody to come back to the tables though and give your poster to one group member Let s do that now Don t worry if it s incomplete This is a work in progress Come on back to the tables Don t worry if it s not finished You get to explain it And we re gonna keep these around so you can add to them Come on back to the tables I count two Alright so group one I m gonna have you guys come on up and hang up your poster You guys let s load towards the front of the room so that we re all closer You don t need all your stuff just come on up and sit a little closer Let s squeeze in in all these front tables Yeah you guys are gonna explain a little bit to us of what you re thinking was So everybody come on up as close as you can Let s squeeze in at these tables Let s get a couple people here let s get a couple people here Pull a chair on up Come on up Somebody come sit here somebody sit here So we ve only got a little bit of time left and I want every group to have a chance to tell us a little bit about their thoughts You guys may on your pre think sheets take some notes Remember this isn t about right or wrong This is about how do we think we understand this system right now And this is all leading towards trying to understand it more thoroughly and better and correctly by the end of the unit So their question the first one is how does adding heat energy to a sample of matter cause changes of temperature and changes of state So you guys tell us a little bit about your thinking here Okay so we were thinking that something about adding heat would have to do with the boiling point and the freezing point And we were also just listing facts that we knew that would probably help us determine about our question We were thinking about specific heat The equation for specific heat Also we said based on the specific heat of the substance an amount of energy will raise the temperature by a certain amount and we thought that was important And it varies for the substance because each substance is like a difference between the heat So if you add one it will raise one gram of a different substance by a certain degree and then a different substance by a different amount And we also thought about how solid liquid and gas that it has to do with the change of space And the solid they re like locked in place but they re still vibrating a little bit Then if you add more energy we think it goes to a liquid where there s more freedom of movement but they re still sort of contained and then in a gas And in a gas the molecules will be occupying all space available and moving faster And they re not like moving in a certain direction What questions do you guys have for them or comments about what they re thinking Why would different materials have different specific heats You don t have to know the answer Does anyone have thoughts on that Guesses Maybe they re different what Different types of material I mean substance So I think that maybe they have different specific heats because the atomic structure is different So they can kind of collect heat differently How does that sound to folks reasonable Is it true that atoms bond in different ways for different substances Okay so maybe that s something worth looking into as we study this and see why that why that physical property of specific heat why isn t it the same for everything And so we were actually still thinking in our gas drawing here because you can see that we drew all the molecules really close together compared to the solid and liquid I guess And we weren t sure whether or not in a gas they could move freely And it doesn t matter how spaced out they are as long as they can they re not stuck in one space like solids are They can just move wherever Or whether they have to be more spaced out and so Didn t occupy the whole space Do you guys have thoughts about that What they re saying Do you guys understand the point Katelyn s making How far do they have to be to be a gas Well I think that that s actually a lot like ours because we were thinking about pressure 
 Okay so write your conjectures down Denominators are repeating Actually let s put this one on number four Put it on number four We got any even number that had any odd number Okay so if it s an odd number in the denominator it s repeating If it s got an even number in the denominator Oh okay so you want to add to it not just say it s even If it s odd over even It s terminating It s terminating and what if it s even over even Even over even Two over six It would one be one over three You d have to simplify it Okay you d have to simplify it and so what would happen when you simplified 2 6 to 1 3 It would be repeating It would be repeating so maybe you re on to something Might want to record that Let s check That s good I haven t heard that one before guys All right let me here some of your conjectures This group we re going with their conjecture What s your conjecture guys That all odd denominator fractions will repeat All right here s the conjecture All odd numbers in the denominator will be repeating decimals Anybody want to add to it Take away from it Change it All right what we got here over here That s false because point two five goes into 100 4 times Okay hold on I m confused Point two five What is point two five represented as a fraction 1 4 1 4 and they said all odd numbers are repeating So far it works Well then 1 5 All right let s try 1 5 Well hold on then Let s get all the conjectures before we start trying them out I do love the action that you want to make up your own fractions and try it cause I don t think it s safe just to take it at a glance All right Dylan what did y all s group George share for your group What did y all say Listen guys We had two You had two okay Even over odd equals terminating Even over odd is terminating okay And even over even is repeating Even over even is repeating He meant two by that Okay so basically and then I would assume that odd over odd would go here Okay my only question is I see even over odd odd over odd even over even what s the other option Odd over even Odd over even where do you think that would go Do you think it would go terminating Yes Well let s pick something really quick 3 4 That s odd over even That would be terminating Okay so opposites even and odd odd and even you re thinking opposites Attract There you go Opposites attract to be terminating and when they re the same even and even and odd and odd They repel Okay and they repeat Pretty good Here s what I want you to do now Based on what you just told me look at number six I ve given you fractions I want you let s look at them as a group I want to come to a consensus as a class Do we all agree with this groups thinking We didn t get to share ours because 8 9 repeat Okay 8 9 is even over odd and that repeats so maybe we want to cancel this one out and it s just odd over even There might be something else It might be that that doesn t go necessarily doing anything like the rules for divisibility like seven and eight they don t have a rule because it just doesn t work but it s right It might be that that doesn t work Maybe if it s even a law you just gotta work it out So do we want to make our rule this If it s odd over eating Eating Is it time for lunch If it s odd over even it s terminating everything else is repeating We should test it out before 3 4 is terminating but 7 8 isn t terminating cause eight 7 8 Try it on your paper real quick 7 8 It terminates So do we want to use this No and yes okay let s Let s do more though Let s do a democracy here okay If you re liking the well hold on Who says no Who doesn t want to use this Why Those rules may not work all the time for every fraction Okay so do you have a better rule or conjecture So far is it working Based on what we know and the numbers we ve generated so far let s use that rule to categorize the following fractions and I think we could do this as a group So here I ve got our rule we said we wanted to try was odd over even Everything else is going in repeating Odd over even We ve already done these so here s our new fractions okay What is this fraction here 11 24 It s odd over even so where do we want to put it Terminating Terminating Terminating Odd over even would make it terminating Six what Sevenths 6 7 Repeating Even over odd terminates But that didn t work That didn t work We tried it and we saw that it didn t work remember Yeah odd over even is the only one we re going with so I ve got an odd over even I got odd over odd Repeating And I ve got an odd over even Terminating Okay so here s what I want you to do Check it Use your calculators as a group check it Circle go ahead and write em down Categorize them just like I did on the board Write em in your chart and circle any that don t belong Use your calculator It doesn t work Odd over even It doesn t work Oh no Which one doesn t work Seven over six doesn t work All right let s do this then The 6 7 were we correct there All right this one s right No This one was repeating or terminating Terminating All right so this one we need to move over here All right 5 13 I haven t checked Haven t check that one Five divided by 13 We don t know Too many decimals Okay if it s too many what do you think it s going to be Repeating Probably going to be repeating so that one looks good Let s do this Hold on I want you guys to try 11 24 I want you to do 15 14 I want you to check 199 over 200 and I want you all to check nine over 80 These rules already tested out That s terminating The rules weren t tested enough to be proven I think my rule is solid even though it s kind of condensed Five four three two one Thank you All right 11 24 It stays All right it repeats so it goes over here All right 15 14 Repeating All right let me change this though Let s change this one to 15 24 Check that one And while they re checking Point 625 Point 625 so it s actually going to terminate okay Repeating or terminating Terminating It terminated And nine over 80 Terminating Terminating okay so it didn t work So odd over even doesn t work Right it didn t work so let s think about it then We got a Do you know a rule I don t know so I m kind of doing this with you Let s look at this What is important Do you think the numerator is important Well if the numerator s what s important I think they re evenly important They re evenly important Without one the other wouldn t be the same fraction Do you agree He said Without one the other wouldn t be the same fraction What do you mean by that You said Which one s important If you say the numerator s important then if you change the denominator it might not work so they re not the same fraction without one another Okay If the numerator is one less than the denominator then it will be repeating If the numerator is one less than the denominator What about 5 13 That s just one rule there s multiple Right well I want to come up with just one rule that works for them all So let s look at this If the numerator is what s important can we not look at these two fractions here What do they both have in common They both have a common denominator and they have different numerators and it s actually put em in two separate categories but they re both odd Prime number Oh you re seeing something about prime number If it s prime over even it ll be repeating but a prime over an even would be Okay so we re gonna do prime over even is which one Repeating Prime over even is repeating Okay because even number has what factor in it Automatically Two A two and will a prime number have two as a factor A prime number will have two as a factor What are the factors of prime numbers One and itself The only problem with that is the number what Two Two okay so I think you re on to something If it s prime over even then it ll be repeating Prime over even then it s repeating I found a problem with that Here s what I want you to do I did 11 over eight 11 over eight It s prime over even Okay it is a mix number It s not a mixed number I m sorry It s a Improper fraction What would it need to be a mixed number A whole number And a fractional part Good job All right so here s my question then Here s what I want you to do Look up here and I think with fractions we always seem to stress when we re doing equivalent fractions To put a fraction in its what Simplest form Simplest form Anytime there s a prime number it s already going to be in its simplest form right Cause you can t reduce it anymore so these are already in their simplest forms What about 15 24 Is there a factor that they both have in common Three Three okay so if I factor out three out of fifteen Five I got a five Eight So that s an equivalent fraction so I m going to get rid of that Odd over even So maybe we could say in a fraction s what Simplest form Simplest form In a fraction s simplest form if it s odd over even then it what Terminates Terminates So are we doing a rule that applies to every number Every single number So if we were to make a conjecture do we just base it off of six numbers No What I want you to do is I want you as a group to come up with your own example that can either prove this or disprove this conjecture The conjecture is that a fraction in its simplest form if it s odd over even will terminate I want every group to make up their own as a group make up your own example Let s do 7 6 You make up your own Buck You make up your own You got notebook paper if you want it I made it up so can we do it again No I want a new one they haven t seen So 5 6 5 6 okay Try 5 6 Is it in simplest form Yes Okay And so it actually repeats It disproves the theory So it disproves it doesn t it 
 So here s the first set I thought I d start a little bit easy So go ahead and within your groups now I ll give you like a minute to tell me all the methods that you can of how to separate how to figure out which one it is Okay Go ahead You can uh You can you use Beer s Law for this right You aren t able to taste that You aren t able to that s not big enough Our Okay so Doesn t dissociate How s the temperature Boil it Yeah that s the only way So the one with the highest concentration s going to have the highest boiling point Yeah You could freeze it and weigh it Okay freezing it The point three would have the most weight Weight Yeah But which one would freeze first Point one Point one would freeze first because there s less Okay What else Point three weighs more But we would need to freeze it first no What We wouldn t need to freeze it The first one being would be with the tasting one Or the volume one I don t know the tasting one Okay you say the tasting one you say the volume one Whichever one comes first The one who boils fastest would be the one with the point one right Okay So the one that boils the fastest Point one You could measure the vapor pressure by also just leaving them and adding them and then just coming back after like five minutes or ten minutes Alright So we can have equal volumes of each solution right And then after like a certain time Alright that s it Everybody stop Stop stop stop Okay So who want to go first We ll start with with Miles I think you had your hand up first so go ahead What s one way that you can identify these things Well you could boil all the solutions until all the water vaporizes and the beaker with the most sugar in it would be the 0 3 molar 0 2 would be the middle and 0 1 would be the least Okay If they were all the same volume Ahh Yeah You guys heard that now Good Good listening skills on that If they were the same volume at the beginning alright Does everybody agree So one method is boil away and weigh Did you say weigh How do you know which one has the most I would imagine you could weigh it right You could weight it Start with equal volumes Okay There s several other ways How about Joseph If you take equal volumes of each solution and you taste them whichever one tastes more sugary would have the highest concentration Okay Anybody have comments on that Jimmy I don t think we re able to distinguish the taste that well Because our mouth isn t that sensitive Okay Miles What if someone dropped some lead nitrate in there So there s two concerns Obviously I think Miles is the most important You know you guys can see that I m smart enough to put the right substances I keep forgetting I m getting old And I may go in the back and I reach for the lead nitrate or something right And then the other part what do you guys think of the other part Could you taste the difference between a 0 2 0 3 and a 0 1 And just say Ah that s the sweetest one It s kind of hard Miles You d need some salt The problem I think is this is something we would actually need to try right I don t think this is a theoretical thing that we re trying to we re practicing theory here We would actually have to do this in a lab right I would imagine we would Wouldn t it be different for every person Because we could It could be different for every person right Because I can t see as well as you for example maybe right So there could be variations in tasting of those Ian Given excess humans Oh wait You re on the next one No on this one Alright I didn t get that either Okay so let s look at another method alright We re not going to list that one because we don t want to be tasting things Okay so Paran your group What about at equal volumes you could test the vapor pressure and the 0 1 would have the most and 0 3 would have the least because there s more sugar covering it What do you guys think Okay Juan He didn t say how you could measure it The way you could measure it is that with equal volumes you leave them out and the one that evaporates the fastest is the one with the highest vapor pressure Everybody agree Yeah Okay So that was my concern too right How do you measure the vapor pressure You re not wrong But how do measure it And thank you Juan for bringing that up Could you repeat that Okay so you would take equal volumes and leave them out to evaporate because they d always be evaporating The one with the highest vapor pressure which is 0 1 molar would evaporate the most after a certain amount of time So I m going to write this as evaporation rate Who s got another method Different view Alright Jimmy Okay so you re gonna put the same amount in a sealed container and put it into light Whichever one grows algae first is the 0 3 Then the second one is 0 2 the last one 0 1 What do you guys think Could you repeat that So you re going to take equal amounts take it into the light make sure it s the same conditions for each one and then whichever one grows algae first is the 0 3 Second is 0 2 last is 0 1 What do you guys think I know some of you guys are thinking that s bio but you took it most of you at least right So we could finish this What do you think Wouldn t it take a long time for the algae to start growing It s going to work right Nobody sees Where s the algae You re always asking me Come one folks You think about this I m going to say the problems But I want you to tell me first alright Alright let s go with Ivan I don t think the results would be consistent Because what if some algae cells just go in one solution and start going there for no reason So because you didn t mention how much algae you put in there could be an issue there What else though No Juan you go alright I don t think you can assume that you have all the necessary stuff in the water for the algae to grow in the first place So I think Juan is saying growing conditions require lots of other things Not just amount of sugar and amount of water There could be other nutrients is that what you re saying Yeah Nutrients and other things of that sort Could I just back up for a sec Algae produces sugar right Assuming that you re talking about algae that grows they use carbon dioxide So my hunch is there s several right One I think as Ivan pointed out you ve got to put in a certain amount Why don t you put in something that eats the sugar like yeast and then we could all finish and have a beer at the end You picked algae so yeah Although is that a bad idea It could work but we have to be careful with conditions A lot of conditions need to be met Anything else You boil them Hold on Let these guys go If you have equal volumes and you add heat to them 0 1 should boil first Okay so you could use boiling point Elevation I wrote this down before we even discussed it But everybody agrees that works right So what s another easy one that we boiling point elevation right You need me to repeat that or you got it What immediately follows with that idea Freezing point depression Freezing point depression Okay what else I have a question for you then Could we use Beer s Law for this No Tell me why Could we use Beer s Law for this Ian you have your hand up At first glace I would say no because I do not believe that stuff actually has a coloring solution What do you guys think Yep Don t you need color Unless what Unless Come on keep going with this stuff Not you Ian You spoke I d like to have as many people participate as possible Alright Nick go ahead You could add food coloring possibly Yeah you could add food coloring and maybe the higher concentration would appear darker possibly Nick we re trying to figure out the difference between these right Yeah What do you mean add You mean add a drop to each of these Yeah But then what would you be measuring The food coloring You wouldn t be measuring the sugar You know what I mean Yeah I know what you mean You re still okay with that Uh I don t know Wait Nick If you add food coloring how much One drop Yeah Okay One drop to each of these right Now they all look the same Don t they Yeah And if I stick this in my spectral photometer they should all measure the same Did I succeed in figuring out which one is which You understand that right Yeah yeah Okay Nat Could you somehow measure how fast the food coloring spreads That s interesting Could you measure how fast the food coloring spreads You d have to indicate that high concentration would Teacher Hang on But once again we have to be careful of conditions right All the temperatures have to be the same What do you guys think Sure Why would that work Because the sugar molecules are getting wet and it s not able to spread through the molecules So that would be in the 0 3 Science Glad you like it Alright How about wait Gevorg hasn t spoken So I m thinking Gevorg it s your turn buddy What did you want to add You wanted to add a new technique Okay go ahead If we did a Benedict s Test I don t know if it would just turn the same color because I m not sure how the Benedict s reacts with different concentrations But maybe if you put the same amount of Benedict s and if it gets darker or it gets affected with the molarity then you could use a color emitter or a spectrometer to test What do you guys think Benedict s is a reaction between this Benedict s stuff with sugar to show the presence of sugar What comes out of the reaction I m not sure but it s a color change Oh well the more color change But if the color change is too intense it could just be like it s all going to change that color or not see what I m saying That s what your pointing out right So again that sounds like an experimental one Could I share one more How about this You know when you take your AP test you just don t know what And we started with something that I think is sort of easy Could you use density What do you guys think Someone who hasn t talked yet Could we use density And how do we use density What do you guys think No Alright Ian Since nobody s going for it Do I have to say it Go ahead and say it Tell me how Tell us how Take equal volume of each of the three and weigh it Exactly Which one s going to weigh the most The one that has the most sugar okay If you take equal volumes this one will weigh the most This will be the most dense The more sugar you add the denser it gets You know this right Does anybody have any more Alright let s move on Set number two Now this says solid and I m trying to get you to see a different range on these Go ahead and talk about it I ll give you a minute or so Colors Conductivity We could root the potassium chloride out with conductivity Well they re solid You have to remember So solid has a lot of problems with it That s just solving it It s hard to conduct a current Well you could dissolve it It s doable It s just a little difficult Potassium Then um Wait calcium What about pH sensing So CACL2 Well they re solids Oh if you put them into a solvent Yeah Can we put them into solvents Can we make it into So lead can t dissolve in water right Lead I mean lead chloride No lead chloride will not dissolve in water But then KCL and CACL2 would They would So you can rule that out That s one way But then how do you figure out between the other solution Couldn t there be a bigger concentration of chloride and then you could form a precipitate I wouldn t say form a precipitate I would say Actually I m thinking you can hybridize the fact the lead chloride doesn t dissolve at all with boiling point elevation freezing point depression because you re going to have more little bits in the CACL2 than the KCL As an end result calcium chloride potassium chloride get what PBCL2 does nothing So after that if you boil it right Calcium chloride potassium the higher value Alright you guys That s it Let s gather up Okay Some of you guys just got back so you guys know what we re doing right Yes Okay Let s get it together Alright everybody stop now Christina you had your hand up first Take the easiest one What s the easiest way to distinguish these You could take equal amounts of each of them and weigh them and then PBCL2 would be the heaviest and the KCL would be the lightest Equal volumes I mean equal amounts What s an amount though Like grams But if I take equal grams then I could have ten grams of this ten grams of this ten grams of that No I didn t say that Alright what did you say then I meant like equal Equal what Volume Volume okay Now let s answer that one What do you guys think She s saying take let s say 10 milliliters 10 milliliters 10 milliliters And this one s going to weigh the most This one would weigh which one s second Oh sorry Second would be CACL2 Okay so this one would be second What do you guys think Someone other than Ian Okay Ian go ahead Does atomic weight atomic mass directly influence Listen to this Miles Does atomic mass directly influence density That s the question Does the formula mass have anything to do with the density of these solids They re all ionic compounds And the answer to that is no You cannot assume that because this has the highest formula mass that this is the most dense Okay Where just to follow that up where could you use formula mass in relationship to density in a pattern that works Ivan Oh wait let s give it to him Just he s just walked in Niresh Is it in gases Gases right Does everybody agree Gases you could do that If the formula mass is high on a gas then it s going to have more density Could you do that for liquids now Could you do that for liquids Ivan You could do it if it s all the same subsets for different concentrations 
 Love the many questions that you re asking Asking questions is a great way especially if you re wondering something Feel free to ask it even if you go in a little bit different direction Also the more you reference the book you can give us some things going on in Brave New World and the more specific you can be the better that helps us understand somebody actually connected to the book and maybe how it s connected to them So two things to be thinking about But if you give examples the more specific you can of real world examples also the better off You guys are doing a fantastic job though Talking having a natural conversation letting each other speak and all that So continue with the next question Are we doing that on here What s that Are we doing what we re supposed to in here Yeah and my outside people ya ll are doing fine continue with whatever you want to put on here As long as it s related to the conversation obviously Ya ll want to talk about Bernard John now Yeah Absolutely Alright how do these characters show a variety of ideas about individualism and conformity I ll just kind of start out Here s my answer I kind of said that they were like the Russians who wanted their blue jeans They knew what they wanted and they kinda went for it And in the end society pretty much pushed them back into their place And was like No don t stand up and rise up against us Well I would say I see a similarity between like Bernard and John because they both had individual ideals but I definitely that John was a lot stronger in his beliefs than Bernard was because I think about how Bernard had at first he was all individual and he had these individual beliefs and then when he when they got in trouble kind of in a way all three of them with the uprising and all that kind of stuff He kind of went back on what he was saying And John he stuck to it like he actually did something about it When he actually kind of protested and he was able to go back to being an individual And he went into doing his own thing with his own beliefs So I just feel like John was a lot stronger in what he believed throughout it than Bernard who was kind of allowing people to look at him put on him worried about what other people thought about him and all that kind of stuff That s true Cuz like whenever Bernard was more of I guess a weirdo he does always like question society and why everybody acts the way they do But as soon as he started being popular he started bragging to Helmholtz about how like right here it says And I had six girls last week one on Monday two on Tuesday two more on Friday one on Saturday So as soon as he became just like everybody else he started to like it far more and it mattered much to him that people like people did what they did like not explicit relationships and everything So you re right John was stronger than Bernard I don t think John ever conformed he stuck to his beliefs pretty much the whole time Yeah he always stayed an individual like he made sure he didn t conform Was Helmholtz conformist or individualistic Because he did a lot of the same things that you know normal people do but he also read as an idealism at times I think he s somebody who he conformed to what he had to just to get by But at the same time he had his own thoughts and believed what he believed I just don t think he really stood up for what he believed in So we re Yeah I think so It s almost like it s almost like a fair weather friend He did what was best for him to keep him going got hit and suffered trouble I feel like I don t know maybe I m crazy but I thought Helmholtz was like reminds me of this is stereotypical but he kind of reminds me of like an old professor you know He like just like goes to work Helmholtz has like good thoughts about stuff but then he didn t like live the life Wasn t he some sort of He was like a top guy professor A psychologist or something He was a scientist Alright so kind of sticking on that topic What about the books and how they nobody really read how they kind of all of the books related to I guess individuality and the whole world what life was like before was locked up I can say the same John was reading Shakespeare and how Shakespeare is all about like love and tragedy and there s like sorrow and there s also you know the aspect of love with Romeo Juliet And how the people didn t really Helmholtz would his job was reading it to them and he started laughing about it because he was trained not to So I think if people actually read about it you know the feelings and how love is supposed to be Then people wouldn t go along with how their relationships would be because they d wanna maybe wanna experience falling in love with someone or having that one person would cause a lot more problems with that knowledge along with seeing how people how there s tragedy People are becoming sad and how in the New World people are always supposed to be happy and everyone s getting along Then in these stories there s like love conflict and everyone is fighting and it would cause problems because from that people could form their own individual problems and then they start to have their own individuality and form opinions and start asking questions which leads to a lot of things Books are they pretty much written to express those emotions in which the whole state is trying to block up anyways That was why they re there So the book do you think that the books are kind of what drove Bernard to be a nonconformist and then as he got away from reading and he started conforming back into society What I think happened cuz they were saying I think he was like bipolar or something and everyone else was like something He was shorter than everyone else and I think he was already kind of like put aside cause they were saying that they think he had alcohol given to him as he was a baby so that made him weird So all along he wasn t like everyone else So he wasn t a like no one accepted him for who he was but whenever he got famous or whatever people began to accept him Huh He wasn t able to conform is that what you re saying Yeah I don t think he was able to conform because no one accepted him for who he was except for Helmholtz I think if someone else was in his position like read even like saw a book they probably wouldn t even try to read the way he did They were so used to not I don t know not having books I don t think the same thing would happen to somebody else It kind of reminds me of I don t know if you guys have seen the movie The Book of Eli How the entire time he s trying to hide the Bible because that one guy wants the Bible because he wants control over everybody Because like if he has like everything in the Bible he could like tell people certain things and they would just listen to him so he could be a master Like in this book how everybody like the Controllers just want control over everybody and without books like I think it s just another type of their control That s a good example Also if you think about it present day a lot of people don t even read books anymore They mostly know that they can and you can watch the movies instead There is also technology where you can learn about something without even actually having to read the book So do you think in a way that s kind of like the same way of eliminating how they did in the story and how they eliminate books and there s more technology is like a weakness Today you know we re all about technology so we eliminate more books and there s more movies and more technology Real quick I wanna throw in one scene that I want you guys to think about also You just brought up a point about if people in the world today saw these books would they even know what to do with them What would they think about them We do have a point in Brave New World where someone does see a book that isn t used to seeing these type of books and responds to it When Helmholtz looks at the Shakespeare that John has So what did you make of Helmholtz s response to Shakespeare And what do you think that maybe suggests about people s attitudes in the World State Especially since the Helmholtz would represent I guess an enlightened view point in the World State You remember the scene that I m talking about Yeah Yeah he started off by laughing at it and didn t later on in the scene he kind of hid the fact that he had read it and that he knew what was going on I m just wondering where it all It s page 183 Page 184 says the second paragraph like third or fourth line Helmholtz said listen to the scenes of the world first meeting with a puzzled interest I mean I guess being the enlightened thinker Helmholtz is kinda curious about it and wanted to know more But at the same time he had that conformity which was kinda scaring him away from it Cuz he didn t want to get in trouble I guess He doesn t really seem to understand what s going on in Romeo Juliet because at the bottom of page 184 same page we saw him laughing about it because he didn t understand why the mother and father are trying to force the daughter on someone she didn t want So I mean it just kind of shows how different things were I guess that goes back to the differences in society between then and now For now and the future Like to do the last comments about John or Bernard comparing and contrasting I come up with something that didn t really get mentioned John the reason he s an individual is cause he was born he was like literally born and grew up on the reservation Bernard the reason he s an individual is because of his physical stature So Bernard is an individual because of physically but John is different because of who he is He was born like that so that s what makes they re two different people in individuality standard And that s why I thought that Bernard was so easy to go back to conformity because the only thing that made him different was his height And that s why John couldn t because of who he was I thought Bernard was the person that John would be if John had been born and raised in his World State where Bernard had The only thing that made John different is that he spent so much time on the reservation where everyone s different They value individuality You had some good ideas just to kind of wrap up with that last question Something to think about also you guys kind of hit it on this essentially what we have is two characters in Bernard and John that both do not fit into their communities Right And the world is saying everything is designed to fit exactly and if you don t fit then you re removed from that situation And the Savage Reservation you are basically shamed out of that group Now that s the way John he s trying to interact but because of his mother and because of his birth he is shamed out of it But notice whenever John goes to the World State and Bernard takes him and becomes a celebrity because of it All the sudden Bernard is very happy to be part of the World State So once Bernard can actually conform and gain advantage from that type of society he s more than happy to continue on in it John though being the way he is he s never had the opportunity to conform to any kind of society and he still has that shame culture inside of him that he continues to live by the whole time he s in the World State right So that s something to think about too is not only are they isolated when they are born and different Then what happens when all the sudden one of them can conform and can be a valued member of that society which John sort of is but it s more for him being strange and weird and exotic then it is him being a person and being brought into it Guys that was a great first half What I need you guys to do in the center circle is go ahead and log in to your computers Outside circle people jot down any last minute ideas you want on your paper responses And then in just a minute we ll switch So now we re taking notes as well as having the competition on there Correct and did that go ok for outside folks Yeah It was ok to do both We can still take notes while we re on the inner circle right Oh sure absolutely 
 In case you think there s something missing and then we ll see what you got Okay The tongue does with the The tongue Oh yeah because the trachea will swallow it No the trachea s the air The esophagus close your The esophagus is the food pipe for the thing No the esophagus is the thing that stops the food The esophagus is the food part the windpipe is the trachea You talking about the epiglottis Oh the epiglottis That s the flap of skin that stops it food going down your trachea your air passageway So you don t choke Right How do you spell that How do you spell what Are you gonna put that in there somewhere Well here s what I m talking about you only need four people in this group and you don t have as many pieces of paper Don t take more without asking why are you taking more Why Because Tyler got on it Go wash it in the sink I ll mark down on my clipboard who s having trouble with self control Go to the sink and wash it with soap and water All right so you guys do not have the same number of papers that they have at the other table because you only have four people so I m gonna let you add more If you feel that you could add a few more pieces to fill it out more go for it And then I ll check in with y all in just a minute Add head Yeah but she said it has to be a word What s another word for stomach acid Stomach acid Acid Why don t you put acid That could be anything In your stomach Stomach acid s kinda like a compound word Well actually since stomach s already here and if we put acid right here you can t just say it s any kind of acid Yeah because it s going down the mouth to the throat to the and they have acid in the stomach Well that s the intestine Duh acid I m gonna stop you right now because we wanna take this to another level but what I have is I have several groups with several different ways of looking at it What seems to be a common thread among some of you is to order things to put them in an order of sequence I had one group that grouped them So what I m asking is that I m still seeing a little bit of food in there and I m still seeing that you ve got processes some people have processes in there and body parts we got lots of body parts So what I m gonna ask you to do is if we could put if we could create a big system on the board with the pieces and if there are duplicates this is why I didn t want you sticking em too much we just put it on top So I m gonna ask you to do this this is gonna be tricky we re not gonna have a lot of time so I m gonna ask you to bring by groups your Post Its and put them on the board this is our work space So if you think it should be in out five groups four of you think it should be in a linear kind of grouping so we re gonna go with the sequence of events order So what I want you to do is put em on the board and let s look at what you ve got if there s duplicates put it on top if there s something you have that s different figure out where if you can move something can it share a space does it happen at the same time We talked about it over there what three things did you have Esophagus throat and neck So they thought those were on equal grounds That they were all either in the same place or the same function I wasn t sure I didn t ask them but they ve got them together So this is gonna be hard It s real easy sitting there with your group of five or six or four people Now you ve gotta work with twenty four twenty three Okay So we re gonna start with Group One And if you can just come stick em on the board and I m gonna get Group Four next And you ll go up with them So you have to make one picture on this board that shows me how you think they fit If you wanna put them in the same order don t make them touch leave enough room for manipulations Yes No Pardon The abdomen is the middle the butt is the fleshy part The anus is the actual opening and the rectum is the tube Yeah so it s very distinct differences They can t interchange All right so just stick em on and then move quickly Got em All right got em on That s why I said they re not going to stick well if you keep sticking them on your face and get the oil from your face All right Make sure you agree Now you re gonna go up there with your Post It notes You may need to use some of their pieces you re welcome to move any of their pieces to fit in since you re coming up there after them And the group that comes after you will be free to move any of your pieces okay All right y all pay attention All right Got em All right can you do me a favor and plan before you get up here how you re gonna do it so we can make it move quickly All right guys have a seat Now they don t they have some words you don t have So how are you gonna make this work You gonna put yours up above it We re gonna put ours in our order we could fit their s in there There you go however you wanna do it Come up and get their voices What s next mouth Water where s water I think we need mouth I have teeth Tongue then teeth Mouth I have taste buds It was tongue teeth then chewing It was tongue then teeth Saliva it was saliva saliva Chewing I think it was tongue then saliva No It was tongue taste buds saliva teeth Then chew And then I think it was esophagus next I have intestine stomach and waste Stomach and then intestines and then waste And then kidney no put em on the same All right we put theirs up now teeth intestines I m gonna leave you guys for last over there you have a smaller group I m gonna leave you for last All right All right so health Health should be overall I guess it s like yeah Yeah you get health from eating Proteins go with food no Yeah nutrients How are you doing It s kind of hard to put this in the same group with So you were looking linear and now it s hard to go linear because they ve thrown these other things in Yeah you have a scrap board what do you do You might wanna build off That s what I m saying or like switching some some of them are very vague And that s exactly it If they re vague you re not quite sure how they tie in you weren t there for their discussion So you don t know what their train of thought was So make it work And realize that somebody s gonna come behind you and they might change it Let s put protein and nutrients But health is overall All right this is getting very interesting Their strategy You have to realize and I ll make the point while we re waiting for them to finish because they re having their own discussions When you have your discussion with your group your having a discussion with a small group So when you get up there and you see a word and you weren t there for the discussion that brought that word into the list you weren t there you don t know what their thinking was So just like we always say you can t disregard somebody s input because you don t believe it should be there You have to find a way oh I m sorry I m sorry Thank you I need you next because y all have the next least amount Thank you for catching that You have to make sure that what you do doesn t lose the meaning or change the meaning and doesn t judge somebody else s input you have to just make it work Grab it If you know where it goes All right but if by some chance that s what happens when you start stacking we can use this masking tape in little tiny pieces All right go for it Ooh Are you all right is it still working You re fine Yes we re okay You lost a nose we dropped a nose A nose But you see it s OK it may not have stood out in your discussion And you might have brought something to the discussion that they didn t Y all gotta talk louder Okay nose should be here Literally put it right on top of it Stomach okay teeth chewing epiglottis esophagus wait esophagus esophagus wait If you have to move something or if you think it needs to be This is the esophagus In other words if you think you have to move something over to fit yours in because it s not there And then Intestines And then acid This word s already here So right after the mouth Then intestines and then to the kidneys and then to the waste and then health Do you wanna move it somewhere else If you think something should be on the same plain I just use the example of Scrabble game with them I think saliva I think water and food Once you put it into your mouth you re gonna get saliva Okay so see what they did So if you feel like you need to move anything we need to get saliva back in there so how s saliva gonna work Saliva goes with taste buds and mouth And tongue Put it like in the middle Okay it should stick Wait discuss go ahead tell them what you think It looks like Are y all ready are you almost ready No You do know the more that get up there the harder it gets So you re making it harder for us No I m making it harder for them Oh All right I m coming Got it They have like three on intestines Let s put a little piece of tape to hold up the intestines Yeah just stick a little piece up at the top It doesn t matter And can you add this to the waste so it doesn t fall All right you guys good Okay go All right how are y all doing out there Are you watching this unfold Yeah And Group One I mean Three Group Three You guys look at the task ahead of you it s gotten bigger I need tape All right I m gonna give you a little bit I d like you not to put too much on the board more on the paper You have to figure out if you have a duplicate then just tape it over the top of it Anything that s duplicate All right all right I need tape You need tape all right so Where do you put stomach All right so he s got a question about where to put stomach No I have stomach acid I m seeing where she s putting stomach It s over here this is acid All right so it s way down there So move down there I need some tape And I will tell you the same thing I told the other two groups Think about Scrabble So if you have to go in a different direction to make something work you just go in a different direction you make it work Okay you guys have the hardest job Or it might be the easiest Mucus Where does the gallbladder go What is that epiligotis oh my bad But look how much came out That s good we didn t have that much expansion on that idea before all we had was body parts Can we have tape for two What do you need Two pieces of tape All right two pieces of tape All right how we doing Emily where do I put mucus Mucus goes with the in between The neck thing Is that everything All right y all ready Would you do me a favor and tell Mr Dresser we need five more minutes You have a test Oh tell him three minutes Thank you So we need three minutes You got it Okay I think it s good All right ready guys All right have a seat Okay now everybody goes up last group Take your papers go I need a band aid For what To put over my Your what Let me look and see if I have one Sometimes you have those little bitty ones Okay I will look If you need them Thank you All right if you re stacking it and it won t stick I have tape Here stick your mouth on that mouth This we can put over this can we change this Yes Use this all right you got it Here just put it like that All right how are y all doing What do you have left Why don t you Alex would you lift up health and move my volcanoes just slide the volcano down it ll come off Just slide it down Now you can do it that way Do you need more tape All right how are we doing In case it doesn t stick Got it All right now I want you to while you are waiting and I appreciate the patience that you guys have had I want you to watch and look at what it looks like now Because some of you made some significant placements and they ve made some significant changes to that So take a look at what the resulting image is here Y all finished Wait don t you think this should be over there That s right they get to you have your perspective and they re bringing theirs to it And they had what could have been the hardest part or the easiest part Okay I wanna pick up on one thing that you guys said because one of the things that you had when you came here and the group was already had already laid all this out was that they felt strongly that the mouth needed to be here So why Because food goes in there Paging Mrs Dalton Dalton come in I m sorry hold on Try it again Like if you re eating something like a hamburger or you re drinking water it s gonna go straight to your mouth and then it goes in there So in the order that we ve established here do you see what they did Do you agree with that Yeah Is it logical Yeah OK is there anything else that you placed that you recognize was changed And you wanna know why it was changed Or you went Oh Because I did hear a lot of Oh we didn t think of that when you were watching these things go up Like at first I thought that that should go before that Don t know that I don t know what that is Um the glucose water and food Okay this column of Yes I thought that that should go before the mouth because I was like But don t you put it in don t you put the food in your mouth And they were like Yeah but once it enters your body it s not first in the Okay using that logic is there anything else that should be adjusted Blair Uh where the nose is Okay what do you think we should do with that You should put the nose right before the mouth or after because it s like you kinda smelled it before you put it in your mouth So would this be logical if I moved this over and put this here like he suggested Yes I want to disagree You disagree you re welcome to Smelling it is not a part of digesting it at all Yeah that s what I said Is growling a part of digesting it No It s the way your body reacts to the smell If we use your logic I m not saying remember the way we work things in here is that you can t judge if it s right or wrong you can certainly disagree with it that s true I may disagree but this is your work this is not for me to this is what you re thinking So but using the logic you used growling light headed and dryness in mouth is not a part of digestion but what do these things have in common I saw someone what do these things here have in common They re symptoms of hunger OK so you re calling them symptoms of hunger What else might they be Indicators Indicators Is there another word Signals Signals If you have stomach growling you feel light headed you have a dryness in your mouth that s a signal right And where does the nose fit in to that And I ll come back to you You have an answer for my question with the nose Or you have something else to add Like the nose the nose indicates that you re allowed to put food in your mouth and so you prepare with the saliva so you can help break it down So the nose so if you can t smell It s like when you have a cold you can t really taste things Okay but does the saliva not flow Because you can t smell Because you said you need to smell to be able to get the saliva to break it down So if you can t smell if you have a stuffy nose or if you don t have a sense of smell does that stop the saliva No No she said I don t know And that s an okay answer She doesn t know You could have an opinion 
 The yellow has less water That s true And more H plus Because a higher concentration of The higher the concentration of the acid Yes Yes So you think it s something about the acid that s causing the color Yeah What about the blue food coloring This stays the same Yeah But why would you think this stays the same and it s the acid that s changing color Okay so the concentration of the blue food coloring is the same but the amount of acid is not So I must be changing the color of the acid So it s the acid that s changing color You re not changing the color of the acid though Anybody else got ideas about that That something else that could explain it That s one hypothesis You put the same amount of food coloring in every time right Yeah Wait so the acid is probably likely to maybe like lose an electron The acid loses electrons What is an acid It gives up an H plus right There are more moles of Hydrogen ions Right acid s dissociate So I got more molds of H plus in this one Okay Emma you have an idea Well there are more I think I might have gotten it confused Basically there s a higher concentration of acid as you go along right So more here Yeah There s more when it s lighter Lowest most Yeah I know Okay So that gives it more reason for a more drastic color change then Because there are more H pluses if you will that could cause it to jump in energy Okay so you got the idea of energy is some kind of something s jumping Because you know Could it be the separation between the two sets of the orbital in the food coloring itself that s changing Okay Which is why the blue color changes to the like brownish yellow So now what is your idea about what s changing color The orbital the food coloring is changing color The food coloring is changing color Yeah the food okay so that makes sense The food coloring is changing color but the acid concentration is making it change color Yeah So the food coloring s like the dependent variable right What is in the food coloring That s a good question That s what we need to know What is in the food coloring The same thing that s in the cabbage indicator actually Well something similar they re called anthocyanins And I have a little handout to show you what they look like So before we do that though Actually no I ll show you a picture of an anthocyanin and have you hypothesize a little bit more about what might be happening here So here s an anthocyanin It s this molecule here So usually anthocyanins have lots of benzene rings in them Okay So what is happening what is causing the different colors So we had the idea of something to do with orbitals and something jumping In the food coloring In the food coloring But the food coloring isn t transition metal It s not a transition metal no Can you still have that happen Well what else could there be Well I think it s the O H because Is it like splitting up the p orbitals What makes you say that There s like SP 3 orbitals and I guess p2 orbitals Okay so are you saying it s that splitting of SP 3 and SP 2 orbitals or the P orbitals I was thinking it s the P orbitals Okay so what here would represent the P orbitals Whatever bonded with the acid The O H maybe Oh would it be the no Okay so here s what we re going to do I m going to give you this handout and what I would like you to do I want you to highlight all of the double bonds in one color Then I want you to highlight all of the single bonds in another color okay You should have highlighters by your table Purple I ll take green Do you want us to do it for all of them Yeah let s just do it let s do it for the first one to start with Anthocyanins in red wine we ll do that So anthocyanins are in lots of different compounds Anything that has color really wine grapes cabbage red onions food coloring Are they they re not in colorless though right Or are they Say it again They can t be colorless because it s colorless Well kind of you ll see We ll explain that in a little bit yeah Is something colorless because they don t have any d electrons or like the d orbital is filled up with electrons Or are there other factors Yes that s true for transition metals But for other things For other things that are colorless what would explain why they were colorless It would have to be a different orbital Different wave length Like the absorption based on the bond Yes to both of you So Riley s idea is that maybe so what did we say color came from earlier Color in general where does color in general come from Reflecting certain frequencies and absorbing other frequencies of light right Okay so we can only see purple to red So is there another explanation for why something might be colorless Because it Probably because it s absorbing everything Well if it was absorbing everything what color would it be Black Oh it s not absorbing anything It s not absorbing anything Or not absorbing Any color It s not absorbing what we can see It s not absorbing what we can see that s right It s not absorbing what we can see It reflects all the colors So you guys see a pattern yet Can I borrow somebody s Let me borrow yours Let s put it under the camera as an example here What do you notice Were we supposed to highlight Single bonds yes What do you notice about the relationships between double and single bonds The double bonds right next to each other The double bonds are next to the single bonds The double bond are next to the single bonds That s right that s right Okay in the first one where you have What color is the first one does is say It just says colored Red wine But we have colored and we have colorless Okay so in the colored one how many can you count how many times it goes double single double single double single That s like a tongue twister It s seven in colored I got seven Okay so now count colorless and see what you get What did you guys get For double single I got like 14 Okay so are you counting double and single as Yeah yeah Okay so you basically got seven too Okay so do colorless now Double bonds between every single bond between the bonds with the C N O I got eight for colored I got 17 in the singles and eight doubles for that Okay what s the difference between colored and colorless basically And the number of double and single bonds There are more singles than colorless Okay not the total numbers oh wait there s more singles than colorless Okay that s a way we can look at it Okay see if the same We got seven for colorless Okay Is it supposed to be the same number No no no it s not supposed to be the same Alright let s hear what Gracie has to say Say what you just said So in colored there s more doubles and there s less singles So that means that there s going to be more of the single doubles But then in colorless there s less doubles and more singles so that means there s less single doubles Can somebody restate that Just so that I can make sure that you understand what she said Does that mean that if there are more double bonds than there are that colors So say it again When there are more double bonds there s a color or something Okay when there s more double bonds there s a color Does that seem like the pattern we re noticing here It has to do with pi bonding Why does it have to do with pi bonding Because it s an overlap of p orbitals Overlap of p orbitals Which allows the delocalized electrons to like Okay so what did you say Con Delocalization Delocalization the delocalization comes from Pi bonds what is a pi bond It s the overlap of what P orbitals P orbitals p orbitals okay So when it goes double single double single double single what s happening there How does that create It s like one big pi bond Like when you have like earlier you were talking about whatcha ma call its I can t articulate Delocalization No like One giant p orbital Yeah like sort of yeah one giant p orbital Like one giant pi bond it like expands from like through different Oh and like a benzene shape and then that makes a circle Yeah and it s not actually like here s one here s one pi bond here s one pi bond here s one It s like they re like all pi bonded They re like all pi bonded to each other okay So in which case in which case are they all pi bonded to each other The colored form or the colorless form I d say colored because they are all close to each other Like the pi bonds The pi bonds say it again They re close to each other They re close to each other in the colored form So is there more There s more double bonds There s more double bonds in the colored Yeah so they would have to be closer to each other There are more double bonds in colored less double bonds in colorless Okay so how many of you say there s less double bonds in the colorless Less double bonds in the colorless Three There s only seven double bonds in colorless and there s eight in colored And there s more leftover singles Wait for which one for colored Oh you re counting the far left one Yeah this one has eight This is an intermediate one So then it s seven and seven Seven and seven okay So how many if you were to try to connect So the idea is that it makes one giant p orbital If you were going to connect all of the p orbitals which one would have the most gigantic p orbital Colored Colored Is that clear to everybody Why did you say colorless Did you say colorless Yeah I don t understand why Because there s a bunch of single bonds Because the pi bond is more in the middle of the two other things Wait for the far left Does that make any sense We re talking about the far left one Let s look at all three So which one of these is going to have the most giant pi bond The middle one The middle one Because it s an intermediate And they re more double bonds Does anyone disagree that it s going to be the middle one that would have the most giant p orbital Okay Alright let s look at some more down here Did you guys do does somebody have these highlighted No I think Rebecca you have them highlighted right Okay so let s look at these two here Can we apply our hypothesis So what is our hypothesis by the way More overlap of p orbitals the more colored it is Okay the more overlap of p orbitals the more colored it is That s our hypothesis Is it supported by these two on the side here Can we highlight the exterior So what do you think Is our hypothosis supported by these two Alright Con can you explain Well I mean it just looks like there s a bunch of conjunctions of single bonds where the streak of double single is kind of broken Okay right so there s a streak of double single double single double single double single double single So imagine you start somewhere Have you guys ever heard the song that never ends Yes This is the song that never ends Okay we re not gonna sing it it never ends So in this case if we were to just go around going double single double single double single double single double single double single double single double single double single would I ever get to an end necessarily Would I here How about if I went double still single double single double single double single But that s single single Single single So which one s going to have a more extensive pi bond The top one so that sort of fits our hypothesis that the more pi bonding there is the more colored it is Okay so what causes color in these compounds Shared electrons More shared electrons that are shared how Pi bonds More pi bonds equals what More area for the electrons to move around Okay more area for them More delocalization okay So let s take it back to this to our acid and blue food coloring demonstration Why are these different colors What is happening here Let s put this together Oh is it the H is taking more of the delocalized electrons because H is positive What do you think Because there s a higher concentration So say it again Okay so since H is a positive ion it takes more of the since there s more it takes more of the delocalized electrons Okay so it s taking more of the delocalized electrons So how does that explain the color change Can somebody add onto that There s less electrons so I guess there s less More double bonding There s less energy absorbed No there s increased So is more energy being absorbed or less energy being absorbed when it s yellow More energy is being absorbed that s why it s yellow Exactly that creates further Because there are more electrons bonding with the H plus than there is in the It s about absorption Ah okay Ruth say that 
 Okay so for social needs we said that their social needs are being met because they They look like the slave traders can talk to each other because they speak the same language but the slaves don t so their social needs with each other aren t So you feel your social needs are being met Yeah And how so Because our person can talk to Cause you have people to talk to don t you Yeah Anybody agree with that I agree because our person You I am You re that person Don t say my person cause that s you I can talk to other people So you do have some social interaction So there s some disagreement there as social needs are being met or not No hands Nita jump in We cannot So your social needs are not being met Yes our social needs are not being met because we They do not understand each other meaning like deaf Or they cannot talk So how does that make you feel Go ahead and talk about your emotional needs now being met or not being met Our emotional needs are not being met right now I think I disagree I think ours are kind of being met I agree with Lauren s Ours are being met because they re more happy that they re gonna get a lot of money You re the person But our person is kinda serious like he doesn t really want So as far as what Nita s already talked about Emotionally So are your emotional needs being met He looks angry You feel safe you re good to go Yeah cause we know we re She s like I don t really want to go but They want the money But we want money We want all the money Well it s the physical needs anyway Ours Ours are not being met Ours are being met cause we get weapons and everything all good food I agree And ours are also being met You don t want to mess with them Yeah I disagree with both of you guys because ours are not being met at all Definitely not We are like We re starving Starving My needs are not being met if I m Ashley because I m scrunched together I m uncomfortable My physical needs aren t being met because it s crowded and my muscles ache Does anyone agree with that That their physical needs are not being met I agree that Ashley s physical needs aren t being met because they are scrunched together and it looks like they re in chains and they don t have much Are your physical needs being met Yes Our physical needs are being met because I disagree with you because I think you have space Our physical needs are being met We re not like You re in good shape With your physical needs being met how does that link to emotional and social needs How do those kind of all go together Talk about how those all go together overall and how does that make you feel based on this picture You re that person so use first person point of view and discuss how those are all intertwined And then add to your conversation as far as I know some of you did the bottom two as far as not These are what are being met and these are not being met So make sure you cover those two okay How they all intertwine or if they do And then you can discuss these bottom questions too Even if you didn t get to them with your partner jump in now with each other I ll be right back Alright so My emotional needs are being met I m earning the money that I should be and I feel confident All of our emotional needs all of our needs are being met Why are the clothes taken off and why are the Just in case Emotional needs are not they do jump overboard being met It looks like they re sad because because we look depressed And you can just tell it by the faces and what they look like Our faces and their and our body language And there was and we re scared because we see the weapons and we don t know what they re gonna do with it to us So think about the cause and effect of that Our emotional kinda was being met Are the people standing up No But how are they not chained Still all of our emotional needs are being met They re running away They don t look worried they look kind of like they re looking at the scenery kind of They look calm In their expression they look calm yeah They don t look worried or anything These people but the people that are sitting down I disagree with Alan cause they look calm and confident I kinda disagree with that because they look like That s why they re all facing different directions They re watching for anything suspicious They re all looking in different directions They aren t smiling like they re looking at beautiful scenery There s like little sections in between so like Grayson said if they do jump overboard they don t all fall over and tip the boat Do you think these people are all in one group No let me rewind and say my question again Do you feel that these people all everybody in this boat was represented by a perspective from your discussion you just had Do you understand my question I m not saying it very well Were roles of all these people in the boat given to at least somebody in this group Yeah You think so How were the roles different I think there s bosses and then there was slaves Like slave traders and them Kind of serious like they just got their reward and these people they look kind of like chained I don t think they re running away I think they re running away I think they re going to a bigger boat cause these people look like I think they re like That s not the full canoe And they re just taking the slaves to the big boat So let me say my question again Let me say my question again Why would slaves take slaves They re slave traders They re not slaves How do you know they could be slaves or they could be slave traders Let me say my question again I want you to think about your role and what was just said Do you think that all roles that I gave this group were I m sorry are on this picture No Oh you re changing your mind Discuss that At first you said yes Discuss that why maybe not all the roles that I gave you were on this picture No do not say your role yet Ladies and gentlemen we have about one minute I think that they are people in the tribe and they re giving their slaves as slaves You know how we were doing that worksheet the graphic organizer It said that most of the time they would just trade other villages for their slaves and take those ones Well I think Cause they could still have their own slaves I think this is a slave trader well not really like a slave trader but like Cause the slave traders a slave boss kind of were from England so I think they d have white skin I think they re with the other people But remember African Americans were also slave traders Because they re not chained and they re standing and the other people like slaves are all tucked together and depressed I think that some European traders tried to persuade other slave people to say like go get your crime people go get your crime people Slaves Yeah your slaves in your own tribe and then we ll trade you Gold A bag of tobacco And those helped capture So even though they don t have white skin they might be slave traders and they give like So we have two different maybe perspectives of slave traders is that what I m hearing you say One being They could have also been threatened to work Europeans Hold that thought David One being Europeans and one being African Well not really African American Cause in the book it said that the African slaves not the European slaves but the African slaves their slaves were kinda like maids So I want you to think about the role that you were given And I asked you to look at that picture from that perspective Is it possible that that specific role I gave you has many different perspectives itself Yes Alright I want you to wrap up your conversation if you have anything else to add and then we re gonna continue tomorrow You re not gonna tell Not yet no I changed my mind You think you know You think you know We still have the cards Aw rats They did it 
 Five four three two one stop I m going to follow the same norms you are so if I want to talk I m going to have to raise my hand Does anybody want to start us off Sort of an initial response or something that s been on your mind or a place we can go in the play to start this conversation In the last act when Emilia and Iago or Iago s been caught and Emilia is piecing together all of these things that Iago s done how it all works and she s telling the others around him what he s done he keeps telling her Be quiet this isn t your place to talk you shouldn t be here But whereas most stereotypical women would have just kind of followed what their husband wanted and just you know kind of been in the background Emilia actually stands up and says what she thinks is right Yeah okay What also talked about was how Desdemona kind of juxtaposes that in that she s like the very stereotypical housewife to the point at which she refuses to even like blame her husband for killing her so we kind of it s interesting how those two characters are just To touch on the racism part I would have to say it s not and at least if it is that isn t the main focus of the play I d say that it s focused more on these complex characters and their web of lies and the plot itself isn t focused on if it is I think because I don t really think it is I kind of agree with Chloe I don t think that Othello is a racist or sexist play It does have racism and sexism in it but that s because it was written by William Shakespeare in a time when that was the norm You can t really look at it as a modern person because we think of racism and sexism so differently from the audience it was intended for They thought of it as more of the norm so it does seem more normal Like it seemed believable and normal to them because that s just how their society was Then it also kind of looks at like how racism sort of caused it like Iago hates Othello and one reason that he gives is that he s black and he doesn t deserve his position and he kind of uses race to his advantage to do bad things So it s kind of looking at it s not racist it s looking at racism and sexism and saying like how they can be used and manipulated you know Yeah I kind of agree with you I think this play is really about like taking advantage of people any way you can So like if you have something on them like they re a different color or if they re a different sex then you can use that to your advantage by like putting that as an excuse almost to take advantage Let s return to that Raise your hand if Iago was your favorite character in this class Come on I mean this is a I have to say I agree I would raise my hand to that question which I find troubling because I certainly agree with some of the opinions that I m hearing here that we have this interesting contrast between Emilia and Desdemona as two different ways women can live with male violence and we also have this examination of how racism and sexism are used as part of the plot to take down Othello But at the same time I have to say I think that it feels to me like the play is set up for us like Iago more Iago talks to us he lets us into his world into his mind in a way that nobody else does So I d almost feel like we can t blame ourselves as the audience for identifying with him for secretly making part of us rooting for him or he even made me sort like glorying in his intelligence and his capacity for manipulation and just his power And I wonder what we do with that because if you walk away from this play being like I love Iago Then aren t you also kind of saying in a way celebrating what he s done Do you agree with me Disagree with me I think his ability to like his like logic and how he like plans things like how he like manipulates a lot of situations and how he like schemes to like use people s like baggage I guess to his advantage is kind of like I guess like the way he uses it isn t a good way but like if you could use it in a different way I guess it like could be viewed as like a good thing So I think there s a difference between like celebrating what he s done and just appreciating like the amount of thought and like intelligence that he has in using it in a bad way because like you can like Iago and like him for different reasons than Oh I like what he s done I like how he destroyed this person It can be just you know I realize that this is a very smart person and someone I really would not want to be on his bad side But like you just sort of you realize like how much I guess yeah I ll just use the word appreciate again You just appreciate like how much you understand his mind and it s just really interesting rather than you love him Yeah I think it s more like sometime s it s fun to like root for like the evil character Because you wouldn t actually do it like if you play video games like Grand Theft Auto Like you kill the hookers it s not like you would have to do that it s just that it s fun Oh my God Well it doesn t surprise me that Iago s the one that most people come away from the play with being like Yeah he s so great he s so interesting right Because like he s the only character that you actually get to know Everyone else just kind of like dies They get drunk and like stab people or they cry That s pretty much what everybody else does and then Iago s the one who like lets you in lets you know what he s thinking when he s bringing specific elements like with each person in the play he s different from each person and you can see that through the play Well as she was saying like how everyone else was crying and like going crazy or like either having an awful time or having a good time like they still trust Iago even though he s standing there not doing that with them I mean just like the way he s able to still convince them whenever he s not he doesn t seem like he s on the like he convinced them that he s on their side but he s not actually doing everything they are or he s not really doing anything to show them that s he s isn t feeling what they re feeling Alex I have a quote I guess It s at around there And their palates both for sweet and sour as husbands have what is it they do when they change us for others Is it sport I think it is And doth affection breed it I think it doth Is t frailty that thus errs It is so too And have we not affections desires for sport and frailty as men have Then let them use us well else let them know the ills we do their ills instruct us so So it s kind of like talking about how the men control the women and so I guess like that s like the sexism of the day or like of that era and like this is Emilia she s talking to Desdemona and she s talking about how like men control them and all their thoughts are kind of implanted by the men like Emilia like she got the handkerchief because her husband told her to do that and they re all just really obedient and everything Chloe I mean I think that yeah it has to do with the time period as far as the sexism in the play or whatever but I mean because that it s just the way it was but I think that when you look at the female characters in the play like Emilia she turns out to be one of the most influential characters and she s the one that takes down the bad person It s her that takes down Iago pretty much because she tells him the truth and then something that none of the men could do or even question Then the other thing I would say is that the women s loyalty to each other especially Desdemona to Emilia because it s back earlier in the play I don t actually have it but Emilia I mean Desdemona sings a song earlier in the play something Willow willow willow some more stuff about the song and then when Emilia s dying she sings a line from that exact same song and she says she references my mistress death So I think a lot of it shows how the women stick together It s also kind of like I mean I agree with you and I mean it s not sexist it looks at sexism because I mean you see how Desdemona is the stereotypical woman of that time and she kind of does what her husband tells her to she doesn t rebel against him she is completely loyal to him regardless of how he treats her I mean he s hit her and she just accepts it Even when he kills her she takes the blame and doesn t rat him out and it just kind of you have problems respecting her because of it Like I mean she s a good character but you just can t it s really hard to respect someone who just accepts everything that is done to her like that Then you have to juxtapose it with Emilia and she was a really influential character and is able to rise above and kind of try to take down her own husband and go against it It s kind of looking at sexism and saying like you know which is better for you Which do you like more Look at how the sexism and the roles of women has affected Desdemona and then how Emilia s been able to rise above it Can I jump in Yeah I definitely agree with you but my thoughts are also going back to Act I Scene III because I think at the beginning of the play Desdemona is very much not a stereotypical woman She has married the man she loves defying her father Knowing her dad wouldn t like it she ran off and married him anyway When Othello s talking about how he won her heart it was by telling the stories of the wars and it s actually very interesting because it says that Desdemona would seriously She would be very interested in these stories even to the point where she wished she had been born a man Then when Othello says I have to go to war and the Duke says Let s like Desdemona stay at her dad s house Desdemona says No I married this man to be with him Let me go to the war also So at least at that scene I think that she s a model of a very very active woman who wants to go to war with her husband she wants to be with her husband When Othello comes out in Act II Scene III to stop the fight between Cassio and Roderigo Desdemona comes out too and says What s going on what s wrong And Othello says Come away sweetie let s go back to bed Right I certainly agree that there s a passivity in Desdemona by the end but I don t know if I see that so much at the beginning Go ahead I agree I think that like sometimes Desdemona wants to be the stereotypical woman and then like other times she wants to be the like rebel kind of because like Mr Proctor said like she completely rebels against her dad at the beginning and then also like she s not the stereotypical woman because like every single man like in the play has admitted that she s the most beautiful woman that they want her and all this stuff and so she has some power over them too But yeah I just think it s interesting how like there are scenes where she s the complete like stereotypical housewoman and then other times she s like completely passive Even though it s been brought up that she defied her father to marry Othello she s still I feel like she s still very like part of that time period as far as the role of women because even though Othello wasn t her perfect husband in the eyes of her father she still jumped from the control of one man her father to another man her husband So Tanya Okay so about Desdemona I think that like even though she did that stuff she still was a stereotypical woman Like we said before those women they re supposed to be obedient to their husbands so like whenever she does kind of like rebel and do something different from or like kind of jump in to the conver like Mr Proctor was saying like those examples she s doing it for Othello She jumps in like she goes to war to be with him and then she comes in like whenever he s in trouble And then the thing about Emilia is she s doing stuff for herself Like in Act IV Scene III yeah that s what we read she s talking about how it s just like she would cheat on her husband once It s just like she says The world s a huge thing it is a great price for a small vice 
 Okay guys yesterday we talked about three key vocabulary words that we mentioned we studied we found definitions for Those words were adaptation there s habitat and community Okay adaptation is the first word Who can tell me something about adaptation Karina Adaptation is how animals act like the howler monkeys they howl so they can tell other monkeys that they are in danger so they can survive Okay so they can survive right Adaptation helps them survive And then habitat Who can tell me what habitat is Ernesto Where you live Okay it s the environment where they live It s the surroundings okay It s the trees it s the plants it s the ground and it s the climate that they live in And the last one is community Okay so if we re thinking about animals what makes up a community for these animals Who can tell me Sergio The community What makes up a community It s not the environment The animals It s all the animals Do we have just one animal in the community We have many we have many It could be very many Okay we re going to on and I d like you to listen to this sound Shhhh Just listen to this sound Okay you may have and you can hear this sound at night Okay what I d like you yo do right now is tell me one thing that you know about this animal okay If you know the name of this animal go ahead and write that down too First of all let s just write it in our K Just put it under for K What do you know about that animal Just write it down first then we ll talk about it I d like you to discuss what you know also Talk to a neighbor Okay this is what you know so you are going to be looking at that What is something you know about that animal Okay Tell your neighbor What do you know about this animal Just tell a neighbor Tell a neighbor what you know Tell your neighbor Eddie what you know What do you know You can talk out loud guys Okay small ears okay All right so write that down Okay now after that go to what you want to know Go to the W What do you want to know about

about what you want to know What do you want to know Tell a neighbor What do you want to know Sergio You don t have to whisper you can say it How old an owl can live Okay good Good okay Now one thing I want you to think about Let s listen to this sound again okay Listen to the sound again Any predictions and you can just tell me without writing them down What do you think that Why does the owl make the sound that it makes Yea Maybe to warn other owls Warn other owls Anything else Yea Ernesto To communicate And to communicate that s right Okay let s take a look a page twenty three Okay we re going to look at text structure on page 23 This is the Great Horned Owl And I d like everyone to put your finger on the title for this animal the Great Horned Owl Just put your finger so I know you know what the title is Next I d like you to put your finger on the caption Okay and can I have one person read the caption Let s have Karina read the caption Owls have large eyes to help them see in the dark Okay very good Then we have underneath the title of the Great Horned Owl We have what I call bullet points We talked a little bit about them And put your fingers on the bullet points there And let s have Ernesto read those bullet points Bird found in North Central and South America Live in the canopy and understory Understory very good And we live in what continent Eddie what continent do we live in North America North America So we ll find these and actually I will usually hear these at night And usually hear them kind of in the winter time All right let s have the first paragraph Eddie why don t you continue The Great Horned Owl has no ears but can hear anyway It can also see very good even on the darkest night Okay and the second paragraph Makayla An owl hunts for food at night from high in the air When it hears a mouse move or squeak the owl swoops down upon it Swoops okay very good Okay now we ve read about the Great Horned Owl I d like you to tell your neighbor one thing that you learned new about this owl that you are going to put down under the L What is one thing that you learned about the owl Okay so write something down that you ve talked about with your partner or your neighbor Now we re going to continue working in partners here and I m going to give you something to take a look at And I m going to have you guys just close your books for a second After you re done writing close your books Okay I m going to give each pair or each little group one of these sticks I want you to look at the stick carfeully and look how an animal might have changed or interacted with the stick okay So take a close look at it all right And take a look at it and then I d like you to put down what you know about that stick okay There are yes you can see that some insects have interacted with the stick also But what is something look at the ends of the stick and let s put down something we know about what an animal might have done to this stick Okay just write it down or tell your neighbor Tell your neighbor Yeah he bit the stick on here But did he actually cut it Was he able to bite it Yes Yeah he was he was Okay all right now who can tell me what animal this might be Karina A beaver It is a beaver and you will find these in this area What I would like you to put down next is what you want to know about the beaver So let s write that down Just skip this and go right to What do you want to know Tell your neighbor Go ahead and tell your neighbor about it What do you want to know Okay tell your neighbor guys too once you have written it down How old can a beaver live Okay how old can a beaver live That s good Yea Keelie What I want to know how about are they electric Okay Okay I want to know how long they are in their house maybe Yes I want to know how big can they be Okay good I have hair on here It s possible Actually yeah that is very possible you have hair of a beaver I would actually I m going to hang onto that And actually let s put that in the garbage But that s good It s right here Okay i ll take it Okay Yea you re going to find that probably we re not going to look at the sticks too much We need to find insects still living in the stick but we re going to leave that for right now I d like you to take a look at page twenty Take a look at page twenty I do recommend that if you ever by chance go to Deerbro there s a forest near the school here Your parents can take you You might actually see a beaver house Okay let s find out some more information about beaver on page twenty Put your fingers on the title Put your fingers on the title You know what I ll take that Here we go And you know what let me recollect these because we have Let me collect those back Thank you There we go Okay put your fingers on the beaver the title okay Can I have one person read the bullet again Bullet marks Sergio go ahead Mammal found in North America Europe and Asia Lives in rivers and streams near the forest floor okay and can you name another mammal If you happen to know what the mammal might be Can you name another mammal Whale A whale is a mammal and we are also mammals Okay the next paragraph I d like to have one person read that paragraph Karina Beavers eat bark twigs leaves and roots They have wide flat tails These tails help beavers to clear a placement Beavers use their split claws to comb their own fur They also use their claws to spread oil onto their fur This oil helps keep them warm in the water Okay before we go on as we re going to be looking at a lot of things think about what it is you re learning What s something new that you re learning about this beaver Now before we go on everybody put your finger on the caption Okay caption Makayla what does the caption say A beaver s fur keeps it warm in the snow All right very good So let s take one more thing We re going to take a look at a diagram on page seventeen So now let s go to page seventeen And this talks a little bit more about a beaver And the title let s put our finger on the title of page 17 What does the title say Keelie Graph Section Diagram Okay we re looking at page 17 right here Put your finger on the top of the diagram And that s the title What does it say Keelie Beaver lodge Okay what is we know a beaver is the animal What s a lodge Keelie Their house where they live Yea it s like their house Okay next there s a caption built into the diagram and it s green Let s have Sergio read the caption there This beaver lodge was built on a shallow part of the wood floor If it wouldn t float the lodge will have to be rebuilt Okay very good Let s get some more information There s some other things in the diagram to give us information Makayla Some lodges are two meters 6 5 high Okay very good And Keelie The lodge is made from logs and sticks Okay and Eddie the last one Beavers come in and out under the water Okay so this is where they live This is how they live and why do you think they build their house this way Anybody What do you think they do Why do they build it this way Karina Because when they when people come like hunters if they want to catch them It is going to be difficult for them Okay like predators Other predatory animals Yeah So this is a way they adapt So how do they adapt to survive in their environment Makayla To enter from the underground water Okay can you use adapt or adaptation in a sentence Beavers Beavers adapt to Beavers adapt how Yea Karina Beavers adapt by entering from a little hole under the water Okay so they adapt in that way other predators can t see when they re coming And as we saw on the sticks the sticks they just pile these sticks up on here and they move them around until they make something that looks like this okay So what kind of a habitat do the beavers live in again Using the word habitat I d like you to tell me What s the habitat of a beaver They live in lodges They live in lodges Okay what s around their lodge Yeah Karina Sticks and wood Okay sticks but then what is this blue stuff here Water It s water Yeah so they actually go underwater to get into their home And that makes it very safe So I would like you to add one more thing to what you learned on the third column of this organizer Okay Okay once you ve got one third okay And Eddie when you ve got something why don t you tell your neighbor When you ve got something tell your neighbor what you learned Like this Okay Actually right here yea What you ve learned Okay and if you were to go out somewhere and you were in the woods what would you see What do you think you would see from this house This is all water so all you re going to see Are you going to see the hole that s here No No What do you think you re going to see The sticks Just like a stick Just a mound of sticks about two meters high Which is probably about that tall 
 In my opinion I think the grandpa shows the most leadership because he stands up for himself telling the principal I should not pay 15 00 because then it wouldn t be a scholarship Okay thank you very much I like the way the way you show you know how much he pays for one day and not have to pay for the scholarship jacket Thank you very much I agree with Julia because you should not choose people for like what kind of races they are or their culture You should choose them for what they ve been through like their hardest work or something Okay So you mean they had jobs they had work it was right to feel that Very good good job Okay I think Martha because she earned the jacket instead of buying it Okay In my opinion the grandpa showed the greatest leadership because he was wise and a great leader is wise Okay I agree with Alejandro that the grandfather is the leader because he didn t pay for the jacket He didn t pay for the jacket So you thought because he didn t pay for the jacket then he s a great leader You think you know just because he did not pay for the jacket that s what made him a great leader No I think that what makes him a great leader is that he stood up for himself instead of just saying oh okay here s the money Okay so a greater leader should stand for what he believes Is that what you are saying Yes Very good Thank you very much for clarifying that Go ahead Daniel I was going to say that I agree with Jennifer I think that a great leader should stand up for what they believe Thank you very much Go ahead In my opinion I think Martha showed the greatest leadership because she showed wisdom because she earned that jacket by getting straight As and being a good student All right Thank you Go ahead Lisette In my opinion Martha s grandpa is a great leader because a leader needs to be a strong person like Martha s grandpa Very good So you need to stand your ground Very good I think that the person who showed the most leadership was Martha Even though she thought she was going to lose what she had earned she believed that even though the teachers they they some wanted to give it to someone else but some knew that she had earned it and she she spoke up not keeping it quiet and keeping it to herself Okay So you feel a great leader you know she speak up you know when something is wrong or in the way She shouldn t just keep it Very good She has to tell someone Very good good job Go ahead It seems to me that Martha showed great leadership because she did all the things that she did so she could win the jacket Okay what are some of the other things you know that Martha did She got she got since she was in first grade she got good grades and she tried not to get in trouble and be a good student Okay so that means you know she has worked hard all this time Very good Thank you Okay go ahead I believe that Martha showed very good leadership because she wanted the scholarship jacket so bad that she didn t give up on trying to get it So a good leader you know she ll try to do whatever it takes you know to get what he or she wants Is that what you re saying Yes All right Good job Thank you In my opinion I think Mr Schmidt is a great leader because he was fair you know to fight for Martha and not the other girl Thank you Who is the other girl Joanne Huh Joanne Okay so Mr Schmidt was fair enough you know to fight for Martha instead of who Joanne Joanne Thank you very much In my opinion it s Martha because she fight for the jacket and she tried her best All right In my opinion I think Mr Smith because even though Martha was poor he still said that she deserved the sweater because of her good grades Because of her good grades Good job In my opinion I believe that the one that showed leadership was Mr Smith because he was honest and fair to Martha Very very good Thank you very much I agree with her because Mr Booney just wanted the person that had money which is Joanne Her father owned the only store in town So Mr Schmidt was actually being fair Okay Thank you for adding on to that Now who is Joanne s dad You know because everybody was saying I could hear Juan you know when Juan said because of Joanne s dad Who is Joanne s dad How can we describe him He owns the only store in town Hmm He owns the only store in town He owns the only store in town What else He s also part of the school board He s rich School board Huh He s part of the school board so they had the decisions like in the school like what they do and stuff In the story he gives money to the school so maybe that s also why they wanted to pick Joanne so they got more money Very good Thank you very much Now that everybody has contributed now let s look at the next question The next question is this what does Martha represent to you Think about the leadership qualities that Martha showed What does Martha represent to you Not only the leadership qualities all the other things that Martha represents okay Anybody can start Anybody can start Just jump in I believe that Martha to me represents a great leader Her experience and triumph illustrate importance in leadership such as never giving up Thank you for sharing that She represents someone who will find the truth and will solve it She stood up for herself and she listened to what her grandfather had to say Very good It seems to me that she was a smart and outgoing girl because she worked hard and speaked up and no matter how you look or where you live you have to be treated fairly Great Like that Anybody can jump in It seems to me that Martha is not a leader because her grandpa speaked up for her about the scholarship jacket I disagree because Martha did speak up for herself Her grandfather just told her what to say I disagree because like her grandfather gave her most of her ideas If it wasn t for her grandfather she probably would ve tried to get the money But like her father said I mean her grandfather said that a scholarship is not a scholarship unless you pay for it I agree with Daniel because like well yeah I agree with Arkie because the grandfather actually had to tell the principal that they shouldn t have to pay for it instead of Martha going to speak to the principal in person I disagree with that I disagree with that I disagree I disagree with Daniel and Javier because even though her grandpa told her what to say her grandpa didn t go up to the principal and actually tell it was actually Martha who went up to the principal and got ideas of what to say I agree with Myra because it s true I mean he didn t go Martha actually had the guts to say what her grandfather had said So that s why I say that Martha had most of the guts to do that instead of the grandfather The grandfather might ve said that but she was the one that stood there and said it That took a lot of courage to me Okay So you know that was a great leader should be courageous enough So I like what Arkie said Arkie said you know I disagree that Martha was a leader and Arkie open up that Thank you very much Archimedes Thank you all of you for sharing that Any other person To me Martha represents a hard worker because since first grade she worked hard to get her good grades and not get in trouble Okay She worked really hard Thank you Any other person that wanted to add something It seems to me that Martha is a that proves that it doesn t matter her race or color she could do anything the same as anybody else can do Wow I agree with Ashley because a lot of people discriminate like Mexican people or like Mexican Americans just because their family or their ancestors came from somewhere else and they re not from the United States So you know what has Martha done to straighten that or to disprove that She showed that who cares where you re from or who you are you can always do your best Okay So you know there was Martha is representing to us that we can do whatever we put our mind in doing If we really work hard we know that it will work Is that what I m hearing from all of you Yes That it doesn t matter what race you know if you work really hard you know that you can achieve Thank you very much for sharing that I really admire her because I know some people who have been made fun of just because of their race and it s somewhat sad because some people aren t allowed to do things just because of their skin color or where they re from What I think is that it doesn t matter what you are No one is bad except for the person who s making fun of your race You are not the bad one it s the person who s making fun of you Thank you very much Any other person that wants to add something to this I agree because in a poem it says you can t persuade anyone unless you have the courage to make them like persuade them Thank you very much Now let s go on to the last question Thank you very much for sharing I could hear from all of you The last question is what other stories have you read that share a similar theme with Scholarship Jacket Think of other characters that have faced difficult choices or situations Okay So think of that What other stories have you read okay Anyone can start I think Crossing the Wire is somewhat similar because Pablo was Mexican too and they mistreated him and denied him a job However he worked as hard as Martha Thank you for sharing that You call that Crossing what Crossing the Wire Crossing the Wire Thank you I think the story of Martin Luther King is pretty similar to The Scholarship Jacket because they discriminated a lot against African Americans because of their color but Martin Luther King stood up for his race and said that we should not discriminate others because we re different We re all the same just because of color doesn t separate us Thank you very much for sharing that I agree with Jennifer Martin Luther King said that it doesn t matter where you re from or who you are everybody inside is the same and all of us are brothers Thank you very much for sharing that I have seem the movie The Blind Side which is pretty similar to the story Michael shows great leadership because he is an African American and he is poor and he tries to pull himself up to be able to play at a Catholic school to play football Thank you I agree with Carlos I ve also seen that movie and the movie has a lot of great leaders definitely Michael I agree with Carlos because in that movie Michael from the beginning he didn t want to go to school he actually had really low grades and the family he had they re from another race and even though he had really low scores they got him a tutor and they helped him like reach his goals so he could play football for the school he wanted to play Wow Thanks again I have read The Outsiders which is a story about two classes of people the Greasers and the Soches The greasers get treated real dirty because of their lower class Okay At the end what happened Did they succeed like Martha Did they achieve Some of them died Some of them died okay 
 What if it comes from like a polluted creek or something or some kind of bad water system in the ground Number three I say crystal clear and filtered I said how dirty the water gets How good the water is for you It doesn t have stuff dying in it it s crystal clear and it doesn t smell Okay class if we can pull back together please as a group I was hearing excellent discussions between each of the three questions and I think we have some very valuable points to go ahead and talk about So what we re gonna do is kind of create a little bit of a list up here to help us remind later when I go to show you something So we re gonna start again with that first question and I m looking for you to participate and share some of those questions together So it says again how do you know if water is safe or not And I heard wonderful responses so can I hear some of those please Brandon please start us Color and odor Okay so you know if water is safe or not depending on again the color and the odor Good what are some other responses Brandon Remember where you got it from Like if it was in a creek that looks fine it s probably safe to drink but if it s from a polluted creek that has a really weird color to it or it s in a weird location don t drink it Okay so I m commenting here I have it depends on the source you re getting it from and so if it s a creek that looks to be clean or clear then you know it s probably okay And if it looks to have like a weird color I think you mentioned again to it or polluted or in a weird location then maybe it s not safe All right what were some of your other responses Jack Um if it goes through a quality filter Okay if it goes through a quality filter And Jack can you maybe think of an example of a quality filter A Culligan filter for the drinking water Okay so a Culligan filter that you can use to filter out the water Okay good Madeline There s no large pieces of trash or anything in the water Okay so you can look for visible signs of large trash and Madeline what was the second part of that Nothing that looks unnatural in it Okay so nothing that looks unnatural Great Anybody else any answers for number one Again how do you know if it s safe or not Lexi I think you had another answer that may have been covered up here What did you say when I was talking with your group about The smell Okay the smell again the odor of it Okay great Brandon you thought of another one If there s something dead in it If there s something dead in it so again we re going based on those visual aspects of it Good Well we re gonna come back to that here in just a moment so we ll move on to number two When are times when the water might not be safe Walker After an earthquake or another disaster Okay so after an earthquake And Walker can I have you expand a little bit What would be so significant after an earthquake or another disaster that would make the water not safe Because maybe something fell in the water or I don t know I just heard that before Okay so you heard it before and if something fell in the water Did you happen to see at all in Japan after the tsunami came through there Do you remember any of those images Yeah kinda they were different colors and yeah Okay and I think I heard somebody else say that they remembered seeing a point that maybe we can add onto Elvis At the beach At the beach What do you mean by at the beach There s different times where the water might not be safe Okay can you think of a specific example like have you experienced a time when you weren t allowed to be at the beach When somethings dangerous in the water Okay if something s dangerous in the water Sometimes they might tell you that it s not safe to be there Okay Any other times that might make the water not safe Amelia can you think of any times where the water might not be safe I have after storms like um Walker did Okay what are some things then because this is something I m hearing so far What are some things after the storm that might be in the water besides I think you said some stuff can fall in the water What are some of the things that might be in the water that would make it not safe Aashi can you think of something that might get in the water Um like tree branches or animals Okay so tree branches and animals that s good Can you think of anything else that might get in the water that maybe wouldn t normally be there Kris Trash Trash okay Can you think of a specific kind of trash Lexi Glass Glass And what would be the danger of glass getting in the water It s sharp and can cut yourself Okay so there s a chance of getting injured if you cut yourself What else think outside the box a little bit more What else could get in the water that you would not normally want in your water Madeline Plastic bags and then you can suffocate animals Okay so plastic bags that they suffocate animals something along those lines Elvis Oil and gasoline Oil and gasoline good Brandon Toxins Toxins okay Jack Plastic six pack holders Because it strangles the fish and everything Okay now lets think I m glad you guys are all concerned about the fish and the animals and all of that but what about we as humans can you think of anything that would get in the water that would be potentially harmful to us afterward Go ahead Pesticides Pesticides okay Brandon Fertilizer Fertilizers Elvis A car What is it again A car A car okay All right well we ll come back to those in just a minute So looking at we ve kind of come up with a list here of how you would determine if things are safe or not So then I guess my question would become if you look at it s color and you look at if it s in a source that looks safe or not how would you be able to determine if something is safe to drink So maybe that might change your perspective a little bit So is there a difference between being able to drink something and maybe being able to swim in something In fact let me give you just a minute to talk about that with your partner for a minute so my question to you again is it are there different things we should look for in water that we drink versus maybe water that we swim in or take a shower in And I want you to talk about that with your partner and jot down a couple notes about that so go ahead That s interesting to hear you saying shower water isn t as filtered as your drinking water Our pool is safe they put a water cover over our pool so it was different At our pool they changed from too much chlorine can burn people s eyes so they changed it Yeah definitely a bigger job but they put a small amount of chlorine in it so all the bacteria that s on us if you go swim in the pool it wouldn t matter as opposed to in the shower because it s different Even if you do have a water cover still it could seep through and that s how they clean it When they open the pool it takes like a month because they have to go through the water thing and all the filters Okay we ll come back together as a group one more time Thank you all again I hear great discussions going on So let s talk about this There s some very neat ideas of whether you think something is safe to drink versus whether or not it s okay to shower or to swim in So what were some comments you were talking about in your smaller groups Again I heard some great discussions going on Mikenna what did your group talk about Shower water isn t as filtered as drinking water Okay so in their group they believe that shower water was not as filtered as what the water is that you drink in so if it s not as filtered where would your drinking water be coming from that maybe your shower water isn t coming from Okay is there a reason that maybe you thought along sometime where the shower water is not as filtered as your drinking water No No okay It just makes sense to you that maybe the stuff that comes out of the tap to drink is not necessarily the same thing coming out of your pipes for the shower Okay what were some other comments about that Larry what did you guys talk about May I have your attention please Would all Spelling Bee winners please report to the auditorium at this time for the Spelling Bee Again all Spelling Bee winners please report to the auditorium at this time for the Spelling Bee Thank you Okay so Larry to expand upon that and I think he brought up a really good point He said that maybe the water that you were you saying Larry swimming or showering He was saying that the water we drink Hold on just one second Isaiah just one second Okay good I wanted to make sure I wasn t saying it incorrectly So what he was saying is in other words when you shower or when you are going swimming that water is not necessarily going in your body you re not consuming that water so there would be a difference possibly between the water you re swimming in versus the water that you re drinking Walker I said that you would swim in darker water than you drink or shower in Okay so sometimes you think that the water you ve been in when you swim is darker So going back to the color difference that talked about here Okay interesting Lexi The shower water and the water that we drink I think is sort of the same but they go through a different process but if we go swimming at our community pool it s different because there s more chlorine and stuff so you have bacteria on you and you re just swimming you not really intaking it But at your house when you drink or take a shower it s different Okay Would you say that Because I think it s probably safe to say you guys mostly agree that there is a difference between drinking water and water you would shower in versus water that maybe you would go swimming in So what are some of those differences What might be what might they have to do to that water Lexi was talking about maybe it would have to be treated differently or that there would be chemicals added to it So can you think of what they would do to the water in a swimming pool versus water that you drink to make it different I think Jack mentioned about filtering and Mikenna also brought up the point about it being filtered different Brandon Well they put more chemicals in the swimming pool because there s gonna be more germs and when people swim in it so that will kill off the germs As in drinking water is not as much chemicals because there s not really any germs you re just drinking it so Okay good So what I m hearing is the amount of something so would you all agree as a class if we were to drink swimming water would you die No No probably not right But the amount of the chemical that is in the water might be something that would cause some effects or cause some harm to you So do you think that there is chlorine in your drinking water Because we said it s in the swimming pool probably to help kill off bacteria Do you think that and I m hearing a little bit of a disagreeance here so I d love to hear your conversation in just a minute Elvis what do you think There is chlorine in the drinking water but then they purify it so So they purify out the chlorine after they put the chlorine into the drinking water Yeah Okay good And Isaiah what were you thinking about I think you were saying no that there isn t the chlorine My question is if there was chlorine in drinking water I mean you can purify it but it may still stay around that water then why would you drink it I mean sure it can knock out the bacteria and germs but why drink it if it has chlorine in it Because that s not good for you Okay and going back to the amounts of it and you re thinking that even the smallest amount might not be healthy for you to put in your system Okay Jack Well for a normal tap system I think it s the last or second last step they do is they insert really small amount of chlorine into all tap water usually in a normal town And so then a lot of people have chlorine in their drinking water but for some people who have specialized filters for drinking water they re designed to filter out all of the chlorine so that it s mostly just water that they re getting So some people have a filter installed Okay and would you be able to tell based on the color because that seems to be what a lot of people are using as their indicator of good water Would you be able to tell just by the color whether or not there s a lot of chlorine in it Maybe maybe not I don t know if this contributes to it but sometimes I look at my drinking water compared to the tap water and the tap water is a lot more foggy so I don t know if that s because the chlorine or because it s aerated or something but I don t know Okay good thank you for sharing that Elvis You can buy those little filters that you can screw onto your taps so that way it filters down the water I have one and it filters out tap water Okay and it s filtering out more of the amount or maybe none of it at all Okay Let s go back oh go ahead Madeline I would just like to say to Isaiah s comment we sort of have to have chlorine in our water because there would be more bacteria if we didn t so there s a reason for it and it s not that much So it would do you less harm to have the chlorine in the water than to not have it Okay so the benefits of what you re saying is that you would at least have to have a little bit to kill off the bacteria and that would outweigh the fact of you not having anything at all and then being exposed to maybe whatever is in the water that the chlorine is not killing off right Okay very good Let s look at We ve used again some criteria and let s look at that final question of what is your definition of water quality So in other words I think Jordan I heard in your discussion could you read your answer for us one more time about what you think water quality is to you Water quality is how good the water is for you to drink Good how good the water is for you to drink Can I hear another definition of water quality Kris what did you decide How clean the water was How clean the water was okay And how would you determine if the water is clean or not What was your number one indicator When you drink it When you drink it okay So if you drink it and you know that it s clean then it has good water quality to it All right Isaiah My definition of water quality is how much of the water is polluted and how much of the water is pure So polluted versus pure and then kind of a ratio of if it s polluted and more pure then it s better water quality Okay Rachel how about your definition of water quality We said that water quality was how much of the water is pure water and how much of it s polluted Okay so going back to that same definition together as you all talked And Ashani what did you think water quality would be How good the water is because some water it like tastes different you can tell Okay so the taste Have you ever experienced where water might taste a little different can you think of an example My aunt s house when we go to her house it s always different from our house And what kind of taste would you say It s gross It s gross water Maybe back to when we were talking about well water in here versus the regular city water and it has a different taste to it So what we re gonna do is using your ideas so far you guys have told me again based on color and you mentioned about the smell of it and you ve mentioned about tasting the water So I have here three different liquids that I m going to go around and show you and on your paper you re going to determine if these liquids are safe or if these liquids are not And since we have already discussed that there s probably different qualities for your water versus the water you drink versus the water that you swim in or the water that you are going to take a shower in so when you comment upon whether those liquids are safe or not I think it would probably be a wise decision to comment if you think they re safe to drink versus safe to shower or to swim So I ll start here with cup letter A So you can go ahead and mark A on your paper and then I will walk around so you can just take an observation of the liquid And you determine again if you think that it is safe All right so what do you all think Logan Do you think that this is safe to drink So if I gave this to you right now you d go ahead and drink it because it would be safe No No What would make you change your answer then 
 Do you want to measure this separately Or do you want to measure this with the ground water Should we measure this separately Yea cause that s the round rocks Okay what were you saying Cathy Why is the ground water cleaner Because the permeable rocks They clean the water on its way down to the soil saturation There s 100 milliliters and you guys could you record the data real quick Write Ground oh no but we ve got to add this first Yea Wait we ve got to add Is it still But let s do the Is that too much Let s do the answer for number one while we re on it Okay It says Good job Describe what you would do Stop But why is your head right down level with the measurement We re doing that so we can make sure it s exactly even cause if we go over then we won t know exactly how much it is And are you measuring the runoff or the ground water right now Right now we re measuring the runoff It was about 380 It was about 380 Is it okay to get an approximate amount for the volume for this and not an exact amount I think so cause then when we measure this we could still Exactly Ashlyn which had more water Your runoff or your ground water The ground water The ground water had more Yeah Yeah cause they re overflowing Oh my goodness Have you measured your ground water yet Not yet I think you can see it for video Where is your ground water Oh oh I see Oh so this really did overflow Yes So when you measure your ground water what will you need to do with the water that s here in the tray I think put it in with the ground water Yea and measure that too Okay this is your runoff Yes Okay so so far you have how much About 380 And then there s some in here Oh you ve already measured 380 About Oh So that s 100 You are pouring that so carefully Jade Stop Good Because we want to have it exact so I had to Okay Ashlyn So Jade put in 100 once and then she put 100 in a second time So how much water has she put in there so far 200 How did you get 200 Um Be sure you talk nice and loudly honey Because I got it because plus it equals 200 because you put two in there Nice Good job Looks like you re doing great kids 60 Keep going Keep going Looks like it might have been slightly off Better watch it go Okay so maybe if we I think that s good but should we add the should I add the data in now No we needed that did you pour on water because that also Wow looks like we re getting a lot of data Your recharge is high Trial number one why do you say runoff had more water in trial number one I think because it clay s more harder so it s kind of more difficult to go through with So what is this number 790 What is this number 62 And which is greater 790 Yea 790 s greater than 62 Good for you honey How did you get this number dear I think we added them up What did you add up honey 790 and 600 I mean 62 To get this total Yeah Great I have a question for this group though How much water did you pour in on trial one 1 000 1 000 what Milliliters 1 000 milliliters But your total is only 852 milliliters It s still in the zone of saturation Oh Or it hasn t collected off the first Alright But it s interesting maybe the water from last time since we only had 852 ending last time Maybe this time the second sort of Maybe it some might against the window if the water from last time I wonder if it came down in the aquifer I wonder Maybe it s just holding it in there I wonder it ll be interesting to measure this time So what part do you have in your lab note We re adding we re have to answer question two and then we re measuring Describe what you observed when you poured the water over the ground water the second time What changed Taylor you go first Um well I think what changed is since the clay sort of got use to the water the first time and there wasn t very much water on the recharge water the first time and it got used to the clay got used to the water that there are little cracks or the water slipped through the sides and it went and now we ve got more recharge water than we had on our first one Do you think that could happen in real life Do you think we could have an impermeable surface like clay and then it could crack and let water through Why do you think that could happen in real life Some place that might happen for real A bunch of pressure If it rains for like millions and millions of years maybe like cement or gravel It would break it down and it would have like a little Do you remember the term for that Weather rock Yeah Weather rock Like what s in the middle of the road Yeah sure yeah Because when people drive on it it gets so much pressure And people keep driving on it and it cracks sometimes Sure And I m sorry I interrupted you when you were answering question number two I wonder if the I doubt anyone would do this but if we put pollution on clay If you put what honey Pollution on like cement of something I would wonder if it would get through Like sort of like water sometimes and since the clay s impermeable water can t get through it easily but I wonder if pollution would That s a good question you might want to do that experiment when you re done with this one That d be great to check Good job The clay became more permeable the second time we added the water Yes And then we should probably measure how much is in here Yes Oh that s kind of Yea because it s like soapy It is sort of soapy I think it s because of the clay being wet Look on this side Oh yeah I can see some of the white So why is the about 120 Because it s not quite at 150 but it s a little bit over 100 Is close close enough for this Or how do you know when close is close enough for this Um we know when it s close enough for this because it doesn t really have an exact measurement for 120 so we know that it s kind of half way between 150 and 100 little bit lower than 125 There s a lot more recharge than last time A lot more recharge Yeah We had 760 now we have 435 Holy cow The first time you did this you had 760 Milliliters Milliliters of runoff And this time we had 435 milliliters Oh that is a big change I wonder I wonder what will happen with your recharge have you measured that yet Yeah what was it It was I think it was 871 Oh my goodness Why do you think you had so much more recharge the second time you did this Christian Probably because the ground probably got more moist so it would make it easier to slip right through Do you remember the term for that When the ground gets all wet with water Soil saturation Great Well yea I mean the water level must have gotten higher Why do you say that Because the bigger the saturation is and the higher the water table is the more moist the ground is The ground is so the water can go through easier I think the first time we did it the water went through which made it easier for the second time to go through Cause it made it more moist And the rock pebbles were kind of scattered around probably mixed with the water So that s the pattern you re seeing What do you predict will happen on your third trial I m thinking that there will be maybe maybe possibly more recharge than runoff More recharge than runoff Did you have more recharge than runoff the second time No but we always have the tape on and it s less than 100 So they started like this and now they re equal and now you think the third time they ll Yea Oh Because probably since the soil s even more moist now that it will make it go through the cracks And Jasper what did your group discuss that you observed the second time you poured in the water that was different from the first time you poured it in The runoff water was kind of even with the recharge But before you measured it before you were just making your observations and watching what did you observe That the first time that there was there was more runoff because the dirt wasn t that moist Oh Great so that s what you wrote down for your number two And I have a question for you Christian How much water are you the drain person Yeah How much rain did you pour in on trial number one 1 000 milliliters So this is interesting How much did you measure after trial number one 900 So what happened to the rest of the water It stayed into the soil Oh So that s why the soil s all wet Cause there s still water underneath it So it s like How did you get 100 Because 900 plus 100 equals 1 000 Good job Alright I ll leave you to it Four three five would equal Okay we need to have less water than the last time 
 Like learning is supposed to be a privilege not a burden It s like Supposed to be Like that s why we re America We have the choice you re not supposed to be forced to do it Okay Um but like about them picking a random person they might they might not just go pick a random person if they have to vote because if they have to vote then they re gonna go see that candidate candidate s political beliefs are and what he or she is gonna do for the country Okay Trevor But if um they re not gonna know which one to pick if they re not educated or don t know about the person Okay What if they don t know how to read In their researching They don t know how to read Okay Do you want me to say my question Yeah go ask your question Okay um If only like when we don t have the law only 60 percent vote so how is that supposed to show what America really wants How is that supposed to show what president we want and what choices we wanna do But if we do get the other 40 percent that already don t wanna vote then they would just pick one and that still wouldn t be the the will of the big United States And outta the 60 percent votes you could just make your uh votes outta that What do you mean Like the people that did vote just choose a person who did get the most votes But we wanna see what America as a whole really wants not what a little over half of America wants Um our founding fathers vote for the right to vote for for freedom and so I think we should use that wisely Okay elaborate on that a little bit Say that one more time Um if our founding fathers vote for the right to or fought for the right to freedom then I think we should use that correctly So you think that if the founding fathers looked at this law they would say this is not what we meant when we said you know we want people to vote for our leaders they didn t want us to force people they still wanted it to be a freedom Didn t we like like have the law for like trying to get the opinion of the whole population of America The other 40 percent it still wouldn t be like their decision because they would just pick one they wouldn t really care So they re not really getting any difference by not having the law But we re not forcing them to do that we re forcing them to help America So you re forcing them Okay Jackson can you respond to that point Um Yes if you like if we don t force people to vote then maybe the poor just can t make it there And if we say oh you have to vote then we then we could like provide them transporation to get to there Also if poor people won t vote that means rich people will vote and they ll just vote for the person who they believe is gonna keep them rich and that they d not go against that Do you think that that represents the majority of Americans if only those wealthy or at least middle to upper class people are voting No No Because if the poor people don t vote they re already poor that s already bad enough and they don t get to voice their opinion and in a democracy too That s just even worse And that s a big segment of people right So you re saying that really a lot of these people maybe it s that it s not that they don t want to vote it s that they don t have the opportunity we need to provide some more public um opportunities like opportunities like public transportation to allow them to vote to make it easier Okay Cause it s not only poor and uneducated people it s just people that really don t care that much and like when making those people vote like kind of what she said they could most a lot of em could try and break the law if you force them to vote Because they just don t want to and they really don t care and like if there s somebody who has who doesn t care but they re being forced to vote and they have a really busy job and they have a lot going on they wouldn t have time to research or anything and so they could they would just have to go out there when they did have to vote they d just vote for someone cause they never had any time to do any research or look at something about the people to vote for Okay let s come back to that point cause I think we still have some questioners who haven t asked their question who s who s up next Jaylen Um you say there are different ways to give them their complete and to vote but what are those ways What d she say Well if you have things Hold on Let me let me make sure they heard what you re saying Say it again but say it louder Okay Um I say it s different ways to get them to vote but what are those ways that you get them to vote Does anybody have a ready response for that I can t hear her She s saying you guys are saying there are better ways than compulsory voting laws there s other and better ways so what are those ways Like just because they re poor doesn t mean they can t know that like you can like hang up posters or like get someone to hand out flyers or something It doesn t have to be all electronic I m not talking about poor people Well she s saying It could help anybody really but Okay Respond Well but there are poor people that wanna vote they don t have a chance to Excuse me Well hold on hold on a second Hold on hold on cause I I m not sure that y all are understand what her point is Say your point again Um With some passion With passion Cause that ll make your point Just scream at her WHAT are different WAYS that you can get the American people to vote Besides Besides posters because a poster s not gonna It s compulsory voting And besides these laws what are some better ways to make people vote Well y all keep sayin go and like pick up people and providing transportation well instead of doing that to make them vote you might as well just do that so that they might have the opportunity to vote rather than having to vote So you don t necessarily have to have these laws to still provide some public services to encourage people to vote Okay And like we all know that we get those like very long phone calls that are like vote for this person because they re gonna do all this stuff and like that then like someone who gets that phone call could actually think about it and then like maybe I should vote for that person and you see the big billboard thingies that have the big names on it and all the signs in the yards and so that could make you think well maybe I should go vote since all these people are saying we should vote for that person So you you think they should have an increase in in publicizing elections we should we should have more advertising when elections come up Okay Okay Well if you were to like have election um that would like cost a lot of money to have like a lot of um transportation going around So um and it s like not a lot of people are gonna use that transportation then why just like so why not just make them vote cause they already have public transportation out there Okay Let s top on that one we ll come back to it because we ve got one more question Uh if we didn t require people to vote what would happen if what would happen if like nobody voted decided to vote Say that one more time If we didn t require people to vote what would happen if like nobody decided to vote Or a small majority of people Okay Well people have different opinions like some people think that we put a voice out into the government and say what we want and then some people think like that we that every vote counts And basically there s like five three million people in America and I don t think every single one of them would not vote Okay Any other responses But we already have 60 percent voting I mean and so we know every some people are going to vote It s just the people who don t care about politics and just like when we had the survey people a lot of people didn t vote for the midterm election But on the other hand some people did We re always gonna have a group that doesn t vote and a group that is voting and if you make them vote they re not gonna care Even as more as they did when they weren t voting Okay I m gonna go ahead and open up the floor because we ve asked all the questions so pretty much anybody can answer or ask but let s try and keep it on the same topic so if you are raising your hand make sure you re responding to what the last person said Okay Uh let s see Connor Oh like you said every vote counts but like we need more people to vote so we know that like we know the exact number of like who is going to be the president or in the House of Representatives or the Senate So that theres a better chance that they will get elected Okay so we need a more accurate portrayal of what people think We need more people to vote so we really know what Americans think Okay Well I agree with Connor but going back to what everybody over there is saying they re all saying oh they they won t care they wont they wont care or anything and they wont pay attention to what happens but I mean if we can make like some kind of exception for like special needs people for the deaf and blind and then um also we can get people to stand out in front of a booth and once they ll go get there you can do a speech about both candidates and their ups and downs Okay so you re saying actually have people at the voting polls that are kind of breaking down the two sides Maybe for those people who didn t take the time to research it Okay Um one of y all keep sayin we keep sayin that they might not care but like in actuality if you if someone doesn t care and you force them to care not only is that kinda like convincing like brainwashing them it s also if you force someone to do something they re not going to want to anymore So that wouldn t be helping anything So you re saying it s it s gonna actually make them more bitter toward voting if you force them to do it Okay And someone said that it s gonna be for the good of the country for making them vote but if they could choose a bad a bad person cause it wouldn t be for the good of the country then Okay so if you force them to vote and then they go and vote for a bad person that s not gonna be helping the country at all Okay Jason Um like um you could um for those people that can t vote or um you could put the they could put the polls the voting polls near where those people uh live and um so that they could like if they can t drive there in a car they could just walk there because it d only be like maybe a block down their way Okay You could like open a public train like so they don t have to pay to go as much And then make it free Yeah For that day Okay Alexandra what do you think Alright um well like making people vote is gonna make them more interested in like the country and then they ll actually care cause like they re not gonna wanna like break a law and so then they re gonna actually care about the country and so they won t just be choosing a random person they re gonna actually start caring and start thinking about who they should choose You really think if if we force them to vote then they they will become more interested in politics and they ll go out and research it Okay Like just like if you make some make everyone vote then it s really not gonna change their opinion they re still gonna have like they re still gonna not really care as much as the person that would go out and vote without being forced So you re really not getting an accurate number of what they think they want because they still just because you re making them vote doesn t mean they re gonna necessarily pick the right person Okay Um they re always saying like that we still have this 40 percent that haven t voted well everyone like even the poor people and the uneducated well everyone knows that there s a presidential election or some kind of election going on you can t it s like impossible to not know about it and so really it s their choice that they didn t vote most of the people who aren t poor but they re like middle class like they won t make the choice to vote if Okay So you re A lot of people have made the choice to vote So you re saying the presidential election everybody knows about it everybody probably has an opinion because it s all over the place so and 40 percent are not obviously those 40 percent know that they don t wanna go and vote They ve chosen not to vote Most of them have chosen not to vote Okay You know I have to disagree with you when you say that if we just tell people to vote they ll just pick a random person What I think is that if people are being told to vote they ll just go in there and say well if I m being told to vote I just might as well just pick someone good You d think that they would actually try and think about something before they vote like the term look before you leap So you think if they have to go to the effort of voting they re at least gonna think about it They re at least gonna form an opinion Okay Um like you put of um you you could like make the offices make the person take the day off and like sort of give them the day off And that s 
 All the water goes into the jeans and this water dripped out the bottom Mmhm So it ll drip out the bottom as it dries and go into the ground Okay Other ideas about A Other ideas about A Okay How about B It disappeared It no longer exists It s gone forever Maybe not forever but it s gone Anybody choose B No choosers for B Okay how about C It s in the air in an invisible form Kyle I think it s evaporated into a gas and you can t see it It evaporated into a gas and you can t see it Okay other ideas about C I just have similar to Kyle s but water vapor you can t usually see it Okay so it became water vapor which you can t see Alright How about D it moved up to the clouds Lots of Ds How about Mina What do you think Well I think it evaporated and then it went up so It evaporated and went up And when things evaporate they form clouds Mm no Okay So who Can you explain your ideas Well it was like actually it did go into the clouds because the water s still wet so Okay so when it evaporates it goes to clouds Alright Other ideas about D Moving to the clouds Luke I do think that it turned into water vapor Okay But I think that maybe clouds are there and then it gets soaked up by clouds sort of Okay So okay Let s talk about some of these ideas So I m hearing the word evaporate from a couple different people What does that mean to evaporate What are your ideas about that Emmie Doesn t it mean to like when the water gets at a certain temperature it turns into a gas Okay so when water gets to a certain temperature it changes to a gas Other ideas about evaporate or what that means When it changes to a gas what s happening Ideas about that Mitch Well maybe it first comes out of the machine maybe the sun could make it heat a lot and sort of the bubble question like maybe it could be a heat bubble under each town Not be an actual bubble but go up to the water cycle and then go come back down Okay so when you say go up to the water cycle what happens to it It s evaporated up It s evaporated And where is it when it evaporates In the clouds In the clouds Okay other ideas Jake Well when it evaporates the way it works is the heat makes it so the atoms get go farther apart and that makes it change into the state of gas Okay the atoms go farther apart So is it still water Yes but in a different form Okay Okay Other ideas about evaporation And how about clouds So some people are saying when it evaporates it turns into a cloud What is a cloud Ethan share I think it s like a gas Okay But then I think when it evaporates and goes up to the cloud and then I think it will be turned into rain I agree Yeah So first it s a gas when it s a cloud and then it turns back to rain Uh huh Okay Jamie other ideas I think a cloud is like water turning into mist and it gathers in the cloud So when it gets dark it builds up with more water and then when it rains all the the cloud gets too heavy with water and then it rains Okay so it s a mist Yeah Is it a liquid or a gas A liquid slash a liquid slash gas Okay a little of both Okay Okay alright Let s move on How about E It changed into a new substance No takers for E new substance Okay How about F it went to the sun It went up to the sun No takers for F either There s a lot of hands I m not seeing up How about G It broke down into atoms of hydrogen and oxygen Alex I said that because well it goes up into the sky and it must be really humid because it like I can t remember is it when the atoms separate or and because we re humidity ing it Yeah Okay so it becomes more humid and that makes the atoms separate Is that what you re saying Well not exactly It s hard to find the words Okay Can you try It separates and that s what makes it humid Well I don t know I guess I ll come back to you Keep thinking about it How could you explain your ideas Joey what are your ideas I can I go off of Alex Yeah Oh so when hot air rises so when the water gets to a certain temperature I forgot who said that but it the atoms spread apart and change into a gas And it would be more humid because hot air rises and the gas rises into the clouds Okay so as the hot air rises the gas rises with it Is that what you re saying Mmhm Okay And the water becomes hydrogen and oxygen as it goes up Mmhm Okay Other ideas Dylan Well so there s oxygen and hydrogen in the atmosphere and the atmosphere is gas and gas doesn t sit at the bottom It s in the air which means it s obviously floating I guess And so if water turns into vapor which I think most of us know and vapor can float and obviously it s turning into a gas like oxygen and hydrogen And so how would water be able to float if it s turning into gases it s breaking down into atoms of hydrogen and oxygen It s still almost like a liquid gas but if it wasn t a gas that consists of things like hydrogen and oxygen how would it be able to float How would it be able to turn to clouds Okay so it can t be water still if it s going to be floating around in the air Well yeah Is that what you re saying It s still water but it s in a different form that it has components that make up it s pretty much a liquid gas almost It s a liquid gas Yes yeah Which makes it float in the air Well yeah gas Gas can float and hydrogen and oxygen Okay So it becomes hydrogen and oxygen in the air Well as it heats up then it breaks because as it heats up then it creates vapor Water evaporates and so as it heats up when it gets to that point then it breaks down into atoms and everything else Okay when it gets to the air Yeah when it turns into vapor Okay when it turns into vapor that s when it becomes hydrogen Because yeah that s how it when the atoms of hydrogen and oxygen break down I m guessing that that means that that s when it s turning into vapor Okay Okay okay great Luke other ideas I think it might become the combination of the two because I think more than just one because I think it does split into different atoms which makes it a gas And then um and then also it could go into the clouds or something like in other parts of the answer Okay so maybe it turns into this hydrogen and oxygen gas but then goes to the clouds Yeah because I think that that s kind of the only way to go to the clouds and I think its probable that it would so Okay Okay okay Lots of different ideas We re going to move on so that we can get to the others How could we observe this What could we do to know if some of these options are the right option or be able to eliminate them as possible options What could we do Turn and talk to your partner quickly What could we observe And see what happens Okay Would we be able to eliminate any of these if we agreed with Owen s suggestion Eliminate F How come Because the sun s very far away Okay And it s really really hot so Okay if we did it in the classroom would it be able to get to the sun No it d be stuck in the classroom right Okay Are there others that we might be able to eliminate if we did that Good Okay let s hear your ideas What could we do How could we observe this scenario Trenton I haven t heard from you today Okay so to eliminate some of them if soaked into the ground you could check if the ground was wet or anything and it moved up to the clouds You could check if there s any clouds Okay See if a cloud forms Okay Miley other ideas I agree with Trenton but I think I ve seen them where the area s curved over like our roof and the sun is out you can see mist kind of stuff coming out And I think if we did that then maybe we could observe something that could be useful Okay what would we have to do though to set this up What do we need Owen You can wet a paper towel and then hang it from somewhere and then heat it by a light and then or you could have a fan Okay heat it with a light or a fan So perfect I like your idea So we have a cloth It s wet Is it wet Kind of Kind of It s not wet enough Should we make it a little more wet Yeah Okay let me make it a little more wet That better Yeah Okay And in this scenario this is hanging outside right Well we re going to hang it in our classroom And since we don t have a lot of sun today we re going to make our own light energy with this lamp So don t look at the lightbulb because it s real bright There we go And we re going to set it up here So as we watch this which one of these or which ones might we be able to eliminate So as we observe what can we how will we know which ones are true or not true Let me give you a minute to think I want to hear from someone new I haven t heard from yet Who haven t I heard from yet Augustine A because I wasn t sure if the ground was wet or dry Perfect yeah It can t soak into the ground right So we ll see if the counter is wet if there s a puddle there then we ll know that A is the correct answer Excellent Others that we might be able to eliminate just by observing Jake B it disappears and no longer exists because nothing can t disappear Something can t disappear unless it goes into a black hole Okay will we be able to observe that though No Not really yeah So that one might be tricky but that s good prior knowledge Jamie others that we might be able to eliminate We can tell if it moved up to the clouds because there s no way it can move up to the clouds because there s a ceiling Yeah there s a ceiling Well so if we saw a cloud forming in our classroom right then we d know that it makes a cloud But if we don t see a cloud then we ll know that we can eliminate that one That one s wrong Good Others that we can eliminate Miley F it went up to the sun because it can t we don t have a sun in the classroom If we saw it right gathering up the light right that might tell us that maybe F is true But it can t get to the sun because it s stuck in our classroom Good Any others that we might be able to eliminate Emmie We might be able to well C because if the cloud isn t wet anymore and you can t see anything or feel anything we would know that that s true Okay okay So if it disappears we can t see it or feel it in the cloth but we can t see it anywhere else maybe we ll know that C is more likely Okay good Very good Excellent So we re going to keep observing for these things Those are the things that we want to keep an eye out look for a cloud forming look for water puddling at the bottom look for water gathering at the light See if it chemically changed into a new substance we might be able to see it right in our classroom somewhere So we ll be observing for that Is it going to happen immediately No No so we ll have to come back to this one Keep looking back as we go In the meantime uh oh No here we go We ll go to the next one next scenario What s in the bubbles So turn to that scenario in your notebook if you re not there right now What s in the bubbles So Hannah is boiling water in a glass teakettle She notices bubbles forming on the bottom of the kettle that rise to the top and wonders What is in the bubbles She asks her family what they think This is what they say So who agrees with Dad Who may agree with Dad Owen Well since it s being heated and being heated from the bottom the bubbles will form on the bottom as heat and then the heat would make it rise to the top Okay the heat makes it rise to the top Good Other ideas Other people who agree with Dad Mitch Well I agree with Dad and Calvin Okay And for Dad if the bubbles are heat maybe the heat forms the bubbles and then the oxygen in the bubbles makes it float to the top Okay okay So let s move on to Calvin then Other thoughts about Calvin Who agrees the bubbles are filled with air Reed I forgot Okay we ll come back to you Anybody else agree with Calvin Anyone I haven t heard from yet today No Trenton anything for you to contribute Well I didn t at first and I don t really know if I do still but like I kind of do because with the water all water has oxygen in it which is kind of like air and then the air could be in the bubbles because the bubbles would probably heat up and be at the bottom and then the air would fill up from the water and go into the bubbles and then Okay so there s air in the water and as it heats up it comes out of the water Okay other ideas Miley I agree with Trenton and Mitch because they could be both filled with air but they could be hot because it s where the source of heat is Okay alright Reed did you remember Yes Okay go ahead Well the heat can take the air out of the water The heat would take the air out of the water like Trenton was saying And since air s lighter than water it would rise to the top It goes to the top Okay good How about Grandma The bubbles are an invisible form of water Anyone agree with Grandma Rupo I said I believe with Grandma because I thought that they d go up to the top I thought it was just invisible because I thought it was just going up and the cloud s just evaporating higher and higher Okay so there are the bubbles are evaporated water And then go away Okay Matthew Well it had to be a form of water because it came from water I guess and they re invisible so yeah Okay so it had to be water because it s coming from water and you can t see it so it s invisible Uh huh Great How about Mom The bubbles are empty there s nothing inside them Who agrees with Mom Who agrees with Mom Jonathan I think that there s nothing inside the bubbles because how could anything get in the bubbles in the first place How could that turn into bubbles Okay how could anything be in there Where would it have come from Yeah Okay Anybody else agree with Mom Anybody else agree with Mom Okay how about Lucy The bubbles contain oxygen and hydrogen that separated from the water Lots of hands Who haven t I heard from today Jodie Well I don t really know why because it just sounded more scientific Sounds more scientific Okay Any other reasons No No Alright Kyle can you add on to that I think in the water when it s not hot that there s oxygen and hydrogen and other things in it and then when it heats up it forms into I don t know It rises up Okay so where did the oxygen and hydrogen come from I think it s part of the water It s part of the water Okay Good Emmie Well I know that I m pretty sure water is made of two oxygen molecules and one hydrogen molecule Opposite Oh other way around Yup two hydrogens and one oxygen You re right Okay and I m with Lucy because bubbles usually kind of probably form by the water and inside and since the water s the molecules that that s what s happening Okay so water 
 the fact that he couldn t do it because he didn t have enough money to do it What would you do in that situation Would you try to get money Isn t this kind of different because we re all girls Yeah but If it was a boy and he was the one who didn t have money Do you feel like the chapters that we read do you feel like you could tell what Pip was going to be doing Kind of You could tell that he was becoming more stuck up wants to change himself and not be around the poor people Are you doing the discussion director Did you do any questions in regards to his did you have any direct questions with regards to the text Yeah One of them was like how did Pip change from the beginning of the book to where he s at now like his character and basically how he acted What was the question I missed Brianna where you said about the girls I didn t hear the question I just heard your response His was in Chapter 29 when he is becoming part of her marriage he was just like how would you feel or whatever None of us really had an answer because the situation is different like it s different for the guys She s the one who s like the rich girl Who s the recording one So on page 128 paragraph two that s where Herbert tells Miss Havisham s story That s important because it kind of explains why she is the way that she is He explains that you meet Miss Pocket and then she s kind of like he kind of explains why she s kind of crazy All right Chapter 8 was interesting because he was home from war and in the camp He started to treat people He treated them like they were all heroes And he shared the cigarettes with him one time He shared the cigarettes with them and was even When he was amongst the Russians he didn t care They were struggling to survive He felt sorry for them which as a connector I ve connected it to I don t know if you guys have seen Tears of the Sun I have And Avatar In Tears of the Sun he wanted to go and try to rescue people but he got stuck behind enemy lines like they re struggling people too trying to gain their freedom And then same thing in Avatar Paul kind of reminded me of how he was behind and he was with the Russians but he thought that they weren t as bad as he the military was the only bad part about them Civilians he felt sorry for them that they had to go through all this They were being killed Their people were being killed And they were actually just regular people trying to make it Everybody was dying because they used all this stuff in the military and they weren t caring about the civilians The prisoners They were They had to trade whatever they had to get like a couple supplies to the refugees He started to wonder like why are people higher up people he d never met forcing them Yeah So then this whole section made me think about that So I thought that could be like the controversial part to talk about This whole section Which whole section The one you were just talking about They re talking about magic Yeah They re talking about the magic and being invisible and then he and scares them away It really showed a struggle between Antonio internally with religions Yeah In one he had keys and then in the other one it was totally crazy Yeah That s my next section is that dream I think it s page 119 That whole dream is really important because it s like it kind of highlights what I just said about how he might be the next person or whatever He goes to this dream and it s kind of the same thing he s been facing through the whole book his mom s side versus his dad s side And Ultima kind of comes out and is like Well you are both You have to find a happy medium It s all within the world of his dreams And then page 139 One part that I thought was really really important was his brother at the brothel These two chapters I think they re kind of jam packed I just kind of picked stuff that would be good to talk about And then page 139 paragraph three they re talking about how the group can be buried in the casket of time I just felt that was informative and something that we should look at Just pretty much the whole funeral The funeral was good styling Like I don t know these four chapters There was no part where you didn t It s like read these four chapters Exactly After I read the chapter I wrote some questions down The first one is what did the contrast between the golden carp and the black bass how the golden carp made the black bass jump And his missing of the bass symbolizes maybe like a win for Abel The golden carp story was just very interesting The whole controversy is that he s Catholic but part of him really wants to believe in this whole It s not like he wasn t interested in it but he still didn t believe But then he still respected the story itself and the respect of the carp It made me feel like the golden carp would bring it up Could Antonio It made me feel that Antonio s struggle between his mother s beliefs and his father s how his father was like on the corpse strewn shore I remember there was something like when you re in the ocean it s the same water It s like Ultima came in She was like You don t pick one You re both That s it You can t just choose one path You should be a priest cowboy I think the way it was portrayed was like because of the way he was brought up it was kind of showing the negative She s brought up She s not there but she s brought up too much I feel like she s a goal though to be like be some kind of spirit type thing He hopes that she s like someone who s not fake So I guess he s trying to like make things work with everyone else and see like what his relationship with other people and to finally be able to call a I feel like he compares all of his relationships to her He has that standard Didn t he point out like all the flaws of her That was just creepy I was just like Poor guy to have all of these weird awkward dreams I m going to say foreshadowing I m sticking by that and saying Ultima s going to die and he s going to be the new I m sticking by that and that s foreshadowing Look at you go All of those things are foreshadowing or are they just predicting something that happened in the past Most of them Well I think the one where remember where he went into a brothel in the one dream Right Exactly So I think that most of the dreams are foreshadowing They re not showing directly what happens but hints Basically I m a beast We don t even have to read the rest of the book because I just gave it to you Because we know what s happening I said also in chapter 14 the bad dream what do you make of it Is he seeing the sinners as deserters that all witches are being spun out and that he needs to step forward Or does the golden carp have like stronger power What do you think it symbolizes I think there are good witches and there are bad witches The bad witches are the ones that should be like That s Antonio s issue as well I think he s kind of figured out that there s something different about Ultima I think he s kind of figured out that he s kind of just like Oh they re evil and she s good If she s a witch then she s evil So it s kind of this contrast of can a witch be good It s kind of like the question of what he wants to believe versus It kind of relates to the Civil War and the Africans and their personal stuff It kind of relates to that The white people they didn t want to believe that they re intelligent and they re friends He doesn t want to believe that a witch can be good because he s been told otherwise And he s a Catholic and witches are evil I think that the golden carp symbolizes perhaps the rebirth I think the two most important themes symbol figures are the owl and the carp 
NFL Yeah So here s like you can see that the professional players who can pay that money They re really rich so there s so much sponsors that they pay for their helmets But like in high school football what they want is long pass cheaper material So they don t care much about The health about the guys they want to go just Their problem is the money of the helmets How much cost of helmet is like helmets with Kevlar or that stuff like they use in the military equipment So how can we combine your thoughts and your thoughts so that we can save these thoughts So what kind of ideas you guys have How could you design a helmet so it s not this big or really neat and super expensive The type of padding we use So what ideas do you guys have So what kind of So you play football What kind of padding right now is inside of the helmet I mean they re not soft It s like it s air glove It s almost like a hard balloon stuck to your head So it s just one on the side and the whole top is full and one on the other side and one in the back But that s it I mean you could actually feel the hit But it you just don t get a concussion unless you re heavy So have you ever been hit Have you ever had a helmet to helmet contact So where did you get hit My head Almost like right here On top of your head Right but there s padding there Oh but you said you could still feel it I mean I could feel it for like a quick couple of seconds or so Then it just goes away It s because of the padding I guess It s umm It s like So is there any way that you would change the design of the helmet that you have now Um more cushion Okay So that s kind of going back to what Angel was talking about So how can we change the design to make it more cushiony but Because if you have something that s too cushiony right is that going to decrease the time or increase the time and decrease the force if it s really cushiony Oh that s really cushiony Yeah Oh you mean like it will just go Yeah No Right So you re saying you want it more cushiony you re saying you want it cheaper you re saying you want it smaller I think like what Matt s kind of saying is more for comfort than for safety Right Right So why So can you relate sort of to what Angel s saying and why if it is more cushiony it would be more dangerous Umm with the head rattling Like if it hits on this side it s quicker to hit the other side Is that what you mean what So how So think about how the padding is right now How it s stiff compared to something that kind of gave So think about relating this back to force times the change in time You can ask If it s built too soft it s going to hit you with a stronger force So what could happen to the time It s going to be slower it s going to be faster It s going to be faster so what s going to happen to the force The force is going to increase So it s going to hurt even more and it will be more dangerous So what you need is like a stable material that not too soft but at the same time So besides Kevlar which you brought up which is I was thinking like like for example when you are hit and you re hit you want that like bulletproof that the force spreads in all the space of the body of the helmet So is you are hit here all the force is not concentrated in this place but is moving over all the helmet So it displaces the force so it s not on one area So I was like thinking like maybe like this big the helmet then in the middle like like a wave like when it hits it spreads to all the helmet So that s you versus less you spread all the force on your head so you have like less Something that will transfer the motion Yeah I like this idea But what I was thinking is that we could put layers so instead of hitting the helmet right away you hit something cushiony first so have something cushiony on the outside so that it takes time for you to hit the helmet And once you hit the helmet the small cushiony so that it takes time for that to hit the other hard part which would then hit cushion again and then hit you So kind of like an atmosphere Yeah it will have like little layers It will probably have to make the helmet a little bit like bigger But not like Don t make it like huge but have layers on there and then incorporate his idea when you re making waves So something like that first layer could help dissipate the force So we have cushiony against cushiony like boxers use And then they have the hard part on the bottom when they do little wrapping So we have the cushiony part first So it s going to take time and I think that s what they use They put cushion on there so that it takes time for you to actually feel the force So that the force will be less And if you have cushion with cushion It s because you are increasing the time Yeah because if you have two helmets that are hitting each other that are cushion and cushion it will take longer for them to hit each other And then the force will be decreased My question for Matt is How big is the helmet Oh The padding It s like thick It s kind of thick That s just the padding and then you have the helmet which is like that much more Yeah It s like that thick How heavy is the helmet Like when you re wearing it does it feeling like it s weighing you down Yeah it takes time to get used to it And that day you re neck will hurt That s how heavy it is Another version of like what we are trying to do I think it d also be cool Maybe like helmet were like it was fitted to like the head and then it d have like inbetween kind of like a net structure which is a part of uh kind of like what he had but something that is hung I want to kind of imagine it like the bridges How they have like a whole bunch of little columns But just a whole bunch that is attached to the outside of the helmet I will draw it and I ll show you guys You had your hand up do you want to share while he Yeah I was wondering since we re talking about the injuries and can you guys give an example of the type of brain damage that you can get Just like an actual name Like I heard concussion Other injuries other names Can you tell What a concussion is What is a concussion Ask the group Well a concussion is when It s when you your brain between your actual brain and your skull There is a liquid like Spinal fluid is it and that s supposed to cushion your brain from touching the or hitting your skull But a concussion is when it s hitting and it s going back and forth I mean gradually it will go back to normal but That s my understanding of concussion And you would have lost like feeling for like one or two seconds on the biggest areas of the impact So what part do you think is the most dangerous part to hit of your brain on your brain The sides What do the sides control Well it wasn t like that I thinking like in the structure of the of the skull So the sides where the nerves enter like Your optic nerves Yeah So I think that s like less pain It s like a really big hit here can kill a man So I think that hit is worst You re saying the skull is thinnest right there Yeah It s not as thick as the other parts It s thickest like right here What does your frontal lobe control So that s what kind of separates us from other species is that we have the most developed frontal lobe And then on the sides is more of your sensory stuff and then in the back is your actually your Occipital lobe for your eyes is in the back a long with your movement your cerebellum So different spots that s why you have padding here and here and back here is to protect all sides of the brain So a concussion is just like your brain keeps vibrating basically after the blow So I like to think about it and I meant to bring this in and I apologize So if you have Think about your Tupperware and inside the Tupperware you have an egg You just cracked a nice egg inside and then you shake it So imagine that egg is your brain And that Tupperware is your skull So the harder you rattle it what s going to happen to the egg It will break It s gonna break right The yolk s going to break right I mean your brain doesn t really break But you can think that It s just kind of the movement Because if you think about what does Newton s first law say An object that s in motion will stay in motion unless acted upon by outside force So if the brain If you get hit here which way is your brain going to go That way Until it hits the skull and then it s going to thunk So that s what they call rattling your cage I was thinking of like when I play baseball when I swing the bat and I hit the ball and my hands keep like I can feel it inside and like even after a minute it will keep rattling So now take that and think about how that would Okay So David can you uh Explain what you have so we can This is kind of like the bridge idea that I had where like there s like different columns that go around like the frame So in this it would kind of be like the head goes right here and the helmet s right here And these would be like some kind of material that s bendable So when something hits it they would bend in so to absorb kind of the impact Kind of like a cage in the racing cars Like how racing cars have a cage inside of them Just in case they roll over the cage still protects the person Yeah kind of No but Yeah kind of like that but these are like cushions Yeah So they absorb the momentum So like a coil Like for your bed The bed spring that when you jump up on it you rebound back so Wouldn t that be more dangerous if it s elastic Yeah it s elastic and when we did the little cars When it was elastic it completely transferred all of its momentum to the other car So when you get hit it will just like swing and then all the momentum will hit you instead of both of you sharing it So if you share it d probably be better But I don t know if that s Because I was also thinking of mattresses A little sleep mattresses and how they talked about the coils and how they give you pressure points and it will be stronger over here than over here and then they have the new ones now that are like foam The Tempurpedic ones Yeah So I was thinking also if you like spread out where the momentum goes Saying if you spread out where it won t be in one certain area Then you won t get hit really hard right here And if you get hit hard like over here it d probably be better than getting hit hard just right there Yeah It will probably be less of a force So when they design like a helmet they ve got one piece thing where it s like your body their shoulder pads connected to their helmet So your body absorbs some of that too instead of just your head So that depends how you turn your head And would it be good if your body have you guys ever heard that people who are like drunk drivers they kind of walk away from a car crash and it s the passengers or the victims are the ones that get hurt the most So think about what s different between their body in motion and the other person s body in motion So they re looser right They re not tightening their muscles compared to someone who is trying to absorb the impact We flex right Just waiting for it and so by being more rigid your body doesn t move You re trying to fight against the motion So you get more of the whiplash and stuff like that Because you It hurt your body more because you re trying to fight against what you re body is actually going to do instead of the other person who s just like really loose is moving with it so there s not as much impact Well I ve been playing football and how you play like you want to win You hit someone you want to After that you re still going and if you are like losing the other person is stronger than you can beat you up like I know What he is saying is like if you see someone about to collide with you you want to hit him back instead of Yeah Why is that Related that to momentum Because momentum is vector right So you have to think about the direction and of the way that things are moving So think back to When we were playing with different cars So you had the greater mass in one car going this way And had the smaller mass going this way Right So what would you want to do to the smaller mass car to make sure that the impact of the Raise his speed Increase the speed right And so by knowing that you re going to get hit you re going to run a little faster So then what was the what is the ending result there So like if you have more speed you hit the other object that has more mass Mean like how do you think is like Inelastic I don t know like So what s going to happen Are they going to stay stuck together So it s elastic so it comes off right Think about it like a rubber band an elastic rubber band You can stretch it so elastic is is saying something that s going to rebound whereas inelastic you re just rigid There is no motion I guess you should say I thought that was inelastic when you hit something it will both go off completely and elastic it will stick together And inelastics magnets 
 Isn t it nuclear fission when like fusion No fusion is when they combine Nuclear fission is like when they split apart right Yes so it s a fission process See Ah So that s a I see that that efficient Efficient It increases the safety though right It s impossible to explain No I m just saying does it No I don t understand Am I the only one here Apparently to you though So why is it that when the atom is unstable it s radioactive It could be it s removing protons and neutrons I think you guys can discuss this Isn t it when like it starts releasing the neutrons to a different atom or something and then it gains the neutron and that s when it starts becoming like More vulnerable More vulnerable and it starts like a chain reaction You guys agree I agree I agree I agree with everybody That s right So how can radiation help them Like Amy said It could also help in the electricity and helps us get our resources Like you said What else though Like cancer Cancer Cancer I mean I had an aunt that suffered from cancer and it kind of helped her even though she passed away It kept her longer than it would have been without her having medication Any last thoughts Okay that s fine thank you I have only one major I guess comment about that one I noticed Steve used a lot of vocabulary words He did remember a lot of the words and I think he planned for that And then I liked the way that David actually redirected the group He asked the group How can radiation help us right at the end and then people responded to that So he kind of helped redirect the questions for the discussion group So and then people were able to respond So that was a nice way to create a discussion Okay question number two Three Three I m sorry Okay I mean How about number four next Okay I m going to do number four next No Do number three The one with three No I m going to do four No I want to do three Okay number four is going to go next You have two minutes to prepare Number four Just ignore it What is that A microphone Oh it works So they can hear me right now Oh It s recording Well why do you think President Obama might support building nuclear power plants in the USA and what are some arguments for nuclear energy David put that away Okay Jane who s going to go next Me Jane Okay so which vocabulary and evidence are you going to focus on Nuclear power plant nuclear power plant Well pick several The nuclear yeah The nuclear power plant can help us create more energy I mean well it s Nuclear radiation for my argument You know what Dano was saying No He was just going to put power plants Do you know what it is Yeah it s where they Yeah Okay what does it do Creates energy Okay Okay what other evidence are you going to use though The fact that we are running out of well we re not running out of but in the future we might not be able to find enough energy So we need to start We need to start thinking about the future like Jobs and stuff No future things that are like the future and what s going to happen and energy and how are we going to have a good supply Like what if we were running out and start thinking about that Okay so the next person Okay so the people on the outside if you were recording the vocabulary last time I want the people on the outside to switch so that you re recording something different So if you did evidence first switch to vocabulary If you did vocabulary switch to evidence Oh Sindi sit like right here Okay this question is why do you think President Obama might support building nuclear power plants in the U S and based on the video we watched what are some arguments to be made for nuclear energy I think President Obama might support building nuclear power plants in the U S because it doesn t release chemicals therefore it s eco friendly making the U S more green Environmentally green I agree with her because another reason I think the president might support it is because like like right now we re in an economic crisis what you call the thing And then like making new plants may create more jobs for people It ll create jobs for building them and then it ll also benefit everybody for clean power I agree I agree because it builds economic stabilization and it ll create jobs for the future like for more years because in order to run a nuclear power plant you need you know like to build it And once it s built you still need to work with it so I think the job s going to last for a while I agree But if we re in an economic crisis like if we re in an economic crisis how are you going to pay for it Like where s the money going to come from Well we re already in debt so we ll get even more debt Yeah it costs a lot to build a nuclear reactor We d get funding Yeah And we have to like think about the future and how it s going to benefit you know for the economy and making more power plants would just provide like a stable future for the upcoming people and the jobs because it supplies more jobs and stuff And more you know we ll get more electricity You know if we build more nuclear power plants Yeah and not just 20 but more like the other countries who have 30 and stuff like that needs luxuries rising electricity demands It won t leave the U S behind and all the new tech stuff And the more factories and the more power plants we produce we make the more electricity and the more factories it will get more stuff It will build the more jobs and that will raise up the economic problems Yeah because more stuff will be done that way So now you guys have given a lot of arguments supporting nuclear energy What do you think is the biggest problem with nuclear energy that we should be aware of The thing that causes cancer Probably be the radioactive waste that the nuclear power plants give off Well they don t give it off the water the coolant or whatever And then like they don t have nowhere to store it I think it was some cave thingy that they were trying to build but they didn t build They re going to run out of space to put the waste in Also it s going to cause cancer to everyone But doesn t it cure cancer and stuff It has benefits but more like some freak accident can happen like what happened in Fukushima Or the third mile At the Three Mile Yeah So say you never know what can happen that s the downside Because if it does happen then it s like downhill from there because people start getting sick then their kids start dying and I don t know Yeah and like Giovanni said if we are in an economic crisis like where are we going to get the rest of the money We re just going to get it from debt and stuff like that We re going to help raise it up but we ll also fall more in debt Yeah Going back to the nuclear waste can someone elaborate on why is the nuclear waste such a problem Because it s just there Kevin I think nuclear waste will cause more wars and pollution That s what I think Cause more what It causes more war and pollution War Well I mean This isn t on camera right Okay someone else Wait what was the question again Elaborate on what is nuclear waste Nuclear waste Why is that such a problem for us Well it s a problem because there s nowhere where you could actually safely put it Other than like I think they have this I read something about they have an island where all the waste of nuclear waste goes That s the only place that you can like get rid of it Don t throw it in the ocean because it ll contaminate everything You can t just like leave it in the ground because then it ll probably like leak And also doesn t it if it rains if water gets in it it s dangerous So that s why they have to find a place where it s not like Why is it dangerous if water gets into it Soil I guess The waste and the water mix and then like it runs down into the soil and it might go into the ocean or the sewers and it ll mess up the ocean or like water And we end up drinking it And scientists are trying to find ways to get rid of the waste like they re thinking of shooting it out into space or anything One thing nobody talked about was half life What does the half life have to do with nuclear waste I think a bunch of years What does it have to do with Obama Say it louder What Say it louder We re talking about that noise Wait what was your question What does half life have to do with nuclear waste Half life nuclear waste So energy So why is nuclear waste bad exactly Oh because they haven t determined the amount of years of when the half life is I think they determined like So they so it was an estimate It wasn t actually a fact they just estimated that so it could be before so they wouldn t be able to prevent to prevent it from affecting society Oh good So let s just get this done Let s try the next group okay Thank you I know Bryan I don t need to look it up I know this already Okay Do you guys want to break before you go up Okay you guys get one or two minutes to prep yourself So it s not a shock Okay question number three let s come up People seem anxious let s do this Okay no phone Diana We re missing people Yeah we are Okay so people on the outside you guys should switch So if you did evidence you know So what you did one time evidence looking for evidence and one time you re looking for vocabulary Okay So people on the outside make sure you re checking different parts Okay so what I might change the question you guys What It happens Okay number three What recommendations would you make to President Obama regarding clean energy and climate change So for example they re trying to build two nuclear power plants in Georgia So what recommendations will you make to him about building in Georgia Building in jorj ee uh Georgia the state Um I think he should make sure that employees aren t making careless mistakes such as the human error in the Three Mile Island I think that he should promote programs on alternative energy but not just nuclear energy But he could also use nuclear energy because it could because the field cost and operating cost is low and 20 of our energy already comes from nuclear energy So we could just get more energy through nuclear power I think we shouldn t use it because of it causes harm to people and you never know when an accident happens and it might hurt the environment and it leads to cancer Okay nuclear energy affects public safety and it creates nuclear power plants create toxic waste I would still try to build a nuclear power plant because it could also boost our economy when it s most struggling Recommendations I would make to Obama regarding nuclear energy is that to stop because it s too dangerous to handle and that if it gets in the hands of terrorists they can use it to murder to murder me or destroy countries We can t prevent natural disasters from destroying nuclear power plants then the nuclear radiation which is unstable can harm by radioactivity and a nuclear spill has happened in the past with human error that hit Fukushima And this means that it can happen to anyone even us That s what I wrote I think it could be a good idea but I think they should focus more on how it could harm people to try and control the harmfulness so it won t harm people Yeah I think it s a good idea I think my recommendation for Obama is that it is not good to nuclear because it s going to affect us it s going to affect our pollution And he s going to spend like more energy on that and he can save more money if he didn t do that Yeah I agree with Charlie too We don t know what nuclear energy could also like harm us which ways Or I mean we do but I mean it s better Like we could just focus on studying more like having more thoughts Like ask him what s better It s like to choose nuclear plants or to keep using what we re using now So I have to change one question Based on all the videos and the articles you guys saw and read what argument has influenced you the most The Fukushima argument So go ahead and explain it to the group though Because um things happen and they just prove to us that they can also happen to us like human error And I think they made people evacuate the cities and the damage the area which is nobody can go because it s radioactive and they have to wait for the atoms to decay which is like I don t know thousands of years just for the half life and we won t be able to use that space anymore It kills everything People got cancer 
 Does that include slaves Yes Does that include women Yes Okay So how are we supposed to take uneducated people s opinions when they obviously don t know what s gonna happen Because a lot of people in Russia I mean if the Russian s knew how to read they would write a song If they knew what was going on and they were smart enough they would obviously write a song about it I think John Locke had one more thing to say is that right Yes okay and to answer your question about the government The government was created to protect people s rights it wasn t created for you to abuse power and just do what you think you need to do they are only for them and it s not doing what it needs to do then yeah the people do have the right People aren t dead so obviously I m doing what I need to do and I m protecting them If that s all you care about then that would just be easy not to let people die Obviously they re not having problems where their lives threatened We have all these like If you re wherever you live Anyways wherever you live if your king or queen wasn t doing what they thought to protect you guys and you had all these invaders coming in then you could argue being mad at them because they re not protecting you and doing their job That s when you know they re upset Plus you re saying that your people aren t educated but they re educated enough to know what their rights are and how they should be treated so I mean you can think you should be treated in a certain way but I could say I think I should be able to slide on this floor right now but I might not know if I slide on this floor right now I m gonna die But because I m not educated in that kind of way But your king or queen is educated in that kind of way so they re not gonna let you do stuff like that We re not asking for stuff like that we re asking for our natural rights I know that they What s the word The end result Conclusion I know the conclusion of you guys getting your natural rights and the way that you guys are acting for them In a way I m gonna get you guys what you guys need to get your conclusion is gonna be a whole lot better than what you guys are hoping So what s the point of having your natural rights if you re going to abuse the law It doesn t mean you re going to abuse the law it just means that you re gonna be more cooperative towards the law You re attributed to a beggar if they don t give you your natural rights It s like a two way type thing If they give it to you then you re gonna be happy about it and you re gonna want to follow them and listen to them Instead of trying to revolt and kick them out if they re not gonna give it to you Alright so we say government is a good thing bad thing or kind of in between Let s go around the room real quick What would you guys say I would say government is a positive thing because it stopped some starving and it keeps everything in place Okay good We re in between Because it s there to protect your rights but if they re not gonna be there to protect you then they shouldn t be there at all Okay so it has to be done in the correct way Government is a good thing Any explanation why Because if you don t have a government then you aren t organized and if you re not organized then you re like chickens would be in your home We think that philosophers they write what they feel about us and they don t do anything about it and they don t understand where we re coming from You philosophers are lucky men You write on paper and paper is patient Unfortunate Empress that I am I write on the susceptible skins of living beings Meaning that they write on paper because they can put out they opinion like that but we have to be responsible for all the people in our country and we re trying to do what s best for them In your opinion Frederick We think government is interesting because we need a government to be organized But government also does a lot of bad stuff We think the government is completely necessary along with religion because it brings unity to the people And I think the laws and religion kind of go hand in hand because I wouldn t consider myself a Christian but others probably would because of certain stuff I write in books that s why they consider me as a heretic but the bible says Thou shall not kill Killing someone is also against the law Thou shall not steal is also against the law I feel the government is good if it uses the right power basically for their rights and things As long as It should be there we feel it should be there but it needs to be used appropriately We believe sort of that the government is a positive If you didn t have a government as a base structure for your country If you didn t The government perhaps is a positive Due to the fact that the government helps you if you need it to an extent I agree with Catherine the Great in the fact that it sort of really helps with the territory I ve been interviewed by many people and specifically saying to many people I ve said it that I m capable of saying whatever I want So my country is there and I get to do whatever I want If you were the king you d do whatever you want to Theoretically Alright Voltaire Pretty much the government is an abomination I mean there s way more bad and nasty leaders than there are good lawful public leaders that do good stuff Too many leaders take advantage of their people in their kingdoms so I think they should just all go away start over with enlightened total What about slavery What do you think about slavery What do you people think about slavery What about slavery Anybody have an opinion Is slavery good bad or otherwise I wouldn t say slavery is a negative then again I wouldn t say that it s a bad thing either I guess you could say mostly slavery came from Austria due to the fact that if you get in trouble with another country and they sand to the Austria you re pretty much going to be a slave for the rest of your life You pretty much work for them You work for the Pope himself and you work for the Roman Emperor Voltaire I think slavery is a necessary evil A necessary evil Well we disagree with because we see everyone as equals and think everyone should be treated equally and it s part of their natural rights such as freedom Exactly that would be considered one of their natural rights Rousseau Serfs which were similar to slaves very good Last comment there Thomas Hobbes I don t think we really have an opinion on slavery but if the king decided to have slavery in the country I think we should respect that and do it for the betterment of the country Respect the authority of the king No piling up because that s what slavery is there for Okay Very good Any last minute comments I think we re almost out of time for our salon discussion I heard a lot of good ideas Does anybody have any last minute comments that they want to add Yes Frederick A lot of things that we have to say I didn t get Three things of everybody s opinion All you guys are really self You re not sinners or anything For lack of better words And I wouldn t read them meaning I would probably do anything to get support from my people and I d do anything for my people Like my dad would do anything for me he raised me well And slavery and natural rights and all that mumbo jumbo shouldn t be from you because you re not them You re not just as you re not Voltaire and I m not Thomas So you can t overrule anybody else it s not right Very good Excellent job ladies and gentlemen Thank you for attending our little salon here Hopefully we learned some new ideas and got to hear some other opinions of people throughout Europe so let s give yourselves a little round of applause Alright you are now done with the salon You can take your little parts if you want and put them up because you are no longer those people you are now you in modern day times Back to modern day times But I do have some questions we are not done with our discussion but you are not longer your person you are back to being you We are not done and I m going to ask you your questions now Please listen What was the purpose of a salon We ve talked about this from what you ve right here What was the purpose of a salon Exchange ideas Exchange ideas any other purposes Sometimes like Joseph did over there but to find out what people thought of you Okay to find out different opinions Okay maybe see something from a different side or viewpoint It was a devised to discuss music who gets painting time Okay so it has an artistic point to it as well It was just another way for us to learn about taking notes and stuff Like research on our person and then hearing what the other people thought But as far as back then is what we re thinking about Oh back then Oh Yes you were right about what you said Just to exchange ideas and go back until people like it Would you say there were effective back then Yes We haven t talked about results we kind of left off talking about these people and how they talked about things and came to the salon Do you think this is going to be an effective method of discussing The conversations we were having with them over there like how they didn t think that we were listening to what the people were saying and how we were just gonna stay the way we were and stuff but actually they got to hear our thinking about moving to where we need to go it s gonna take them a little longer to get there Okay Do we have anything like salons today Do we have salons today Yes What happens at salons now Right so it s not so much political all the time in exchanging ideas about government stuff but they re still kind of socialization and gossip going on Is there anything that we have in place or anything in our society today which you can discuss opinions especially about government or problems that you might have in life Um Since salons don t really go with that but So if you have a problem with your country or with the government or with something that s going on we don t have a salon to go and meet like this and talk with people but is there anything that we do that Or any other thing Another way to voice your problem if your dissenting and you have a different agreement or a disagreement with the government or with anybody anything What can you do Don t we have press conferences What do you mean representatives Write letters Write letters to who The government Congress the government okay They also have environment issues and worldwide problems Worldwide problems Okay that s kind of similar Where different people come and talk about their issues their problems and maybe how to solve them You kind of have different levels like if you have a problem with like if it s about the school you go to the school board Okay President or people who are trying to be president they have the debates on TV Okay good As far as being an average citizen what can you do Say there s an issue with the world or an issue in our country or an issue in our city that we want to see fixed what can we do you think to maybe go about fixing that or trying to get that done Protest Protest Is that allowed Are we allowed to protest Yes Were you allowed to protest back then It depends on where you live at Depends on where you live We have a different government now right Back then it was monarchy now it s more of a democracy So what we re seeing here a little bit a little bit different method and a lot more opportunity There s a town like 
 That they need to make some sort of a change Like the turning point Like there s a turning point There s some kind of change that needs to occur Do you guys think that most people take that opportunity and then change No I think some no In Fahrenheit 451 how some people were assuming that Mildred already knew but she just didn t want to not like accept it but not be part of it She didn t want to be part of the change she just wanted to be in tune with society She never gave herself an opportunity to have any kind of turning point Even when she had the opportunity she didn t Right I think emotion plays a big role in that too because Faber let fear get in the way of him doing something so he basically created that little earpiece thing so that somebody else could do it for him and he could watch over somebody that s actually doing it Another person who s carrying the shoes to go through the turning point is Beatty because although he had all of the knowledge much more knowledge than Montag had about society and everything he chose not to go against it because he believed that if he does it then what s the point if he s not going to gain anything out of it Do you think also because he has all that knowledge he wants to use it to have power Since he knows all that he wants to manipulate keep them in control keep them in check and stuff No I don t think it s that he wants power I mean it s that he s seen the bad side of things and like all humans you don t like to go through something when it has lots of negativity in it With education he knows it s good because it helps you think outside of the box and everything but it s bad also because then you have two countering opinions on everything Then you realize that there s genocides there s slavery there s wars there s too much negativity The government also doesn t want that because it probably gives them ideas of where to go The more information they know the more possible ways they can use it against them I like what you said about the government doing that kind of stuff because I guess they see it as a way of knowledge makes people Vulnerable Vulnerable It s like if the people were the government s subordinates so it s not the government s people who they re protecting it s pretty much who they re in control of I kind of want to share my opinion on the turning point thing like in Harrison and bridge around again You get to see the emotion or what George has to go through but yet he doesn t do anything about it Harrison does It says right here His thoughts fled and panicked like bandits from a burglar alarm It s showing you what he has to go through for his thoughts to be taken out of his head or whatever but Harrison is the one doing the actions He s the one that wants to go against the government and George isn t So do you think their relationship and the correlation of George and Harrison is just like Montag and Faber s where Faber doesn t want to do anything because he didn t want to go to jail in the South George doesn t want to go to jail because he doesn t want to lighten his own way because he would get what was it seven years Yeah For each sled that he takes out And Harrison is actually doing stuff And Montag isn t doing stuff So do you think that you need that person the one behind the scenes doing the stuff and then a person that s actually doing it or do you just mean people that actually already in action to a bill I think that you need people who are I think that you need people who are but I think that it s easier to so I think that way is better So you don t get in trouble I think the people that have the people in the front lines are always useful They are easier to camoflauge They are the ones with the real plans These people in the front don t usually come up with them Yeah but you have the plans and then you don t do it but what does it matter that you have the plan and you don t know how to use it Well not every body s that brave That s why you need to I think people need the support system like Faber was Montag s support system He had a plan Don t let him tell you he sees walk away walk away I guess here s my question So in looking at our essay question for our final exam tomorrow I want you to think our question is to what extent should citizens comply with unfair laws right created by government I know I m asking you to respond with to what extent should citizens comply with these unfair laws But we re also talking about so who should act right So who should be the one to act out to lead to go against the government Because we re looking at characters who possess the capacity to act out We re looking at people who have knowledge who have strength who are talented But they re not leaders And we re also looking at people who may not have those qualities they have the potential to have those qualities but need a little bit of encouragement and a little bit of a push So when we say to what extent should citizens comply do you guys think that citizens applies to everybody Or is it limited to a group of people who are willing to make those sacrifices Do you even think that s fair that it s a small group of people who make the sacrifice for the whole I want you to think about any types of current or historical events where we ve seen a group of people whether it is a whole group or just a couple of people who take charge who lead and impact change Are there any examples that you can connect to that Do you think that that s even fair for everyone to benefit from the sacrifice of a small group of people I see it as a way every time there s a change or a law or something that affects a certain group of people it s never really based on the whole group of people Like all citizens It s more of a target and when a certain group is attacked or targeted it makes others not really I don t want to say care but it doesn t really matter to them because they re not the ones that are experiencing the negativity of that Or yeah it s just basically it s that group of people who have to I guess express their ideas and it may be scary for some people to go along with it and actually carry out what they think is right but I think it s necessary for a unit You probably need that one person who spreads the message and then I think it is very important for other groups of people to go along with it because you never know when it s going to be your turn So here s my question because on your AP exam on your final exam for your argumentative essays you have to be able to generate your own examples So I know Omar you ve got a very clear idea but does any body have a historical reference or a current event that we can tie that idea to something specific and that s what you can discuss Let s see if we have any ideas here about historical or current events that we could really provide as really concrete examples that we could look at because you want to get specific You want to say hey let s look at this specific example where this actually happened Any thoughts on that Anything with slavery with Frederick Douglass and the abolitionists in the north They really felt the need that slavery was needing to be abolished and I guess that s where civil disobedience comes from is the abolishment of slavery Well the need to abolish slavery That it really wasn t really blacks or Africans or whatever you called them back then Wanting to be set free was people that weren t even affected by slavery that wanted them to be set free And I think that s more important and more appeals to your emotion because these people have no tie to slavery They re not benefiting they re not getting negative from it so it s like you really think that it s wrong when someone else is not affected by the situation It s saying that it s wrong I want to connect to what you just said about to the idea of the mental slavery that s going on right now because I guess maybe not a lot of you are aware but there s I don t know if you guys heard something about the green eye That recently that s in the past And I think that s very important because that affects me in a way because many people wanna go to college but I guess the idea of going to college and getting your degree but then not excelling in what you are supposed to be excelling in That kind of stops them and discourages them from to keep going So I guess that idea is I don t know it s kind of opressive because they re trying to maintain you in that little it s just marginalizing you and yeah I think it needs more support So I want you to think about that example because there were a lot of protests right People were really protesting that and there were a lot of these laws that people were standing against right And when we look at the questions to what extent should we comply with unfair laws If that is an unfair piece of legislation to what extent do you then choose to protest How far would you be willing to take it Because we talked about this this line between pushing your protest and your form of rebellion Like look at Harrison right Dancing on stage as a ballerina Doesn t really seem all that tough right But for him he was taking a big stance right Not about borderline violence right I want you to look at what Thoreau did He didn t pay his taxes He wanted to go to jail He was happy there He was like don t bail me out Had nothing to do with violence right You hear a lot of people protesting you know Issues regarding the DREAM Act but to what extent should they comply with the laws Do you use violence Do you even take it there Do you use more creative forms of protesting I want you to consider how far do you take it How far do you show your protest What is acceptable and where do you draw the line Good reaction lots of reaction Let s hear from people we haven t heard from I want you to go back and think about your goals that you set I m hoping those of you that are a little bit quieter in our discussions chose goals that might push you to speak up So let s hear from a few folks that we haven t heard from yet and share the air time Any volunteer Jesus what do you think Like Omar said like the DREAM Act has an ill affect on a lot of people It doesn t really affect me but I know a lot of friends that it is affecting It s not really fair that it really didn t pass but when we want to try to push something like Julian said for slavery it didn t really take it took such a long time for them to really get the rights There was the abolishment there was Frederick Douglass during that time But as time went then came Martin Luther King who was the center person who started the really big move for African Americans to realize their own rights He lead the protests marches if you gather groups of people over time if you speak up with your voice people will hear Even people like African Americans they came and rallied to listen to the idea that everyone being equal There should be rights and everyone no matter what color you are So for Latinos like us for the it s such a short time because we just started also trying to pass our rights but the dream that was once dead but even though it didn t pass people should not be put down like Aw it didn t pass So they ll just forget you got to stand back right up and get more people and to continue to pass on for your rights cause if we stay together anything can happen If we stay together as one something will happen I am hearing two things and we ll get back to Stephanie really quickly I think she s just itching to get in this conversation I m hearing two things One that it takes a collective group effort It s not just one person but it needs to be many people involved As many people involved And I m also hearing that it takes a lot of time So those are a couple of factors that play in to going against unfair laws That s kind of like right now that it s kind of more modern because You think so no no no I want you take this idea that Omar brought this idea of mental slavery of oppression of our intellect our intelligence Is that something that you think is just recent Is that something that s been happening over time I want you to think about that and see we might isolate one part of the problem but I want you to think on a broader scale Is it really just one isolated event or is this one in a stream of events Stephanie you had something that you were Yeah all of them were in the governement and I was thinking of the movie Milk How they have to fight for the rights for equality for homosexuals and what he does is he runs for office in California and to be heard which is kind of like civil disobedience in a way But he does it in a bigger way for them to be heard One part in the movie that I ll always remember is when a guy in a wheelchair calls him to tell him that he s gay and all of that But he just hangs up but yet he does it for him most likely because he wants people like that to be heard And that s kind of what my connection is I think another historical event besides the slavery and what you just said is the nine eleven I think it s the short term one It took actually really quick the terrorists going up there It just took one simple idea to tell them Oh let s just go 
 I m not too sure if I like this screen print with the acrylic on top of it I m not too sure about that It makes it less It s different in an awkward way I don t know how to explain it It doesn t have any depth to it It has no dimension Like she s standing there he has to take the paint and try to add dimension to it and then It looks like she s laying down Actually yeah it does I mean he has to take the paint and try and add dimension to it and then add the cool and warm colors to make it pop And I m just not feeling it I like the Mick Jagger one but I m not feeling this Taylor Swift one See I like pop art I just I don t know Did you notice that What I thought it was a green that goes in to this That s on them it s more like a quiet like she s sleeping softness But I didn t notice it that it goes into purple periwinkle and this dark violet color that comes out of this red on the bottom half side Did you see that Then it goes in to two and he breaks off the colors And it s like All right let s take a couple of minutes and try to just wrap up some of our questions And then we ll talk about a whole group discussion and see what we all have and what we want to write In a sense it would be a good picture for the stance that she s in You know the title of the album is called Fearless and we decided that it is a powerful stance she does look kinda fearless In the way she s standing The way he did it it just doesn t look like her It s like the wind s coming back and it pushes her hair Yeah but you would think that she would want to be looking directly at the camera But then her hair wouldn t have been like that Yeah but they just need some big ole fans it s Hollywood You can get some big ole fans to blow your hair back You would wanna be looking at the camera if you want to be looking fearless You have to think It s more of country music I mean I could see if you were saying like hip hop pop And you get like all forceful What s Up I m here But they re saying you know she s a pop icon If she s a country artist then why are they putting her on pop billboards and pop charts Because she s mainstreaming into the different areas she s creating kind of a new version of country for the younger generations like you guys You wouldn t compare her to Kenny Chesney Those who want newer generation of country Right All right let s just try and get to our last question and then we ll talk about whole group and get you back in here Let s go ahead and start you guys can chime in when you guys have an answer if you want your input put in So let s just talk about the describe section What we really need to talk about is describing the scene in your own words What kind of words would you use to describe this piece Let s start with Mick Jagger Bold Bold Proud Proud Electric Electric Okay those are good ones What about Taylor Swift It s more feminine More soft It s pale it s delicate and Delicate Soft You said soft It s like he s almost scared when he s doing Taylor Swift compared to Mick Jagger Because Mick Jagger is all rough and boxes everywhere I think he almost makes Taylor look almost intimidated She s kind of pushing away The position and you have all these colors around her With the selection and Innocence Yeah I think we talked about that with Taylor a little bit You kind of have to look at the personality of each artist as well Plus really you have to listen to her lyrics then it like paints a picture She has an innocent expression I d say innocent yeah Okay Fierce You say fierce Okay It s like her personality she just breaks it out with this bold pose All right good So those are some good words key words to describe it So analyzing Let s figure out and pinpoint specific elements and principles of design that we see in the piece that we want to discuss Colors Colors Color s a big one In both of them actually Paint strips The paint strips it looks like it s a lot of paint It kind of creates a lot of movement with the way that it s flowing through the pieces All right so our big ones are color He said in the video color is everything And that s his main focus is color The different colors make the value in the picture the dark colors make the darker shades and light colors He uses more bold colors in Mick Jagger than he did in Taylor And like the contrasting colors of Mick Jagger are more loud I d definitely say it s louder Okay good Let s discuss the movement a little bit So if you look at it I see a lot of movement personally in the touch with the hair I like how the hair is like that and I like her position from the side because I think it adds interest Like I was saying a second ago if she was looking straight forward I don t think the hair would have the same effect as it does from the side And that s just my personal opinion but I like how the hair is kind of flowing through and it s creating the movement through the piece And then with the Mick Jagger one the movement in this piece right here is really interesting to me How he chose the green and the red to contrast each other I think that s big bold move in this area Good Now what are our focal points Faces Faces And what are the big things that factor in for that Why is that What did he do The colors around her make her pop The colors surrounding If you look the face is white right here and then her skin tone is pale as well So that kind of pops out against the bold colors What do you guys think about the materials The silk screen and the acrylic paint You guys got to see a little bit of him working in the video where he gets those huge rows of the acrylic paints from the jars and just dipped in a couple different ones And just started coloring So what do you guys think about his process and the materials he uses He doesn t really choose what direction he just kind of goes with the flow It s very free if you watch him Mindless Mindless creativity He does what comes to him which is interesting Any other comments about the actual process or materials I think It would have been more amazing if he didn t use the silk screens So you d rather him just paint it than add the silk screen I think it would be more like a wow factor And some of his pieces are just paintings More of the people though like the Rollins he painted And the ones he did for President Obama President Reagan some of the Statue of Liberty And also some of the other people like Aerosmith and the Beatles as well And he s usually famous for painting his faces And he would go into the color 
 Trying to find meaning for their lives or were they just trying to what were they questing for do you think Well Gilgamesh was questing for like immortality and that was for him and not really his people but Theseus I think was I don t know I think Theseus was just trying to help the people of Athens I don t think either of them were really looking to find that but they both ended up finding it I think both of them were like looking to help their people and then I also think like a small part of them was looking for glory I think it s kind of like looking for their destiny like they know they re meant for something bigger but they don t know what it is yet so they re just looking for what that is so Then he goes to take the test and the test kills him Or not Then he goes back to his father and he realizes that he s just like you know the father s really disappointed in the son and then he s really disappointed until the son I think it could happen in today s society I don t know about Gilgamesh Well yeah it was a really like Abstract connecting In the really broad sense it could happen but like Like the story line But when you look at details then like no But I mean minotaurs don t exist So it probably couldn t happen But like you were saying like metaphorically it could be something that you know Like the storyline could happen But metaphorically you could compare anything That s true Can you explain more of what you mean by metaphorically Like me No the only one was like You mean hypothetical Theseus not like he goes and fights a minotaur and when he comes back he s like not dead but his dad thinks he s dead and kills himself But it s like Haley said I guess Thanks If you have like a test and like you re bad Like a difficult situation in general Yeah and like your dad or parents or someone are like You can get through this like You can beat it and they think that you or like they think that you fail it or like catastrophe fail it or they think you do then they re gonna be kind of disappointed in you but like they re not gonna necessarily kill themselves because you failed a test But still You can laugh if it was someone else But maybe like on the inside he s dying Yeah Your turn Okay I just said what factors have to be changed to make this apply to modern times Well the Probably the whole like fantasy aspect of it would have to be changed At least like in the to the culture like the gods and goddesses aren t like a you know Big deal Yeah I think that the gods and goddesses kind of like connect with like the people that are not like in charge but that are higher up in our society like the government people and like parents and I just think more like mentors in general Yeah like people that are higher than us Like anyone technically could like you know that you look up to that you rely on for help It s like a figure rather than like Yeah A physical Yeah god God Yeah Well my question was show the similarities and differences between Theseus and his father Ooh okay So I think like they both kind of they re very different in their terms of like loss and like failure Because like when Theseus s dad like thought that he was like dead then he jumped off a cliff and committed suicide But when like Theseus like was with Ariadne or whatever and she like helped him to like defeat the minotaur then he just kind of you know left her on an island I think that I don t really remember how he got in the situation of having to give the people on Crete seven maidens and seven children but like I just think that because that happens and because he does that every year I think Theseus is a better leader he s just like better in charge of I think that they re definitely like different rulers too Because like Theseus is more like including the people like when he goes and like he led his army against Thebes but doesn t try to like most people would like try to steal stuff from the city but he s just going to like bury the dead and then he leaves So like that s more of a nicer leader I guess whereas his dad wasn t really like put in that situation but I m guessing that he would be one of those people who would probably take stuff from that city and not include people very often It says that Because he lived with his mom so he didn t want to have a son So then when he could lift the rock then he could come over and meet his dad Is this question number No we re still asking predict what would happen if King Aegeus and Enkidu hadn t died If the king hadn t died I think the son would have come back and they just would have lived happily ever after and there would have been no like not formed you know what I m talking about Because King Aegeus No but he would have died sometime and then Theseus would have taken over Yeah that s true Can you go dig a little deeper with what you said about the democracy What did you mean by that Oh just like right when King Aegeus died Theseus came over and said We re going to have a democracy instead of me ruling over all of you So like we don t know if that would have happened or because if he just would have stayed alive he could have like changed Theseus mind and made him think a democracy was a bad idea Mm hmm Yeah He would ve wanted him to be he would have that as king He would ve been more like his dad Yeah that s true But if Enkidu didn t die then Gilgamesh would probably like be happy and then like conquer a bunch of other stuff and like they would probably like die together She could have sent him to Athens to claim him as his Oh okay nevermind You re allowed to go on All right No if Enkidu didn t die though I just think that Gilgamesh wouldn t have really known like you know how they said he was really arrogant in the beginning I think he still was kind of arrogant until Enkidu died so he He would have stayed like that Yeah he would have stayed that way Mm hmm Because he went through like a stage of depression so Yeah Do you think that each one reached humility at the end or no Do you think that Gilgamesh you said was still arrogant even at the end No Oh he wasn t Not after Enkidu died but once he died it stopped of course but I think Gilgamesh was arrogant until he found out that he wasn t going to be immortal Well yeah that too Because then he had to like live his life to the fullest because he couldn t live forever He couldn t do whatever he wanted Who s your favorite character between each story Out of the stories Theseus Yeah I like Theseus too We all like Theseus Yeah It also said that Theseus was grieving Was grieving her loss or his father s loss It was both Debate which character had more impact on their society Can you say that one more time Debate which character had more impact on their society Oh she has the debate word in there Okay let s hear it I d say Gilgamesh I would say he wants to be king Let s let him finish his reason What s your reason You think who I think Gilgamesh Actually I think Theseus would because he changed the kind of structure of government and made it democratic That s it Yeah I would agree with you there in the way that he kind of completely changed the government structure where he lived while kind of Gilgamesh would probably be one of those leaders that is better forgotten than remembered and memory lived on is not probably a theme in that story While Theseus kind of left his ways and his story behind That people remembered on high rather than as like a low point of their society Weren t you going to say something Oh I was I thought you were I think Theseus was had an impact And the reason for that Because he like survived more than Gilgamesh did and he helped people out of the maze with Adrian s help right Yeah Predict what would happen if the King and Enkidu didn t die Well I don t think Athens would be democratic I don t think the king would have done it Yeah he probably would have been poisoned Why is that Gilgamesh I don t know because Gilgamesh probably wouldn t have been searching for immortality Yeah he wouldn t have gone on that Journey Yeah Okay well my question is how would you have handled some of the tough situations that each of the characters had to go through Wait what was the question How would you have handled the situations Wouldn t have done any of them No I get scared really easily and stressed so that would not be good the Labyrinth thing Sorry I didn t hear what you said I wouldn t go to the Labyrinth thing Why is that It kind of sounds like a bad idea I might go and just not defeat the beast and in the first place I probably would have traveled by water and not just said I m too good for that it s too easy Because I Bandits have sharp swords Yeah Okay what s yours Choose your favorite character and explain why From because you like Gilgamesh or Theseus Okay Oh not like our favorite character just in the story Yeah Well either way it doesn t really matter Well because my favorite character from Gilgamesh was Enkidu Is that how you say it Because I think he like really changed Gilgamesh for the better And helped him and humbled him Do you agree with that Yeah I agree with that because I feel like he was kind of like Gilgamesh was so awful and like Enkidu came in and just changed all that Plus I thought that it was kind of cool his journey from like a savage to the civilized guy Yeah I don t think that Enkidu really meant to change Gilgamesh though I think that it was just the circumstances surrounding his death that made that happen Enkidu s mom kind of made that happen too didn t he Did you feel like Enkidu was just kind of created that he I mean we were saying that we like him but did he seem real to you or was he just something created See when I read it the entire time he just kind of seemed like this robot that the gods had created to fix Gilgamesh so he didn t really have that much of a personality to me so that s my opinion I don t know Yeah he seemed like his pretty much sole purpose of existence was to balance out Gilgamesh And he did Yeah he did My favorite character from these stories was Ariadne Oh Well because I didn t feel sorry for her because she helped Theseus and like without her he would have been trapped in the Labyrinth But then to repay her he just ditched her on an island and just left her so that wasn t very nice So I feel sorry for her that s why Okay mine is how would you have dealt with these situations in Can you repeat it one more time How would you have handled these situa I wouldn t run away from the I would not have gone on this journey I probably just would have stayed home not gonna lie Do you feel like that people to be great have to go out in the world and seek these amazing achievements that that s what greatness is Not necessarily I don t think you necessarily have to seek them It all really depends on what your definition of greatness is I feel like to get that like glory and all that I mean I think you can do that if you have enough impact where you are you don t need to go off on a journey What do you think Dinesh I don t know I feel like if we re going by the definitons as you would see them within these stories that obviously you don t have to I don t think you have to seek greatness necessarily I don t think you have to seek it to find it but I think that you do have to go off if you re just going to stay where you are you re not really going to be able to achieve it So if you just sit on your front porch and watch your life go by that s not greatness That can t constitute 
 Okay alright Okay okay So that s his position He s going to stick with it for a minute but then he might have to go around he might change his mind alright Okay This group agreed with Fernando okay That it s because the Earth orbits closer to the sun in the summer than in the winter Who would like to share they re thinking I ll call on you if you don t So what do you think Well I think it s because since the Earth like orbits around the sun like in an oval when it gets here it would be warmer because it s closer to the sun Okay And it s winter when it s away from the sun Okay So can you go and draw that on the board what you mean Because I heard you say that the Earth orbits around the sun in the shape of an oval Raise your hand if you agree with that Okay Okay Okay So that s the Earth and it s orbiting around the sun and he said that the shape of the path that it travels as it orbits is an oval okay Anybody else in this group has something to add to help him defend Fernando Okay I see Can I read what you wrote Sure He said that the orbit is not a perfect circle So that s sort of what he s saying there Is that right Yeah And how would it not being a perfect circle affect the difference in summer winter temperature or heat Well we know that the Earth if it was a perfect circle the seasons wouldn t change Okay It would be the same Alright Okay Depending where the Earth is Alright okay Anybody else have something they want to add in this group Okay Now anybody based on these two groups Anybody want to move from their group to these two groups Not yet Okay that s alright Okay Now let s go to Raul okay This group agrees with Raul and he says it s because the Earth s tilt changes the angle of the sunlight hitting the Earth Defend yourselves So I remember learning that the tilt of the axis is the reason for the seasons But I read the question again it says the Earth still changes and if it doesn t change it stays the same Okay Let s read it again Read it really simple It says it s because the Earth s tilt changes the angle of sunlight hitting Earth Okay So it says the Earth s tilt changes the angle of sunlight Yeah Does it say it changes the tilt of the Earth No Okay So you going to stick with what you said or you want to change Can you show me If I give you something can you show me what you mean Alright Okay So I m going to give you an apple and I want you to pretend it s the Earth okay And I m going to stick this bamboo skewer through it well it didn t go exactly right but just pretend So what does this represent based on what you just said This is the axis of the Earth So this is the axis and what does the axis do Okay So the Earth rotates around the axis which is what Ryan said right Okay And be careful because I just poked myself I want you to be careful Okay So can you stand up and show me what you mean and let s have someone else in your group that agrees with you be the sun and stand kind of in the middle of the room right here okay Alright So she s the sun you re the Earth show us what you mean okay Okay Well the Earth orbits the sun Alright What s the word you were just about to say though Revolves I think that might be okay too What do you guys think Do you think revolve and orbit might be the same Yeah Okay alright It doesn t matter Okay so you re going to have to make the Go around the outside of the desk for your orbit okay Well it orbits the sun in a tilt Okay Which one is tilt I forgot how many degrees Okay Alright okay So keep going It orbits in an angle Alright Hold it the way you think it s supposed to be Okay I think it s this one I m pretty sure Alright So she s tilting it but now and it s tilted Right now it s away from the sun is that right Yeah Okay Now keep coming around Of course does it make a little job to play that No But we re just imagining those who were in this room Okay Now stop there for a minute Is your axis pointing where you want it to Yes Okay alright Keep going You guys need to make space for her to come through on her orbit Okay alright So does that help some of you How many people think that she s right That the Earth tilts as it s going around its orbit It s actually kind of spinning on its axis while it s going around right Is that right Yeah It s spinning the whole time right What does that spinning give us What does that spinning give us Day and night The spinning gives us day and night okay Right Okay Because one side of the Earth is facing the sun it s what Day And the other side is in Night Okay alright Okay alright This group over here You guys agree with Susan Susan okay And Susan said that she thinks it s because the northern hemisphere is closer to the sun in summer than in winter So what do you think So like she said that its axis is tilting but as it moves around the sun the northern and southern hemisphere are closer and farther away Okay But on this side the southern hemisphere is closer Alright And when it comes over here the northern hemisphere is closer in the sun and Alright Anybody else in this big room have something to add Well I agree with her Natalie Because as it is tilted I believe that and so when it goes around the sun shines bright and as it s turning and so as it goes around it will change where the light is hitting it Okay Can someone add to that or give us more detail I m also pretty sure that like the state of Texas it s more closer towards the equator and so it doesn t have all of the seasons Okay So you think that places on the equator right here they don t have four seasons Summer fall winter right I think they do have seasons they re just not as different as like Okay So there s not much that difference in the heat from the sun and the winter versus the summer Yeah I think they re always getting the same amount depending on The same amount of what The same amount of sunlight and heat Because they re getting it directly almost Okay Alright Why do you think that What makes you say that So you think the orbit is elliptical like this group Fernando s group agreed But it s not enough to change the difference in temperature I don t think heat really varies depending on I mean it varies but not in that small of a scale depending on where it is And so just that little teeny movement ellipse or something will not change Okay alright Okay I think we have another group over here How about the Shakira agree ers Do you want to move now Okay Okay Everybody if you want to move to a different table go for it now okay Nobody agreed with Warner huh Okay So Eva s out alright People don t think that it gives off more heat right in the summer than the winter in Warner s group right So we re down to And Shakira s out right Alright Who said to me that they didn t agree with any of them I changed my mind You changed your mind Okay Alright So here s what I want you to do now okay I want to do another little demonstration okay Would you be the sun Okay And would you be the Earth Now here s what I want you to do for me I want you to orbit around the sun I want you to pick a spot Like let s say that yellow bucket okay And as you re going around I want you to keep the axis pointed at that yellow bucket no matter where you are Can you do that Yes Alright Give it a try Alright Alright Now stop for a second right there Okay He s still pointed at that yellow bucket right Keep going Alright stop right there He s still pointed pretty much at the yellow bucket and you re tilted over a little bit right Like she said Because we all kind of agree pretty much These two groups agreed with that What season is it right now In the northern hemisphere What season is it right now in the northern hemisphere Winter Winter Why is it winter in the northern hemisphere Because it s farther away from the sun Okay So it s pointing away from the sun right Do you think it s because the northern hemisphere is farther away No because it s tilted away Tilted away Yeah Okay Alright keep coming around here now Keep pointing at the yellow bucket It s a little bit hard to do huh Okay stop right there What season is it right now Would it be spring Perhaps It would be spring in the northern hemisphere What is it in the southern hemisphere Fall Okay So it s the opposite right Okay keep coming around here Alright keep pointing at the yellow bucket Now what season is it in the northern hemisphere What season is it in the northern hemisphere now This group over here Somebody in this group the table What is it Summer Summer Why is it summer in the northern hemisphere Because it s closer to the sun Closer to the sun And it s like kind of like Are we like a few hundred or thousand miles away from the sun A few hundred or a few thousand Or like a few million Yeah Okay So in the scope of that it s hard to picture do you think that the distance between this spot and this spot is that much compared to the sunlight coming over Yeah To make it that different Okay So you think it s more the tilt Exactly Okay I m not sure in your past science classes what is it about heat energy and light energy pointed on something that makes something warmer or colder Anybody have an idea Depending on how direct it is because what I was thinking is like if this is the sun and can I come up Come show us So if my pencil s the heat and the light it would be coming from here and it would be coming and it would hit with him this one more Right And this one will be direct Okay So I think what he s saying is that both the northern and southern hemisphere are still getting sun aren t they Yes Because we re so far away that the only which side of the Earth is not getting sun right this minute This side When it s rotating it s night time But during the day is it still pretty much light in the northern and southern hemisphere Yeah Yeah So what he s saying is that it s more direct to the hemisphere that s tilted right toward the sun It s still getting sun and somebody over here said something about the equator the places on the equator Those over there Who said that Say that again Like states or I m not sure Any locations right So like for Texas as an example I m not sure if it s exactly on the equator but I know it s really close to the equator Okay Closer than we are Yeah Okay I just read somewhere that it doesn t have all of the seasons Okay Yeah Somebody else said I think as much difference or variation Yeah Okay So this is summer in the northern hemisphere Now we re going to cut across our orbit and save time go back over to that side and what season was that again Winter What season was that again What season is it now in the northern hemisphere Winter okay So which hemisphere is getting more direct sunlight now The southern hemisphere And what season is it now in the southern hemisphere Summer Summer okay Alright Because the heat s having to go around Okay So let s go back for a second Raul s group said it s because the tilt doesn t change but the tilt as you re going around changes the angle of the sunlight that s hitting the Earth okay That s Raul s group You guys still agree with that Yeah Okay And Susan s group said it s because the northern hemisphere is closer to the sun in the summer than it is in the winter Anybody want to move groups now Wait Does that mean more direct or Well Or literally closer Literally closer Okay Anybody want to move groups Okay That s okay You don t have to change alright And this group with Fernando that is because the Earth orbits closer to the sun in the summer than in the winter Alright I m going to show you something and I m going to see if it changes your mind okay Do we get to eat the apples afterwards Well we ll see okay Alright Okay So take a look up here Alright This is a simulation What do I mean by a simulation You can come back and sit down with your group What do I mean by a simulation It s a photo or a video of what actually Right It s not out in the universe looking back at our Earth It s not from the space station or anything like that okay So take a look Alright And look at what s happening with the axis It s a little bit hard to see on the screen Okay Did you notice how like what we tried to do It stayed pointing the same direction right Let s do it one more time Okay alright Okay Now does this look kind of like what he drew on the board at the beginning Does it look like an ellipse Yeah Or an oval Yeah Okay So I wish I had a glass a clear glass We do right over there We have a clear glass That s alright We can use this Okay There is one over there We can use this Okay I want you and you re looking at this kind of from the side Does it look like that When you re looking at the rim of this cup or the rim of this glass from the sort of the side does it look like an oval Yes Yeah Okay Let me make sure you can see that It does doesn t it When you re looking at it from that angle But look at it straight down now What does it look like A circle It looks like a perfect circle Let s let a couple people experience that Look at it from the side now look at it straight down With this one you re almost looking you re looking like right here Okay So the glass it was right there I want you guys to try it too okay Alright It might But what I want you to think about here is this is sort of what you guys probably saw in your fifth grade science books maybe even in your middle school science books We ll have to take a look at the pictures in our books You know publishers the people who print the books they don t always do things the right way for us to work And do you know that there are many hundreds and thousands of adults maybe millions of adults who think that the orbit of the Earth looks like this because this is what they saw in their science books when they were kids growing up But just like the glass what happens I m going to do it again but I m going to flip it over We re looking at it from up above So look what s happening now It s a circle Yeah And did you know that the Earth s orbit it is slightly an oval but so slightly that it s really close to a perfect 
 Dakota didn t want to bring his because it s all broken Well we can still look at it Go get it honey Actually Hannah bring Dakota s petroglyph over please Yeah that s the thing with clay It breaks very easily Okay All right Will you still be able to tell us about it He said that it exploded Please don t break it any more Are you going to be able to talk about it still You can tell us what was on it Okay put it down Addy or it s going to break Okay So you guys you did Your small group was Washoe and you re going to present to the whole group next week or the next week after The whole group The whole classroom Okay Okay So what I need you to do for a little bit is talk between yourselves about what you found And the four things that I want you to make sure somebody knows something about food shelter clothing and location But if you found something else you want to talk about go ahead So anybody chime in Okay I think I know where they re located Can you tell us South Lake Tahoe I know what they ate In your strong voice though They ate onions They ate wild potatoes wild carrots I think a little bit Wild mustard sunflower seeds wild carrots wild potatoes wild strawberries raspberries wild gooseberries wild rosehips wild rhubarb pine nuts and they used Sweet potatoes wild turnips wild spinach seeds Okay Do you think we re good on food Yeah Okay I think Olivia got the part Well we ll talk about that after So we have location Shelter Go ahead Okay Who s going to go next I have they used sticks and leaves to build their homes Okay What do you have your information on I have clothing They used rabbit skins buckskins and plants Okay And I m sorry Coleman What did you say They used sticks and leaves to build their homes Okay So you got those four covered Any fun facts you guys found Dakota what did you find out Give us one fun fact In 1859 the Washoe Wait Let Dakota guys Remember we re trying to be good listeners In 18 Go ahead sweetie In 1859 the Washoe had about 90 people times Aw No no not 90 900 Can I see what you wrote They had 90 000 or Nine hundred Nine hundred and now they only have 300 No let s see The population Well I got it off the computer Yeah I got 1500 In 1855 the Washoe numbered about 900 But are now reduced to about a third of that number What that the same fact you had Dakota Yeah Yeah very good Thank you Dakota I got in 2007 there was 1500 But I got it off the computer too and it said that Well you know the computer is not always I got the latest What kind of data did you get Like demographic Or where did you get yours from I got it from Google Well guys 300 was what yours said Dakota And yours said 1500 Yeah Are you sure yours wasn t 1500 from before And now it s 300 Well it said in 2007 Okay On here on my brain copy Okay We might need to look at that some more you guys We ll look into that before we report on that But that would be a fun fact anyway Joe did you tell us anything Yeah I have another fun fact Okay A fun fact Their houses are called Gadus Gadus okay Okay Now who hasn t had a turn guys All of you got your hands up Let s include our little friend Addy Okay They made baskets Any good baskets Mostly Dot So La Lee Most famous one She was famous for making baskets What was she famous for Olivia She was the She made the most baskets than other Washoe people the other Indians And why was she more famous than all the other Indians I don t know that but I think she was like a really good basket maker You think she was a good Can you scoot over I can yeah Okay Did you guys get to see any of the samples of the baskets Yes Did you know that they re in very Oh you have a picture Awesome These are actually Dot So La Lee s baskets Mm hmm Okay So the thing if you every get to see one of Dot So La Lee s baskets they re woven so tight you could carry water in them And we talked about symmetry today in math They re perfectly symmetrical Yes they re woven so tight that you can put water in them And even Dot So La Lee had like 2000 You what She had made that many baskets She made how many A lot Two thousand Two hundred and something Wow It would be nice to have one of those now huh Yeah But they re like You can t even buy them You cannot buy them huh They re like in a museum They re in museums but I think some people do have a private collection of them Really Maybe one or two yeah They re not like our petroglyphs that we re going to talk about Can you have a petroglyph in your private collection No Those you can t have Okay So you guys let s see who wants to be the writer Do you have a pencil Grab that pencil Would you write your tribal name up here You guys are Washoe And then go around Addy and find out Write the name of the person next to the food the shelter and that s what you re going to kind of be responsible for Let s get Addy And you can go around and ask each person or you can say Who wants to do food W A S H O E I ll do fun facts I ll do shelter I ll do fun facts No I ll do shelter Okay How are we going to decide Joe should do the clothing Joe should do clothing Is that okay with you Do you think I should tell you the name of the Hold on We re not doing these We ll do that later Thank you Olivia Olivia volunteered for food Joe do you really want to do clothing I was either going to do clothing or language because I found a whole thing for Everybody can do a fun fact too But I was going to do a fun facts We need somebody to do food and location Okay I ll do location Shelter Shelter and location I got I ll get shelter Good Thank you Coleman And then I know you guys want to do fun facts too so everybody can do a fun fact L E and then M A N C O L E M A N L E L E M A N Okay Now we just have location left But what s Dakota doing What do you want to do How about me and Dakota will do location together Does that work Okay That s who s going to do the fun fact Everyone can do a fun fact So write Thomas Dakota for location No don t worry about fun facts Everybody has got a fun fact right there So if both of you are doing it it s got to be super duper Okay so we re going to look up if they lived in Washoe They probably did Did you have their names down Addy It s like Washoe people Where are you guys going to find the information Dakota And Dakota D A K O T A Better You guys what did we find out about Google Maybe you want to find two If you have two things and they don t say the same thing you might want to check another one There s a lot of maps on Google There s a lot of maps on Google Yeah We re going to go We re going to go on maps and look where Okay Thanks I m going to take that so when you Okay So next week or the week after you guys are going to do a whole group class presentation on your tribe And you re welcome to bring pictures or artifacts or like pieces of whatever if you want to do that You can bring a basket Obviously it s not going to be a Dot So La Lee Can I bring a arrowhead Did your tribe have arrowheads Yeah Okay Now looking in front of you you guys for our art project we did something What is this called Who knows Olivia I like how you raised your hand The petrograph Louder Petro The petrograph Petroglyphs And what is a petroglyph You re going to break yours Thomas Addy what s a petroglyph It s a carving in a rock A carving in a rock Did your tribe make petroglyphs We don t know Why don t you know Cuz they put things like right down They made it They just moved They just carved it in and nobody really knows unless there s someone from that tribe who made it and passed it down generation to generation Yes Very good What were you going to say You know when we were looking on that website We were looking on that website and one said Washoe Okay Yes So some of them they attri They say that they did it but we don t know who did what petroglyphs But in our state can we narrow it down to one of four tribes probably And maybe if they found petroglyphs where your location was you could say those were Shoshone petroglyphs Would that work We re Washoe Washoe I m sorry All right So who wants to share theirs first So what you re going to do is you re going to share it and show the whole group and tell us what yours meant to you Okay Okay Addy you want to call on somebody Since everybody is dying to talk Who s going first Coleman Coleman can we see yours Okay I want to zoom in on it Hold it up a little bit because I got it up Okay What does yours mean to you It means that it s night and there s some stars and there s a duck And then there s a canoe on the water And there is a lot of meat and camping Camping Okay Anybody else want to go Pass it around Joseph Oh don t pass it around We don t want to break it We re going to stick them on wood or something Oh let me get a picture Oh I m zooming in Up higher Joe because I ve got this on a tripod Okay All right Mine is we re going to drink some water from a river with fish in it and a duck on top And there s a snake trying to eat the duck There s an eagle It s daytime and the skies are clear Oh Addy you re calling on people Thank you Okay Addy sit back a little bit so we can see Miss Olivia random things but I think I know what it is It means they re hunting buffalo at night And then the daytime came and it s all rainbow And we caught some fish That s it Okay Good Who wants to go now Thomas Nice So there s a camp and there s a little hill behind the camp And there s people in war and there s a snake And then one person is not in war He s just trying to shoot a duck But then the other guy shot him and then there s And this has been happening for three days Okay Dakota Mine kind of blew up here Mine kind of blew What happened to yours honey It like kind of didn t turn out so well It like blew up in pieces Can you tell us what it was before it blew up in pieces Well it was like I don t know Did you have like hunting symbols or anything No He just did like squares I drew lines because I I remember I didn t really know what to write You didn t know what to write Okay That s all right But if you could do it again what would you do What would it mean to you I d probably make up a war thing A war thing Okay It s more war except hunt Hunting Oh okay Did you go Miss Addy Okay Humans were hunting for humans That s what s on mine Okay Addy I would wait until everybody was listening Thank you I can t show your Okay Just show the other children It s a sunny day A snake is trying to eat the fish The fish are in the river Cool What s the little zigzag Mountains Oh those are mountains Oh cool Sun Snake River Just fishing Just fishing So what other kind of art things could we have done to show your tribe What would have been your tribe only Baskets We could have maybe tried to weave something What else Basket but That wouldn t be too fun In our project like we could pretend that we were real 
 Also causing habitat loss Anyways Indirectly through our use of C02 emissions It says that It is a naturally occurring greenhouse gas and we want to keep that right We want to keep it naturally occuring we just wanna work on our Levels Yeah Because our impact is not exactly natural It s not like we re trying to stop the unhuman related processes Just like what we re doing to increase it Because like it s been staying at a level until we started releasing a bunch of CO2 and then it went up so it s kind of obvious that we re the cause of that So I don t think it s going to go down then what it was before normally Yeah I think it s highly unlikely that this would ever happen Yeah and 20 to 40 degrees Celsius is a lot too I highly doubt this would happen If we reduce the CO2 emissions in what we re doing this is kind of ridiculous Give some more evidence for that Why Yeah why Explain why do you feel that way Because carbon dioxide is part of the natural carbon cycle yeah But we re contributing to make more of it There s so many economies and stuff that are dependent on it right now that are not going to get rid of it for a long time Therefore there wouldn t be such a drastic change in the amounts of carbon dioxide that there wouldn t be a drop of 20 to 40 degrees Celsius Because we don t plan to tamper with the natural Flow of the carbon cycle We just want to tamper with our which will take a long time anyway So we re going to be up and up and up for a while But we kind of already did tamper with the CO2 the natural ones because yeah we re trying to reduce our own personal emissions now that we re doing it now but we ve already gone in and tampered with it We ve already cut down millions and millions of trees We ve already so can we talk about I m trying to touch into what we ve done in the past and how if we kind of try and back out now then we leave the Earth in a sticky situation Does that make sense Well I do have a question I don t remember does the greenhouse effect exist naturally even as like a little bit right Yeah we just made it bigger So it s like they re claiming that without the greenhouse effect the Earth s average temperature would drop drastically well obviously because the greenhouse effect exists naturally but we re making so much of the greenhouse effect that we re trying to bring it down to normal levels We re not trying to bring it down below normal levels I think they re saying that this is going to happen if it s below the normal level but the problem is that we are already above the normal level so if we bring it down it s not going to make it a complete effect anyway I mean they are right saying that it s going to get significantly below as everyone said it s not going to be to the point where life will not exist But I mean the process by which sun penetrates the earth like some of the heat is retained because of that effect And what we re doing is enabling the Earth to retain more heat than it normally does So by releasing some of it by reducing emissions we are making the Earth much much cooler But we also can t get rid of the greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere So those would stay there and our temperature probably wouldn t drop as much probably still would drop maybe not as extreme And also we live in a world where we use so much carbon dioxide there s no way that we re going to get it to the level of just the natural processes I mean at least not in a ten year period I was wondering how long it thought we were going to slow so called global warming It doesn t really give us a projection I don t think we re going to have another ice age for a long time I mean we re having a mass extinction as it is the way we are right now I think if anything reducing it would help stop the mass extinction I think we ve kind of talked about all we can at this point Alright so at this point if you feel like you have talked a lot in an effort to get you to stop I m going to have you actually I want you to scoot your chair back like a foot or two for the next one to give some other people a chance to talk Yeah I have two you want the good ones with lotion The next one sorry is Concerns over CO2 emissions are unfounded Somebody want to read Okay Concerns over CO2 emissions are unfounded Water vapor is a leading greenhouse gas Today Mythbusters Daily exclusively reveals what climate scientists have been hiding from the public Water vapor is actually a much more prevalent and potent greenhouse than carbon dioxide Water vapor concentrations in the atmosphere between 30 000 to 40 000 ppm while maximum estimates put CO2 around 370 ppm Due to its abundance water vapor s a much more important greenhouse gas so human inputs of CO2 are negligible We should stop focusing on CO2 and refocus research and funding on reducing the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere Would that be parts per million for ppm Yeah parts per million Water vapor unit really really Okay We have a whole water cycle I know we have the whole carbon cycle and everything but we have contributed so much to the carbon cycle I mean and global warming hasn t really been a problem until recently gee I wonder why Maybe because I don t know we are emitting a lot of carbon I mean it s not like we ve been emitting more water you can t create more water Okay Yeah I m done I m sorry I think if you explained what the greenhouse effect actually is it will disprove the water vapor theory Because the way the greenhouse effect works is completely unrelated with water vapor How Well because like isn t the greenhouse gas a gas that lets in sunlight but it prevents the heat from leaving or whatever or something right But water doesn t I don t think water does that I thought it was a greenhouse gas We learned about that in chapter 20 But We did it on the worksheet maybe or the thing that we had for homework last night It s considered a greenhouse gas That s all I know You know what effect it had Sorry No it is a greenhouse gas I remember reading that But You can grab a textbook if you d like Keep talking Elizabeth Water vapor has always been there It has always been at this level Am I wrong Well I mean if our CO2 emissions are increasing and global warming is happening then you would be releasing more water vapor I mean heat would cause that to happen But then technically this is an effect it s not a cause then Is it possible to be both Maybe Like a positive feedback loop What do you know about water vapor It s a greenhouse gas We know that now Isn t it when water evaporates Clouds Nope that is an excellent point Hold on you guys what do clouds do They block sunlight So if the global temperatures rise there would be more water vapor because there would be more fluctuations of creating water vapor Don t look at me look at your people And people who are on the outside are not supposed to be talking Well just like Well she can finish Sorry sorry no go ahead Go ahead finish She said you could finish Oh Okay Well when water vapor think about it when you like boil water it s hot and it creates water vapor So increases in global temperature there would be a possible connection between increased temperature and increased water vapor Hot air rises Which way would it be though Because if increasing temperature causes increase in water vapor does that mean increase in water vapor causes increase in temperature Well you said that water vapor is clouds so wouldn t clouds would block sunlight so wouldn t that decrease temperature But that s kind of like contradictory Can that happen though Like how hot air rises and cold air drops so maybe forgot what that process is called Well it s like sometimes when you re on like islands or something that it s like all cloudy but still really hot and humid so maybe it can increase the temperature I have a question At what altitude do clouds form It depends I mean they can form at ground level That s what s basically fog What s the highest altitude that clouds are going to reach For the most part like on average I have no idea that is an excellent question But like what part of their is it under the stratosphere There s a laptop over there if you guys want to get it No one s ever asked me that That s a really good question I don t know I know that they re throughout the troposphere but I m not sure how high up in the stratosphere they go That s a really good I don t know Can I read something really quick Four natural greenhouse gases in the troposphere are water vapor carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide These gases have been present in varying concentrations in the troposphere during most of the Earth s long history Fluctuations in the troposphere concentration of these gases especially carbon dioxide and methane plus changes in solar output are the major factors causing new changes in the average temperature of the troposphere over the past 400 000 years And then it just talks about how from the beginning of the industrial revolution human actions have led to significant increases in carbon dioxide and therefore it correlates the relation to the increase in temperature of the globe I just read another thing Additional clouds can have a warming effect positively back by absorbing and releasing heat into the troposphere Or a cooling effect a negative effect by reflecting more sunlight back into space So they can have a warming effect So should we be worried about water vapor more than carbon dioxide No Why Because doesn t the CO2 cause the warming which never mind No no keep going That was good keep going That was it Okay Well based on what she just read and based on everything we know about carbon dioxide we know that carbon dioxide can lead to a lot of effects A lot of them bad And one of the major things is that it does lead to more water vapor and if water vapor is such an issue in terms of global temperature increase then you would think their first thought would be decrease carbon dioxide emissions But no Can we directly regulate water vapor No Can we directly regulate CO2 Yeah we can decrease our emissions We can switch to alternative vehicles We can find other sources of energy I mean there are a lot of options with water vapor we just have a water cycle We can t tell the water vapor to stop rising into the clouds like Yeah can you just pause for a moment No we can t do that because it s a natural cycle Are we done with that one So what do we have so far Nida Well that heat would cause the release of more water vapor and clouds can trap and release heat but they can also cool And concluded that clouds are water vapor first of all What we were saying should we worry about water vapor more so than CO2 Probably not because we can regulate CO2 but not water vapor And water s a greenhouse gas I call that using science I have a question for you In nuclear power plants how the steam comes from the cooling tower Is that water vapor emission That is considered a water vapor emission Okay so maybe we could control that aspect of it control the steam One additional thing to just sort of keep in mind and we ll talk about this later is what we call residence time Does anyone know what that is Residence time is how long a chemical stays in wherever it is And so one of the things that we re concerned about when we look at a chemical is its residence time So if we re talking about a water pollutant what s the residence time How long is it going to stay in water Is it going to break down quickly or is it going to be very persistent and is it gonna last for a really long time So when we were looking at greenhouse gases we re also looking at what s the residence time in the atmosphere How long does an average molecule stay in the atmosphere And water vapor tends to cycle in and out of the atmosphere a lot quicker than some of our other greenhouse gases Its cycles are usually on the order of days whereas others are on the order of months to years versus like do you guys know what CFCs are The ozone depleting compounds Chlorofluorocarbons we ll talk more about those as well CFCs are also a greenhouse gas but their residence time in the atmosphere is more like hundreds of years Hundreds of years to thousands of years That would be something we would be more concerned about So like the residence time of something radioactive could be like its half life Yep And then a third factor that we look at is also how potent of a greenhouse gas it is Some gases have more warming potential and some gases have less warming potential So we also want to look at what is its potential for heat trapping versus its concentration And we ll talk a little more about that too Alright we have two left I d actually like for you to pick one I m thinking maybe you should do the freezing temps one because we already kind of talked about the cloudy one but if you want to do the cloudy one you can do the cloudy one You suggest the freezing temperature one That s my suggestion but I won t be upset if you overrule me Let s do freezing temperatures Does anybody want to write 
 She saw sparks in the sky and a beautiful panda bear appeared in front of her Don t be scared I m your Fairy Panda Bear I will turn you into a beautiful princess so you can go to the parade But I don t have anything to wear I will wave my bamboo wand and I will take care of it The Fairy Panda Bear waved her wand and suddenly Daisy was dressed in a lovely gown On her neck was a dragon necklace that glowed Don t forget when the fireworks are over the magic is done Daisy walked up to the celebration and everyone looked at her No one knew who this beautiful princess was The Prince of China saw her from across the parade He went right to her and said Hello beautiful princess I like your outfit Do you want to hold my dragon puppet with me Sure Daisy was having the best time of her life at the parade Suddenly she saw the fireworks show in the night sky and she knew she must leave before the magic wore off Sorry I had a wonderful time but I have to go Daisy turned and ran but she caught her dragon necklace on a stair post and it fell off It stopped glowing as it hit the ground and the prince picked it up But I don t even know your name I feel nervous because something bad might happen The Prince looked all over town for the girl who would make the dragon necklace glow He went to Daisy s animal farm Out in the distance the Prince saw a little shadow by the animal pen Could that be the girl from the parade Can I try the necklace on Daisy tried the necklace on and the prince smiled when the dragon lit up like the sun Tomorrow we should be married right in the morning Alright then we shall And they lived happily ever after Let s give our puppeteers a round of applause Bravo Bravo That was awesome you guys Class Yes You re going to earn yourself another smiley Class class class Yes yes yes Boys and girls if you are on the list of children that are going to go out to work on an art project could you quietly stand up and walk to the door If you are staying in with me for our work will you sit hip to hip with the person that I ll get it No Ms Turner wants to do it Please sit hip to hip with your partner Good job Zoe that was awesome That was so cool Okay just a second then Alright turn your bodies this way Okay Criss cross applesauce Okay Who s your partner Zoe Can you sit hip to hip with her DeShaun face this way Alright if your legs are criss crossed then look up here Wow Theodore why don t you pop up and go close the door for me Alright this morning when we were talking about the books about China Xander wrote down a lot of the things we were talking about that were different between us and the people that live in China So as a class we figured out that they have a different flag they eat with chopsticks which is really neat We do too Sometimes we do right They have a different alphabet they have water buffalos there they have the Great Wall of China and they speak a different language And they also have dragon puppets which you just saw on the Puppet show What we re gonna to do now is we re gonna talk about things that are the same between our culture and the Chinese culture and we re gonna use our listening stones So Toban I m gonna be coming around and I m gonna give a listening stone to one of the people in the group and if you re holding the listening stone you re gonna say one thing that s the same and then you re gonna pass it to your partner and they re going to say one thing that s the same And then they re gonna pass it back and we re gonna go back and forth and see if we can start to talk about what s the same We know a lot of things that are different I m curious of what s the same Could you please sit knee to knee with your partner Can we show them knee to knee Zoe Like this Facing your partner like we do There you go I ll give you a Band Aid in a minute Finn okay Can you sit knee to knee with Graham Like this I have another thing that is dis Another thing that s different Uh huh What They have more dramatic designs on their clothes They have more dramatic designs on their clothes We saw that in our research material As soon as you get the listening stone I want you to say something that s the same and RJ you might want to start saying like we both might be a way to help okay RJ you have the listening stone Okay So look at Zoe listen with your eyes and your body and say we both and see how many things you can think of Can I be the stone keeper You may yes We are the same as them because we all We all have eyes We all have eyes yep We all have clothing We all have hands We both can see We are the same as them How are we the same as them We wear clothes We all have to wear clothes right We all have beds We all have beds Can we do something different You may say something different yeah We both have to sit down We both have a mouth We all have hair yep No some people can be bald That s true some people can be bald What else between us and the Chinese culture is the same We all have shoes We can all walk and we can all do things We all have bodies Did you guys see anything from the puppet show that made you think of something that s the same between us What We all can make things We can all create things and be really creative Did you see something from the puppet show that made you think we were the same We all have clothes Did you see the clothes on the puppet show We all have dragon puppets There are a lot of dragon puppets at Chinese New Year Oh we all have puppets We all use puppets That s what I was just going to say Okay we all use puppets We all have an alphabet We all have an alphabet even though it looks different Alright I m going to see if we can earn another point Class Yes That was so good Boys and girls hey can everyone turn their bodies this way Alright let s share out now we had the chance to pass the stone back and forth I just wanted to quickly hear one thing per group of something that you thought of that was the same Zoe and RJ can you tell me one thing that you talked about in your group We both have imaginations We both have imaginations And RJ said we both have brains We re all pretty smart aren t we Finn and Graham can you tell me something that was the same We both see We both see We both have rotten teeth What do you mean by that We sometimes all have rotten teeth We have to go to the dentist sometimes Yeah okay Xander and Nazarette what did you guys find in your group What You tell me what s the same We both We both can make things like necklaces and fireworks and actually Chinese people were the first people to invent gunpowder and that s what makes fireworks Did you hear that boys and girls Finn did you hear what Xander said He said that the Chinese were the first to invent fireworks Because they were the first to invent gunpowder and gunpowder is what powers the fireworks a lot That s cool Wait wait wait it s Anna and Toban s turn Anna and Toban tell me something that s the same We both have families We both have families Did you think of one Toban We all have dragons We all have dragons What does that say I ll tell you in just a minute okay And DeShaun and Gabrielle you re the last ones What s something from your group We talked about We both We both What s something that s the same We all have rainbows We all have rainbows Yeah they see rainbows in China and we see rainbows here And DeShaun what about you What s something that s the same between us and the people in China We re gonna have the same melanin as somebody We have the same melanin Yeah What do you mean by we have the same melanin as somebody Here sit up so I can hear you I think he means we have the same melanin in our skin We have the same melanin in our skin Cuz we both have light skin Yeah but what if the people in Africa have I m not talking about them The people in Africa have dark skin they have more melanin Yeah but the people in Asheville Oh in Asheville In our city we have lots of different colors of skin and different kinds of melanin but in China did it look like their skin was pretty similar Yeah yeah Alright so this is what we re gonna do Does everyone see these circles over here Yeah You re gonna come up and you re gonna pick one off our chart and you re gonna go draw a picture of something that s the same between us and the people in China and then you re gonna come and you re gonna stick it back up And this is actually a word bubble chart Okay So when I see you re sitting nicely I m gonna call you up and you come pick your color and I have brand new markers at the table Alright Zoe and Finn come pick your color Xander and Nancy come pick your circle You re gonna draw a picture of something that s the same between us and the Chinese culture You can write words too Okay the rest of you It says We will go on hug patrol today We re gonna see if we can earn it You re gonna do orange I wanna do pink Can I do green You have to do orange or Alright So what s the same boys and girls Thank you I love brand new markers We have to do something on the same Something that s the same Anna what are you gonna do We all have families We all have families Can I sit by Anna I m doing green Can you sit by Anna yes Anna Toban s gonna sit next to you Sometimes you can say we both Or we all Xander that was cool How do you spell melanin You just sound it out We all have brains we re all pretty smart Can you write that in words on there You guys are such good writers RJ what are you writing what are you writing RJ Can you read it to me What do you mean by it we all have rooms We all have our rooms We all have art rooms Bedrooms Oh bedrooms we all have bedrooms We re gonna make a word bubble Can you read it to me We all We all have a heart We all have a heart 
 We all know it s splash Just put it next to it Your turn Okay let s see How are we doing How many animals do we have Do you have a few We think mussel It can be in the middle It can be in the high tide and the low tide Because it can move around And then it eats clams and clams would be in the high tide It can grab on to the wave It eats clams It says this eats clams I saw the of the mussels sort of in the mid high tide one day When you were out at the tides before Yeah Excellent so you re using some of your previous experience to help you Good excellent Okay I ll be right back It s a snail The shell protects its soft part As a hermit crab grows it moves into a new shell It may take an empty shell or steal one from another So it s like war I think that would be in the high Yeah that s a high Yeah I think the high tide I thought it would be in the mid or low But no Well it could move down there What s your next one Tuesday put this circle right on top of the clock Same time Same height Wow that s pretty interesting isn t it Good for you Oh you re looking at your first one What s your first one Yeah just line it right there on the clock That s eight Yep like eight Yeah excellent And Margo you re getting your first measurement Negative one Oh awesome Monday s negative one Hello Kazhu I will show you where you need to go It s negative something I don t know what negative It s right here Look here Did you find out they went that low Yeah Mine went to negative six Wow I didn t put Tuesday and then I m going to put a block under it You had one that went really low Look at that Awesome You set that up first pretty well didn t you Look s like we got Monday and Tuesdays getting done Wednesdays are being worked on Perfect So much to hear what it is you guys are gonna discover from the charts Let s do a worm Whatever that says They have a veil of flaps on each side The worms usually stay buried in the sand If a wave comes it swims back down toward the sand and wiggles into it I m pretty sure that s low Yeah No how about maybe high High tide High tide No but the waves crash there a lot actually Splash There s more of the sand Yeah I think it would be splash Want to try splash on that one Good And you guys thought that because what did it say It said it buries in the sand and if a wave crashes it has to wriggle back down Okay So it stays in sand as much as it can How many does Nate have Oh two The whelk That s a scientific name That s a tough one isn t it Ah it s hard It s hard it s okay you can skip it Just say look for the whelk on rocky beaches On rocky beaches and on rocks sift or muddy gravel beaches The shell of the snail can reach about two inches in height It is a scavenger feeding on kin It also preys on injured animals such as limpets The snail has also So I thought the sentence said it also preys on injured animals such as limpets So preys on them what does that mean I think I know What do you think Andrew It means catch them and eat them It catches them and eats them Where do you think that would need to be if it s gonna eat limpets I think it would be in the high tide Oh you ve got both of them So you also might want to talk to Addy and find out what Addy has And try to figure out where those guys are before you place your whelk No so Addy what do you think What is one of yours Let s find out what yours are right Under each shell I think it s already in the high tide zone I thought it would be in the splash Wait no High high high Yeah high tide Okay the limpet Guys I thought it would be in the splash No remember you gotta like figure Okay I ll let you two go I thought it would be splash because No I don t think that The thing should be underwater most of the time It says Watch for whelks on rocky beaches and muddy or gravel beaches It could be in the middle True Yeah mid Okay mid No you have to say where the other food is I put it to high splash Okay you go then you go Guys look too much heart One that was lower than negative four And this is negative four What do we have Margo did you finish your graph Excellent How are you doing on yours Joshua You finished I m on Friday You re on Friday So maybe you two should start setting up your circle Pick your question Margo Joshua And this is your question And set up your circle right on there Grab your graph and a chair And sit in your circle off to the side there I think it s either low or splash No not splash Not splash Otherwise there wouldn t be anything Lower mid I d think low No No remember at the aquarium they were underwater completely No things sticking out Only some of the spine Yeah but the rest it was just boom there I am doing it I m doing the sand dollar for my report And it s high No remember at the aquarium also it was at the bottom of the tank Remember No it was at mid I remember I checked And also anyways I m doing the sand dollar Okay Okay so Margo do you have your question with you So everybody gets a chance to converse and talk about the answers to that question Or maybe you might realize something or come to a realization about your information And all of you can contribute to the answer Okay So go ahead Were there any patterns you noticed doing your graph What are they I noticed that first it went to medium then it went lower and then it went higher and higher the third fourth and fifth time My pattern was that each time each level started getting higher and higher and higher and so it s really high Mine would go to 12 to 12 then it would go to 11 and then it went down to 10 and then it went down to nine It went lower and lower And it was kinda like a mix Monday and Tuesday were the same and then it started going higher and higher and higher all the way What was unexpected I ll go first It went lower than the average on the chart It went lower and then it started going higher and higher I thought it was just gonna stay in the negative parts but it actually went up to the nine In mine I expected it to be some different levels but it kept going higher and higher and higher and then when it started to go even higher it just kind of stayed the same Mine went higher and higher and higher and higher again Okay who s next I am Unless you want to go Read your question What was your highest tide What was your lowest one My highest was Tuesday and Friday They were both negative one And Friday and Thursday they were both negatives Everything was negative Everything was negative on yours Wow Negative Even one below the negatives You have five negative Negative five Yeah that s right because you re grabbing you don t realize you ll get a negative five That tide s really low Very low tide level yeah Margo has her hand up go ahead Margo On the day that was highest was Friday It went all the way up to nine And my lowest was Monday and Tuesday because they re both negative one Oh and my lowest was Thursday Thursday and it was 9 Thursday and it was nine Yeah And Maia what was your lowest tide My lowest was Monday It was about at eight and then it starts going higher and my highest was at 12 So I m wondering now if we look at all of our charts all of our graphs who had the highest tide of everybody Who had the highest So you had a 12 I had two twelves No she had 11 So it looks like maybe Callen and Maia have close to each having a 12 I have the lowest score I have the lowest I think Joshua got the lowest with a negative five reading on his Anybody else have a negative five No I have a negative one But no negative fives Okay alright So whose question s next Alright I ll be right back 
 Yes I think if it s really really quiet and you want to talk about something then go ahead But if a lot of people obviously want to talk probably a good idea to raise our hands Okay what else Be involved Be involved yes I will be keeping track of who contributes to the discussion Because everybody has an opinion but I need you to express that opinion What else Don t criticize other peoples ideas Don t criticize other peoples ideas Okay What might you do instead Suggest something give your outlook give your opinion Okay Give your argument But don t insult the other person s ideas This is a safe place to share ideas okay Now we re going to have three jobs I m going to need a task master a reader and a time keeper Time keeper You want to be the time keeper Alright you need to let us know when we ve got about two minutes left of the class I want to be the task master Okay so what does the task master do They make sure that everybody s on task Yeah what else What might that look like Subjects get off or out of control So people get off subject we could a little bit of crowd control What about if everybody wants to talk and they start raising their hands You get to pick on one Yeah task master gets to call and make sure every body gets their chance to talk Okay Yes Is there a praiser Actually that s a good idea Let s have a praiser I want to be him You want to be the praiser Alright Michael is the praiser What s the praiser do Oh can I do that Dang it always You can team up with me Can we This class yeah you guys want to be a team Okay So what is a praiser What are you guys going to do Give compliments Okay give compliments Compliment their ideas their expressions okay And then I need a reader Preferably somebody on that side of the room I don t know how to read I m unavailable You ll read No Who would like to read About five seconds before I call on someone I ll do it Okay so the questions are all up here there s five of them You re going to read them so the whole group can hear Okay Okay Alright so task master Oh I m here Okay you re on task now and we re going to start by having the reader read us the first question Okay should people own ideas I don t really think so I think it should be shared like for public opinion Like public knowledge like how they were putting the genome stuff out on the internet Great thought Thanks You re doing good Well I think that the information should be shared but the people who found it or came up with the idea should get credit for it I think that if you come up with an idea shouldn t you have some like you have conferences everybody gets together and talks about stuff So why don t you have scientists and stuff that like created this idea come together and have a conference and talk about it so then ideas are spread out through all those companies and stuff And then the people that made that contributed to it have like a patent I guess you would say or just like copy or not copyright it Like discovered by or Yeah like that Good opinion So coming together would be easier then Sometimes I feel like if If no one gets credited or gets yeah They won t want to like They won t want to Put the information out there Yeah put the information out there Like they won t have something to you know Work for Work for There you go Yeah because I think that everybody like wants a part of getting like Because you want that credit because you put all that effort into it So why not get a little bit of credit That makes it worth it How do you like that one Okay second question Should people own genes No Yes Well you kind of already own your own genes I mean you kind of they re your own Like any unless you clone yourself I mean nobody else has the exact same stuff You could Let me give you an example of an idea of somebody owning a gene The breast cancer gene that was discussed in the video which is actually a lack thereof of a particular part of a gene that is patented by a particular company Which means they found it they spent money to find it so they own the patent on it If you are a person you don t have to be female just to look for this but if you are a person who would like to go look for that gene you have to pay a patent fee to that company because they found it That s what it means to own a gene I think owning a gene is just having a company that has a lot of money that can be like Oh I m going to put a patent on that so boo ya can t take it Yeah I don t think that s right I mean if someone they should like put it open to the public because I mean if it s a gene like say breast cancer they should t just keep that private and make they pay for it Yeah So it s sort of like owning a part of a human If you own a gene by a corporation it s like owning a part of the person who has that gene or doesn t have that gene So It s sort of a moral issue Would you want to be owned by a company just that little tiny part of your DNA I wouldn t Excellent point You would Good job Jenna I wouldn t Oh okay You practically just went against everything we just said Anybody else have any input I agree with Jen Okay third question Would you want to know if you carried a gene for cancer Yeah No I would not Well it depends on what age I m at Because like then you have that whole impending like doom your whole entire life like Oh I m eventually going to get cancer might as well just die That s why I die But if you do know then you have the chance to actually deal with it You re going to have to deal with it anyway Yeah but if you knew you would have all that time to realize and to put things in order in your life You would know you would live life to the fullest I would I would live life to the fullest if I knew that I actually had this cancer I would know and I would do the best I could to live my life without settling Yeah so the shadow of you that eventually And that would just push me forward considering Drive yourself Whatever I do Yeah And maybe just maybe if I knew I would work to try to cure it myself So then I would be helping other people as well I would want to know Remember that there are no right or wrong answers to these questions Please feel free to share I think my what s it called my opinion I d want to know so that if you didn t know and you have kids you could be passing it on to them and wouldn t that hurt you to see that to have your kids have cancer Like I would think that And then if like I did I would want to know I would like Jen said live life to my fullest and Because some things like if I was per se white I would go tanning wouldn t that hurt your cancer Because like radiat Well that s what causes it you know what I mean I d just do things differently if I had it Remember what they said in the video it s often a maybe It s not a you will have this it s a maybe There are things that they can check for that they can say definitely you will or will not get like Huntington s Disease which is a very devastating disease Remember how they talked about Tay Sachs which kills very early Huntington s is somewhat similar but it kills later in life And starts to show signs mid 30 s and usually death is somewhere in the 40 s or 50 s so that s significantly earlier since life expectancy is in the 70 s in this country So Would you want to know yes or no if you had something like Huntington s which is definitely a yes or no but what about in a situation that s a maybe I don t want to know if it s a maybe because then you live with that fear that you might get it or you might not I would still want to know Yeah because what if your body starts shutting down like one night and you just start twitching in your sleep Wouldn t you want to know that s from cancer rather than your brain s messed up and drugs or something I don t know Yeah I think I d want to know I mean like instead of just not knowing what s causing all this stuff happening in your body Some think it s because I m a very curious person I d want to know what s going on I would want to know Because like Jenna said like one night you re just having a seizure or something you could take like medicine like that they prescribe to you because they know what you have rather than just like trying to deal with it and like that you could die because you never even knew what was happening So I d like want to have that back up plan with me So just to clarify we re talking about an offense end rather than a defense team So rather than waiting until you have it and reacting taking preventative measures ahead of time Like an inhaler for asthma Some people have to take their inhaler every single day twice a day morning and the afternoon but there s other people who don t have it as severe or a higher risk not as high as a risk who only take it when they re having an asthma attack So what you re saying is having like the pill every day constantly I would still want to take that chance So you would you want to take the pill Yeah If you know you have cancer early enough can t you get rid of it Can t they get rid of it If it s like Yes the earlier you know the better chance you have Yeah that s why I would want to know I don t think it would matter that much because even if you do have cancer that doesn t mean you re going to die from it Like you could get hit by a car today and nobody could tell you that nobody could predict that So I don t think I wouldn t want to know like if I was going to if I have cancer or anything I don t know I don t think it s You don t know that that cancer s going to Yeah and then I m just going to be in fear all my life like thinking like Oh I m going to die from that When that s not necessarily Like the you know exact thing that you re going to die from Like it s not a guarantee so Very good Yeah it s because of that Great job It s because of that maybe that maybe like you might be like how that guy on the video said you have a 99 of getting a heart disorder you might be that one percent that doesn t get it And you spend your whole life preparing spending all this money on preventative measures and getting all these pills setting up stuff and then you go through your whole entire life and you don t even get it That s true That he does have a point But then wouldn t you want to take those precautions because You d be happy that you did but then you spent all that extra stuff But what if that extra stuff is what made you not get it No I mean you don t like you don t get all the stuff just in case and you don t take it s like you don t even take the medicine It s only for like when you have like Travis said if you have a seizure you can take that it stops it Well that s kind of just like getting hit by a car Exactly Preventative measures is like looking to see if there s cars and if you don t look I mean you could get run over you could not But then you also like what if you lived in fear of getting that taking all these precautions is kind of wasting your life trying to prepare for something that may or may not happen That s why people should at the right age when you have the right maturity decide whether you want to know or not and not have it mapped out when you re born whether you re going to die or not Or by what In the movie how they just like took that thing Right That would be freaky as a woman Like you just went all throughout nine months of that and now you get to find out that your child s going to die in it s kind of freaky That actually brings us to our next question Okay What genes would you want to know your children had Why and how would that change you as a parent I wouldn t want to know at all I mean that s part of giving like human birth the surprise I guess It s a gamble You can t always like create the perfect human being Well if you could find out what genes they were going to have could you fix them Like how that person got rid of the forehead thing Right now no But that is a direction we re heading in You can right now completely sequence your child s genome if you have the money and get an approximation of what they will look like and what effects that That s messed up I don t care what my child would look like I don t really care But I just don t like you could prevent it from having these like life threatening diseases like cancer or Huntington s or like Parkinson s Disease Alzheimer s But then again that s a way of like too like I would want to know life threatening diseases but not because like you can cure like seizures You can like can t you Like my friend s been cured of that She had them and then now she doesn t anymore because she took medicine and stuff now she doesn t have it But there s people that have been taking those medicines and then still have it now which doesn t make sense Is that cured or treated Treated Yeah Cured means that you no longer have the disease Treated means that it s managed with medication or It s treated then Wait it s cured Yeah it is cured But anyways How would that change you as a parent knowing that You would know what to do if you have it Stay with your child at all times I don t want my kid dying Your kid s going to be in like a stroller until age 13 See it wouldn t change me as a parent It just wouldn t change me I think it d make someone stronger Because going through all of that hard times like with your child and it being sick and stuff wouldn t that make you stronger than having a normal healthy child And make you closer to them But you would still love your child the same way You would still try to have the best memories with your child either way If you knew that this that your child was going to die or not You would still do the same thing Except maybe change their diet or Take more precautions Yeah more precautions Pad their room They re going to be falling over and hurting themselves or something But you wouldn t change your experiences with your child I would Well I wouldn t Would you Bernard What Change your experience with your child Yeah Just don t go to Disneyland it s not worth it It s not worth it he won t even remember it Nope Oh the fifth question What does any of this have to do with you Like as in personally or as in That s a good question I m confused Say that again As in personally Yeah both ways as in persoanlly and as in a generation Give yourself super powers Hey stay on task Good job Stella Thanks I guess you re just kind of getting us ready for the future you know Like thinking like about your children like in the future like what if like what if you really wanted to know and then like what would you actually do about it if you ve never thought about this before Is this technology possible Yeah Not quite yet So who s going to have to make those decisions Us Our generation This generation and next generation The genes are us And if you want to know everything about yourself if you want to know then you have to go through the genes But if you don t want to know then you don t have to Yeah And so those people that think it s like That want to know should Wait what Never mind Should be able to Yeah should be able to And then the people that don t want to know shouldn t harp on them they should just keep their opinions to themselves And see it from their eyes too and just have an open eye to it not being so negative So what happens if say half of society would like to have their genomes sequenced or their children s genome sequenced and the other half does not want to or doesn t have the means to because it s probably going to cost money Right What might that how might that impact society as a whole Not just the individual As in this country individual s rights are paramount right Hmm So it ll be messed up like it is already How 
 Okay So what s going on with this group You go ahead since you did it We made like a T chart Oh fantastic Graphic organizing Love it We put the ones that we re going to delete over here and then keep over here Now we re discussing why we deleted these or chose them Was it pretty easy to choose the keepers It was Yeah we agreed on most of them What about the delete Have there been some discussions We had to think about the smart and the healthy and religious Yeah Okay Good Oh and stay in school They don t have to stay in school So there were some that you had to discuss a little more Yeah Tell me some of your thoughts Which was the most difficult Probably the religious And also smart Tell me a little bit about the discussion you had with religion Well first of all we thought that it wouldn t be but then we thought some people had different religions and other people My dad has a friend my dad has a friend that isn t a Christian but he s still a really good person It s just like as you grow up being a Christian that s just what you think But then as you think about it that s not how you re a good person Okay So you stepped back from what you knew and you looked around Were you able to come up with some examples like was it your uncle No it was just a friend A friend So were you able to come up with some examples of people that were not religious people Yeah Can you tell me some qualities on the list that they have even though they are not the Christian My uncle he s not religious but he s a teacher So he s helping kids and stuff and he s really nice My neighbor she s really nice You can t even tell that she s not religious You always think she is She s kind and friendly She s respectful I don t know just really nice Okay So when we first put up our list that was one of the qualities that were on lots of list boom boom boom then just religious So we had to step back from it to really stop and think about that Or they could be not doing their best in school but they could be a really great friend or person Very good There s more than one kind of smart Yeah Do you think that having good qualities and keeping yourself with those qualities is another kind of smart Yes And you re right I know some mentally challenged friends people that are some of the most kind hearted people Good discussion Good going Okay Why did you do happy Because whenever you re sad then you just have that gloomy feeling hanging over you all the time Yeah And also if you re not happy all the time you don t have it all the time every minute you can t just be depressed all the time And then Stay in school Yeah Why did we go into stay in school Thank you Lexi Come on over here Veronica Okay ladies what is your question We re going two ways I kind of think that you need to be religious Because if you go to church it helps you become a good person But then at the same time there s like people in the world that are really great people but they re un relgious They can t be religious Like countries And they re still a good person even though they can t Also we were thinking people that do go to church aren t always taking what they learn and using it in their lives So you have found some examples of religious that are not exhibiting other qualities and then people who are not religious who show a lot of these qualities Yeah Okay So that kind of goes both ways I think we should delete I don t know I can go both ways So you can see both sides Yeah You don t have to be religious to be a good person Okay So can you set aside what your own religious beliefs are that if you believe this way if you don t believe this way something bad will happen to you Can you set that aside and just look at the person s qualities My sister has a friend that goes to college with her and she doesn t hang out with her that much but she doesn t believe in God And that s her religion But I guess that would be their religion So really everybody has a religion kind of but they can t express their religion or go to church and stuff like that Okay So which one s our leader Jordan you re our leader So do you want to take another vote and see where it stands Okay You re changing in a way Okay So where do you stand now Those are all qualities that make up a good person but again we all had to make a decision on it But again other groups can have different opinions about that or different opinions on how to make a good person So we can think that you need to be religious but then another group can say you don t have to be religious Right It s all about what this group decides I was also thinking about the Ten Commandments that it has a choice If you want to be religious that s also putting that in mind Okay So are you leaning towards deleting or keeping We re just talking How about you Grace I kind of think it s I don t know I think we should keep and then I think that we maybe should delete because you don t have to go to church to be a good person Does anybody have a personal experience in their own family of somebody who s not religious that is a really great person Well like they don t go to church or they re just not like Okay That is a great statement that Jordan made that will give us pause to think What does religious mean to each one of you So maybe that s another place to start What does that word mean And then that might help you decide whether to delete it or keep it Because going to church doesn t necessarily make you religious You can just walk into the church and listen to your pastor s sermon It doesn t mean that you re a good person So discuss that for just a moment Okay What does religious mean to you I think it means being saved and saying sorry for our sins and asking for forgiveness So that s like the main writing In my opinion of being religious I think that you take what you learn in a church s sermon and you use it in your world You know what I mean Yes If it s a very touching sermon and it s what you believe you can take it back and you can use it to help you go through problems or whatever and then I think also religious is that you re willing to share with other people Yeah You re not embarrassed You re not just holding back and keeping it to yourself No matter if people aren t religious and they ll come up to you and make fun of you here at school You re just willing to put it aside I used to go to a different school I don t remember now But he was a very very very good student And for some reason they did want to I don t know why I didn t figure it out The pastor got fired because it was just a job to him He did something very very inappropriate that a pastor could do with another person within church And he left because he was so embarrassed Why would he have been embarrassed I would have felt bad not just embarrassed And he was married You know what I said about you have to be willing to share Well there was this one pastor Let me turn the camera on you Hold on So there would kind of be a way of saying that it doesn t really work out So if both sides are Okay All right Regan let s hear again what you said about the deleting why would you thought you would delete it Oh I m not the one who said delete Oh okay I said delete it because I know people that are not atheist who are not Yes ma am I will tell her Thank you Scarlet Vicki is not here today Thank you ladies for getting quiet when the intercom rang Now discuss continue They re still Christian but they re still just as good as any other person would be That s why I think we should delete it But I don t know Okay Maybe it s the way she put it because she said it changes you inside but being Christian it does kind of change you inside Okay So you have a person in your life that you consider to have some qualities that make them a really great person but they are not religious Yeah They re not atheist but they re not Christian Okay Do you have anybody in your life that s not religious that you find a lot of good qualities My grandpa He s not saved but he still believes I guess it just depends on how the person acts Okay How about you Do you have anybody in your life Yeah named Delaney she s an older person But she really really likes her house and stuff And would you consider her to have qualities that make a really great person Yes But you would not consider her religious Oh no But she is not really atheist but she doesn t believe in anything But she doesn t believe in being atheist So we re kind of on the fence on this one in that some people think it needs to be deleted and others think no it makes a difference Do you know anybody who says that they are religious and they don t have qualities of a great person Yes Some people as soon as they get out of church they ll go out and do stuff that wouldn t be religious Yeah It s kind of like they don t have a Christian background They ll sit in the church room and they say I m a Christian because I m here at church but really you go do this at other places So then I guess it all boils down to what do you believe or what do you think that religious means A lot of people would say Oh I m religious but then like you said spend the rest of the week doing things Yes But they re kind of being truthful if they say they re not religious and they re not really religious So it s kind of two things so truthful but they re not religious Or maybe being a fake Christian like sitting in church They ll watch a football game just waiting for church to end But maybe that s kind of worse than saying I m not a Christian but also be a good person Okay So you re the leader in this group Why don t you poll each other again and see if they want to now delete other people Okay So go ahead and ask Okay So I put I m not sure yet We re still not sure That s fine That s fine If we re not sure yet we don t have to put it in one side or the other yet if we re not done discussing it This may be one that the group can t agree on I think it s a good thing to have but you don t have to have it to be a good person Yeah I think we can just delete it It is good to have but people can be really good people and not be religious Everybody agree with that If you re still thinking No I don t want to say that this is the safe place to say that Nobody s going to kick you Because even religious people can also be 
 More important cause their friend Maser something died the day before and they stayed in the village for that long They didn t have to stay but they decided to stay They didn t have to do that but they just chose to do that because they felt it was more important Well and it may have been a choice for safety also if they stay with him If they run to another village they may be you know picked off Trying to stick to the customs that they are so used to like back in normal life and stuff like that So trying to get back in that But the fact that they did wait kept them from their real life like their parents and stuff But saved their lives Yeah Okay Emily and Simon Simon Emily Emily and Spencer I mean Simon That s her last name Do you believe the boys were right for getting mad at whatever his name is after they got to the village and blaming him for missing I think anyone would get mad They need to get it out on someone What do you mean by being right to get mad Do they have like A valid purpose A valid reason for getting mad I mean yeah They were probably just mad out of frustration If you would have went in with them before like earlier before the rebels attacked they wouldn t have been able to see their families So that s what their drive has been for the past couple months or however long they ve been running It s to get back to their families Even if they would have died I mean That s what he was saying is that he was mad at him at Dishmrael for holding him back because he could have seen his family He would have died But then later on when his mind cooled down he was like yeah well he saved my life cause I would have been killed It was probably like an in the moment thing I think in that kind of situation you always look for someone to blame Cause there is no way he could have known soldiers were gonna attack them so we should hurry and go see them He thought they had time to go and see their family Like let s stop and rest and stuff like that There s no way he could have known that was gonna happen so they can t really blame him but they need to blame someone Yeah I d want to punch someone too I d be so mad if that happened to me I understand why they would blame him but looking back on it And how does his age impact that also Well he s not He not really old enough to really think about it All he s thinking about is his family With maturity you think before you act but as a little kid you just act and don t know the consequences Well and he has no life experience to prepare him for this at all There s another aspect And he used to follow Junior and everything he did but now that Junior s gone he doesn t even have that Right Exactly Okay keep going War is hell Oh yeah you can Sorry about that It s okay So want to go Kaylee Okay Ask the question The question Girda is a young woman at the time of the book and so was Valentino and Wutuzuwut How do they change through the course of the book due to the tragic events in their lives I think they re forced to grow up real fast because of all the pressures At the time I mean Valentino doesn t know his age but let s say like 15 and 20 and when I haven t read the end of this book but she comes home to America and so does Valentino and they just come over and even though they re like like a 40 year old So it s kinda weird coming back to America and trying to enjoy all the child pleasures Yeah the whole event just kinda makes them you know kinda step it up a bit If something like this happens to you you don t easily forget it It becomes more of a part of you It kinda takes out who you really are inside Yeah it shapes you Yeah Well and how did the stages in their life coincide That s a good question Kaylee Well first of all genocide I thought was basically kind of done the same so it was usually like they lost their families they re forced to go out on their own they re forced to make a life for themselves And both of them kind of think or know that their parents are dead And so they kind of use their families in a way to keep them going and just like other people in their lives that have motivated them cause I think Ile or I don t know how to say her name She kind of motivated Girda to kind of stay in the camp with her and have maybe a friend there where with Abek s family she wouldn t really have a friend she d just have like she d owe it to their family to do things for them And then with Achek he had William K to help him Just had a friend to make it through Yeah So they both had a strong friend What kind of life did they both live before disaster struck They both had the perfect ideal family life you know They were happy They were all together It was you know like what would happen in a Disney movie pretty much Everything s kinda perfect And then something happens in the first Both in the person that happens to meet their family ties are cut And their survival depends on whether they can kinda ban together with the people around them and kinda grow and become stronger Yeah I think Yeah No you go Okay They were just I mean they were forced to grow up And they just lived like Ryan said like the ideal life with their family or whatever But once their parents left they had to find a friend or someone to group with in order to Well what were they replacing What were they replacing with William K and Ile Yeah They established a family without being blood related They just had to make it through by that It s cause if you don t have motivation then you re not going to get through things so even though they didn t know that their I mean they assumed their parents were dead but they didn t know for sure Cause on page 80 of this I mean she said that she never saw her father again But just to know that their parents are alive and they just want to regroup with them at the end keeps them motivated and alive Not knowing They both have that in common Right Assuming that they re dead but not really knowing for sure Just to keep them motivated to survive so it s a good tactic So what is a really simple message that we can take from that from both of their stories What do you need in your life Motivation You need family You need some kind of family unit to Survive Or friends Everyone needs like someone to kinda like go to and they can depend on no matter what the situation is Right and if you re going to friends a lot of time at least in like a high school or whatever you go to friends with questions instead of your family or whatever sometimes you ll get the wrong side of view on things and it will change your life drastically Cause your friends determine how your high school is gonna be determines how the rest of your life But also you got a different perspective cause your family doesn t necessarily know what s going on in your own high school Yeah so it s good to get both but family is more important cause you can count on them more usually And they re older and wiser You need that kind of like wise person cause my mom knows more than I do or my friends Yeah But you need those relationships as connections right Right to keep motivated Both of those stories show that really literally life and death situations those connections with other humans It is a human basic need that we have to make those connections Or you cannot survive I think both of those stories That s a really good question in looking at the stages It also shows globally Globally what can we say about families At the beginning of the story you were talking about it s like a Disney movie right Yeah So what can we say about families literally around the world They re all usually together Nobody ever leaves their children when their toddlers to go find where like how they re supposed to live and like what s good and bad You usually nurture your kids til they re about nineteen and then they go off to college I think that s just how it is everywhere It may not be that way in some places but you usually have schooling and then you go off and then you figure out for yourself once you ve got a base Yeah they re usually pretty perfect or ideal until like a third party like Nazis or the Arabians come in and just wipe that out and changes a lot drastically to where they have to depend on themselves and I guess their friends since they didn t have family And that family unit seems to lend to safety even if you re living in Sudan or if you re living in Poland The children both at the beginning feel very safe in their lives right Right And if nobody knows you what makes you if you die who would care That s what I would think Like if nobody cared about me or nobody knew who I was That s what a lot of suicidal thoughts Yeah I was just thinking I don t think that but I m just saying if I had nobody to be like I care about you You need to stay alive or like your parents There wouldn t be a reason to live Yeah but like in those stories like they find symbolic fixtures or whatever I think in both yeah the moon They look at the moon and they see they just see the moon and it s like their kinda friend But they also hope that the moon will find their parents somewhere or wherever they are cause they don t know Yeah their parents are looking at the same thing that they re seeing kinda Yeah so it s kinda like right there keeping them together And what s funny is that s a main the moon is a main symbol in a long way gone Yeah And he refers to that also I think cause the moon can be seen anywhere on earth It s a connection I think somewhere Yeah Yeah totally It s kinda like the bright light in darkness You know the night it s a pictch black but the moon s shining You know kinda there no matter what Good Okay keep going And the German s are just coming in and everything s getting really bad And like going back to their past and showing it as such a nice place What she does is she ends up showing how much darker it is by comparison Okay what was the question How does the author implement setting to contrast good and evil How is it affected Okay purpose And we just finished talking about how it shows the atrocities to be even darker because it s happening in this nice place But she s forced to saying the dark side of things cause she s forced into her basement where it s all dark and you know there s mildew on the wall and it s flooded and it s just really gross down there And that s what s happening outside of the happy little hometown that she grew up in And then her childhood is marked with flowers and the sunny days You know running with her friends and chasing butterflies and eating sweets And it s just really happy and bright and cheery And so there s a major contrast And as you go into the book does that darkness continue Or is it broken by light How does she portray darkness and light even when she goes to the camps There s Go ahead but I have an answer OK At least up to the point where we ve read she s kind of reached a climax of how bad things are when her parents were taken away from her and everything Arthur s letters stopped coming And that s kind of the climax from how far we ve gotten where the darkness is So now it s about finding the good things that are in that darkness Right I think she has little flashes of good things and the smallest of things to us brings such hope to her of a bright future But it is surrounded by darkness And in the camp did she talk about physically light and dark also Like the dramas and she wrote plays And they had fun there The single light shining in the dark room Do you have anything to add Abbey Can you think of times when she talked about light Physically light in the camps I was trying to think And how does she portray it Cause that is an interesting motif in the book the light and dark And it will continue to play a part Which camp is she in at the middle part She s in the I can t pronounce it It s the first one where she s they re sewing they re weaving So they re at the looms right Yeah they re at the looms Did she pass through Auschwitz Or was that the one she was in jail I think she passed through Volkenheim Yeah Does she ever get outside That would be a key at Volkenheim Outside of the camp itself Just outside in the outside Well here s a reference to outside She talks about how the night was starry and beautiful From Heirgonk I could see the hill through a window Slowly the full moon rose So that is like a light in the darkness literally Because the stars the moon and the stars are the brightest things at night in the sky and just her finding that comfort in that also shows really extreme light and dark But her comfort comes at night in the darkness And she has one source of light So keep looking for those motifs of light and dark cause they play a part throughout Have any of you gotten past the halfway point Yeah Yeah we ve gotten a little bit past In the march you know that becomes very important Alright good Good job Alright you guys Bell s gonna ring Keep your questions for tomorrow 
 Who s gonna do the skyscraper So we got to put size color and shape Size color and shape Ok I m gonna do a skyscraper Beau is that for the past or the present That s for the present Skyscraper Present the present The present ok And the pyramid is for the past Yeah And you ll do a pyramid for the past I was gonna do a log cabin That s what I was gonna do But we have to use different things because we don t got no logs Well actually they still make log cabins now We can use brown for the logs Jonathon says they still make log cabins now They do Yeah they do We don t really make pyramids any more do we No Yeah but they could be hidden in Egypt Yeah but there is four lines What we gonna do with the other two What I want you to do is list three details Color size and shape So what shape will your skyscraper probably be A rectangle A rectangular prism A rectangular prism That s what Dillon said Rectangle Rectangular Prism Okay Then you can talk about your pyramids Ask them they re your team A square pyramid Triangle Oh he said a square pyramid Yeah let s do it A triangle You think it should be a triangular pyramid Yeah I m with Dillon Well talk about it Which one do you want to do I thought square pyramid was more like a real pyramid You know because it has four sides It does have four A pyramid only has four sides Well a triangle has four too It does One two three four That s a square honey because it has four Well if it has three sides how many sides does it have Three Three So you have to decide So we could take a square and make it like a Dillon agrees a square pyramid too I love having y all together Let s do square pyramid and rectangular prism Good deciding Alright What are you guys discussing right now We re discussing what all we wanna do I like that Okay We re not sure what play we re doing You re not sure what play you wanna do Because everybody keeps picking everything So how are we gonna figure it out But I agree with Randy So what do you guys agree on I agree with my plans He wants like an old time car and I don t agree with that But we don t understand how you do an old time car How do you do a play or skit about an old car That s what you need to tell them The only time Okay Aaron said something about the classroom and that I was going to be the teacher Or something like that I wanna be assistant teacher Randy likes that And this is two people from the past and two people from the present Hear what Jacob said Jacob wants to be assistant teacher You re the teacher assistant teacher So when will that be in the past or the present Present Haley could be a teacher from the present and then me and Randy can be from the past and then they can be from the present too And then we ll come to where they are then they ll have to show us what changed Did y all hear Aaron s idea You can say that to them I like Aaron s idea Listen to what Aaron just said guys He has an idea that you may want to do Ian and Jacob and Haley are from the present And me and Randy are from the past and we come And they show us all the stuff that has changed I agree with Aaron I agree with Aaron I agree with Aaron Or we could do like you two are teachers and like me and Aaron and Ian are like students And then them two teach us Oh that s an idea You could do But then how do we do the past Well but you could do the past and then how could you do a skit about the past and a skit about the present Yeah They would be the same except one is the past and one is the present To where like no one had desks and then in the present we have desks Oh What do you think Ian I wanted to do people from the past and future they all meet together and do things from the past and the future Well are we doing the future or the present Present Well then people from present and past and they do things from the past and the present Okay Well decide It sounds like you got some really good ideas Why can t we just do one if they are doing stuff from the past and the present And you choose your own people who live in the present Well Ian if your working in a group should everybody do their own thing or should we work and kind of come up with the same idea Yeah you choose your own people but you do it in the present Sounds like y all have to just keep on You may just have to make a decision Ok You may just have to make a decision Sounds like you are doing great guys How do you spell transfer trucks Huh How do you spell transfer trucks Transfer trucks Let s sound it let s tap it What letters T Trrr A N C E R or something Trr like tree T R You got it Shannon Did you hear Shannon Let s tap it Ta jarius Trr Aaa A What letter is that Nnnn N Ssss C K S Ssss Transssss S I got S F F How do you make er at the end of a word E R You got it There you go and you know trucks So what are y all doing with transfer trucks I don t know He s the one who wanted to write it Why was this on Noah s desk Case has some names Yeah Ok but what But why did y all um You re describing what each persons job will be And I have that Noah and Ta jarius and Madison are gonna do what The waves What kind of waves What are y all showing from the past and the present I wanna do waves in the present Do waves change from the past to the present Do you mean like ocean waves Have those changed over time I m doing transfer trucks What s it suppose to be A I m doing transfer trucks How have those changed over time Horses carried them with like umbrella s over them Very cool And we saw that kind of wagon on the smart board earlier And you said that was like a truck You could pull that up back up there I could pull it back up Do you wanna see that again Cash do you wanna do the illustrations for the trucks over time Shannon what are you doing What are your illustrations gonna be showing change over time She might do cars or something Do you wanna do cars You don t have to do cars You don t want to Lots of things have changed over time You can actually buy food and not hunt it How do you spell Shannon That s one of the things you could draw the change from the maybe you ll do washing machines Yeah Yeah that works Yeah Cars change Do you wanna do transfer trucks No You re already doing them Guys Do you wanna do washing machines Madison Draw a washing machine next to that You wanna do washing machines Can you hold that up so they can see it because Shannon can t see it Where did ya wash your clothes at Turn it over like this and you d rub them against here Different isn t it Yeah When I was little my great great great great great great great grandma grandfather he had a washing board he took a picture of and then when I was big I was allowed to see it Very cool There was a picture Alright It sounds like you ve got some work to do guys I love the idea of showing the illustrations of the trucks over time and the cars over time I think we need to think about waves though because waves are a natural thing People don t really build and change those do we No so we need to think about something that has changed over time And don t forget our books Buildings Buildings Buildings have definitely changed over time Alright guys Keep it up you are doing great Alright let s see what you guys are up to Okay what s going on over here Well we re thinking about About Cassa coloring Ann coloring and me coloring and drawing and her drawing I love drawing You love drawing That s what I love I love typing at home I love all of it Very cool Alright so what kind of things are you gonna show how are you gonna show past to present with your clothing We re gonna show the style the color Okay can you tell me what you re gonna draw We re gonna draw dresses Oh dresses And shoes Like dresses and the shoes that they would wear I can get my old dress My mom s old dress she s got I have it and I can design it You can Uh huh So are you all four going to show dresses from the past and present Yes Or are some of you gonna do past and some of you do present We re gonna do it all together I love that Them two are coloring I m coloring and me and her are drawing Very nice You re drawing Yes we re drawing I m coloring Very very nice Well it looks like you guys are ready for your next page Let me ask you this how has clothing changed over time The color has definitely changed The colors have changed And the shoes Ladies used to wear long dresses and now they wear not that long of dresses Oh so they used to wear really long dresses and now They have short dresses that come up to here Yeah and shoes they wear lace up boots Laced up boots I think my mama has them I won t be able to wear them but I might be able to bring them Oh that d be cool if you bring those It sounds like you have great ideas And they wore hats back then cause I m thinking about my mom s dress I mean I can design it I am very very pleased with how much you ve accomplished together in your group let me get you the next sheet Okay We all have our things done and we re going to get it And we all have each others phone numbers Here s the next sheet Let s look for a second Who will design the piece from the past and Who will design the piece from the present Now that doesn t mean it has to be separate Right you can take it home Well me and her Well it sounded like we re all okay Yeah we re all basically doing it Okay Why is this change important to people today and How could this continue to change in the future Hmmmm There s some questions to think about So have you worked on this some more You ve decided to what you re gonna do Skyscrapers and pyramids They re doing the pyramids me and him is doing the skyscrapers Them two are doing the pyramids we re doing the skyscrapers That was nice Good going coming up with that Good job We re doing a square pyramid You re doing a square pyramid Yeah That s easy all you gotta do is start out as a square and draw triangles at the top So when I was with you before you said this is hard we don t know what we re gonna do and all had different ideas and as it turns out this is kind of easy What made it easier Working as a team Working as a team Dillon would you mind sitting over here sweetie so that everybody can hear and see what you re doing Yeah Kinda off by himself over there huh sweetheart Alright the last thing you need to fill out on your papers is How has this changed over time Buildings how have buildings changed over time Pyramids pyramids been tooken down Did we ever build buildings out of gold No I got something Pyramids have been tooken down to make more space in Eygpt like more land Okay What about buildings in general How is this building different from McWilliams It s bigger It s bigger and has more space Which one is bigger McWilliams And it s newer It s newer so how do you It s newer or it s smaller He says it s newer 
 And then with Carl s example was down to MSB marginal social benefit So how can we put that into words Marginal social benefit Andrew Isn t it something that can t really be measured Okay Yes and it s harder to measure but how would you explain it What is it Think about what we did in the example and say like everybody is benefiting from washing cars Right So what is It is a social benefit and it s what he gets from the society It s what society gets from you Yeah you re on the track but it s what we get from his interaction Right Okay So it s the benefit to society for whatever market that is Okay So social benefit this is going to be the additional benefit okay The additional benefit that society those that are not involved in the transaction but from society get from one more unit Okay Now I m going to put next to this slash costs Oh just kidding That s that s the other document So down here is just something is a negative thing So what this leads to Do you think these two definitions lead to positive externality or negative externality Positive Positive they re things that market itself does not take care of Okay Market obviously in this example does not take Carl and offer YTB for all of our benefits considering it doesn t pay him at all Right There are things in society that when you look at the actual amount someone is paid they re maybe not paid to the extent of the benefit they get Okay So right now if you flip over to the back we ll come back to definitions later flip over to the back Oh I m sorry on the other sheet because I didn t put it on the back on the other sheet you have two columns I want you first by yourselves without talking to someone else think of try to think of at least two examples where there are things in society where there are markets for these and it makes everyone better off because they re there and we all benefit from them Okay Go ahead write them down Think about it You really think you re going to have to defend it So think about on your own what markets are out there things that happen that benefit everybody not just the people participating in the market So benefits more people than are just paying for the service not just the buyers or the sellers of that service but outside of it people are benefiting from it Write and think and then we ll talk about them Write and think write and think Wait do we need negative ones too Just positive right now we re going to go back to the negative ones So just think of the positive ones right now Okay benefit people again let s cover the definition again Benefit people outside of the buyers and sellers in that transaction Okay So we re not talking about just the buyer of someone who goes to a store and buys something and the benefit they get from it that s marginal benefit but that person buying this gives other people benefit outside of that person But like if they built a hospital in the neighborhood and it has a reputation of being not like they don t have a lot of equipment it s not very good Then could you like the property values of the of the town go down So you could talk about Okay So you re on absolutely the right track so then that would be a negative Like so what could always be a positive benefit Okay Well let s talk about some of the negatives Some of you wrote some stuff down I saw Matt right away think of something what d you write down I said flu shots Okay Why Because the more healthy people there are around the less you ll I don t know The less sick people there are the more healthy people there are Overall right Because if one of you Think about this If one of us If half of the class gets flu shots and the other half doesn t that mentality shows us that now that other half is more likely to get the flu right So that is an absolutely Flu shots What could you make that into a broader explanation Vaccinations Vaccinations Okay Vaccinations So go ahead and write those two down because those two are textbook examples Is medicine good Medicine It depends if it s contagious but go ahead and be more specific so you want to put flu vaccine or any kind of vaccine It s a perfect example because that is a big issue right now A lot of parents are talking about not vaccinating their children because they re worried about issues of autism that have been indirectly slightly connected to it but for the most part that has not been proven yet so now we re seeing other ramifications of that decision Over here go ahead Pro sports Pro sports tell me why People who play get paid for doing it and the fans enjoy watching them Okay good So pro sports and we re not even talking about people that necessarily pay for the ticket to go You might just get to watch on TV A lot of times on the main stations you don t even have to pay cable lines So you would go ahead and benefit from those If you pay aren t you technically then part of that If you paid for it then you re part of that market So like vaccinations You pay for vaccine Okay But that person that pays for the vaccination doesn t get it but all of us benefit because that one student got the vaccine Okay So that s the key It benefits people outside of the one paying for it So that s why it s social Okay Sam YouTube Okay Tell me why Because people can freely put up any type of videos they want That uses creativity and people that want to hear music from anywhere can do it wherever they want Absolutely So YouTube is a great modern example because we all benefit from that kind of laughter that enjoyment It doesn t cost us anything People do it for their own interest and we all benefit Cody Education Education Tell me why Students learn and they get to do well in the world and then the world gets some technology Okay Good Like you brought up tax payers So your parents pay for your education in school Right But by the fact that you re becoming educated even if they pay for your college tuition Now you don t give back just to your parents with that education you give back to society overall Right To everyone hopefully in the world one way or another you end up giving back to society For more people than are paying for your education Okay Yeah Clean energy like electric cars or something because even if you yourself don t drive one that makes like it improves Okay Anything green Absolutely Anything green like that You can put green technologies benefit the world which kind of brings us to one that we re going to talk about with a negative Okay Yeah I just had a question Could you put stock like since if someone buys a stock it raises the price for everyone else Yeah I ve never heard that example but you could argue that It s still benefiting a select group though I guess in some stocks though that s millions and millions of people so I mean you might be able to argue I didn t know because they re still involved in the transaction They re only involved if it s their initial one So that s why I think it s worth some argument there You might be able to prove that I think some of the other ones across the board are a little bit more general but that s definitely something to think about Andrew Well see I agree with him because when the stock prices go up people see that as Oh the public is spending more so that would bring the economy up which would bring That s a really good point because that s an indicator of the health of the economy Right So by the stock market being high it makes everyone employ people Yeah that s a good extra point to add in Yeah What about something like sorry You were thinking of the same thing at the same time Alright go ahead So like taxpayers and the government pays them and even if you don t pay taxes you still benefit from it You could actually put public works down in your column because now that we ve kind of opened that can we can think about parks right And I get the example all the time There s a really nice park I live right by Glenn Ellen and I am not technically in Glenn Ellen but right by there then I go down there I run by the park I take advantage of that public area and I add to my benefit So just by having that park it kind of benefits more people than just the people that pay for it So any public works Police you could talk about firemen they benefit many more people than the people that pay for them The people that clear the snow off the roads Delightful Can I get some negative externalities then Flip it back over Let s go right on Flip it to the other sheet and let s go to the other thing here and then we ll start graphing it Marginal costs Let s put that in our own words here What is the marginal cost of these Everyone think about it for a second Think about it write down your own definition This is something you should know like the back of your hand at this point In your own words write down the definition of marginal costs Write it down you already did Marginal cost You got it Andrew What is marginal cost What is marginal cost The extra cost of hiring one additional worker Okay One more whatever it is It doesn t have to be a worker We re all thinking about workers because we just got out of inputs we just got out of inputs and factor markets and resource markets but remember those units one two and three they had marginal cost too If you picture a monopoly graph what does marginal cost look like on a monopoly graph Upward sloping Upward sloping right So we can think of the system in every unit So what does it need One the additional cost of what One more unit One more unit Let s just keep it like that because input is just factors One more unit because in a monopoly it s marginal cost of making one more unit In a labor market it s the additional cost of one more worker Keep in mind again these are both people that are participating in that market So I m going to put This is the same thing except for it s the cost So you wrote it ready in your own words but make sure you ve got that basic idea Additional cost of one more unit So now we re applying it to this new idea What s the marginal social cost of something The marginal social cost Andrew How much society loses for one more unit Okay How much society loses for one more unit or how much it takes away or cost us when we make one more unit So we re going to think and I m going to add thoughts here It s for all of society So flip it over what are some examples or go to the other sheet What are some examples of negative externalities now that we ve got this down in your mind What are some negatives Zach Breathing in pollution Pollution That again he is on it this is the textbook definition Pollution is the most common example So what has government implemented to try to curtail pollution What kind of things have they done Smoking ban laws Okay good smoking bans So you could say pollution you could also say cigarette smoke is a negative externality So government stepped in which is the type of pollution The government stepped in and said No you cannot smoke in places of employment you cannot smoke in any public area in Illinois it s obviously done by state but the state has stepped in to curtail this type of externality Betty Don t they have pollution rights that they can buy in the market Okay Very good Who do they buy them from The government Good So federal government actually sells pollution rights So that s another way that they deal with it What agency was created to deal with pollution The EPA EPA So the EPA is out there trying to make sure that only so much pollution happens Yeah This is kind of more local but like banks in Elmhurst like they make a lot of banks a ton of banks but every single time they make a new one it seems like less use of all the banks like there s no point to them and it s like a lot of So you re saying that s a negative externality because there s too much Not just that there s just like Say you replace a store that maybe some people use and make a bank and then there s less to do in Elmhurst Okay Try to think of the best way I mean I see what you re saying because that transaction takes away from your enjoyment of living in a town You could put something else there like a new house or a restaurant or something just don t put a bank Okay So how would the government fix that They could be like We re not going to let you buy it The bank buy that lot they could have said no So they might limit they might say how many of these business could be That s a new one I ve never heard of that but obviously there s something there to that because you re saying it s taking away from the enjoyment of people in the community It is maybe adding to the wealth of the community with the employment and the income that s being raised but overall True no I think you ve got something there but it s a different lens Andrew I think that a better example for that would be parking lots because then it s just there and not doing anything whereas for a bank it increases the competition and it increases the rate of The parking garage closer to the Y encourages people to go down to the retail area of Elmhurst and it kind of does encourage people to All right I like what you guys are going with this either one of you could make an argument with it That kind of brings up another point though This is somewhat of Alex are you with me This is somewhat of a this is somewhat of an opinion right Because now you re saying that there s certain things that there s definite and those are going to be our perfect examples like pollution No one in their right mind can argue that pollution gives a benefit to society They can argue that what they produce that produces pollution is helping industrialize I mean talk to China One example Their massive pollution few regulations at all because they re trying to compete with other countries and step up but they re not they definitely would say it s worth it But pollution itself no one can say that it s good Andrew mentioned something about the beauty of something What are some things that people buy or do 
 All right So I showed you all that video for three reasons Number one I want you to see that volleyball is not a girl s sport Here in the South a lot of people think of volleyball as a girl sport because we don t have a lot of male high school volleyball teams I don t know why we just don t That s a common misconception that volleyball is a girl s sport Everybody in that video was a male Everybody in that video was over 50 years of age That means volleyball is a lifetime activity Raise your hand if you can take a guess at what a lifetime activity is Yes ma am A lifetime activity is something you can do when you re older A lifetime activity is something you can do basically for the rest of your life Would golf be a lifetime activity No Golf Yes Golf would be a lifetime activity There s people 70 80 90 years old that are playing golf As a matter of fact playing golf is an accomplishment to be able to go out and shoot your age So I m if I m 70 and I go out and shoot a good Golf is a lifetime activity How about bowling Yes How about tackle football No No Tackle football would not be a lifetime activity If I was to go to the YMCA do you think I would be able to find a league to sign up for tackle football at my age No No Can I go out to the YMCA and find a volleyball league for somebody my age Yeah Yes So volleyball is what we consider a lifetime activity Something you can do the rest of your life Okay the third thing those guys were pretty good Mmhmm And they were pretty athletic So by playing volleyball and staying active you re going to be more athletic than a lot of people that are your age So not only is volleyball a lifetime activity it s going to help you stay in shape help you stay active okay First thing we re going to do is the serve With the serve there are a few things we need to remember okay First thing I want us to remember with the serve is that the ball must stay at the waist When we hit it out of our hand we want it to stay at our waist If I hold the ball up here and I hit the ball is going to go up It s all about the angles okay If I hit the ball right here it s going to go up and out like I want it to go all right So then I want to hit it at my waist Second thing that we re going to remember is that my opposite foot needs to be forward If I hit it with my right hand I want my left leg to be up front like this What other activities have we done that your opposite foot is forward Yes Catching Throwing right With the overhand throw we step with our opposite foot What else Yes ma am The underhand toss The underhand toss that is exactly right I think Ms Beldo taught y all the underhand toss Step tick tock point Which foot do we step with The opposite The opposite foot Do you see a trend Can you make a little connection there Opposite foot forwards okay Now the next things that I want you to remember kind of go hand in hand They are tick tock Tick tock looks like this Tick Tock Pretty easy right Tick Tock Tick I want to pull it back Back here Tock our arm is coming forward Now we are going to add a little something to the tock part All the tock when we do tock I want you standing like this and do tock When we do tock we are actually going to transfer our weight from our back foot going forward into the front foot What do you think that s going to do If we transfer that weight forward Yes If we transfer our weight forward it s going to put more pressure It s going to put more pressure on the ball Am I plugging it harder or softer Harder Harder It s going to produce more force Right I m going to hit the ball harder if I do this than if I do this Does that make sense Because you re getting that momentum going forward It s just like in baseball If I m playing baseball and I m standing in the outfield am I going to throw it harder if I do this or if I do this The one with more force The second one right Because my momentum is going forward Does that make sense So my momentum is going forward Just like in four square If I m playing four square and I want to hit the ball and I m trying to get somebody out in four square am I going to hit it harder if I do this or if I do this That The second one I get my force from the momentum going forward That s right and the last thing I want you to remember with the serve is the follow through Follow the ball John will you stand up please If I want the ball to go to John my follow through should be towards John right If I want the ball going towards the flag my follow through The flag towards the flag If I want the ball going to the cougar my follow through The cougar going to the cougar But right now we re working on hitting it straight so my follow through goes to my target Watch see me take everything out Ball s at my waist my opposite foot is forward tick Tock Tock just like that Okay We ll do it a little bit farther Ready John Opposite foot forward ball at the waist tick tock All right Did you see everything that we had just talked about Opposite foot forward ball at the waist tick transfer my weight into tock All right You re kind of hitting it like that I hit it Good That s great Tony you ready Tony You ready Tossin it up and hittin it And stop just a second put the ball on the ground Ball on the ground A lot of people are doing a good job getting that opposite food forward but they re not transferring their weight to that foot they re getting that opposite foot forward and they re standing like this Am I going to generate much force by doing this No Think about baseball I could step with that opposite foot but if I step and then throw is that helping me generate any force No No I want to step into it Same way in baseball When I throw a baseball I want to step and throw at the same time to get my momentum going forward We re generating force So instead of Tony are you ready Instead of this opposite foot forward and like that I want to generate more force so I m going to start with my weight back here and go into it You see the difference Ball on the ground please Yes So work on generating that force going forward Okay Continue Go And stop just a second Ball on the ground All right One more way that we re going to try to generate force is by following through after we hit the ball So instead of Alex are you ready I m going to serve this to you Instead of doing this kind of almost like you re punching the ball and stopping I m going to follow through to my target If Alex is my target my arm should finish up here at my target Watch Do you see the difference in the force between punching it and following through to your target So that s another thing to work on Remember if you are doing a good job with the ball that you ve got you can switch to another ball If you ve got one of these big yellow ones and you re doing perfect every time I would recommend switching to either this or one of the yellow and blue ones Challenge yourself a little bit Let s go ahead and switch stations so that if you were here one person walk up here and get a clipboard and paper so you can leave notes for your partner If you were over there come over here If you weren t over here just put your clipboard on the steps there And everybody stop Put the ball on the ground just a second No balls in the air Everybody stand up Everybody stand up Alright put everything on the ground Everybody should have to free hands Together let s work on tick transfer your weight through to your target Ryan go in his place Tick arm back transfer weight follow through to your target I still see some people doing this Where s that ball going to go That way That way If I m aiming at the Ball on the ground If I m aiming at the white poster my follow through is to the white poster Everybody pick out a target Tick step follow through Go Pick out a target tick step follow through Go get that ball We ll get you another ball Who can raise their hand and tell me the first thing we need to remember for the volleyball serve Yes sir The first thing we talked about Yes ma am The ball should be at your Waist The ball s at your waist And what is that going to impact And what s it going to influence How far the ball goes It s going to influence how far the ball goes All right So if the ball is up here it s going to go where Up Up If I m down here the ball s going to go Go out so I want to add my weight in order to get that angle so the ball will go over the net and drop What s the second thing to remember Yes sir Remember it s what we talked about with the underhand throw four square and the overhand throw Our opposite foot is Forward Forward right Our opposite foot is forward Like this What s the third thing Shift your weight I want to shift my weight We actually did tick tock when I talk about shifting my weight but shifting our weight is one of the most important things because that is how we produce 
 Who came up with the definition for radiation Peter you had a good definition could you repeat that remind us I don t remember it exactly but it was something along the lines of anything with waves that move waves that are radiated I mean Didn t you say it was waves that are spread Yeah waves that are spread by something and they usually have energy with them Like the sun sends its radiation to the earth in the form of light heat UVA UVB rays Okay so with that understanding would you guys say that all radiation is harmful Not all Yes To a degree all of radiation is harmful But just it depends on how harmful But so then what is like when it s not harmful It s very very very Not almost It s almost negligible What types of waves that radiate or what types of radiation do you associate with being not harmful Radio waves Any others Jordan Microwaves Visible light Yeah visible light isn t really that harmful What about microwaves that s a good one What do you guys think about microwaves I thought they were dangerous but somebody told me that they weren t They re not really that harmful are they I mean You probably shouldn t stand in front of it Saying they re not that harmful They re not I mean I think probably like extended exposure to them would be bad but I think that could be the same with a lot of things The door shuts when you use the microwave too What about then where do they fall on the spectrum what makes you think they re not dangerous Or that they are Because they are longer than light waves They ve got longer wavelengths Which what does that mean They have lower frequencies They don t carry as much energy with them Lower frequencies Let me consult my chart Okay good idea Or can anyone help her What was your question Claire Oh I didn t have a question Oh okay What was the question Why is she looking at her chart Nope same We think they re not dangerous because they have a longer wavelength and a smaller frequency than light Light is Okay good so I think this is a good segue to the next question which is why are some electromagnetic waves considered dangerous to humans while others aren t Do you know what a segue is Okay Which ones have more energy than others Gamma rays and X rays and UVH rays Okay good Peter did you have something you wanted to add To what he just said Mm hmm Okay good and can you repeat that Sam Some electromagnetic waves are more dangerous because they have much more energy Okay good So ultimately what is that energy doing Why is that harmful to us Can stimulate cell growth The more energy it has the more like materials it can penetrate Like visible light wouldn t really cut through you but gamma rays could like travel through skin And X rays can What did you guys learn about perhaps in biology Cancer Well that it s when cells grow too fast the abnormal growth of cells keep reproducing and There s a mistake in the coding of the DNA and then everything just goes haywire and the cells like what Caleb said grow at abnormally fast rates and they just take over that area and spread Well yeah they stop functioning as normal cells and their sole function is to reproduce and to continue growing and then they eat portions of other cells Okay so what do electromagnetic waves have to do with this extra energy This dangerous energy Well wouldn t like Cho said they would like stimulate the growth and or is that not Why do they stimulate growth Because they have energy What does the energy do to stimulate it What were you going to say Ronnie Well I just said that they trigger they don t like stimulate I mean cell growth to an extent is necessary But they can trigger something dangerous like with I don t really have like the percent or anything but What else might control cell growth DNA Okay good yeah Lots of energy can Can energy alter DNA I feel like it can t Well isn t that what it s doing if it s triggering abnormal cell growth I don t know Is anyone in here have you taken or are you taking biology I took it last year I kind of remember what we talked about with cancer It s okay and you guys have actually come to a good conclusion that it does lie in the DNA and that you know certain types of radiation can cause mutations in DNA that affect the cell cycle So when we think about cancer a lot of times in light or electromagnetic waves a lot of times we think about skin cancer And we talked a bit about that yesterday We also probably notice skin variations among different people from different regions of the world So how does skin color variation how do you think it relates to the amount of UV radiation that a particular population receives You mean based on their race Just based on their geologic background Geographic background not geologic Well I mean people with darker skin tend to not get sunburned as much as somebody with really really pale skin I don t think that s true I think it s just that it doesn t show up as much like you can definitely still get sun damage No of course you can still get sunburned but I don t think it s like It s harder I think so I think it s just less noticeable Yeah I think it s just less noticeable I really don t think it has anything to do with Okay so you re getting the same amount good you re getting the same amount of radiation sure Is sunburning caused by like the amount of light we absorb our skin absorbs It s actually it s in their Grace and Lana s video About how What did we do On your presentation about sunburn How sunburn works I don t remember Okay so ultimately I guess I ll restate the question So how does skin color relate to the amount of UV radiation a certain population may receive We see a lot of variation so a lot of people often times say Oh why do people in in countries that are near the equator Why are they darker wouldn t that make them hotter Because we tend to think of dark colors as absorbing a lot of different wavelengths of light Is that true is that what s happening It seems kind of Wouldn t that make you sweat more then Which would be good if it was hot I guess sweat Sweat is just to release the heat on your body No but that s what I m saying like if you get hotter quicker then you would start sweating earlier which cools you down What is the pigment in skin that causes color variations Melanin Okay good alright So people who have darker skin do they have more or less They have more It s in eyes too right It s what causes eye color differences Maybe I m making that up but What do you think the purpose of the melanin is Is it to absorb Grace offered one theory what s another theory too there There are several different reasons What does it do to UV light What s different about people that live say in the equator regions like the and people who live up north They don t get sunburned if they live there I mean There s like nothing to Yeah exactly People who live in northern climates are much more likely to get sunburned because they re not exposed to that much sun or their relatives weren t And as they adapted they just passed on that trait of having fair skin But I don t know why Do you know Miss Roseborough Yeah I have an understanding yes And when I think about it I kind of think about the actual pigment itself and what it s doing and where it s located on the body What it may be serving to do Doesn t it synthesize vitamin D for us That would make sense Yeah that s vitamin D from sunlight I guess that s why Okay so people who have more melanin have live in the sun you know they have more exposure to the sun Why do they need that extra melanin To protect them Okay yeah so let s go with that to protect them From what From the radiation like I guess if you re out in the sun more you need more protection so like it s kind of like a built in sunblock What would it protect So it s on the surface right Protects the inner skin It protects the outer layer right Epidermis Yeah I feel like Ewan brought up something like this yesterday when we were talking Is that why they you have lighter on your hands Oh I think that s the thing about like gamma rays for example being more like that was one of the question because they have more ability to penetrate through skin and Okay so really what s happening is the melanin actually absorbs the wavelengths of light that would normally penetrate the skin How does it do that It just doesn t the energy is just sort of dissipated as heat and so You get the heat but not the radiation Right exactly so it doesn t go further into your body So darker people get less sunburned than fairer people because of that Well does it necessarily have to do with sunburn And they re less likely to get skin cancer Yeah I d say they re less likely to get skin cancer When you get tan are you getting more melanin in your skin Yeah what s happening when you get tan So shouldn t tanning make your skin stronger Well If it increases melanin I don t think it s necessarily increasing it Because the tan goes away Oh So it s like you have whatever your natural skin color is then that is determined how much Okay Okay so next misconception that a lot of people have or just something that I ve always wondered about I don t know if it s a misconception or not but I m thinking about colors that we associate with certain just everyday things So when I go into the bathroom when I go into the kitchen I see red and that indicates the faucet that I turn for hot water and blue for cold water Why do you think those colors were chosen and is that always true Because fire is red Water and ice is blue It s not really blue it s more clear White and blue flames are much hotter than red flames Yeah explain that I don t know I guess back a long time ago before they knew that The hottest part of the fire is at the top and if you think about a flame usually you see a little blue or white part at the bottom and then it s the red orange at the top Which is where it would be the hottest It s hottest at the top But there s at the top it would be starting to cool off as it gets away from At the peak it s the hottest But then the bunsen burner the hottest part is like Yeah the hottest part of the flame is the top You get a marshmallow you put it at the bottom No sir What color is at the top guys Red White Or orange Blue and white at the bottom It s an experiment Miss Rose let s do experiments on fire That s a good idea I think we should at this point Do you have bunsen burners in here No I don t have a gas source So let s just go back I even broke it down and I was thinking about well where did this come from I was thinking what wavelengths of light are being absorbed by the color red and what are being reflected by the color red And so is the color red actually hotter How could I relate that to temperature How do you even relate a color to temperature So just the color red what s it reflecting What s it absorbing What color does it reflect It reflects red And it absorbs green and blue Or cyan Right so going back to the what makes it that color its natural frequency what types of waves are causing it to change in temperature What s happening as a result of different white light say striking it and its actual reflection and absorption of different waves of light Would red or blue actually be hotter As a pigment Blue should be hotter because it has more energy it has the shorter wavelength and greater frequency Yeah Sam s right So with a pigment Think about a pigment first What about it just think about it Yeah so certain wavelengths of light are being absorbed and certain wavelengths of light are being reflected What does it mean when a pigment absorbs wavelengths of light What happens to the energy that is being absorbed It transfers to the medium Okay good I was going to say the pigment has the same frequency as those wavelengths so Probably right Okay good so it absorbs so let s think about blue again How could you apply that What wavelengths of light does it absorb Shorter wavelengths than red Well no blue absorbs red and green so this would be longer wavelengths and lower frequencies So red would absorb the blue Therefore it would absorb the higher frequency had more energy which means it would be hotter right What do you guys think Can you restate that Sorry because red absorbs blue and blue has a higher frequency the red would be absorbing the higher frequency which means it would be getting more energy from the higher frequency So red would be the hottest The man has a point I agree with Peter I agree with it too I agree with Peter Yeah that s sort of the conclusion I came to the only conclusion Then I started thinking more I was like well how does this apply to stars So if I see a star that gives off a 
 Okay so for our first trial we just wanted to see how long it would take for 25 milliliters of magnesium hydroxide to turn into acid by adding HCL and it took 73 5 milliliters And for our second trial we had the same amount of milk of magnesia but this time we diluted it with 100 milliliters of water And it took less HCL hydrochloric acid than in the first trial that we did And the first time we only added five drops of phenylthalene and the second time we added ten drops just to see if it would make it different and the ten drops definitely made it pinker but we don t think it affected the results because phenylthalene is just the indicator and not part of the reaction You guys actually brought up a good point How many groups added phenylthalene in large quantities How many think that you didn t add enough Let s just ask that Or how would you know if you added too much or not enough Alright go ahead Will Well as long as it turns pink you know that the indicator s working What if it s pinker It wouldn t matter because it turns clear towards the end What do other people think Alright Vivian I feel like if there s not enough indicator that when you add more and more HCL to the solution it becomes the pink color becomes so diluted that you can hardly tell when it turns clear and when it turns back to very pale pink So I don t think there s such a thing as adding too much indicator Our group added about five drops and that was enough Okay what Tad Actually adding too much indicator is bad for the experiment because that would distort the actual concentration of reactants So in an extreme case if we added like 100 milliliters of indicator that would definitely distort the concentration True what do people think about that Alright Jimmy The indicator doesn t participate in the overall reaction so it doesn t really make a difference What do people have to say to that Alright why don t you take Discuss would adding too much indicator would that affect your concentration Like in terms of volume maybe you re adding to more volume of your reaction would that affect the concentrations of your reactants Okay thoughts Alright Jerry I feel like if you added the indicator it would dilute the solution because it would be somewhat like water if you added let s say would change the concentration Okay alright Stephanie I think it would like because if you started out with 25 milliliters of milk of magnesia even if you add a lot of phenylthalene it would still be 25 milliliters of milk of magnesia and that s what s reacting So I don t think it affects it Alright Mackenzie Isn t pH determined by the concentration of hydroxide or hydrogen ions So if it s it would be moles over liters so if there were more liters it would be a smaller concentration right Alright Corey It s mostly about the moles because if the moles of each of the acid and the base combine they will neutralize It doesn t really matter the over liters as long as the moles are equal Okay Rick Well since phenylthalene is an indicator it doesn t actually participate in the reaction just like water so adding it would just increase the volume which as he said which would dilute the solution Adding a lot would have a profound affect but adding a little bit wouldn t actually make a difference Okay Richard It would because there s a lower concentration it would take a lot longer for it to react meaning that it greatly increases the risk of error Because when you re using a burette it s continuously dripping so then if you re swirling and it doesn t react as fast then you have more that goes in before you actually realize it So those are all good thoughts that you guys came up with and all reasonable It does affect the concentration and when you add a few drops just like Vivian said if you don t add enough then it s still indicating but in terms of the overall concentration the concentration of the phenylthalene would be relatively small and so that s why you see like a very faint pink but it s still indicating Now if you add more drops of course you re going to have a darker pink but the overall reaction volume would increase and so if you add drops of phenylthalene if you re adding like five drops compared to your overall reaction volume it wouldn t be that big of a difference So you would still have some source of error but since you re only adding five drops as opposed to five million drops five million drops could conceivably double your reaction volume and then your concentration on a greater scale would be affected You know it would make it so it s more diluted Okay does that make sense to everyone Alright those were all good comments Anyone else have a comment Alright so let s go to table two In last week s experiment we were testing how much HCL it would take to neutralize 25 mL of milk of magnesia First we measured 25 mL of milk of magnesia using a graduated cylinder and add the milk of magnesia into the flask and then we add three drop of phenylthalene as indicator to the flask Then we slowly used the burette to drop the HCL into the flask and it took us 55 5 mL of HCL to clear the solution Every time we d see that it s clear it took the solution longer time So the first time we stopped putting we stopped adding HCL but then it only took about one second to turn back to pink But then after the third or fourth stop that we made it took longer than one second so by the time it took so like towards the end it didn t turn pink anymore So for the second trial what we did instead of using just 25 milliliters of milk of magnesia we just used 15 milliliters and diluted it with ten milliliters of water to see if there s a change in the amount of HCL we used and it did because it took a lot less which was 35 5 milliliters of HCL as compared to the first trial where we used 55 5 So we thought there might be a relation between the concentration of trial two versus trial one It was roughly 35 5 is roughly two thirds the amount it took for the m o m to come clear as over HCL and we were kind of surprised by the results because we didn t expect it to keep going back to pink after it turned clear once Do you think you did something wrong Well we kind of did but then we remembered that this reaction was actually reversible so then we tried it again and then we eventually made it all clear Did anyone else did any other groups think that when the reaction was happening that you had done something wrong Or were surprised by the results Alright Ian Oh no just saying yes Okay anyone have a comment We thought something was going wrong because it took a lot of HCL for the indicator to start working What do you mean start working To start turning opaque because it was pink for a long time We had to add extra HCL to the burette We actually thought that it wouldn t stop turning pink because we stopped it for about three times stopped the burette from running and every time it kept changing color So we thought that happened throughout the experiment Did you think it was going to go on forever Yep Okay any other groups Alright Andrew We noticed that yeah what they said It changed to clear and then after we stopped stirring it it would go back to pink We thought it was the reversible reaction rates but then like we were surprised at how big a difference it was because it was really clear when we were stirring it but once we stopped became really pink Okay alright Will There was also a transitional phase where it turned light and we thought that was the phase it would turn into rather than clear so we actually stopped it there but then we looked around and realized that people with a less concentration turned clear so we started adding more Okay alright group three First we used 25 milliliters of milk of magnesia and then we took 200 milliliters of water to dilute it and then we added five drops of phenylthalene It took about 7 milliliters of one molar HCL to actually fully huh Yeah it took 70 milliliters and then it stayed clear from there For the second trial we want to see if we added less milk of magnesia would it would the time decrease I mean the time to neutralize decrease And so we add 15 mL of magnesia and the same amount of H2O and so we used up about So I heard something about timing because I heard the first couple groups timed some of the things What did you guys time and why did you choose to time that Here let s start here because you guys timed something What did you time and why did you choose to time that Well basically I think we re just measuring the amount of HCL we used up and see how many times we need to stop the burette for Well we observed that it kept changing from pink to clear but the more HCL we put the faster it was from the switch so we kept adding HCL and it turned all clear It turned all clear the faster The previous times were milky white and then towards the end it becomes clear Like totally clear Okay did anyone observe something different in terms of the amount of time that it took for it to turn back to pink Okay table six As we added more HCL the white color persisted longer and it took longer for it to turn back to pink Okay so yeah Rick I don t think time really matters in this experiment because the changing of the colors in the reaction depended more on the amount that was added rather than the time you left it in there So if you add more of course it s going to change quicker but it doesn t matter like how long you have to wait for So you guys were saying that when you added the HCL that it changed quicker to white and then it took longer for it to turn back to pink Okay Gabriel We timed it because we think that there might be a connection between the time it takes each time to turn back to pink and the concentration of the reactants because the longer it takes to turn back to pink might mean that there are less reactants and therefore it will take a long time to get back to the reactions right back to the products which turns it to pink Okay alright Corey I was saying that it was faster turning back to pink The reaction was actually it was slower going back to pink That s okay Okay let s go to table four In our experiment in our procedure actually we had two beakers of the magnesium hydroxide and one beaker we would heat instead of diluting it we would heat up one beaker to around 50 degrees Celsius and we would perform the experiment with adding HCL using the burette and in the other beaker we would leave it in room temperature which is around 25 degrees Celsius and we would do the same procedure adding the HCL with the burette Our purpose for heating it was to see whether the reaction was an endothermic reaction or an exothermic reaction What we found was that when we heated it it actually changing from pink to clear it actually took less time than when we did it at room temperature so we don t know if it accounts for the exothermic or endothermic or maybe the molecules are just moving faster so it ll react faster We also did not dilute the milk of magnesia like most of the groups did so that may have skewed our answers a little as well It took us a lot longer and more HCL to turn the solution clear again Comments Does anyone think that so this group didn t dilute How many groups diluted and added distilled water Okay so all the other groups did Do you think that their data would be affected because they didn t dilute and because you did What are your thoughts Alright Nina We diluted our second trial and it didn t affect the amount of HCL needed Why do you think well from your observations that s obvious but does anyone know why Or think why that might happen Why would your data not be affected Or think that maybe theirs was a fluke And your data should have been affected by diluting it with water Alright Joey Is it because the HCL only reacts with the milk of magnesia So it doesn t affect how much water because it doesn t react with water Okay what do you guys think Alright Katie I think it will affect it because the concentration s higher and the milk of magnesia by itself is more dense so there s less surface area I would say Okay less surface area Okay that s a possibility Alright Gabriel I think it wouldn t affect the amount of HCL that would be added but it will just affect the time because with water it will take longer for the reaction to take place because there s more volume and without diluting it their group just made it straight up so it would be faster for the reactants to go back to pink and then at the end it will just turn clear either way Why do you think it would be faster if they didn t dilute it Because there would be less volume and the smaller the spaces the molecules will react faster and have less room to move around Okay reasonable yep So our group kind of did both We had a control we redid the same experiment for number one and then we measured how many milliliters of HCL it took so if you change the concentration it does affect the amount of HCL it takes to neutralize it Alright Michael We diluted it and it took longer for us to we added more HCL for it to neutralize and I feel like if you dilute the milk of magnesia there would be less molarity and if it s not diluted it would be a stronger weak base than if it was diluted It would become weaker You can t change the strength of an acid or a base because it s based on what it s by definition You can t make a strong base weak but that s okay Wintel In our case we did two solutions different concentration The amount of HCL that s needed to neutralize the solution shouldn t be should be the same but in this case the time delay causes the solution with low concentration to take more HCL because during the delay the reaction the HCL hasn t still reacted with milk of magnesia yet and because of that delay there s more HCL that s needed to compensate for that Okay so there s a little bit of stoichiometry going on where the number of moles or the amount the amount s still the same regardless of whether of milk of magnesia regardless of whether or not you added distilled water or you didn t So the amount s still the same 
 Until I say switch So you stay at your center when you are finished When I say switch you may go to the next center Okay All right so Here are different centers You know where you go you may go to your center and you may begin Let s go back again let s make sure we re pushing There you go 14 14 14 Where should we start them Good job Nice job Where do you think we should start our cubes when we re gonna measure Here Yeah Because we wanna line it up where it starts Good Nathan used more force to do it Right Nathan used a little bit more force than you didn t he So when you used more force what did that do It made it go farther It made it go farther good job All right guys if you are done put your thumbs up If you are still working raise your hand in the air Okay I m gonna give you about one more minute to finish up All right how did it go Okay very nice Where should we start it Now if we re measuring where do we need to start the cube Nice job All right I want you to stop what you re doing You need to pick up your clipboard and your pencil and you need to switch Leave the cubes and the pucks at the station Clipboards pencils and switch We have no puck over here Here it is Have an idea for you Okay hold on a second let s go down the list I want you to come back put that away I saw Teddy go like this and put his fingers here and go up Why did you do that Teddy Where it was but when he marks the paper there he needs to really leave it there and then push the other ones up And I need someone else to come over here and measure Now we knew it was 10 here what are we gonna count next What comes after 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 15 okay go ahead and record that How do we know when it s supposed to be a Okay so whose turn is this one Mine Where do you need to start lining it up 50 15 50 50 So if we did 10 what comes after 10 11 12 13 14 14 Right there Nice job All right stop what you re doing I want you to go ahead pick up your clipboard and your pencils and you may switch Let me do it Can I ask a question Sure what would you like to ask me All right Okay That s a good question All right who s gonna go next in this group Okay why don t you hold on one second Can you move over a little bit Get behind it and push it 11 12 13 14 15 Yeah I did What do you notice about those two numbers Oh it s two 19 s I think Amber might get the 19 You think she might get 19 No she didn t Do you wanna try pushing it again Here start behind Nice job All right guys go ahead and switch one more time Take your pencil and your clipboard You can go first Okay guys Let s get our pencil so that we know exactly where it is Right here Okay so now go ahead and count So what did you come up with 13 13 good job Let s turn the clipboard around so you can Three backwards 35 Whoa All right now whose turn is it DaMonte s turn Go ahead DaMonte Now where do we need to start counting Right here Can you give him some tips Where do you think he should start counting Right here Okay and why The line That s where the tape begins right Or you could even go like this and start it at the tape and then you use your pencil So where does the pencil stop Right here Okay so then count to there I ll hold it for you you count 10 Ben what do you think Can you help him Seven So Ben thought that he got seven Yeah it s seven Okay so we re gonna stop where the thing begins so we re gonna stop at the seven okay Here you go good job Okay I want you to stop what you re doing I want you to quickly come to the carpet with your pencil and your clipboard Come to your circle spot I m gonna count down from five I want you to be on the carpet at zero Five Four Three Two One And zero I love how you guys get to the carpet so nice and quietly Thank you Give yourself a pat on the back for doing a really good job Now I wanna know what you noticed about using the different surfaces What did you notice about the tile what did you notice about the wood what did you notice about the cloth and what did you notice about the carpet Sophia I noticed that the cloth and the carpet was harder It was harder And so what do you think happened The puck slowed down The puck slowed down what made it slow down The bumps on the towel The bumps on the towel and when we watched that video that talked about the bumps do you remember what they called that What is it that causes those bumps Nathaniel It pushes back It does it pushes it back What s that big word that we ve been talking about Friction Friction so do you think there was more friction on the towel Not when I did it Okay so Monalisa share what you noticed When I pushed mine it went all the way down It went all the way down so which one had more friction when you were testing it Which one slowed down or did not go as far Which surface was slower do you remember The carpet The carpet so the carpet for you had the most friction Okay so does anyone else wanna talk about their surface Kayley The cloth when I pushed the puck it went kind of far but not really far because of all the bumps Which surface had the least amount of friction Daniel Wood The wood Give me a thumbs up if the wood was also the one with the least amount of friction Good job
