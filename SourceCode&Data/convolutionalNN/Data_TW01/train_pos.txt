 Hi welcome to the library media center At the entrance we post school community events and have some newspapers so that our readers can keep up with the current news and community happenings At our situation desk we have a suggestion box our series list and magazines and books to entice students as they check out In our commercial seating area we have state book award nominees and winners as well as numerous magazines for you in the library for your checkout For the teachers I have a professional library with over 3 000 books DVDs manipulatives and kits developed to support the curriculum Fiction is concentrated on the right side of the library The paperbacks a student favorite arranged by genre just like in retail stores All of the series books are clearly labelled so students can quickly find the next book in a series I give special consideration to my reluctant reader s needs if students interests were looking for fiction or making sure we have quality literature for all reading levels We have 13 desktop computers and a mobile laptop lab with which students access the internet numerous databases Impact and a variety of software On the school library website they find reviews blogs links to resarch sites as well as book suggestions trainers and podcasts many of which are created by the students On the left hand side of the library the reference and the non fiction sections are located Our many biographies are housed on the non fiction side of the center counter I have many displays throughout the library and around the school but two of the most effective ways I encourage student interaction with literature is by display of their works such as book reviews or projects and by intermingling related materials to encourage further exploration of the topics I keep the collection current and relevant through annual reading and by following my collection development plan so I can offer my patrons a fantastic collection with enthusiastic and professional service But we don t we don t find our food and just like The three little pig wolf thing She counted all the way up And she wants to know the lines or something We re going to now that you guys have most of your categories filled in I would like for you to flip over the lab sheet that s in front of you There are two reviews for this book Compare what you have on your graphic organizer to what you find in the review If you had mentioned that Bridge was a protagonist or basically mention Bridge and give some description of Bridge then that would be something that is in common with one of the reviews If you find something in common circle it on your graphic organizer I would like for you to circle everything on your graphic organizer that you also see in the reviews And again you can work with your partner on this one it talks about what they deserve and 30 more seconds That s okay Did you find that there were several things in common between the elements you looked for and found in the story and what you find in the review Yes The review has some additional items in it doesn t it There are a lot of people with the same basic items Anyway I wanted to do a quick Venn diagram up here and compare and contrast I want for each group this group I want each of the two of you to find one thing that you found that wasn t in the review Or one thing that was in the review that was not on your paper Okay Okay you guys I want you to find one for each of those groups I want you to find one thing that was in common So this is compare this is contrast Contrast compare Find one thing that was in common and one thing that s different Oh okay here s a sticky in the middle of the table I want you to write it on the sticky You guys hard Awesome step up here and tell us what it is and where does it go Awesome perfect So all you guys came up with a We did like don t count your chickens before they hatch and it was in our graphic organizer Oh okay Perfect and that was Good perfect Okay so everybody here found something that they had that wasn t in the review it was in their graphic organizer You guys come on up This table everyone at this table is looking for something that was found in both their graphic organizer and in the review We found Super Super so that goes in the middle because it s in common with both of them This group Perfect they found both in the review and in their organizer that So that was a What category Oh was that in common Did you find it in the review also or was it Just you guys found it So where would it go Excellent excellent That would go in the graphic organizer because it was something that wasn t in the review so it would go over here perfect Okay next We found that the Okay so you found something that was only in the review that the how the pigs disguised themselves Where do we put that on that Excellent something that was only found in the review Save the best for last What d you guys find We found that the graphic organizer and the review they both talked about that related to like the The allusions in there Wizard of Oz Three Little Pigs Excellent that was So we see an awful lot is in common with these Sometimes you guys find something that aren t in the reviews the reviews sometimes had something you didn t find They are a little bit different Not necessarily in your review cover every literary element there is You won t necessarily tell them the five different types of literary devices that are used there and that s okay What you want to do with your review is tell some about the book and give a substantiated opinion of the book Why do What are the good features of this book What are the weaknesses in the book that you read Now there are other things that you may need in there and I ll show where you can get some additional information Let s bring this on down here In the online catalog Both of those computers are logged in over there Okay look up So far So if you want to make a note of how many pages as a reminder to yourself Oh yeah that was a really long book or Oh that was a quick read That would be something to kind of jog your memory there Things like Oh yeah this was about Korea 
 Write at the top of your paper The color that you want for your sugar and the color you want for your salt on both of them Sugar on one salt on the other Yes because you can make from your sheet two Now the purpose of these sheets is so you can actually take your spoon Malik take your spoon and dip out onto that paper This gives you a better visual of how much sugar and how much salt is in that particular food Now what s the most important thing about the label Serving Size Serving size Good Aaron serving size So that is showing most of these is the container itself That s the reason we went to snack foods so that you could see how much that is This also gives you a better idea of how much you eat Some of you like Aaron may eat two or three of these especially if it was Gummies right Aaron Yes It s not Gummies but it s close Okay so any questions before you get started Okay decide who is going to do calculations decide who s going to measure first I want you to rotate those responsibilities around and Devon what is your question Remember the personal column is how much you would eat the serving size Doesn t matter your group remember has to cooperate figure out who s going to do what and just look at responsibilities Just make sure everyone sees how much sugar how much salt it is That s the important part On the back of your paper When it says about 29 grams right here What s the serving size Serving size is here there are four servings in here They would eat half the bag then it would be two servings So next is the total calories and it s got 130 calories total carbs ok so nine grams Now when you dip out your salt and sugar try to replace it in the correct bucket we don t want the salt in the sugar or the sugar in the salt So pay attention to what you re doing Now remember you have to calculate what you would eat Give me some sugar 11 grams divided by four Put two teaspoons on here Is it sodium Dip it out you see how much See visually how much it is I don t have any salt Yes Paul I want to encourage you that after you done something that s really sugary do something that you would think would be salty as if it surprises you how much sugars in it 
 At the end of class I want you to be able to explain how to swing the bat faster so the ball will travel further Because the faster the bat goes the further the ball s gonna go And there s three things that we re going to do to make the bat swing faster Okay we re going to hold the bat at the end to make it longer We re gonna hold the end to make it longer A longer bat means a faster bat We re gonna use more body parts or muscle when we swing and we re gonna apply more time to our swing by stepping into the swing And we re learning to bat so that we can play more and more fun games in order to stay healthy Because there s lots of fun batting games you can play with your friends here at school and outside of school that will help you have a healthy heart and muscles And we re gonna do four different things today I m gonna ask you to talk to a partner I m gonna do a little experiment we re gonna play spotlight tag and then we re gonna have some personal practice And I ve created a little healthy a little helping worksheet for you that shows you what it looks like Now all these things will help you know and help you be able to explain how to swing the bat faster I want you to turn to a partner and tell them as many things of as many games that you can that use swinging a bat or an impement Go ahead Hey everybody let me get your attention If I pull your stick I want you to tell us a game or an activity that you can do that requires using a bat or an implement to hit a ball or something We re green No we re red Jeremiah where s Jeremiah Yes Softball Softball very good Raquel where s Raquel What Raquel Game or something you can play Do we use a bat to play soccer No No How about Stephanie Baseball Who said golf what about golf What about ping pong Do you know what ping pong is Yeah So all of these activities are things that we can play once we learn how to swing a bat Now we re gonna go around the blue house and you re gonna sit on the red dot until I say go and I m gonna do a little experiment to show you how these things can make the ball go further I would like you to walk please be careful Go Okay thank you for sitting Now over there I said the longer the bat the faster it goes The faster the bat the further the ball goes So I m gonna show you what I mean Is this a very long bat No No so I m gonna swing and see how far it goes Did it go very far No Now I m gonna make that longer Who thinks it s gonna go further Let s see if it goes further It went a little bit further huh Yes Now by holding the bat at the end it ll make it longer and it ll go further Now another way we make the bat go faster is by using more body parts and muscles So I m only gonna use a couple muscles here to swing the bat You think this will this go very far Yeah Yeah Okay let s see No I didn t use a lot of muscle Now I m gonna use lots of muscles on this step and I m gonna twist see how far it goes Do it again do a lot of muscle Anyone know of any other way we can make the bat go faster Hit from the bottom I had it written over there Does anyone else remember I want to make my bat longer I want to use lots of muscles and Alex That s how we use lots of muscles I want to swing the bat for as long as I can in order to generate speed Now if I start my bat right here and I swing it do I have lots of time to hit the ball No Do you think it ll go far Let s see what happens Now if I start way back here do you think I ll have more time Yeah You think it ll go further Yeah All right let s see So raise your hand if you want to hit the ball far Hitting the ball far will help you be successful and if you re successful you re going to have a good time But today we re going to learn different ways to hit the ball further by making our bat go fast Don t swing please tell me It makes the bat go faster Why does the bat go faster The bat goes faster the ball goes faster But what makes the bat go faster because it s short or long Long Longer bat means faster Okay rotate Rotate Dominant hand on top Step twist We re practicing what grip is the best How d that one go Fernanda what grip are you using Mr Holden can I go to the bathroom Hurry Excellent twisting Derek excellent twisting What number are you going to read it Try this one hold your bat with your hands apart Put your left hand on top I mean your right hand on the top Left hand at the bottom Spread your hands apart like this Now try it again How did that go Is that one good You think so Now hold it at the end see what happens It s right here Now hold your hands put your right hand on the top Right hand on the top your right hand on top All right Fernanda Big step let s see it Big step twist your whole body Get your bat back there you go Try it again Did the ball go further that time Okay sit behind your little cone and answer the question on your card Alright now read it out loud for me Which grip do you think makes the bat swing fastest Holding it at the end Remember when we talked about how long the bat is A longer bat can travel faster or slower Faster so when you hold it at the end it makes it longer and then you can swing it faster and then the ball goes further Is that what happened Yeah All right rotate Alright are you going to twist or not twist Back foot step Put your weight on your front foot Alright so pretend your feet are stuck in mud so you can t move them So we ve been learning all the different ways we can make the bat go faster so that we can hit the ball far because when we hit the ball far our game and when we re batting is more enjoyable We ve practiced we ve talked about and we ve discussed three different ways to make the bat go faster so that the ball will travel further When we re batting okay I have a sentence frame for you it says I can blank to make the bat go faster so the ball will go further Okay you re in your batting team groups right now When I say go I want you to use this sentence frame and discuss the three different ways you can make the bat go faster so the ball will travel further And then I m gonna pull our sticks and you ll get to share with the entire class how you think you can make the bat go faster So now is your time to use all of the intelligence and brains of your group to figure out your three answers Are there any questions No Okay I m gonna give you about two minutes Use the sentence frame discuss with your group Go ahead Alright how is your group doing Jesse you getting to share I might pick your stick Talk with Alex What are we coming up with Jeremiah How are we gonna make the bat go faster Do you remember Okay how about Alex Why do we twist Alex Alex why do we twist Alex sit up please When we twist we use more what Muscles What color were we Black or green Red Oh we were red Okay second grade eyes on me please Sit down on a number You ve had a nice opportunity to talk with your group to figure out the three ways we can make the bat go faster If I pick your name please stand up speak nice and loud and use the sentence frame and tell us one way we can make the bat go faster Let s see here Jonathan All right Jonathan stand up buddy Jonathan use the sentence frame I can I can hold the bat at the end to make the bat go faster so the ball will go further Good answer give him a round of applause When we have a longer bat it generates more speed and more speed with the bat makes the ball go further Now there are two other ways you can make the bat go faster 
 What you just said They re going to go back together Well I ve glued them down so they can t The green and the red charts are locked down in place They can t get back but I ve taken up the orange field Wouldn t it generate a new field They re going to make a new field and that new field will be Say it again Oh like the earlier drawing We can actually say a little more than that In this vicinity here They ll be trying to pull each other back together So we re going to end up with a field that s exactly opposite What we did was they move around As long as it s still running They move apart until the field is basically nullified Let s look at one more example Do you have one more potato shape in there Most people Most people right So let s start for this last one let s look at this shape and say that I observe fields coming out like that Write down a couple of observations before you make your prediction Based on what you re seeing in there what can you say about what you see Are those lines all supposed to be straight Yeah To the best of my drawing ability they re horizontal parallel lines My drawing was perfect Mr Shields what They re going in two directions The orange Yeah the orange one Like a very large plate It could be just a potato in there and that s The thing in your hand This one Yep Okay let s take a look Chris can I get you to shut the door to keep the noise down We ll give you a break in about 10 minutes or so It s nice to have the extra period here First thing before we talk about this new one I failed to address Hannah s question and good insight earlier Yes The orange lines in here will be drawn into the negative and they re going to bend and will be coming outward from the positive end So you re definitely going to see this sort of pattern I think people saw a little bit of that in the simulations Anytime you ve got a conducting material Anytime you ve got a conducting material the field lines always intersect exactly perpendicular with It s a conductor So it definitely makes a difference when you call it a conductor and look at what happened in the field Let s talk about this new one There s a couple of observations Ian give me one observation and Claire give me the second observation Besides the fact that the lines are straight No that s a good one The lines are straight Very important Claire They re going in opposite directions Exactly opposite directions Okay Hakim give me another one Well the lines are coming out of it Okay they re coming outward not inward Good To indicate that the Okay so that one we know from the very first piece here The net charge is positive The fact that they re horizontal They indicate like a plate or something Yeah is it like two parallel plates Two parallel plates So where would you draw them Above and below There are two on top So like above and below like this Four plates Four plates Let s make it 16 But if you had a plate and the thing is neutral or no net charge and then they would just But what if you had one positive plate straight up and down the middle then it would push away on both sides Two positive plates Two plates sounds twice as good as one but I m not sure that it is Four plates sounds even more appealing An infinite number of plates sounds fantastic I m hearing good ideas here I want you guys to think about what it would look like in different scenarios So two positive plates Okay two positive plates and I m looking at the vicinity in the middle here is that right And do I want my two positive plates to be on the sides Negative plates Well negative plates okay Two negative plates on the sides like this so the field would look like what Bend Okay we re getting a bending because if I draw it here But you still have to compare It d be like this kind of a picture It d still be bent Greater than the distance Okay so you ve got So based on that you ve got some things going on above and below that should be penetrating into that shape What about two infinitely long Two infinitely long plates Both negative What would the field look like Forge the potato shape What would the field look like in the vicinity of two infinitely long evenly charged negative plates Wouldn t they go If I take a single positive test charge and release it right in the middle what would it do What if I release it a little bit to the left side An infinitely long plate We derived this one before a single one Remember the equation for the field or the general shape of the field from an infinite plane It s constant It s a constant exactly right Brittany didn t even have to look at her notes on that one But you remember what was our analogy to an infinitely large plate Yeah gravity on the earth here you know big flat earth I don t care how far above the ground I am it s the same number it doesn t change at all That s exactly right So an infinite plate the field is some number another identical infinite plate it nullifies it So in the same charge okay Well that isn t going to work Infinitely far Infinitely far away from each other When Brittney says it s a constant even if you go to infinity I guess it d still be a constant either that or you go to zero It would be two sets one set like that except that they are horizontal and vertical and they re infinitely far away where Two horizontal plates like this Yeah because I don t think that s going to work either Ben you re getting agitated back there And what are you saying We were just talking You re saying there s no way in the world they can be infinite Is that what you re saying Yeah You can t have an infinite plane anything because you re defining the shape So that s a good question When I ve got the shape here do we require that the thing that I m talking about fit inside of the shape No I m going to say no Okay so does that change your answer Okay I think we can and will look at situations where the surface And remember this is all leading up to that Gaussian surface idea we mentioned on Friday Where the Gaussian surface does not fully enclose an object Like an infinite plane we need to be able to study those even though I can t fit it inside of a box So we have to expand a little bit to the possibility that whatever it is is inside of there An infinitely long positive plate right in the middle Right in the middle Is that what you said about seven minutes ago Yeah I tried to ignore him because I didn t want you guys to get the answer too quick But I do want to acknowledge him Yeah tell me if this makes sense and why Somebody besides John and Ian It doesn t make sense that I ve got a plate and this is slicing my potato in half and it s a positive plate Would it have to be infinitely long Much longer If I don t Now I m not very good at drawing in 3D so is the potato lines are they diverging this way at all I can t tell They re uniform this way parallel lines this way so we know that it has to be infinite this way And not have divergence this way Well I didn t draw any lines coming out of the Do they have to be parallel to the ones that are on the board or would they be diverging That s going to change the answer that you give If I draw another red line that s coming like this that s clearly diverging from this red line So I m going to assume that every line for this problem every line that I draw is parallel and then we ll get a new Perpendicular with the plate Yeah perpendicular to the board And then all positive coming out both sides Very good Alright I ve got one more drawing on there I want to hit and then we ll just say some fantastic summary words and then I ll give you guys a break The last one here instead of the three dimensional shape now all I ve got is a single sheet of paper And this sheet of paper I ve got I noticed I noticed parallel lines arrows coming straight out of that shape Write down a couple of observations on it quick and then see if you can predict based on what you observed here what and where if you want to what the source of the field lines is What can we learn from the electric field lines They re all coming out parallel in one direction Yes parallel in one direction One direction They re parallel this way and they re parallel this way also So they re normal to the surface everywhere Are they coming from the other side All I see is lines penetrating this way so I could actually draw them like this and that s fine Do you know anything about the other side of the plate like is there anything there It s a two dimensional structure and the arrows penetrate Oh okay Yeah they re not diverging at all Yeah uniform orthogonal all that good stuff Into the paper So they re coming out of here They re going into here and coming out here Oh okay To the differences that s a closed shape This is a two dimensional surface If I had wrapped it around like this it would make a difference right Okay guys let s see what we ve got here I m going to ask Paul first Emily second and then we ll see if Michael can go for the trifecta Oh no No pressure You can be wrong it s alright Paul what is based on your observations what is the thing that you think is the source of the electric field here Where is it coming from that it makes this pattern in this object on this sheet I think this is like the second or the third example we did when it was passing through Where they re just passing through Yeah So then where do you think it s coming from What does that tell you about the source of the electric field I m not sure You have more to say No Emily give it a try Since it s positive on this side Yup You can see that there might be a positive charge Okay so if I had a positive charge on this side I would get electric field lines going like this That s correct okay Or if you had a negative charge Ah okay so you re answering two things which is pretty overachieving but I like it that you re saying that instead of a positive back here it could be a negative over here Okay now there s something incomplete about what you re saying The positive here versus there could be a negative here that s a great insight that it could be one or the other but Michael s going to help us out because you re a little incomplete on what you re telling us They have to be infinite Infinite Infinitely strong charge Infinitely long whatever a plane A plane yeah A plane back here that s infinitely large distributive charge that s positive That s the only way to get a uniform field here Can it work with what Emily was saying about it could be a negative over here It could be an infinitely long thing here There s one more option Does anybody It could be intro That this piece of paper here is neutral And you could just put a new positive charge But be careful Any positive charge if I start off with the very first drawing and I look at what happens when I put a sheet here the field lines are like this They re diverging I m not having divergence here at all So it can t come from any old point source We are going to assume that this thing is neutral though Okay that itself is not It s just capturing the story of what s going on Hannah Could there be both a positive and negative along the plate Yeah you can have both You bet That seems like a little bit of overkill but as long as you re making your sheet infinite in size you might as well make two infinite s You have all your infinite That s right And two parallel plates two plates that are parallel to each other one positive one negative is a very common thing So common in fact that it s on my tie today Oh yeah there it is See that Hakim do you have a question Okay so it s the positive plane that s standing or negative plane Yeah the infinite plane The infinite plane I was about to say that That it would be infinite Yeah I think Michael was saying that it would probably be Not the charge distribution the sigma how much charge per unit area will be some number but it would just keep on going on Chris Yeah you know that would be a lot Reasonably speaking if something goes to infinity all of your homework is easy So there s no purpose for me doing that What is the answer Infinity or zero It s got to be one Infinitely large in size with a uniform charge distribution does add up to an infinite charge but it s distributed infinitely far away So that s okay Now remember the goal of this as we were getting into this today is to figure out what can we learn from an electric field And here s the thing In the first three or four examples or five I guess for some people if I take a closed surface I can learn a lot Not everything necessarily but I can learn about what s inside of that Infinitively is the first one positive Yes Yes The next one that I drew was negative absolutely This most recent closed surface it had to be a positive plate shoved in there This last one with just a two dimensional structure to measure with to gauge what s happening I don t know everything We ve got a lot of ambiguity And this is why with Gauss law we need to use this closed surface We need to look at it from all sides We need to be fully envelop in what s going on or else we might miss something We ll go back again The equation that I showed you last week we ll put that on the board in a few minutes when we come back from a break as well as looking at a couple of scenarios just conceptually how we can draw these things to capture all that field Go ahead and take a break and be back in five minutes 
 On a regular basis Have you ever thought about what that causes I mean what causes wind to blow in the first place Whether it be a breeze Whether it be a hurricane Whether it be a tornado Would you take a few minutes in your notebook would you just draw a line write after what you wrote And I want you to give your best explanation of what the heck causes wind Just do this on your own first What could cause wind to blow Take a few moments just on your own Just like always guys you don t have to be right here I just want to know anything that you think might contribute to wind blowing On a big scale on a small scale Anything that you ve got that we can build on anything that you put down Alright when you have this discussion in a few moments share your ideas with each other And then remember one person will be called from the group to share either what you put down or what somebody else did Talk to each other See what everyone there is thinking What ideas do we have The air pressure and temperature changes and so it kind of like shocks and it creates wind That s good I think wind develops because clouds carries that air I don t really know much Alright folks When we go let s use let s see who gets to share Person two We re going to go with person two And let me switch this over here real quick so I can write down some of your ideas Hold on Alright where d my pen go Okay here we go Person two And we re going to start over here Did you guys have any ideas why wind to blow No table seven Sorry I don t know but I said heat and cold air rising and falling Cause I know how hang gliding gives us columns of air rising heat rising how you get in the air I m really not sure so I m just thinking Okay so something about hot air rising and cool air falling And like how they re Say that again And cold and hot air going over mountains Different land masses Okay very interesting Now she had the toughest job From now on every other person number two that goes you have to either come up with a different theory a different idea or you can agree or disagree with what Miah had to say But you cannot say I don t know Okay So you gotta kinda run with what s been said Keisha we re going to go back to you first What was your thought at your group Well we agree with Miah because basically we said the same thing that like the temperature of the air can have something to do with the wind Okay So I m just going to add on here temperature I was going to add pressure Temperature okay That may be something different Let s see what we can add to this So you re agreeing with Miah that it may have something to do with the temperatures of the air Yeah Okay Table three you guys had a different kind of theory We agree with what she said except we also thought the pressure how the wind blows and stuff Okay so you guys talked mostly about pressure Yeah Could you pass that up to table two So far we have two theories One has been agreed to already We have temperature pressure Our group wasn t sure But I agree with Kavya in how the pressure You re thinking that it s something do with pressure And okay there s an agreement here with temperature as well Pass that up to table one Prescott what kind of ideas did you guys have Well we were talking and we kinda agree with A or hot air rising And pressure and air too but I was thinking that currents or air currents carry the wind or carry the air faster Okay so let me add something about currents in here Cause that s another kind of interesting thing So are currents separate from these two Or the same Or added on to Or they another thing all together Just added on I guess Okay so we ve got temperature of the air we ve got pressure of the air and we ve got something to do with currents Could you pass that over to Conner Conner what is your thought We kind of agreed that pressure of the air probably makes the wind Like low pressure and high pressure You know that s an interesting thing with the low pressure What would cause air to be different pressures I thought maybe the Earth s core and the gravity pulls down more in some places than others Okay so let s see So you re agreeing with pressure and you re kind of saying the pressures have something to do with gravity Really interesting Oops hang on Something to do with gravity causing different pressures Pass that back to David David what did your conversation involve Well I thought the I really didn t know exactly what makes the wind blow but if I had to guess I d say it s air masses meeting Let s put that down Okay Hold on And you threw out something that says air masses meeting Alright so when you talk about air masses give us more of what you thought of what that is What do you mean an air mass And when they meet how would that produce wind Well I know that when warm and moist air mass collides with a cool dry air mass it forms a thunderstorm I was thinking of one warm air mass meets another warm air mass then when they collide it might produce wind I don t know why that s just my guess No no that s fine So you re thinking when you re saying when two different kinds of air masses meet it makes a thunderstorm But maybe when two of the same meet it makes wind Yeah So let me put that on So air masses meeting So since we re talking only about wind right now it s the same kind of air mass meeting Alright Would you pass that back to Ah Nathan we re going to have you go since Amber already went today Back over to Nathan Nathan what did your conversation revolve around back there Well we didn t really know but based on what everyone said I agree with Miah that it s the hot air rising and the cooler falling But I also think that David s ideas are kind of interesting I agree with A You re agreeing with A that it has something to do with the temperatures Miah what s your thought I also thought what David said cause I know how tornadoes are formed But then I thought air masses are way too big And I know almost all over the continent get a lot of wind And so I think it might have something to do with air meeting together I think that has to do with hot and cold air kind of mashing Okay so You said with hot air rising and cool air falling And then you said something about hot and cool air mashing So when you talk about them mashing are they like coming together and like swirling together What do you mean by mashing Mixing not mashing Mixing Yeah just kind of colliding together but not swirling Okay so when you re saying hot air rising cool air falling you re saying that those two things are mixing and it s by the mixing together that s what s causing the wind Yes Okay Guys take a second I want you to talk we ve got two more tables to go But I want you to take a few moments talk about the theories that have been presented so far and see if your opinions change so far And then any questions that come up based on it Talk to each other Alright guys about ten seconds Everybody time And three two and one Great ideas so far guys Let s go to the last Any questions or comments come up in your discussion that you just had Yes Well I think that if two of the same air masses meet it would just make a larger air mass I mean if you re adding water with water it s just making more water Huh so you re saying instead of wind being created you would just have a bigger one And I also think maybe it creates a thunderstorm if it s two of the different air masses but maybe I think that would create wind like negative and positive magenets refusing to mix You re bringing a couple of interesting things You re saying when a warm air mass and a cold air mass meet you re saying that those are kind of like magnets Like opposite sides attract Am I understanding what you re saying Sorry I mean both of the I m a little confused Also I would kind of agree with David now because if I m thinking about magnets then two of the same magnets would refuse Right So would that analogy be a wind refusing Or would coming together be more like the wind I think that analogy would work with the two different temperatures of air mass but there s the magnets are the same the air masses are That s really interesting when you go and you apply to analogy like a magnet like that which is really cool to bring in Let me get the two other theories and we ll come back to that How big are air masses Well let me come back to that Let me get the two others and make sure we get some other theories in Richard what d you guys end up talking about Did it change as you saw these ideas Yeah so originally we were thinking that it might have something to do with gravity s movement Actually we thought it would probably be more something like a change in air pressure You know I m going to because I think that s an interesting theory I m going to put it up here anyway You said it had something to do with gravity and the movement of the planet itself So with gravity and movement of the Earth Okay and then once you started throughout this round you re thinking more it has to do with changing pressure Okay and you agree with what Connor was it you that was saying that it was the gravity that was causing the change in pressure Yeah So are you feeling like are you taking your idea and kinda hooking it together Or does something else cause a change in pressure Okay alright That s fine Where s the mic Can you pass it up Here I ll come get it Abigail last theory Go Well at first we weren t sure And we were talking about kind of atoms moving like molecules and compounds moving away from each other and combining But then we changed our opinions and think that like the pressure of air and the temperature of the air and the compounds that make up the air moving and changing make wind from the combination So you re really mashing it all together So your theory revolves around molecules moving away from each other That was the first part And then did that end up causing pressures did you say No like and then the different types of air kinda combined I guess So then molecules move away from each other When you say different types of air So like warm hot and pressure And those combine Should I add that to this I don t know Tom Yeah Tom I have a question How would two air masses meet if they didn t have wind to bring them Well now that s an interesting question Do air masses now that s a really interesting question Are air masses just these big masses of air And then wind blows them around Because then it wouldn t make the wind if it couldn t if it couldn t come together it couldn t make wind Oh now that s a really interesting thing So is the wind Oh wow Is wind a result of the air masses Or do air masses need wind to move Well that s a really good question Ben you had a hand up I just thought about it and I didn t really want to share the question I just was thinking in my head and I thought through the question Alright Does anybody have any other theories they d like to suggest Other than are there Let s go through them real quick So we had the theory that said it s hot air rising cool air falling and somehow those two mixing that creates the wind We had the theory that said it s the pressure of air and that pressure is kind of dictated by gravity We had something with currents So it s somehow the currents in the air whatever those happen to be that s what s causing the air to move as wind There s air masses meeting If it s the same what Dave was saying If the same air mass meeting that s what causes the wind It s gravity in the movement of the Earth which Richard and this table suggested Although they moved away from it I think it s a valid theory to be suggested And then it s molecules moving away from each other and then somehow combining with the other things So would you take a moment and if you had to commit to one of these as being why you thought wind would blow take a moment and talk to each other and decide which one you think you d commit to as far as which one you think it is Talk to each other I don t really know like what Matthew brought up how they would move So Alright guys here we go Would you grab the voter that is registered to you And when you turn it on you should have an A through F option And would you choose one of those to be your theory please Is this graded No it s not No we re just theorizing right now So just go with the one that feels best to you What s the question It is which one of those theories do you think it is that is what makes wind blow Wait for a few more people to vote Oh Mark we gotta get to voting Patrick you in Yep you re in Okay Mark what you want to vote on is which one of these theories you think is best Votes are on your voter and fire away And he s the last one to vote as soon as he goes we ll see what way we as a class think Oh you got it Okay here we go Let s see what you think Alright so B is our best theory so far So right now as a group let me save this So right now as a group we are thinking that it is pressure and Let me ask you this Let me get a quick hand vote for this just out of curiosity One of the things was that the pressure is caused by gravity How many of you are going to add pressure would be caused by gravity then Okay most of the people voted that way look like they re going 
 How s everybody today Good Good Okay we are gonna work our bodies real hard today and we are gonna play a game called Wellness Uno How many people raise your hand if you ve ever played Uno Absolutely put your hands down Do you know that there are four colors in Uno Who knows what one color is Alexis what is it Blue What s another one Um red Red What s another one Nate Yellow Yellow Green Green absolutely Okay we ve got the Uno cards spread all around the circle here first graders And what we re gonna do is in just a minute you re gonna come up here and you re gonna get an Uno card I might pick this one right here this one is a Green four Green four Okay I look at it and then I put it right back If you notice the gym is set up in four different color zones Point to where the green color zone is Boom you got a green cone over there stay right there watch Ms Miller The green color zone is the muscular strength and muscular endurance station So if this is you have choices when you come over here first graders Choice number one you can get a rope and you can swing how many times Four Four Swing four times Which rope would be easier to swing on Alexis The knot one The knot one cause you can hang on to it better that s right So you can swing or can come over here and you can do those bicep curls that we ve been working on in muscular strength and endurance Stand right here to the wall and do that four times nice and what Slow Slow absolutely And here s your last choice at the muscular strength and endurance station if I got what was my number again Four Four Look there s four hula hoops on the rock wall You would start here and you would go through hula hoop one then hula hoop Two three four What happens if I had a green two how many hula hoops would I go through Paige How many would I go through Two Just two Okay so it s either four whatever number that is that s the number of hula hoops you go through Then I come back over here and I pick another card Hmm did I pick this one oh I just picked that one Let s pick this one what color s that Yellow three Yellow three Point to the yellow color zone Absolutely the yellow color zone is the cardiorespiratory zone and guess what you have to do here first grade There is a cone here and it says yellow Add zero What was my number Three Three and if I add a zero to that what does that make that number Thirty Thirty That s what we re gonna have to do I have my choice I have to do thirty of something over here Here are my choices I m gonna do thirty oh gonna work my heart thirty step boxes Or if I don t wanna do that I can do the ball on the stick How many times Thirty Thirty And if I m really good and if I really wanna try I can get a jump rope right there on the wall and I can try jump roping thirty times Now I m gonna run back here and I m gonna get another card and I m gonna get this one right here This one is a Red six Uh oh Red nine Red nine it s a red nine see where that line is under there so that means it s a nine Red nine point to the red color zone Woo you guys are so smart I come over here to the red color zone and look what does the red color zone have on it Times two Times two so what was my number Nine Nine What s nine times two Say it Alexis Eleven Not eleven this is hard What s nine plus nine What is it Nathan Do you know What is it Ethan 18 It s 18 So we re gonna do 18 Ms Miller will help you with the math if you don t know so we re gonna times that one by two and here are my choices I m gonna come over here and I m gonna get a paddle and I m gonna this is a hand eye I m gonna use my hands and my eyes I m gonna put my safety strap on and I m gonna do how many of these 6 9 18 18 that s right 18 And first grade how can I challenge myself at this station If I wanted to make this station harder for myself how would I do that Courtney Um use your left hand Use your other hand Ms Miller is left handed so if I use my left hand I would use my right hand So if you want to challenge yourself you d use your other hand so you re gonna do that how many times 18 18 okay So that s you could either do that at this station or I love these these are the I call them the ice cream cones Look you throw that ball and you re gonna catch that ball Do it again that s how many Two Two And you re gonna do that all the way til you get to whatever number you have at that station That was using your hands and your eyes watching that ball right into that cup And now I m gonna come over here and I m gonna get one more and oh I just grabbed that one let s see what s oh what s this number Blue Blue six Where s the blue color zone point where s the blue color zone over there Hey the blue color zone is balancing watch Ms Miller over here You re gonna come over here and if you don t wanna touch the gym floor Ethan sit down for me you re gonna step on the stepping stones and you can either step on the sides of the ladder or if you wanna make it harder for yourself you can step on these rungs and balance all the way to the bleachers step up come across and then we re gonna go on this balance beam Hey first graders when we re balancing do we go fast or slow Slow Slow we go slow we don t wanna go fast at this station because we wanna have good balance and we don t wanna fall We wanna make sure we don t touch the gym floor So that s wait what was my number again I forgot Nine It was a nine red how many times would I go then Nine Nine times around there Or your choice is the hippity hops Now Ms Miller s a little big for this hippity hop but you kinda get the idea you just use the boing hop hop to the black line it s one and then back is how many Two So I would do that nine times Okay those are your choices so there s four stations yellow red excuse me green and blue Turn around and face Ms Miller now I wanna talk to you about something really quick it s something called personal integrity You ready back there Ethan Everybody sit on your bottoms sit on your bottoms Personal integrity and first does anybody know what personal integrity is do you think you know Maddie when you hear that what do you think that means Listening Listening okay what do you think Maria If you wanna go to one station that you really like and you get a different card you can t put it back and get the one you want Ah Wow do I like that definition Absolutely personal integrity this is the way I think of it is doing the right thing when nobody else is watching You said it Maria you know what my favorite I really like those swing ropes over there I really like to do that Would I have personal integrity if I came over here and I did this I got a card and it s like ooh blue I don t wanna go to blue I wanna put that back Ooh there s another blue I don t want that Would I have personal integrity if I kept picking cards until I got what I wanted No Can Ms Miller watch every person get a card No No so you have to have some personal integrity Whatever card you get that s the one what happens if I just got a blue card and I come over here and I pick another blue one What am I gonna do what am I gonna do Paige You put it back down and you get another one but not the same one No no no we re not gonna get another one we re going to what it s okay You just go back to the blue station That s right you re just gonna go back to the blue station and just maybe if you did the hippity hops maybe do the balance drill next time Outstanding okay we re gonna get started this is what I want you to do Oh I forgot one more rule when you get a card do you ever run across the Indian No Do we ever run across her because we wanna stay spread out we don t wanna bump into anybody Nelson do you have a question Do you have a question about something You d probably rip the card You would absolutely rip the card if you were to step on them or actually you might slide on them and you could hurt yourself Hands down let s get started I m gonna call months of the year And if I call your month of the year that your birthday is in then you re gonna get up and you re gonna go get a card Are you ready If you have a birthday in January February or March go get a card How bout April May and June July August September October November and December let s go What d you get Chris let s see man What is that talk to me Red eight Red eight do you know what eight plus eight is Eight plus eight think about that Almost 16 go do 16 of those good job buddy Hey Paige you wait on the end of the mat there until Alexis is done What s your number Alexis Four don t hold the bottom grab up at the top like Brian is doing that s perfect yeah What was your number One What was it One One did you do one Do you think you can do one then come back here and go get another card Ooh Steven Steven what d you get man What is it Blue seven It s a blue seven go Hey Ethan what d you get Now remember the line means what A yellow six Okay what are you gonna do with that yellow six Wait come here look at me you re gonna put a No you re gonna add a what to the end of that A zero and that makes it what number 60 Yeah let s go Woo look at these people over here at the cardiorespiratory station they are going up up down down they are getting their heart rates up What number did you have Maddie Um 50 50 holy moly Keep counting It goes like this Maddie up up down down that s one Every time you hit the ground that s one okay Woo Be careful That s okay just hold it up like this Watch watch you see how it whirls like this at the bottom There you go like that it can get pretty hard Yeah Chris I saw one card that was um um it was turned over Oh did you So I flipped it over Oh really thank you so much I appreciate you taking care of the cards for me Here you go five times two what s five plus five Ten Ten that s what it is Jamie what d you get Forty Forty Did you get four yellow Go Woo look at these hippity hops over here Outstanding Man are you guys doing a good job I like how you re going really slow at this station that s good balancing Ooh Chris way to get your balance back Slow down buddy woah Nelson I know Can you put one foot in front of the other Can you bring your other foot in front Wanna try it Ms Miller s right here in case you have to grab onto me Yeah look at that what a good balancer you are I balance on the monkey bars You balance on the monkey bars Yeah Woo Good job You did it good job All right what d you get buddy Blue four Hey are you supposed to have your card with you I ll go put it back for you remember to leave the card Hey Jane did you run through the middle of the Indian Did you forget Don t do it again go on stay on the floor Way to practice How s it going over here Paige and Ethan Keep your eye right on that ball Ooh Paige that was close Right on there good job How bout you come over here What is eight times two What s eight times two Paige do you know that That s a hard one Nine Eight plus eight Eight plus eight kids Six times two what s six plus six Six and six put the two sixes together 12 12 That s what it is Just keep going there s new music coming on there s new music coming on first grade Keep it going Way to go there Nelson I like that Woo Your arms hurt You re getting a lot of good muscular strength What d you get here let s see What is that Yellow seven What are you gonna do to that seven You re gonna put a what on the end of it A what are you gonna put on it A zero What does that make it 70 Go Woo Maddie you got a blue Nine Yes No kidding Don t go running What is that card A yellow four And what are you gonna add to that four 
 Look at your station one information And the question we posed in station one was does temperature affect the rate of chemical weather And yesterday you guys constructed a graph to show that data Why is it useful to construct a graph in science class Sky Because it s a visual way to show you information It s a visual way to show you information I have a case up here as an example Based on that graph what does that pattern reveal about our question Gabrielle The cooler the temperature the more the I mean more increases in time The more what increases in time The more uh weather Okay anybody want to restate that Rebecca The colder it is the more time it takes to weather Very good The colder it is the more time it takes to weather If we re talking about dissolving a tablet is that chemical weathering or mechanical weathering Logan Chemical weathering Chemical weathering So the colder it is the longer it takes for the chemical weathering to occur Would you agree Thumbs up or thumbs down Thumbs up I would agree Now I want to talk about so what Why does it matter to us Why does it matter in our daily lives Talk about it for one minute record your thoughts on your wipe board and be ready to share back We could consider where to build our stuff In what types of areas would you have to be specifically and particularly hot What about up north You ve got 30 seconds to finish writing your thoughts Okay it might dissolve faster in a warmer place Or what type of rock would I want to avoid Limestone why Okay very good very good Alright let s share some of our ideas with the class Info managers table three what did you find If you live in a cold environment there will be less chemical weathering than there is in a warm place Good point if you live in a cooler environment there will be less chemical weathering than in a warm climate Who s gonna be particularly concerned with this What for instance job field is gonna be concerned with this idea Forrest Construction That would be one area what else Statue building Yeah any kind of artist who s designing statues What type of rock would you want to avoid if you re living in a warm area And you know that chemical weathering could be a problem What rock would you avoid Patrick Limestone Limestone Do you guys have some proof for me Somewhere in your data as to why we should avoid limestone Which station Alex Station three Flip to station three for me At station three who can explain to me what the lab was that you did Someone I haven t heard from Colin We put one small piece of chalk into a bottle of vinegar and a small piece of chalk into water and we saw if the acid from the vinegar dissolved the chalk and if the water dissolved the chalk And the chalk didn t dissolve in the water but the acid made it fizz bubble and it was just dissolving And why did we use chalk What is chalk a type of What is chalk a type of Jeremy It s a type of limestone It s a type of limestone So your evidence showed that yes limestone weathers quickly with acid Why is acid a part of our environment How does it become part of our environment Andrea Acid rain Acid rain acid rain Now as we grow up it s important that you re environmental advocates That you fight for protecting our environment What types of things can you do in your lives to cut down on acid rain Give me two ideas on your wipe boards Two ideas Is that polluting our water our air Polluting the air and it s getting into our clouds Very nice very good So air pollution particularly because the air pollution contributes to that formation You are making worst case scenarios You don t have to consider the unthinkable It can happen alright You don t have to consider the impossible So we can unplug outlets when we re not using them We can turn off the water when we brush our teeth What about things in your house Electricity Cut down on your electric bills Remember you burn fossil fuels to make electricity So right now as middle schoolers the easiest thing to do would be to cut down on your electric use Alright I want every table to share one idea Info manager from table one give me one idea One idea is we can help the environment by taking a bus to school instead of like everybody having their own individual cars Good point Or even better you can walk Instead of having that carpool line going on let s take busses Table two give me one idea Save power by changing your lightbulbs to CFLs Yeah use those light bulbs that are like the twirly light bulbs they use a lot less electricity good idea Table three give me one Conserve water by turning off the water when we brush our teeth Now conserving water Think about what the question was How can we be environmental advocates to cut down on acid rain We can cut down on electricity by unplugging outlets Very good Unplug items from the outlets that s good Table four We could use hybrid cars Hybrid cars that s good They burn less fossil fuels good idea Table five Recycle Recycle How would that help acid rain Okay so it s cutting down on factory use that would be a good one Table six Cutting down on electricity Alright cutting down on electricity because to make electricity you have to burn fossil fuels Table seven is there any that haven t been said Carpool to work and school Carpool to work and school I love it You got something to add I was going to say instead of the bottles end up in landfills so you can keep bottles out of landfills if you reuse them Yeah very good A lot of times we focus only on the idea of recycling but it s good to reuse too That s a good idea as well So we talked about how the temperature will affect our chemical weathering We haven t yet talked about how temperature affects mechanical weathering Which lab would answer that question How temperature affects mechanical weathering Station four Alright look at station four Take one minute you don t have to write this one down discuss it What does station four tell you and how is that important in daily life Take one minute And it like ice wedges and then it ll make bigger cracks and then it will do bad stuff for sidewalks What were you supposed to be measuring In centimeters You measured in milimeters but you meant to measure in centimeters So how much was it in centimeters Well if you said it was at 79 which would be right there What centimeters is that at Around 15 Write down 15 Oh wait wait I had it going the wrong way and no one even noticed So if it was at 79 where would it be At 79 the tick mark right below the 80 About 16 About 16 and if it was at 76 where would it be at About 14 and a half Very good Alright let s pick someone at random who s the lucky person Andrew P What did you notice was the difference between the same amount of water when it was frozen and when it was left as a liquid When it was frozen it was taller When it was frozen it was taller What does that mean that it was taller Lucy Well the water was frozen to ice So it expands a little It expands I like the use of that word Water expands as it freezes Here in Louisville how is that a problem And it s been a particularly big problem this winter Ethan Because like the water can get in the cracks in the roads and then when it freezes it will expand and it will crack roads and buildings Soon the people will have the construction people will have to rebuild the roads Right very good point Now that affects us here in Kentucky because we have those cold winters What types of areas would it not affect Forrest Florida Florida areas that don t have freezing that s a good point Now we ve talked about climate as far as temperature goes We ve talked about the warm temperatures and the cold temperatures and how it affects the chemical and mechanical weathering What is the other aspect of climate other than temperatures Other than temperature what is another aspect of climate Patrick How humid it is How humid it is Which lab do you think would tell us how humidity affects weather Flip through Sky Seven Let s look at station seven Now during our labs the materials managers were always in charge of getting the materials ready A material manager Can someone explain to me what s the difference between the steel wool that was covered with a cup versus the steel wool that was not covered with a cup What would that difference be Lucy Well the steel wool that was covered well the steel wool that wasn t covered with the cup it was all like stuck together and it wasn t rusting and the one that was covered with the cup it had like stuff popping out like it wasn t all stuck together and it was rusting Okay so the one that was covered with a cup and moistened had a lot of rust And the one that was moistened but was just left sitting out dried and did not have a lot of rust Would you agree Okay what is the purpose of covering it Why do I cover that Otis Keeping the water from evaporating Yeah it s keeping that water in So is the covered cup a dry environment or a humid environment Humid environment A very humid environment I have a great map here that tells you a little bit about different areas and tells you what their humidity is like I m gonna flip off both lights to help you see it This is a tropical wet area tropical dry area semi arid which means dry arid then marine west coast Mediterranean and humid sub tropical These areas that are marked as humid sub tropical such as down in Florida those areas that are marked as humid what do they have to be cautious about If it s a humid area what do they have to be cautious about Don t see a lot of hands talk about it for one minute What do humid areas have to be cautious about Now think about this an area like Kentucky And our summers aren t just hot they re humid So we have to deal with cold winters which are gonna affect mechanical weathering and we have to deal with Yeah so we re kind of getting the worst end of both scenarios Yes we definitely are Good point Alright I need someone I haven t heard from to share let s see who the random card is Lucy What do you think They have to be careful about rusting like their cars and stuff They have to be careful of rusting Good point Because the more humid the air is the more likely you are to have what Oxidation Now there was another lab where we used steel wool What was the purpose of the other steel wool lab What were you trying to answer what were you trying to determine Jamiel what do you think There was the key word the what kind of water Salt water You look to see if salt water affected the oxidation rate You look to see if salt water did Silently look at your data and tell me did salt water affect the rate of oxidation Jeremy did salt water affect the rate of oxidation Yeah 
 Great job thank you for playing along It s so much nicer to play with live accompaniment than it is recorded Your assignment two weeks be able to play an improvised solo in this key in F concert utilizing the Dorian and Mixolydian scales We ll leave in just a moment just relax Utilizing the Dorian and Mixolydian scales I ll ask you to play live on this Bosaladera I also want you to outside of class find a Latin piece of music it doesn t have to be bossa nova that you can play along with identifying the Dorian and the Mixolydian scale that fits that key Pick a song that you can identify the key and that you feel comfortable playing in that key to bring back and play for us I want a recording here so you re going have to find a mp3 CD DVD something along that you can get to class So you can share this information with each other Questions Time frame is two weeks If you went through this quickly tell your buddy how long you got and what you have to do go That s a great question thank you Yes yes do it in vibes it will be wonderful You can do this it s in F scale it s in F scale is what it is And I saw your results and they were outstanding Very good let s all grab an encore thank you and I will see you tomorrow Keep the rhythm sync Soft As we do our solos here if you would take your pencils and when you hear the soloists play on these notes on the side of this changing I want you to put a mark beside that change where you are Put a count on it Each rotation will be different Sometimes they may play from the middle scale to the middle or the whole thing Wherever you think that happens I will be documenting it over here too All right Today s volunteers are beginning with the vibe player and then we ll just go through the trumpets the trombones and saxes and those others who are assigned to play today Here we go everybody got pencils ready And one one two three four Here we go Rockville On my mark One two ready One two and one two ready play 
 Our is like Crown Crown Royal and like it shows like a helmet and like an ad for it and it says He who wears the crown I think that s like if you wear the helmet you will seem cool Mm hmm and the helmet is for what do you think Motorcycles or cars kind of racing kind of stuff And Crown Royal tobacco or alcohol Alcohol and racing a car Thoughts Drinking and driving Huh Well that s bad But they appeal to your your uh love of racecars and motorcycles and cool stuff but those two don t really mix do they Next group Ours is tobacco and it has a picture of a firefighter and it says A bit braver so it s trying to hook you by you wanting to be braver and trying tobacco So the inference there would be that tobacco makes you braver What do you think Could it really work If I chew tobacco Am I gonna be able to fight a fire No But firefighting appeals to a lot of young children right That bravery that toughness that rugged fireman thing It s like if I do chewing tobacco I m a rugged fireman type Um what are my teeth gonna look like though Yellow Not gonna look like the rugged fireman type am I Fireman sounds like he smiles is that what you said All right um ladies Um ours was alcohol and um they got our attention by like the grandma and the daughter playing patty cake and telling stories about her So grandma and daughter and granddaughter playing patty cake lovely little sunny porch sponsored by Budweiser Oh my Oh that s so popular So drink You re appealing to the family nature And the message is drink our drink Yeah it says that like all stories weren t about family they also had some other stuff Family and Budweiser Yeah No Yeah you re getting it now All right Ladies Um ours is um There s isn t really an ad There s is a display at a grocery store Yeah like there is um a whole bunch of like alcohol in the background and up closer there s tobacco and then there s a bunch a candy bars that should appeal to the little kids Right next to the The tobacco Tobacco okay Candy bars Like right there and then um also you have pretty much the candy Alcohol behind the booth tobacco right up front and candy bars right at hand level Kids would probably think that tobacco s candy They might Or as good as candy Does tobacco come in flavors like candy does Yeah No Yes it does Oh Mint berry apple Ew really Really Hey I think I missed a group Did I miss a group This one up front Nope Did I get you guys already Did you guys share Oh you did share just with me Share with the rest of the group It s Ours is alcohol and like if you re a rockstar you ll drink like if you drink this then you will become a rockstar What hook did they use The girls in bikinis So how many guys are in that picture One One guy and he s the one who s drinking the alcohol and Fifteen girls Fifteen girls in bikinis So if the message is if you drink this You ll get hot girls You ll get hot girls yeah All right you ve had a chance to let Oh sorry Eyes Ears Mouth Thanks You ve had a chance to look at these ads Um you ve got a chance to see how they re trying to hook you in You re knowing that the messages that they re sending are slightly warped It s their trick to pull you in but it s your job to think and process through using your critical thinking skills Weigh it out Consider but then choose something else that s healthier So we ve looked at negative influences It s time to talk about positive influences in your life things that can help you say no to all of that no matter how appealing it is no matter how many girls in bikinis show up Leave your cards right where they are in the center It s time to take a look at the charts that are around the room There are five of them These are activities you can do instead of things like using drugs alcohol tobacco like a social activity um something you can do with someone else Ideas Have a sleepover Sleepover good All right so in just a few minutes we re gonna be rotating around the charts with different groupings We re gonna be writing down our ideas of other positive things instead of this Can anyone name one physical activity something you can do that would be instead of using drugs a positive thing Football Yeah Did you want to share too Go ahead Um riding your bike around the block Good You re on the right track guys Keep those ideas in your head When you get to the chart you ll have to write it down What s something you can do with your brain a mental activity that would be positive Chess Chess I like chess Math Not for everybody I understand Um this chart over here says Emotional What s something you can do um that can make your emotions feel better your passions or whatever How can you support yourself emotionally so you can say no to this Trying to think happy Yep Positive thoughts Watching emotional movies Definitely gets your mind off those I know you got great ideas and I m gonna be willing to see those on those papers in just a few minutes so save them in your head Okay The last one is spiritual Spiritual Somehow you can nurture your spirit so you have the ability to say no to negative influences Go to church Church All right Save it You ll get a chance Time to look at your pencils again Leave your papers right where they are okay Face up This time we re gonna go by color and you might notice that there are markers at each station for the right color So when you get to the station if you are patience I promise I ll explain it No worries When you get to your station we re gonna start with your bag of colors You will take your bag of colors and your marker and you will only use your color marker So if you are a green guy you would grab a green marker and you will be writing at this station first You ll write down however many ideas you want You ll talk it out with your group You might notice Mitchell that I also put group work uh reminders up here about how to work with others in your group One everybody has the right to speak so make sure you give everybody a chance to talk it out if they need to and to write it down the topic Don t interrupt Give everybody a chance to share their side Two everybody has the right to be respected We re not looking for put downs We re looking for ones that can encourage us positive things so when you re getting ready to write positive things speak positively to each other as well And three everyone has to agree to work together to solve a conflict So if you re having a difficulty in your group talk it out Work together to solve that problem If it s not working and you can t solve the problem who can you turn to for help You Me And others in your group So if you re a green person you re gonna get one green marker and there are multiple in here in case your marker doesn t work Get a different one Write down whatever ideas you want When you hear me say Switch or Rotate you move to the next chart around like the face of a clock Take your marker with you So there ll be multiple colors on here You ll get a chance to write on every one Yes How does this work Are you supposed to write it down like a list You can write all over that paper Yeah Anywhere as long as we re on the front Everywhere all over that paper so you can all be on there at the same time as you want you can take turns you can arrange however you and your group want to You each can have a marker though There s plenty of them for everyone Yellow s are over here at Emotional um I believe blue s are Social purple s are Physical and oranges are Mental Questions before we begin Think about something to do besides You ll have approximately 30 seconds to a minute so listen for me to say Switch Keep writing until I say it Go Here How about we take this and put it on the floor Does that work better I know it s going everywhere isn t it Here you go You guys want to take that one down too put it on the floor so it s a little easier to write on Yeah Good I know isn t it cool Yeah So I see you got chess on there Anyone think of some other ones Other mental ways to use your brain things you can think about it Think of school kind of activities things related to learning using the brain Spelling You can practice your spelling You can do your math I think you guys are in right place You have a lot of good ideas Tell me your favorite one so far Give him a spot Good How do you spell baseball Oh online

 Megan what quadrant am I going to be centered in Quadrant four Good okay so I m gonna go to the right six and down five I know my radius is three root seven Now this may be a little difficult for you because three root seven is kind of a hard number to wrap your mind around Any thoughts on how we can tell which quadrants this goes into I want to know if it goes into quadrant one first Twink what could we do Do you un simplify it so when it gets through the center it d be like square root of 63 and then you like have so it s in between eight nine or I know it s in between seven and eight Okay did you guys follow her on that Yeah Yeah okay so Twink knows that this decimal is going to be between seven and eight because she knows it s the square root of 63 And the square root of 64 is eight So it s just below eight All right So you may be able to picture a decimal in your mind close to eight but not quite so we re armed with that knowledge true or false this circle goes into quadrant one Melissa Agree No Ben Yes it does go into quadrant one Do you have anything to back that up Yeah because it only the center point is down six and if we go up one more than that at least James It s down five and since it s more than seven it s gotta be at least past the two There were a lot of pronouns there What James was saying is we re five units below the x axis the radius is seven point something units long so we re going to top out right around there There s the top of our circle okay Let s speed up this process a little bit here The is it going to go into quadrant three Yes Why Abby Simpson Because it s over six and yeah you count seven the other way Okay Or a little over seven So we re going to be there Oh and now for the great dilemma will this circle go into quadrant two Robert what am I going to have to resort to The distance formula I can t hear you The distance formula Okay give me some more pairs to plug into this formula William Zero sorry zero minus six squared and then zero plus five squared All right Now what is the square root of 61 in simplified radical form Rue Is it just square root of 61 Good maybe that was a trick question Maybe not it s not going to break down any further because 61 is what type of number again Prime Prime okay so we ve got square root of 61 Robert you told me to use distance formula I used distance formula I followed your orders to the T I still don t know if this goes into quadrant two or not It does not The circle doesn t make it to quadrant two No So you re saying it does this Yes Prove it Well if you actually put I don t know Call on someone else please Maddie Since you know that your radius is the square root of 63 and that s a larger number than the square root of 61 it therefore passes the origin and it goes into the opposite quadrant or quadrant two in this case So you re saying it goes like that Correct Is that good enough for your piece of mind The radius is longer than it needs to be to reach And therefore yeah you re right Moral of the story The circle goes through all four quadrants So far we ve kind of been in been there done that land and so now I m going to take you into some new stuff right now The x and y intercepts First the x intercepts of this graph How am I going to find where this circle collides with the x axis Let me ask an intermediate question what do you know about every x intercept in the universe They all have something in common Abby All of their lines like the y equals zero What I m sorry Okay all like the y s equal zero like the y Which variable Y Equals Zero One more time Y equals zero Okay does that makes sense to you guys Yeah Because if you do go up or down to plot your ordered pair I ve got bad news for you you re not on the x axis any more Thus it s not an x intercept All right just one more time Abby I forgot what you had said earlier Y equals zero Okay so how am I going to find my x intercepts here Twink I have a question does it like the circle cross over x like the x axis twice Well we ll find out if it does I mean sometimes doesn t it Yeah So what do you do if it does So this is the first time in your math careers where you might have two x intercepts Colliding once and coming back down and colliding again with the x axis that s good instincts And I ll just warn you right now yeah we re going to have two x intercepts here Maddie how are we going to find these two We use the formula of a circle and we plug in for y zero Okay so let s get the equation up here because I forgot to write it earlier Josh Ah I don t remember Ella May X squared X squared plus or minus six Or no x minus six Okay Squared plus y Plus five Squared equals 63 Okay Maddie now we have our equation and you said to do what to it Since you know you have when you re looking for an x intercept you re always going to have zero for your y Oh Abby told us that Yeah you have your y in that formula equal zero Literally literally Well we ve got to see what x is Ben Well I know but that s it Does it make sense to you Yeah It isn t that hard of a concept and that s why I had Abby repeat it eight times If you get that y literally has to be zero you understand why you literally make y zero and then solve for x We re finding here s one of the ordered pairs right here that we re searching for and I ll be darned if the y is gonna be zero The question is what s the x All right so I ve got x minus six squared Plus I m just going to write five squared equals 63 So according to my calculations we have that right there Mason You forgot that middle term It should be minus 12 x Yeah or something like that You forgot the middle term You forgot like the something x Yeah it d be x squared minus 12 x and then plus 36 Oh so I need to square both those terms Yes no wait what d you say I just wanted to square the x and square the negative six No you didn t you wanted to square the whole thing Okay which means we utilize what process in math What s that called again Twink Foil Foil we had forgotten our oi Ben Where did we get 12 x from Vanessa We squared x minus six so we used factoring We did x minus Now do you see where we get it from Ben Okay thank you Ben What to do with the 63 what to do what to do Mason Do you just combine like subtract 63 from both sides combine all the like terms of the whole numbers and then you have a quadratic equation Okay Well now I have a quadratic trinomial and it s arranged in what What do we call that Kate Ellie Descending order Mm hm Nice so let s try and factor that Michelle you re shaking your head like no way It doesn t work Well all right then I guess we re stuck That s so stupid Don t we have to do the quadratic formula Yes if only I could remember that though It s been such a long time Sing the song You tell me the song I ll actually write the line pertinent to this problem what s the first line Keep going Plus or minus the root of b squared minus 4 a c all over 2a Okay I m going to do some of the math for you and then I m going to have you do some of the math for me because I m more interested in seeing that you can do this So I get 12 plus or minus the square root of 152 over two Now normally normally I would have you guys simplify that and give me exact answers But it s hard on a graph for you guys to see where something like 12 plus root 152 is I mean that s kind of an abstract So we re actually I m going to let you do decimals here So here s what I want to do Kevin s row through Sarah s row I want you guys to find the plus branch so you do plus You two rows find the minus As soon as you get an answer real quietly and quickly check with a neighbor and make sure we have confirmation Let s go to the nearest hundredth Okay if you ve got an answer that corresponds to what your neighbor got regroup Regroup Ellie If you ve got the same answer as your neighbor raise your hand right now over here So Melissa what was the value of x you got 12 2 12 2 what is it to the nearest hundredth Oh 12 16 12 16 All right that sounds about right And then over here my branch with the negative sine in there Ellie Negative 0 16 Okay now let s not lose sight of big picture here Context what the heck s going on Why have we been trying to chase down x and why are we getting two different answers And which one is right and which one s extraneous Help me make sense of all this now that the procedure is done Michelle Neither of them are extraneous because the circle hits the x axis at two points So what are my two x intercepts 12 16 and negative 16 In ordered pair form 12 16 zero and negative 16 zero There s that one right there makes sense And then the 12 16 zero hopefully you have room on your paper I don t have room on the board for that Should be somewhere over here It s a good pit stop moment right here Pull off to the side of the road Stop for a second are you sure this makes sense to you 
 A lot of people thought the mass of the water in the bag would be less than the mass of the ice cubes in the bag How many people One two just three of you Okay Cameron do you want to start us off with your reason why Because the cause you can put water in a water bottle to put in the freezer then that water bottle will like explode because it has so much ice in it Okay So because the water when it freezes expands then therefore you re saying it has more mass Yeah When it s frozen Yes But when it melts it doesn t take up so much space so it has less mass Yes Okay Michael Do you or are you on the same idea as far as more as far as thinking there s less Was your reason the same as his or do you have a different reason why it s going to be less Mine was the same Same idea Yeah Okay Hannah you got a thought or something Well isn t it like the same Isn t it like the same thing because it s the same thing It s just expanding but it s going to have the same mass When you re saying it s the same thing what do you mean by the same thing Like if you have water in a water bottle like it does expand or whatever but it still has the same amount of water so it still has the same mass Okay so Hannah s saying it doesn t matter that it expands It s still the same amount of stuff and therefore it should still have the same amount of mass Is that correct Kay Houston idea on that Well about the water bottle thing it would be opposite to this cause when you start with water it takes up the entire bottle But the bag the ice is the one taking up the minimum space of when it freezes an entire bag So it wouldn t So are you saying if we let the ice cubes melt are you saying the mass is going to go up It s going to increase Yeah Okay Colby I d say that when a solid turns into a liquid its form changes but not its mass Okay so kind of the same idea as Hannah Only you re talking about the actual forms then It can change form without changing mass Hannah says it s okay to expand because it s still the same amount of stuff Okay Michael s got another thing thing to talk about Well when you put like the water in the bottle and then you like freeze it then you unfreeze it then there s less water than what you started with and it probably would change the mass Why is it so you re saying the amount of water you put in first before you freeze it is more than the amount of water after you thaw it back out Yeah Do you have a reason why that might be Well no it s just Okay any other ideas on this one Okay how many people thought the mass would increase then How many people said the mass would increase A couple of you Jared why don t you tell us why you think the mass would increase I thought the mass would increase because water weighs more than ice Like if you pick up a bottle of water that s frozen it doesn t weigh as much as a bottle of water with water in it Okay So Jared says that water weighs more than ice Correct Anybody else have a different idea Anna Well because ice floats on water so that means it has less mass so if it thawed back out then it d weigh more Okay So Anna s using the example that she s seen ice floating on water therefore she s saying the ice must have less mass than water Correct Is that what your e saying Mm hmm Colby you got something to say about that I have something to say about that It will stay the same going off of what she s saying Oh going off of what she s saying Okay go ahead then Ice is pretty much the same as it s water it s frozen water so it still has the same density as water it s just colder So if it s colder it floats Ice because it s cold it floats in the water So you re saying the floating of ice has nothing to do with its density or its mass it has to do with its temperature Kay Houston Well I think the only reason ice floats is because an ice would weigh less because ice isn t completely full There s some air in there Okay So Houston s saying there s some air trapped in there that was not in the water beforehand Okay Anybody else Anybody want to have any other arguments about why the mass should stay the Oh sorry Anna Oh okay I disagree with Colby how he said that it floats because it s cold when heat rises and so if it s cold wouldn t it sink if it had to do with the temperature Okay so Anna s saying that heat rises and cold sinks so you don t think it has to do with temperature Yeah Okay Colby response to that or are you Well in water it works differently Warm water actually sinks more to the bottom actually and cold water s more on the top Alright So if you put cold in ice it will float above Okay Oh I have some hands up now Michael Well when you re in the lake for example the warm part s on top and the deeper you go the colder it gets because heat rises So you re using your experience in swimming or something in a lake Yeah It s colder the deeper you go warmer towards the surface you re saying Yeah so the ice cube must have oxygen in it because when we hold our breath we float up Okay When we have no air we go down Okay so you re saying an ice cube has air trapped in it that s what s causing it to float Is that what you re saying And Hannah were you gonna agree with her as far as the lake water temperature thing Yeah so when you put your sweater or something in the water it s like the top is usually more warm colder Okay Alright Now people who think the mass is going to stay the same Who are those people Who thinks the mass will stay the same Gavin why don t you give us the reason why you think it s going to stay the same I think it s going to stay the same because nothing s lost when it melts Nothing goes away It s still the same thing He s saying it s going to stay the same because nothing is lost When it melts it doesn t get lost Okay Anybody else who says it s going to stay the same have something to add Gabe I said that Just talk louder I said that it ll stay the same because there s still the same amount of water melted or frozen and even if it s in a bag if it melts and tries to break down into gas then it s still in the bag so it won t go anywhere So Gabe s saying that it doesn t matter if it s frozen as an ice cube if it s melted as water or even he s even going as far as saying that even if the water liquid starts turning into a gas it s still going to be the same because nothing s leaving the bag Is that what you re saying He s going even a step further he didn t even mention anything about turning into a gas but he s saying even if it does that it s still not going to change Right Houston Well I disagree with that because if you take a frozen lake the ice is only on top it doesn t freeze all the water Okay Hannah I agree with what he said Even if there s air bubbles in the ice then after it melts the air bubbles it s still in the bag It s still concealed in the bag So sounds like the people who are for it staying it s the same are really sticking with the fact that everything s in the bag Nothing s out of the bag or leaving or coming in and then the people who are thinking it s going to increase or decrease have a lot of ideas about ice having more mass than water as a solid and then some of that s through the temperature Michael one more before we move on About how it all stays in the bag well when you melt water it sweats So wouldn t it lose some of that So are you saying some of the moisture s going to be on the outside of the bag Like comes off the bag If you have it on the table then it comes onto the table Like how it has a Okay so here s my question to you then That water that s on the outside of the bag that you re talking about You were saying that water came from the inside of the bag Well it sweats from the the compression of the temperature So you re saying that s what s causing the mass to go up then Wouldn t that cause the mass to go down Okay so that s my question to you then is where was that water on the outside coming from Inside How is it getting to the outside I don t know Some scientific theory Okay Does anybody agree with her idea that some of the water from the inside might be getting to the outside Yeah Do any of you guys have an idea of how that might be happening to help her out James how do you think that water might be getting to the outside The moist is like when it What s it called Wait a minute The carbonate the condensation it like seeps out like the air it seeps out So somehow you re thinking it s seeping through the bag Colby I know how that happens actually Because the water in the air will stick to the bag because it s colder So it ll stick there and just condense there so it ll look like it s It s just water from the air So you re saying the water that forms on the outside is not coming from the inside It s coming from the outside which is different than what they re saying Cameron did you have any other ideas how it might be getting out there Kay Alright So we got some different ideas on that one Let s move on now to our alka seltzer problem This time last one we started with people who thought the mass would decrease Let s start with the people who think the mass will increase So people who think the mass is going to increase with the alka seltzer Who are those people Alright We re going to have Kyle start us off on this one What s your reason why Kyle Well when the tablet dissolves I think after dissolving water will rise and make more Make more water Yeah Okay So Kyle thinks the reaction is going to create more water and therefore more mass Sam different idea than that for why the mass is going to increase Okay so you re thinking it s going to increase because you re adding something to the water Colby I think it s going to increase because the alka seltzer tablet will release gases which will increase the weight of the bottle inside Okay so the gases that is going to be created from the reaction are going to add to the mass Jake you had your hand up for the mass increasing correct Do you have a different reason why it s going to do that So basically saying the same thing as Colby More gases Hannah Aren t the gases from the water in the alka seltzer aren t they going to just stay the same Good question So what you re saying then is if the gases are coming from the alka selzter tablet in water so what are you saying the mass will do I think it s going to stay the same Actually it ll decrease It ll decrease Okay why do you think it s going to decrease I don t know Okay Who could come up with the reason as to why it might decrease Cameron Why is it going to decrease Because the acid from the from the from the tablet the acid from the tablet is going to release gases and the water will go out of the beaker How is the water going to get out of the beaker Because the tablet will react with water and the gases will float away But isn t there a lid on top Maybe the lid will pop off or something Let s assume the lid is does not pop off Let s assume I have it on there tight enough that it s not going to pop off Then since air is lighter than water then that means that the air that means the mass will decrease because the water will be like not as much and there will be more gas in the container So Correct me if I m wrong So you re saying that assuming the top stays on it s still going to decrease That s the decrease right Because the solid and liquid are going to turn into Gas Gas and gas is lighter than solids and liquids Is that correct What you re saying Yeah Alright Jared has something to say about that I think that the mass will decrease because the tablet will disintegrate and that mass part will be decrease Okay so he s saying that the tablet disappears then the mass will go down That piece that the tablet s bringing to the table for mass is not going to be there anymore Kevin what are you thinking Pretty much the same thing that the tablet s going to dissolve into the water And so mass will go down Yeah Okay Who thinks the mass is going to stay the same It s not going to change Who thinks it will stay the same Why don t you tell us why it s going to stay the same I think it s going to stay the same because the water the alka seltzer piece is a water it s just in a different form But everything is still Okay So you re saying because nothing s going away it s still going to be the same It s just in a different form So kind of like what some people were saying about ice in the water Gabe do you have a different reason than that No it was a lot like hers It was the same as hers pretty much Yeah Okay Anybody got anything else they want to input on the alka seltzer one Why it might go up down or stay the same before we move on Gavin I said it would probably go down because if you have a bunch of gas in a bottle it ll probably weigh a lot less than a cup full of water like the same amount Okay so you re going again with the idea that gas has less mass than the water and the tablet And since we re turning them into gases the mass will go down James I said since the tablet is gonna be kind of shrinked once it mixes with the water it ll stand making it a lot more liquidy and bigger and then the mass will get higher The mass will increase because it ll produce the Alright Let s go to burning paper Alright Burning paper Let s start with the people this time let s start with the people who think the mass will stay the same People who think the mass still stay the same Colby s the only one Morgan Gabe Not very many Jasmine Morgan why don t you start us off for why you think it s going to stay the same I said the mass will stay the same because the air and everything else is still in the jar and it s not going anywhere Okay she says it stays the same because everything is still in the jar not going anywhere Jasmine you had your hand up Do you think the same thing as her or do you have a different reason for why it would stay the same I agree with her You agree with what she said Colby Burning stuff does not add It s still the object but it s more spread apart Okay so the mass stays the same you said It s just we re going to take up more space with it Okay Michael No Yes I was stretching Hannah I disagree with that because it when it burns I don t know if that s the word for it but how it s causing it all when you burn wood in a fire eventually all that will turn into ashes so I don t think it has the same mass or anything Okay James you got some more on that When that paper burns it ll turn into charcoal which basically is lighter than paper and then that ll make it so mass will be decreased Okay so given the idea that we re taking the solid things and we re changing them into maybe non solids so either liquids or liquid acids they re not gonna have as much mass as those Edward what do you think Do you think this mass will go up down or stay the same I think it will decrease Decrease Yeah And what s your reason for that Cause when the paper burns it turns into a gas so some of it and then gas is has less mass than solid objects Okay so again back to that gas is less mass than solid objects Kayla what do you think Increase Decrease Or stay the same I thought it would decrease like what Hannah It ll disintegrate Okay So as a quick vote how many people thought on this one oh sorry Kevin go ahead Also I think it s gonna decrease because the paper s gonna burn and incinerate but also the match when you light the match it s gonna burn too Okay Some of you maybe forgot about the match I haven t heard you mention it until just now so that not only is the paper gonna burn up but so will at least part of the match Okay cause it s burning too alright A quick vote How many people on this one said the mass would go down would decrease And how many said it would increase And how many said it d stay the same So the majority of you are on the decrease side on this Okay here s my next question We ve now heard what a bunch of people had to say about each different situation One if it would increase or decrease or stay the same My question to you now is that after listening to all the people throw ideas out there has anybody changed their mind on any of these In other words like maybe for the ice in the water one I was thinking it was going to increase but after listening to every one now I think it s gonna decrease 
 That s a start ok Devon and Sasha 3 1 3 what are the classifications Natural No not natural Rational Yes rational Real Yes Ok it s rational and it s real Now Brian you had first said natural Yeah I kinda because a fraction isn t natural Ok right a fraction is not natural Who else can tell us something about natural numbers then What do we know about our natural numbers They re the counting numbers Yeah Ok counting numbers what do we mean by that the counting numbers Numbers that you count with Like one two three Ok our natural numbers are our counting numbers So 3 1 3 again was just a Rational Rational and a Real Ok very good somebody else Ok go ahead Natalie Square root of 19 What are the classifications Rational Hold on one second thank you Can you show us your number So the square root of 19 Ok Irrational It s irrational I decided It s irrational Cause it s the square root of a nonperfect number Nonperfect square Nonperfect square Ok so Sasha and Christina both agree that it s irrational and Christina what else did you say I m not sure if they heard It s a nonperfect square Ok it s not a perfect square And it s also real Ok it is irrational and we wanna remember that an irrational number is also a real number even though it doesn t end or repeat How did you know without using your calculator that the square root of 19 was an irrational number It doesn t make a perfect square Ok and how do you know it doesn t make a perfect square Because I have no idea If you multiply two numbers you don t get it Ok very good that s exactly right You actually can multiply two numbers to get 19 It s just a decimal or Yeah it s an irrational decimal It s an irrational decimal ok So you can multiply and we looked at an example of that we did a little activity with the square root of 19 Is it gonna be two whole numbers that you could multiply to get 19 Mm mmm And that s what makes it irrational Compared with if you did like the square root of 16 what two numbers can you multiply to get Four and four Four and four ok good Ok how bout another number Go ahead The classifications of 1 3 Rational and real Ok rational real Anyone wanna throw in anything else about 1 3 Mm hmm The greater the decimal it s repeating Right it s a repeating decimal It doesn t end but it does repeat Ok so if it were If it was you could get a rational number Right and that makes it a rational number very good Ok we looked at several numbers How about someone ask a question Someone wanna throw in a question Ok go ahead Scotty What integers are also whole numbers Ok what integers and let s make sure everybody s having the opportunity to answer questions Repeat that again What integers are also whole numbers Ok so what integers are also whole numbers Two can be a whole and an integer Ok what did you say first Two Ok two is an example it can be an integer and a whole number Positive numbers Positive numbers Ok our positive numbers Negative numbers could be too Can negative numbers be whole numbers though No No It can zero Ok zero Positive numbers Ok who remembers what example did I give you when we re thinking about whole numbers Pets What can help you think about whole numbers Pets Ok Sasha says pets Who can elaborate on what that means The number of pets you have Count the number of pets you have And then we asked for a number or something They wouldn t say like I have 3 4 of a dog or something Ok so if you d ask somebody how many pets they have their answers are always gonna be what A whole number A whole number which and what are our whole numbers Zero one Zero to infinity Zero through all the way Ok mm hmm Zero and all Alright good Good question Scotty Let s have another question Go ahead Luke Is a negative number rational or irrational Ok turn that around so we can see So is a negative number can it be classified as rational or irrational It would be a rational number No A negative number is a rational number It would be both Yeah It would be both If you have the square root of a negative number It s an integer Take the square root of a negative number An integer is always rational so An integer is rational And a negative number is a is rational But his question let s see that again Is a negative number so it could be rational Can we have a negative number that s irrational Can somebody give me an example of that Negative pi Ok negative pi mm hmm The negative square root of two Ok the negative square root of a number Would the negative have to be on the outside or the inside of the pi Outside The pi I mean outside the square root sign So Luke can you conclude us what was your answer to that question Sometimes both Ok it can be both Mm hmm good Alright good question too What about another number What s another number Madison go ahead The square root of 144 Ok the square root of 144 who can give us the different classifications Real Ok Damian says real Natural Natural Whole Whole Integer Yeah Integer Any others Rational Ok it s rational Do you agree Madison Yes Ok very good So we looked at when that s if we look at our graphic organizer when it starts here with natural we read this going out that it has all those different classifications Good Ok how about another number Go ahead Amy What is the difference between these two numbers The negative square root of nine and the square root of negative nine Ok I like that question So what s the difference between those two So on the first example we see the negative on the outside of the square root sign and then we see it on the inside One s real and one s not Ok Damian says one s real and one s not When it s in the inside it s not real Because you can t take the square root of a negative number Exactly we cannot take the square root of a negative number So when we see it on the inside there s not a solution to it What about when it s on the outside You can take the square root of it and just add the negative sign Ok so what would that answer be negative square root of nine Negative three Right negative three Let s talk a little bit more in depth about when that negative is inside the square root why do we not have a solution to that So it was a square root of negative nine Because you can t multiply two numbers to get a negative Right exactly So if we had like the square root of nine what two numbers can we multiply to give us Three Oh nine three and three Three and three and remember how we talked about what is the inverse of taking the square root of a number Squaring it Mm hmm So there s not two numbers we can multiply to give us that negative nine good Alright let s have another number Go ahead Brock Ok 3 14 pi I m glad you showed that number 3 14 That is not pi It s rational and real It s irrational No it s rational It s not rational because it never ends or repeats It is rational Yeah but 3 14 ends Yes it ends It s 3 14 not pi That s not pi Pi doesn t end That one ends pi doesn t end Ok so are we all in agreement that the number pi is an irrational number that doesn t end or repeat Yes But what is Brock s number 3 14 3 14 so that number 3 14 Ends It ends So what are the classifications for that number Rational and real It s rational and real Now when we re working problems like area or circumference of a circle why do we use 3 14 Because it s easier Because it s easier Right could we use a whole number for pi to do a calculation No No way it s gonna end Right it would never end So when we re doing our calculations we use that 3 14 But Brock I m glad you had that number so you know there s that difference Pi doesn t end but just 3 14 does end Mm hmm Square root of negative 41 Ok can you show everyone your number So the square root of negative 41 Not real Ok not a real number But if it was real then and they were on the outside then it d be irrational wouldn t it Ok and why would that be irrational the square root of 41 Mm hmm no two numbers that can multiply Not the same two whole numbers Let me ask you a question about the square root of 41 What if your neighbor came and said I d like for you to help me make a fenced in area for my dog and I want it to be a square and I want the area to be 41 How would you maybe respond to your neighbor Make it 49 Ok Cause it wouldn t be a square It wouldn t be a perfect square If it was 41 Ok so you what did you say Damian To make it like 41 so you could have a seven by or 49 so you could have seven by seven Ok good Or make it a six by six 36 Ok I would tell him to make it way bigger because a dog needs a lot of space No that wouldn t actually be a very big area would it No that would be small Unless maybe it was a small dog Yes A really small dog like a teacup chihuahua Ok how about another question Oh Ok Are repeating decimals ever fractions No Yes 1 3 So you could have a repeating decimal as a fraction Yeah 1 3 Ok 2 6 It s a bunch of threes Yes Ok 1 3 definitely that was the number Damian had a bunch of threes And you said now two what about 2 6 It s repeating also Ok cause that will reduce back to what 1 3 1 3 ok Alright how about another number Ethan Square root of two Alright I don t know if you can see that but the square root of two What if you try to take the square root of two It s irrational Irrational Ok it s an irrational number but it s also a Real Real number good alright Another number that we can look at Maybe someone who s not answered Down here Nicole Five divided by zero Oh that s a good one we ve not had that How about five divided by zero It s not real That s not real Ok not a real number again Can we go a little bit further Why is that not a real number Because there s no longer a number you can multiply by it s zero Anything divided by zero is not a real number Ok I had several of you talking and I do want to hear everyone What did you say Natalie It s undefined Ok we do say that s undefined Michael could you add to that You can t divide anything by zero Ok you can t divide anything by zero And if you look on the overhead if I were to write that out and put five inside as our dividend and zero as our divisor is there a number I can multiply by zero to get five No cause anything times zero is zero So that makes it undefined Ok very good Ok another number Ooh Ooh Ok Cliff go ahead and then Brock you had your hand raised I ll come back to you The square root of 53 Ok hold that up so everyone can see Ok we have the square root of 53 Classifications for square root of 53 Irrational Irrational and Real And real very good Ok Brock how about your number Ok the square root of a prime number is always what Ok Brock s given us a question Can you repeat that again The square root of a prime number is always what Oh that s a very good question Irrational Ok so if it s a prime number and you re trying to take the square root it s always irrational Ethan you said irrational can you expand on that I said the square root of a prime number will always be irrational because you cannot make a square out of a prime number you have to have two for it to be a perfect square You have to have two numbers prime numbers and you have one and the number itself Ok only those two factors right Ok very good Ok maybe another question Mm hmm Is a repeating decimal rational or irrational So if it s a repeating decimal Rational Rational Yes Ok very good how about another question that we could discuss Madison True or false a terminating decimal means the decimal repeats It s false Ok it s false What does that mean Mariah if it s terminating It So if it terminates it It ends It ends right exactly Ok how about another number Anyone an example we ve not had many with integers I see you How about one with a negative number Anybody have one with a negative number Brian you do Ok I have the square root of negative 225 Not real Ok not real again why is that not a real number Because it s negative The decimal s inside Ok well not the decimal is inside but the Negative The negative s inside I wanna throw a number out How about negative 4 5 For the number negative 4 5 Rational Yeah rational Ok it s a rational number and it is a Real number Is it a negative number Yes No Yeah No Hmmm So negative 4 5 Wouldn t that be considered an integer No Because it s not a whole or a natural number Ok very good What do we know we haven t talked too much about integers What do we know about our integers How do we classify an integer That it s whole numbers and their opposites Ok whole numbers and their opposites And we used our number line in class Do we have any fractions or decimals on our number line No So what numbers are not considered integers Decimals Decimals and Fractions Ok so if they have that negative sign in front of them then what do we call em If they re not integers 
 Well let s say about like a plane A plane can use the wing to like slice right through the the wind making it just fly with ease but let s say the wing was vertical and then it would just be working like a parachute and just stop its fall Okay did everybody hear what he said No Daniel did you understand what Jonathan was saying Yeah Okay so does that make sense to you then Daniel Yeah Okay John About the thing the last part did he say vertical Yeah like like like vertical like pointing upwards Oh Okay What do you think Reese what do you think Um what Jonathan said Jonathan would you kind of say it again Reese would really like to pay attention and he d like to hear Yeah I m saying like like a wing it uses like like like a V shape of a duck of a duck squad Like every single wing goes down each part and then it s just like a V Okay Shayla Um I said they fly because the air pressure in the wings gives it stability to keep stable and make sure it doesn t fall onto the ground Okay Kelsey Um I think that if the aerospace vehicle was in space then I think it would just float in space because there s no gravity Okay we re kind of yeah Ramaji Okay I m kind of lost Ramaji is lost let s help her find herself No that s a good thing Because I ll be honest I m a little lost So tell me where you are Like I thought we were supposed to put like why we think they were built not how they were built like like I wrote um I think aerospace vehicles fly to improve society and help and new aerospace technology helps build modern things Okay Can everybody understand where Ramaji went with her answers Kelsey I m totally lost now Okay here s what happened okay so let me see if we can find this a different direction Um in reading all your different sentences most of us had a purpose for aerospace vehicles flying okay or some of you wrote that they fly both in space and in the air okay and so we re not kind of getting where I want to get to So can I for a second kind of change the discussion Just because Yes John Is it like when you take a rocket like on the rocket it has uh two wings and like one tail Great so his question that he asked does a rocket have two wings and a tail Um here s what s happening Mm I thought the vehicles would help you and what I m seeing is having the vehicles is making you try to figure out what it is about how this vehicle was made And I m not as concerned about how this vehicle is made okay as I am the science behind how it flies and why we design it that way does that make sense Yes Okay so can we go a different way with me for a minute Each of you has a picture of a hot air balloon on your table correct Okay I know I took yours Reese which is why you don t have one now I need to know something okay This vehicle doesn t have an engine okay Okay Now I want you to think about this for a minute and I want you to discuss it at your table before we talk whole group I want to know how does this hot air balloon fly how does it get in the air and how does it stay in the air And is it possible you don t know anything about this Possibly Possibly It is possible okay it is possible Joelle you don t know anything about this okay So I want your table group to share what you know for a couple of minutes about a hot air balloon and how it flies okay And I m gonna come around and talk to different groups okay So how does this hot air balloon fly Okay so you two start the discussion at this table So discuss that because some of us did have a good concept and some of us don t okay So share in your group Okay what do you two know Okay Has an engine a propulsion engine Okay but is that an engine Okay so now you can do your discussion What did you come up with over here So the fire blows hot air into the balloon Okay without it it would do what It would fall down okay Okay So any idea why the hot air makes the balloon rise What do you think Okay okay Ooh that was awesome You are so good today Um I think we re now getting somewhere So let s talk about this hot air balloon for a minute okay So I ve heard some different things around the classroom I want to know how does that balloon get into the air Nathan The fire in the hot air balloon blows the the balloon up to where it can float down Okay Shayla do you agree or disagree I agree with that because yeah because you pull on a cord and like it lights up the fire and stuff and then the fire pulls in air and it like shoots it up with the fire So is the fire being shot into the hot air balloon No air is What kind of air Hot air Hot air is being shot up into this part Okay John Didn t they say one of those like if you compare They can t Jonathan can t hear you Oh sorry If you compare a hot air balloon and a balloon they re you use hot air for the air balloon and you use the helium for a small balloon yeah and the it s not really air kind of I thought it was steam Okay okay Now why would you think it was steam Because you know how when you just um when you put like a fire fire in one place it sometimes can turn into steam Maybe The fire turns into steam No not the fire but like when it s when it s done Ann Maria says she thinks you need the word water Yeah because when you heat up water then steam comes up out of it Because steam is like moisture Steam is like moisture that s In the air In the air okay Ramaji I agree with you John Okay I think what he s saying is because in air and the fire is there or whatever and so then when they re getting pushed up that comes and like then I m lost here Okay like then the steam like yeah you were right about the moisture part but it but there is no way that like water is in this There isn t water in there Yeah I mean Reese be supportive I mean there s moisture in the air but still like fire is a big part of it Okay can I ask a question Okay Do I need water in order for the hot air balloon to fly No no you don t Ramaji says no Laura says no I said no Mariah says no Kelsey I m totally lost Kelsey it s okay to be lost okay Kelsey you re if you re lost you need to know where you are So here s the question what do you feel like you know and understand about what s been discussed so far I thought I was understanding everything until John said I m so confused right now So tell me John was talking about steam John was talking about steam I would agree Kevin John was talking about steam So the question is prior to that Kelsey okay prior to that what would be your understanding of how the hot air balloon flies Basically nothing before that I just think it s steam because of like hot and air because or like there would be like a fire inside of the air and then it would be steamy Okay let s see if I can bring around some concepts Ramaji and John can you let me have two seconds okay Um we have a concept of this fire that s heating air but we also seem to have a concept of water that gets heated and creates steam Correct But I m also hearing and I just want to make sure I understand I m hearing that the steam isn t necessary for the balloon to go up John Well this is this is how I thought it was steam Because you know how sometimes there s clouds and you you want to go up in the air balloon and sometimes it might rain like when you re in the air balloon sometimes it like when you pass through a cloud and the air is super hot it actually turns into steam I think Okay Ramaji Okay Listen I ve got to come over here Okay so like like You two can put your hand down for a minute and I ll go to you next So like steam is I think it s putting pressure like on the balloon to like make it go up So we feel like we have air pressure okay I don t agree with Ramaji though because with the air there s no steam involved there s like kinda like what John said he said when the planes come up the hot air pushes it Okay I m gonna ask Oops I didn t let you speak Well like it s just like like comparing this to a regular balloon with helium it would float up just like an air balloon but you can t put helium in an air balloon Does everybody understand that So if I put okay that is an awesome analogy So everybody listen If I put helium helium is a A gas A gas okay helium is a gas so if I take a regular rubber balloon and I put helium in it the helium because it s a gas helium floats that makes my balloon float right Whereas if I just blow up a balloon what happens It just falls down on the ground and I got nothing okay On the flip side Kevin what she s saying is with a hot air balloon instead of filling it with helium I m filling it with hot air okay Now I have a question I think you ve got to think really deep about this one If hot air Reese is what makes my hot air balloon go up okay I want to know would it be easier for me to fly my hot air balloon on a warm day or on a cold day Just think about it for a second just think Would it be easier for my hot air balloon do you think to fly on a hot day or a cold day What about on a windy day Ooh Okay she said what about on a windy day Let s assume that there s a slight breeze on either day okay but the temperature is either warm or the temperature is cold okay Kelsey I personally think that it would be better to be on a hot day because then the sun would be helping with all the hot air so then it would make the air inside the hot air balloon warmer to help it fly higher So I d get radiation into the balloon Okay Ramaji I think a cold day And why on a cold day Because like there s not I mean even on hot days there s still like low humidity sometimes and so like it you basically with fire would kind of I don t know not set your hair on fire but like No when it s cold there s no moisture in the air so like it would be like like helium but like Okay Shayla I think that it s a hot day One of the reasons is because there s hot in the hot air balloon and if it was on a cold day there s a fire in the thing in the hot air balloon it could blow out the fire and that could make the whole thing just plummet to the ground and people could die Okay Ann Maria I think it would be better on a cold day because well I don t know if this actually really makes sense but like the hot air would be working against the cold air Exactly And like if it s on a hot day it would be like the same Just a second So Ann Maria if the cold if the warm air is in the hot air balloon and it s a cold day what would you expect to happen to the balloon Go up And why would you expect the balloon to go up on a cold day faster than on a hot day Because like the hot air would be pushing against the cold air faster than it would be pushing against itself Okay Over here I agree with Shayla on the hot day because like a regular air balloon just regular heat would make it go up but if you had the sun hitting against it I think it would help with radiation like the sun would help out The fire Yeah how it has something to do with radiation Okay I think the sun hitting against the balloon would make it go up higher Okay Nathan I think on a cold day because it would give it less chance of popping from the hot air that might pop it Awesome Kevin what do you think I think the same hot air because I ve never seen a hot air balloon fly when it s cold Okay Dakota Oh wait Kevin I have a question for you How do you define a cold day Okay what s the okay here s my question okay You said you d never seen a hot air balloon fly on a cold day and what I m asking is is there a particular season that you would say the air would be too cold Winter Winter okay Dakota what do you think Uh I think uh Kevin Dakota can think on his own I know he can I don t know Cold day warm day what do you think I think a warm day because it would be easier to fly Okay Daniel what do you think Cold day warm day I would say a cold day because the hot air would meet the cold air so it would be more enhanced going up you d get more from the hot air Okay I need to kind of bring this to a close real quick and I know you two have lots to say Tyree did you want to add the last comment Yeah Uh I think the hot day because who would go out on a cold day when the higher you get the colder it gets Okay Tyree says who would go out on a cold day because the higher you get the colder you get so Tyree s logic here is that if I m going to go in a hot air balloon I don t want to get really really cold Okay ladies I know you have lots to add okay but I kind of want to bring this to a close but I need to know a crucial question So everybody has to commit to this question I want you to don t do it until I tell you to Ready You re gonna hold um you re gonna hold your arm straight up if you believe the better day would be the warm day and you re gonna hold your hand at the side of your shoulder if you believe it would be the cold day that would be the better day I didn t say go yet Okay on three everybody So does everybody understand This is cold this is warm okay Ready one two three Okay Okay now hands down I have just two more questions and then we re gonna close out today s lesson okay Question number one I want to know if you ve ever heard the word 
 We are now getting into Earth Sun and Moon interactions We have done one thing well we have done several things all year on that first slide which you copied onto your board What is it The moon phases The moon phases You do the moon phases every day So you should be pretty familiar with moon phases what they are how they happen all that good stuff We get to move on Okay Let s start with something you do know What is a moon phase Tom It s what well it s technically when you look up in the sky and like what light you see in the moon Good What light you see in the moon Where does the light come from The green she s reflecting The sun The sun How does that work The sun shines on the moon and reflects back Good the sun shines on the moon and reflects back So that s how we see the moon Do you agree with that I see most of you agree Good Okay Then if we know that it comes from the sun why don t you tell me some of the moon phases so we can build on what you just told me What are some of the moon phases This one should be easy Waxing crescent Waxing crescent excellent Aisha Waxing gibbous Waxing gibbous very good Grillen Waning crescent Waning crescent Bailey Full moon Full moon Tom Waning gibbous Waning gibbous Ramos 1st quarter 1st quarter excellent New moon New moon excellent Last quarter Last quarter Third quarter Third quarter and last quarter very good When we talked in the last class some of you said Second quarter Then the second quarter is half time so that would be what moon phase What s halfway in between first and third What moon phase is that Full moon Yay full moon yay Yeah just start spouting everything out and then eventually you ll be right That works for me Yeah it s a full moon Get it half full Or not okay So we have all these moon phases How can you tell which one s which Why don t you just look up and say Yay it s a fingernail How do you tell which one s which Because different moon phases look different How does it look different Because It s okay Because different parts of the moon have light on it in different amounts Okay different parts of the moon have different amounts of light on it How would I be able to tell a waxing something from a waning something You re almost almost there Yeah I think you will because the moon has different kinds of faces Good very good Different kinds of faces One lights up on the left side and the other lights up on the right side Which one lights up on the right side The waxing How do you know that Because um Well you always told us it s light on the right it s wax iting Yeah it s light on the right it s wax iting Or what you guys like to do Wax on wane off Or wane off I don t know wax on Okay So I don t have a problem I don t think that you have a problem knowing the different phases of the moon I think you guys are pretty set on that How about what causes the phases of the moon What makes that happen You ve already told me light reflecting off the moon that comes from the sun but why would you have parts Why wouldn t you just be able to see the whole thing all the time Sean Because the earth blocks out some of the light that s coming from the moon Okay good Brenda Because the earth rotates with time and when the earth rotates the earth blocks the sun so you can see maybe at the top of the moon Okay good Tom There are other stars shining in different directions not just the sun Okay very good Stars shining at different directions Anything else Nancy Because the moon is moving and so Okay as the moon moves we see different phases So I hear a lot of that the earth blocks the moon the sun from reaching the moon Are you in agreeance Yeah A little bit Yeah yeah somewhat Okay Here s what we re gonna do You have won the experiment You ve done the flip camera But what I want you to do on your table everybody has like a big lollipop You either have the blue styrofoam ball you have the big white styrofoam ball you have a little styrofoam ball I want you each person in your group to have one of those styrofoam balls Okay And then you are going to come this way Down in your light paths You are gonna come up front and gather around my lovely light bulb Okay Come forth children And you might wanna squat down if you re near the front Yay I know it s bright Good Can t see Oh you can t see okay alright Oh Okay what I want you to do and you re already doing it hold it out in front of you I want you to look at your moon What am I holding in my left hand The sun The light bulb the sun You have the moon yay Here hold it out in front of you What moon phase do you have on your moon Aisha New moon New moon Why is it a new moon Because you can t see any light You can t see any light I can see lots of light It s blinding me Oh there we go But there s a light source Isn t my moon illuminated Becky It s illuminated on one side but since you re behind it you don t see any of the light coming Well then how do I know it s illuminated Because you can see other light Oh So I look across from me and I see Sean Sean you have a full moon Now you re supposed to disagree with me and tell me that no you don t Oh okay Um What moon do you have A new moon No you don t you have a full moon He has a waxing moon No he doesn t he has a full moon You all are crazy Look It s illuminated on the other side Okay Oh yeah you could do that But then wouldn t your head be in line with the earth It doesn t make any sense But that is one way that we can figure out that the moon is illuminated Not that we have 15 different moons or 28 or however many people we have But just because we re looking at a new moon doesn t mean that the moon s not illuminated it s just the other side So I look across and I can see full moon across from me What else can you see from where you re standing Tell me what you see and where you see it Yes Over there with Zack and Sarah I see fullmoon Okay good Over there I see a waning gibbous Really I see a waxing gibbous Uh Becky I see a full moon over at Zack Nice I see a waxing gibbous with Charlese I see a full moon Well I see a waxing gibbous Why Why do you see a waxing gibbous and I see a full moon Because we re in different places What s that got to do with anything I thought y all told me that we saw moon phases because the Earth s shadow blocks the sunlight from reaching the moon How can we see moon phases then Tiffany Ooo Kaitlyn Line of sight Line of sight What does that mean Um Besides your sight in a line It s um well Because sunlight s here it looks like a new moon but if the sunlight were like over there it wouldn t Huh Interesting Brooke Well I m just suspecting that Lauren turns kind of the moon out of view then like I couldn t see a shadow I could only see the new moon Oh because oh well oh Lauren s head is in the way Look at if the Earth was in the way that If the Earth was in the way would that cause a moon phase Yeah Is the Earth in the way of the moon all the time No What could we call Sorry What do we call it when we have the Earth and the moon and the sun lined up or if the moon is blocking light from getting to the Earth or if the Earth is blocking light from getting to the moon Bailey An eclipse An eclipse Have we talked about an eclipse before A little bit Just a little bit So is there anything in between me well is there anything between the moon and the sun In my No No vicinty because if I ask you you re gonna be like Yeah Lauren s head is in the way She s blocking all the light There s nothing in between me and the light source yet all around you re saying you see different moon phases Correct Mmm hmm Mmm hmm I want you to think about that Why you can see different phases on my styrofoam ball but there s nothing in between us Because the moon and the earth is at a different angle Ooh Cause the earth is at a different angle Because of our position Your positions Very interesting Here s what I m willing to have you do You all have a light bulb some work some don t I know there was at least one group in the last class that blew a light bulb So you might have to share but I m gonna have you go back to your seats Some of you have three people Some of you have four people Some of you have two Daniel you have three now I want you to set yourselves up in an arrangement around your light bulb where you personally can see four different moon phases or three different moon phases depending on how many people are in your group So you need to be able to see if there are four of you four different moon phases You stand there You hold it and if you get it raise your hand for me now Okay that was your challenge You don t have to fill anything You don t have to do anything Off you go Try not to blow it Alright move Michael Where do you think it s gonna be Put it like this Okay It doesn t have a switch It s just automatically on and off Yay we made it Nice Are we getting there Okay Okay since you have four people you re going to position yourselves differently than they are They only have three So you re gonna think think about a clock Where on the clock will you put everybody so you can all see four different moon phases from your angle Well one can go at twelve Twelve twelve six and nine and three Like a cross Do it I don t think we can put anybody over there And then tell me when you get it We can t put anybody over there So that ll be like twelve this ll be like Well we need a camera for it Right there we re not using a camera Okay Well now So Brenda can stand there Brooke can Or we can do like um like this kinda way I ll be here she ll be there and she ll be there and you ll be at the corner Yeah Okay So take your moon It won t move until you stand there and hold it No I see yours New moon No it looks like a waxing Excellent ladies and gentlemen I have a group who has it Ooo it looks like I have another group who has it Ooo I have another group who has it Somebody tell me If you equate it to a clock where are you standing Tell me what numbers you re standing on Jamie Uh oh Oh Forget about that For one moment we had it She s on number one She s sitting at four On a clock She s nine She s three and six and twelve Good So one of the ways you can do it is twelve three six nine You can do it that way Or you could actually scoot yourselves a little differently you could rearrange yourselves and see something besides What are you moon phases that you have Um that s waxing gibbous Waxing gibbous There s full moon new moon and this looks like I see full I see new and then if you re at nine and three I should only be able to see half What would those things be Mmm Go ahead First and third quarter Good first and third quarter I want you guys to see if you can figure out different arrangements to make it Okay Something besides those four And you got it too Okay we could Get a And then someone could be Could be right there and right there Yeah I see a full moon I see a full moon I just see a full moon Because your the light source I see a full moon and a I see a full moon I just see a full moon Do you see a half moon here I see a full moon Well Now do you wanna switch out Okay I ll take it Okay it s blinding Ooo yay Oh yeah I see a new moon and I like see a Everybody got it at least once Yep Yep Okay do me a favor unplug your light bulb and come back to your group Okay Was there anything in between you well actually your moon and your sun No No So does your theory or your hypothesis that the Earth blocks the light from reaching the moon still work No Carolyn says no Tom Technically it can work because when you have a I forgot what kinda eclipse it s called but it s an eclipse of the moon it goes like all red or something we had it this year and the Arth Earth arth The Earth is blocking it in a way worse Okay so is that going to change the phase of the moon nightly Becky No She says no Do you agree So what changes the phase of the moon Ben The way we see it from Earth The way we see it from Earth Agree Yes Ah interesting Now when you did the experiment before when you did it with a flip camera we re gonna re watch some of those videos I m just gonna do the montage so it s not necessarily gonna be your entire class but we re gonna go through and you need to critique each one You need to figure out do they do something wrong Do they do something correct Do you need to do something with that Do you need to re think your flip camera video Because we re gonna do it again after we get finished with this Make sense Are you sure Mmm hmm Are you positive Mmm hmm Let s watch the first one Okay Let me play it for you again See the phases Yeah Alright now I want you to tell me Besides being blinded What did they do correct What was right They were in a orbit not around the sun just a orbit Excellent they were not orbiting around the sun a k a the lightbulb What did they do incorrect They didn t call out the phases Okay they didn t call out the phases They didn t orbit orbit the camera They did The camera was in the middle So it went around So that s okay Think about that They went around There s even something wrong 
 The yellow has less water That s true And more H plus Because a higher concentration of The higher the concentration of the acid Yes Yes So you think it s something about the acid that s causing the color Yeah What about the blue food coloring This stays the same Yeah But why would you think this stays the same and it s the acid that s changing color Okay so the concentration of the blue food coloring is the same but the amount of acid is not So I must be changing the color of the acid So it s the acid that s changing color You re not changing the color of the acid though Anybody else got ideas about that That something else that could explain it That s one hypothesis You put the same amount of food coloring in every time right Yeah Wait so the acid is probably likely to maybe like lose an electron The acid loses electrons What is an acid It gives up an H plus right There are more moles of Hydrogen ions Right acid s dissociate So I got more molds of H plus in this one Okay Emma you have an idea Well there are more I think I might have gotten it confused Basically there s a higher concentration of acid as you go along right So more here Yeah There s more when it s lighter Lowest most Yeah I know Okay So that gives it more reason for a more drastic color change then Because there are more H pluses if you will that could cause it to jump in energy Okay so you got the idea of energy is some kind of something s jumping Because you know Could it be the separation between the two sets of the orbital in the food coloring itself that s changing Okay Which is why the blue color changes to the like brownish yellow So now what is your idea about what s changing color The orbital the food coloring is changing color The food coloring is changing color Yeah the food okay so that makes sense The food coloring is changing color but the acid concentration is making it change color Yeah So the food coloring s like the dependent variable right What is in the food coloring That s a good question That s what we need to know What is in the food coloring The same thing that s in the cabbage indicator actually Well something similar they re called anthocyanins And I have a little handout to show you what they look like So before we do that though Actually no I ll show you a picture of an anthocyanin and have you hypothesize a little bit more about what might be happening here So here s an anthocyanin It s this molecule here So usually anthocyanins have lots of benzene rings in them Okay So what is happening what is causing the different colors So we had the idea of something to do with orbitals and something jumping In the food coloring In the food coloring But the food coloring isn t transition metal It s not a transition metal no Can you still have that happen Well what else could there be Well I think it s the O H because Is it like splitting up the p orbitals What makes you say that There s like SP 3 orbitals and I guess p2 orbitals Okay so are you saying it s that splitting of SP 3 and SP 2 orbitals or the P orbitals I was thinking it s the P orbitals Okay so what here would represent the P orbitals Whatever bonded with the acid The O H maybe Oh would it be the no Okay so here s what we re going to do I m going to give you this handout and what I would like you to do I want you to highlight all of the double bonds in one color Then I want you to highlight all of the single bonds in another color okay You should have highlighters by your table Purple I ll take green Do you want us to do it for all of them Yeah let s just do it let s do it for the first one to start with Anthocyanins in red wine we ll do that So anthocyanins are in lots of different compounds Anything that has color really wine grapes cabbage red onions food coloring Are they they re not in colorless though right Or are they Say it again They can t be colorless because it s colorless Well kind of you ll see We ll explain that in a little bit yeah Is something colorless because they don t have any d electrons or like the d orbital is filled up with electrons Or are there other factors Yes that s true for transition metals But for other things For other things that are colorless what would explain why they were colorless It would have to be a different orbital Different wave length Like the absorption based on the bond Yes to both of you So Riley s idea is that maybe so what did we say color came from earlier Color in general where does color in general come from Reflecting certain frequencies and absorbing other frequencies of light right Okay so we can only see purple to red So is there another explanation for why something might be colorless Because it Probably because it s absorbing everything Well if it was absorbing everything what color would it be Black Oh it s not absorbing anything It s not absorbing anything Or not absorbing Any color It s not absorbing what we can see It s not absorbing what we can see that s right It s not absorbing what we can see It reflects all the colors So you guys see a pattern yet Can I borrow somebody s Let me borrow yours Let s put it under the camera as an example here What do you notice Were we supposed to highlight Single bonds yes What do you notice about the relationships between double and single bonds The double bonds right next to each other The double bonds are next to the single bonds The double bond are next to the single bonds That s right that s right Okay in the first one where you have What color is the first one does is say It just says colored Red wine But we have colored and we have colorless Okay so in the colored one how many can you count how many times it goes double single double single double single That s like a tongue twister It s seven in colored I got seven Okay so now count colorless and see what you get What did you guys get For double single I got like 14 Okay so are you counting double and single as Yeah yeah Okay so you basically got seven too Okay so do colorless now Double bonds between every single bond between the bonds with the C N O I got eight for colored I got 17 in the singles and eight doubles for that Okay what s the difference between colored and colorless basically And the number of double and single bonds There are more singles than colorless Okay not the total numbers oh wait there s more singles than colorless Okay that s a way we can look at it Okay see if the same We got seven for colorless Okay Is it supposed to be the same number No no no it s not supposed to be the same Alright let s hear what Gracie has to say Say what you just said So in colored there s more doubles and there s less singles So that means that there s going to be more of the single doubles But then in colorless there s less doubles and more singles so that means there s less single doubles Can somebody restate that Just so that I can make sure that you understand what she said Does that mean that if there are more double bonds than there are that colors So say it again When there are more double bonds there s a color or something Okay when there s more double bonds there s a color Does that seem like the pattern we re noticing here It has to do with pi bonding Why does it have to do with pi bonding Because it s an overlap of p orbitals Overlap of p orbitals Which allows the delocalized electrons to like Okay so what did you say Con Delocalization Delocalization the delocalization comes from Pi bonds what is a pi bond It s the overlap of what P orbitals P orbitals p orbitals okay So when it goes double single double single double single what s happening there How does that create It s like one big pi bond Like when you have like earlier you were talking about whatcha ma call its I can t articulate Delocalization No like One giant p orbital Yeah like sort of yeah one giant p orbital Like one giant pi bond it like expands from like through different Oh and like a benzene shape and then that makes a circle Yeah and it s not actually like here s one here s one pi bond here s one pi bond here s one It s like they re like all pi bonded They re like all pi bonded to each other okay So in which case in which case are they all pi bonded to each other The colored form or the colorless form I d say colored because they are all close to each other Like the pi bonds The pi bonds say it again They re close to each other They re close to each other in the colored form So is there more There s more double bonds There s more double bonds in the colored Yeah so they would have to be closer to each other There are more double bonds in colored less double bonds in colorless Okay so how many of you say there s less double bonds in the colorless Less double bonds in the colorless Three There s only seven double bonds in colorless and there s eight in colored And there s more leftover singles Wait for which one for colored Oh you re counting the far left one Yeah this one has eight This is an intermediate one So then it s seven and seven Seven and seven okay So how many if you were to try to connect So the idea is that it makes one giant p orbital If you were going to connect all of the p orbitals which one would have the most gigantic p orbital Colored Colored Is that clear to everybody Why did you say colorless Did you say colorless Yeah I don t understand why Because there s a bunch of single bonds Because the pi bond is more in the middle of the two other things Wait for the far left Does that make any sense We re talking about the far left one Let s look at all three So which one of these is going to have the most giant pi bond The middle one The middle one Because it s an intermediate And they re more double bonds Does anyone disagree that it s going to be the middle one that would have the most giant p orbital Okay Alright let s look at some more down here Did you guys do does somebody have these highlighted No I think Rebecca you have them highlighted right Okay so let s look at these two here Can we apply our hypothesis So what is our hypothesis by the way More overlap of p orbitals the more colored it is Okay the more overlap of p orbitals the more colored it is That s our hypothesis Is it supported by these two on the side here Can we highlight the exterior So what do you think Is our hypothosis supported by these two Alright Con can you explain Well I mean it just looks like there s a bunch of conjunctions of single bonds where the streak of double single is kind of broken Okay right so there s a streak of double single double single double single double single double single So imagine you start somewhere Have you guys ever heard the song that never ends Yes This is the song that never ends Okay we re not gonna sing it it never ends So in this case if we were to just go around going double single double single double single double single double single double single double single double single double single would I ever get to an end necessarily Would I here How about if I went double still single double single double single double single But that s single single Single single So which one s going to have a more extensive pi bond The top one so that sort of fits our hypothesis that the more pi bonding there is the more colored it is Okay so what causes color in these compounds Shared electrons More shared electrons that are shared how Pi bonds More pi bonds equals what More area for the electrons to move around Okay more area for them More delocalization okay So let s take it back to this to our acid and blue food coloring demonstration Why are these different colors What is happening here Let s put this together Oh is it the H is taking more of the delocalized electrons because H is positive What do you think Because there s a higher concentration So say it again Okay so since H is a positive ion it takes more of the since there s more it takes more of the delocalized electrons Okay so it s taking more of the delocalized electrons So how does that explain the color change Can somebody add onto that There s less electrons so I guess there s less More double bonding There s less energy absorbed No there s increased So is more energy being absorbed or less energy being absorbed when it s yellow More energy is being absorbed that s why it s yellow Exactly that creates further Because there are more electrons bonding with the H plus than there is in the It s about absorption Ah okay Ruth say that 
 I teach in a second and third grade combination class The students are arranged in grade level specific table groupings This allows students to complete any grade level specific projects together and receive instructions in a manner that s clear to them I also have a guided reading area And a independent reading corner All of the resources the students may need are located around the perimeter of the classroom leaving access to the center of the classroom the large rug area for all of our class discussions to take place As well as collaborative group work Students also have available to them the reading corner area as an area for collaborative group work They have a listening center where they access books on tape and CD We have three computer stations where children word process completed writing projects or they do research on the internet But complete sentence okay for that first part All right and then someone who s taking turns So we re clear on the rubric what my expectation is when we walk around Questions If they make a mistake do you want us to correct their English or You know what what I think is a nice way to correct someone when they misspeak and I do this a lot so you might notice that I restate what someone has said And that s part of being a good listener So being able to recall or restate Something like oh I heard you say and then you restate it in the way that might be more appropriate That s a respectful way of being a listener and also a speaker when you re trying to teach and be a role model I have a different idea I think that is Okay so there s another way I think that is excellent So we re going to just try this out and see how it goes We re going to try this out again and practice those cues Are we the same number as usual Yeah okay so here we go We re going to practice When you get to your pictures this is what I want you to do Right now I have put I have this image of a whale on okay can you have a seat I need everyone sitting next to their partners right now So what I want you to do is looking at this picture I want you to practice right now in your group sharing one or two things that you notice in this picture What do you see So I want you to share exactly physical features and use descriptive language to talk about what you see Question Hold on a second sweetie I just called on Jonathan Just a second Question We re going to describe with our partner So you re going to need to turn to your partner Adam what did you I don t really understand what that thing in black is You know it s just a shadow It s a shadow This one It s just a shadow on the picture It just doesn t look very clear the way it came out It s the shadow on the image okay All right so turn to your partner When I ring the bell number ones share first When I ring the bell number twos share When I ring the bell I m going to take some of your descriptive language Sharing what you see Number twos Okay excellent So I m going to pick a stick I m going to go fishing in my sticks And when I call your name I want you to share either what you saw or what your partner saw okay What was the detail that was shared And I m going to write it up on this sticky note because I m modeling now what you re going to do when you get to your stations Everyone s going to get a stack of sticky notes and you re going to get an opportunity after you share to record some of your ideas of what you see Number 10 Cesar Sorry You want to ask a question For a clarifying question No I was just making a comment Just I don t like it when there s only like one sticky note for everyone Because then the first group who goes there puts like every single little thing that they see And it takes up like maybe three quarters of the whole paper And then the next group has like Okay so we re going to solve that problem because each individual gets a sticky note okay And then you re going to choose where you re going to put it All right so number 10 Cesar Madelaine said that she saw white spots and one on the bottom And she said an Orca and she saw a very long tongue and sharp teeth She actually named the animal which was an Orca She saw white spots on the bottom And what was the part about the teeth and a few sharp teeth Oh sorry and then sharp teeth Okay so I wrote more than one idea on this sticky note But what you re going to do is after we do the conversation after we walk through the stations and see the images and talk about it then you re going to go back and record one idea on the sticky note And put it onto the picture So let s try one more I m going to turn it over So look at the picture and then I m going to ring the bell you re going to share and I ll pick somebody else to share what they see Okay so who s next number 21 Roberto My partner says oh what I said It can be what you said or what your partner said whatever you decide His was good I said that I see a pod of Orca whales and their dorsal fins sticking up out of the water That was great So he has two points that he sees the pod which is how we refer to A group A group excellent use of the vocabulary The Orca whale so he s named the actual type of whale And he starts looking at the dorsal fins which is one of the physical features Not only of the Orca but of what The humpback doesn t The humpback that s right it doesn t have a dorsal fin So which ones have the dorsal fin All the others ones except for that one There s a couple of other ones as well Blue whales don t Blue whales good good good good good Eyes up here Are there any questions on what I want you to do when you go around to the different stations Yes Sarah So how many sticky notes are we going to get Like a couple four or five So first I m going to give you a chance to walk around And then I m going to come around and I m going to give you some sticky notes So you re going to let us look at them and then we re going to pick which one we want and put a sticky note on Yes exactly exactly What s this This one s cool I see some baleen which means it s a baleen whale And it looks like it has a big mouth And the baleen looks like it is some sort of bendy thing And on the bottom of the baleen it s scary And it looks like it has a big mouth which probably means it is a very big baleen whale I see a baleen whale with a lot of crushed thingies And a person s touching it I m not sure if it s a real whale that s alive It might just be an exhibit No Jake And so I don t really think this is something that s underwater It s part of baleen It s like a baleen whale there s baleen but It looks like a Blue Whale because it is very big It also doesn t have any throat looms and it has just a small bump for it s dorsal It also looks like it s swimming very close to the top And that also looks like it s coming up for air I see a whale that a man is touching their teeth I m not exactly sure what type of whale this is but it s a whale I see someone touching part of a whale and it might be part of a baleen I see a whale and I think it s coming to the surface for a breath because they cannot breathe under water I think that that is a baleen whale because it is it is white and it s a little bit gray I see a whale that is going up to the surface of the water and I believe that it s a beluga whale I see the whale I think it s going to jump out the water and then dive I see a big gigantic beluga whale with his skin has a couple like dents and wrinkles And it doesn t have a dorsal fin 
 In my classroom each student has their own individual workbench with a set of hand tools in the drawers where they also may store their art and they ve each made a back splash of art inspirational images In the corner of the room I have a resource area including images of art books and magazines a computer with an internet connection and examples I have a board where I give notes and it has a calendar with the semester at a glance I have a demo table where we meet for discussions and group demonstrations In the corner of the room there s acid etching done safely with rubber gloves and goggles and a rubber apron In front of that there s soldering with a acetylene tanks chained to the cabinet and a good ventilation system above and also eye protection and gloves The sink area includes an emergency eyewash station and soaps In the corner of the room you see a fire extinguisher a buffing machine a hammering area done safely with a stump to limit the percussive nature of each blow and ear protection a drill press done safely with eye protection and gloves an emergency eyewash station and shower and first aid kit In here we have an enamelling area above banks of labeled cabinets with ventilation And in the front we have a bulletin board with notices and class rules and another fire extinguisher This is another reason why people might own jewelry or want to have jewelry Now this isn t jewelry per se You know what these are Coins Coins There s such an interesting iconography of coins I love the patterning that happened when he cast them I mean I just think its You ve got the horse You ve got the man Some sort of a symbol I don t really know what all the symbols are but you could really use a lot of this And do research symbols like for the production project that is coming up And here people have even made jewelry out of the coins And here art is an example of in north Africa a lot of times women traditional women it s probably changing now but I don t really know how much it s changed or not changed This picture is from 1988 or something so it s in the past But they would get a lot of their wealth from their family given to them as jewelry And they d wear it everyday And it might seem ridiculous to us you can do your farming you re going about your business cooking and you re wearing all that craziness but that way it s on them they have it if something happens to their husband nobody can take it away because it s on their body It s protected It s also very obvious If the husband were to steal the money and take it away they would know because she s not wearing it So he would be shamed So it s sort of it s like the dowry the money comes into the family from the woman s parents but it s also to help protect the woman It s not just it s not just to go to the husband So I think it s amusing that they re wearing it I thought they weren t allowed to wear makeup Well it depends in what part of where you are I mean are you thinking who is they I m thinking Iran and stuff and north Africa Right Iran there s different sects of Islam and what people believe as really strict is different In this north Africa Iran s more in the Middle East getting closer I mean does it even even in Asia it might even be Asia No it s not in north Africa It s not in Africa So this is like north Africa there s a lot of tribal groups that were nomads in the desert It s all intermixed And people in southern Africa like in Sudan are predominantly Islamic and they have a different take on it too So maybe in Iran it s frowned upon as vanity but The Muslim culture requires women to cover their faces It s not Muslim religions that only It s Arabian That s very good Chloe Very very astute It s there traditions It s not required by the religion it s a cultural thing That s good That s a good clarification I didn t think of it that way So also this redeemable investment or wealth people like to and they have people over for dinner Golden silverware On the right that was the silverware of Marie Antoinette I ve never heard of gold silverware So gold I know they re eating on gold And it can t be 24 carat because it would be too soft But it s probably a gold alloy And there s also cases of people when times get tough melting down their silverware So they can have the Yeah and you use that as your it s like people nowadays are investing in gold They re buying gold bars because it s like you own something You see it It s not just a piece of paper that says you own something Yeah I think there s commercials about buying gold And this is a chalice through the church The church accumulated a lot of wealth specifically the Catholic church during the Medieval times And they would have it made into these things like the chalice for the blood Okay attraction and beauty This is pretty obvious because where do people usually wear jewelry On their necks and faces and Yeah yeah to draw attention I think to the face usually is a big deal And also this is an example of a Cartier necklace that was a gift from a man to a woman So a lot of times it s with the idea of love or commitment romantic love Here we have Indians from India and these are things that you can buy This is just off of that So this is like the traditional wedding where you ve got kind of an inexpensive version perhaps that you can buy There s all sorts there s all levels of expense that you can buy And here we are again with north Africa Just kind of thinking about the different ideas of what is beautiful and what isn t beautiful I don t know How many of you have tattoos Any of you have a tattoo I wish Okay I mean you re a little bit young Right Do you think you might want a tattoo at some point Yeah my friend has a whole entire paragraph on her back Really Do you like it Yeah it s really pretty but I wouldn t want something like that Yeah I don t remember what it says Something it has to do with swimming I think It s like swimming In some way It s a really good quote though Yeah she looks like that girl from Avatar You know I haven t seen Avatar but as a movie designer James Cameron what do you think he was looking at to get inspiration for the movie Probably If you I mean does anybody like Star Wars That was a popular kind of thing But you know I always wanted the hair braids Mom mom please She s like Your hair isn t long enough That was a movie They had it was a wig I was like Do it Do it I braid my hair put beads in it sometimes There are cultures that wear their hair like that So it s like nothing is sort of new under the sun People are reinventing what s already happened I always wanted it just like Pocahontas that s the entire story The second time I saw it I was like Oh this is really bad One thing they represented it wrong that s like the reason they were there because it was very valuable Oh so you re thinking it could have been a little more creative You know the first time you see it it s so good And then the second time you re like Hey now that I ve seen this So it s good to critique pop culture to determine If you get a job in the movies how would you do it better or differently I d do a different plot I d be more creative Okay yeah we better I m gonna keep moving on All right Okay so here we have ancient Egypt on the left and we have Miss South Carolina 2000 I can t remember 2004 2006 recently Isn t it interesting how similar the eye the eyeliner the long eyebrow the hair coming down the crown You know I mean I think the eyebrows Well she doesn t have the I m trying to create a bead kind of thing Okay Melting the stuff Drew was using for his corset together Oh the screen So you re melting the screen Oh interesting So how will you use that in your I m thinking I can use it in attaching because I think it would look cool if there was something kind of like that not gold and shell ish Okay Okay well do you want to go look at your stuff Or do you want to or you feel like you need to finish that Oh no that s fine There appears to be no blue stuff Oh the pickle It s new Oh It only gets blue from the copper so it it does have pickle in it It s just fresh and new So you could you could see that little yogurt container You can put it in that and that has holes in it and then you can just kind of let that float Just kind of put a little in there Like tip it Yeah that s good Okay yeah let s go look at your Oh should we look at those Would you rather do those or Okay let s go Sorry we re going outside now Okay Oh wow What do you think I like them I really like them as not a shell color because they don t seem Can I touch it Sorry I touched it before I asked you I think once you like as I did just find the shell along the stream Right you re transforming it I really like the shell of the spray paint too because it helps tie it in with the metal It makes well it s metallic spray paint so it seems really metal y yeah Right Cool And it makes it a little bit more blingy You know And I like how it reflects the light all the cracks and stuff Yes it gives it a unifying presence instead of having all that color variation Especially if you think about having one necklace that has many shells on it Then this unifies them It makes them probably a little bit more wearable with people s clothes Do you think About how would you how will you attach are you thinking of using these in one group Or are they more pendants I think they re more like pendants and I was gonna poke a hole Okay Like two holes in them and I was gonna use a bunch of different strings together So it s kind of like and they re right there And maybe bead it a bunch of beaded strings So really this is like one necklace that s or is it many necklaces that people can layer It s just one necklace Okay all right Well let s can we go look at your sketch book too The other thing is next time it would be better I think to drill the hole first before you paint it Okay Because I m afraid the paint might scratch in the process of drilling the hole I was going to just poke a hole with a needle Can you do that I think so I mean they re really a lot more soft than metal Oh okay well try it and see if it works But I have a diamond drill bit It can drill and that s what Drew has been using to drill his glass and stuff Okay and also most of these already have holes Oh yeah because of the creature that eats the muscle Yeah I love the hole that s already in there yeah okay All right let s go look at that These probably need to dry a little more Yes Okay okay let s go in There s only five more minutes on here Okay that s good We ll get this and that ll be okay Oh look at that See that s amazing to me because whenever I find coquinas I guess I find the live coquinas I ve never seen the shells like just the shells But they all have a hole This is a great find I got my back so sunburned gathering all of these on the beach Yes Because they all lay next to each other in the sand And when you I mean now do you have sketches of how these might be transformed into jewelry I m not sure yet because Here I ll come over is this better like this Yeah I could use like I could put them all together on one string on one necklace Sort of like the coral But I don t know I don t think I have enough for that from reproduction Well you have a lot What might be better right because you re right Because then they would nest Right If you just put with cubicle then they don t take up much space What if you made a bunch jump rings with thin wire and then you have a little jump ring that would go through each one And that could put see how you have sort of charms on your chain You could these could also be sort of like charms hanging down and you could layer them maybe with a jump ring could have a little chain And it could hang down to vary the length or or you said that you like to use did you make your necklace that s woven there That s okay you but you know how to sew So could you sew them on something I could yeah I mean I have some leather strip and that would be keeping with natural materials So that might be interesting I don t know I well I think what you need to do is to experiment sew some do some metal through some and then maybe lay some out And you can see how Chloe has hers laid out in that box so that she can keep it I think you d need a box or a tray and you could sort of lay it out so you can start to see the composition of them Yeah Now what are these Those are Oh and these are a dove s feathers They re so elegant Yes Now do you have your sketch book Can we look at the sketch on how you thought you might do this Here I think I got it Here you go I could do this with the shell Oh because that s hanging off And then what is this round ring part I m not sure It could just be like a round golden It could be a soldered ring of metal like brass wire soldered together Is this an earring Yes Okay That may be for these Right That was that s what I was planning to do with the shell For that I could do a bunch of different strings or I could just do one string and put two of these sort of up the string or something Right right asymmetry Okay I like it And then this is the feather These are jump rings and this is the feather 
 Okay guys yesterday we talked about three key vocabulary words that we mentioned we studied we found definitions for Those words were adaptation there s habitat and community Okay adaptation is the first word Who can tell me something about adaptation Karina Adaptation is how animals act like the howler monkeys they howl so they can tell other monkeys that they are in danger so they can survive Okay so they can survive right Adaptation helps them survive And then habitat Who can tell me what habitat is Ernesto Where you live Okay it s the environment where they live It s the surroundings okay It s the trees it s the plants it s the ground and it s the climate that they live in And the last one is community Okay so if we re thinking about animals what makes up a community for these animals Who can tell me Sergio The community What makes up a community It s not the environment The animals It s all the animals Do we have just one animal in the community We have many we have many It could be very many Okay we re going to on and I d like you to listen to this sound Shhhh Just listen to this sound Okay you may have and you can hear this sound at night Okay what I d like you yo do right now is tell me one thing that you know about this animal okay If you know the name of this animal go ahead and write that down too First of all let s just write it in our K Just put it under for K What do you know about that animal Just write it down first then we ll talk about it I d like you to discuss what you know also Talk to a neighbor Okay this is what you know so you are going to be looking at that What is something you know about that animal Okay Tell your neighbor What do you know about this animal Just tell a neighbor Tell a neighbor what you know Tell your neighbor Eddie what you know What do you know You can talk out loud guys Okay small ears okay All right so write that down Okay now after that go to what you want to know Go to the W What do you want to know about this animal By the way what animal is this An owl It s an owl It s a Great Horned Owl okay Now what I d like you to do you want to put this information Yea what do you want to know So write one thing about what you want to know What do you want to know Tell a neighbor What do you want to know Sergio You don t have to whisper you can say it How old an owl can live Okay good Good okay Now one thing I want you to think about Let s listen to this sound again okay Listen to the sound again Any predictions and you can just tell me without writing them down What do you think that Why does the owl make the sound that it makes Yea Maybe to warn other owls Warn other owls Anything else Yea Ernesto To communicate And to communicate that s right Okay let s take a look a page twenty three Okay we re going to look at text structure on page 23 This is the Great Horned Owl And I d like everyone to put your finger on the title for this animal the Great Horned Owl Just put your finger so I know you know what the title is Next I d like you to put your finger on the caption Okay and can I have one person read the caption Let s have Karina read the caption Owls have large eyes to help them see in the dark Okay very good Then we have underneath the title of the Great Horned Owl We have what I call bullet points We talked a little bit about them And put your fingers on the bullet points there And let s have Ernesto read those bullet points Bird found in North Central and South America Live in the canopy and understory Understory very good And we live in what continent Eddie what continent do we live in North America North America So we ll find these and actually I will usually hear these at night And usually hear them kind of in the winter time All right let s have the first paragraph Eddie why don t you continue The Great Horned Owl has no ears but can hear anyway It can also see very good even on the darkest night Okay and the second paragraph Makayla An owl hunts for food at night from high in the air When it hears a mouse move or squeak the owl swoops down upon it Swoops okay very good Okay now we ve read about the Great Horned Owl I d like you to tell your neighbor one thing that you learned new about this owl that you are going to put down under the L What is one thing that you learned about the owl Okay so write something down that you ve talked about with your partner or your neighbor Now we re going to continue working in partners here and I m going to give you something to take a look at And I m going to have you guys just close your books for a second After you re done writing close your books Okay I m going to give each pair or each little group one of these sticks I want you to look at the stick carfeully and look how an animal might have changed or interacted with the stick okay So take a close look at it all right And take a look at it and then I d like you to put down what you know about that stick okay There are yes you can see that some insects have interacted with the stick also But what is something look at the ends of the stick and let s put down something we know about what an animal might have done to this stick Okay just write it down or tell your neighbor Tell your neighbor Yeah he bit the stick on here But did he actually cut it Was he able to bite it Yes Yeah he was he was Okay all right now who can tell me what animal this might be Karina A beaver It is a beaver and you will find these in this area What I would like you to put down next is what you want to know about the beaver So let s write that down Just skip this and go right to What do you want to know Tell your neighbor Go ahead and tell your neighbor about it What do you want to know Okay tell your neighbor guys too once you have written it down How old can a beaver live Okay how old can a beaver live That s good Yea Keelie What I want to know how about are they electric Okay Okay I want to know how long they are in their house maybe Yes I want to know how big can they be Okay good I have hair on here It s possible Actually yeah that is very possible you have hair of a beaver I would actually I m going to hang onto that And actually let s put that in the garbage But that s good It s right here Okay i ll take it Okay Yea you re going to find that probably we re not going to look at the sticks too much We need to find insects still living in the stick but we re going to leave that for right now I d like you to take a look at page twenty Take a look at page twenty I do recommend that if you ever by chance go to Deerbro there s a forest near the school here Your parents can take you You might actually see a beaver house Okay let s find out some more information about beaver on page twenty Put your fingers on the title Put your fingers on the title You know what I ll take that Here we go And you know what let me recollect these because we have Let me collect those back Thank you There we go Okay put your fingers on the beaver the title okay Can I have one person read the bullet again Bullet marks Sergio go ahead Mammal found in North America Europe and Asia Lives in rivers and streams near the forest floor okay and can you name another mammal If you happen to know what the mammal might be Can you name another mammal Whale A whale is a mammal and we are also mammals Okay the next paragraph I d like to have one person read that paragraph Karina Beavers eat bark twigs leaves and roots They have wide flat tails These tails help beavers to clear a placement Beavers use their split claws to comb their own fur They also use their claws to spread oil onto their fur This oil helps keep them warm in the water Okay before we go on as we re going to be looking at a lot of things think about what it is you re learning What s something new that you re learning about this beaver Now before we go on everybody put your finger on the caption Okay caption Makayla what does the caption say A beaver s fur keeps it warm in the snow All right very good So let s take one more thing We re going to take a look at a diagram on page seventeen So now let s go to page seventeen And this talks a little bit more about a beaver And the title let s put our finger on the title of page 17 What does the title say Keelie Graph Section Diagram Okay we re looking at page 17 right here Put your finger on the top of the diagram And that s the title What does it say Keelie Beaver lodge Okay what is we know a beaver is the animal What s a lodge Keelie Their house where they live Yea it s like their house Okay next there s a caption built into the diagram and it s green Let s have Sergio read the caption there This beaver lodge was built on a shallow part of the wood floor If it wouldn t float the lodge will have to be rebuilt Okay very good Let s get some more information There s some other things in the diagram to give us information Makayla Some lodges are two meters 6 5 high Okay very good And Keelie The lodge is made from logs and sticks Okay and Eddie the last one Beavers come in and out under the water Okay so this is where they live This is how they live and why do you think they build their house this way Anybody What do you think they do Why do they build it this way Karina Because when they when people come like hunters if they want to catch them It is going to be difficult for them Okay like predators Other predatory animals Yeah So this is a way they adapt So how do they adapt to survive in their environment Makayla To enter from the underground water Okay can you use adapt or adaptation in a sentence Beavers Beavers adapt to Beavers adapt how Yea Karina Beavers adapt by entering from a little hole under the water Okay so they adapt in that way other predators can t see when they re coming And as we saw on the sticks the sticks they just pile these sticks up on here and they move them around until they make something that looks like this okay So what kind of a habitat do the beavers live in again Using the word habitat I d like you to tell me What s the habitat of a beaver They live in lodges They live in lodges Okay what s around their lodge Yeah Karina Sticks and wood Okay sticks but then what is this blue stuff here Water It s water Yeah so they actually go underwater to get into their home And that makes it very safe So I would like you to add one more thing to what you learned on the third column of this organizer Okay Okay once you ve got one third okay And Eddie when you ve got something why don t you tell your neighbor When you ve got something tell your neighbor what you learned Like this Okay Actually right here yea What you ve learned Okay and if you were to go out somewhere and you were in the woods what would you see What do you think you would see from this house This is all water so all you re going to see Are you going to see the hole that s here No No What do you think you re going to see The sticks Just like a stick Just a mound of sticks about two meters high Which is probably about that tall 
 In my opinion I think the grandpa shows the most leadership because he stands up for himself telling the principal I should not pay 15 00 because then it wouldn t be a scholarship Okay thank you very much I like the way the way you show you know how much he pays for one day and not have to pay for the scholarship jacket Thank you very much I agree with Julia because you should not choose people for like what kind of races they are or their culture You should choose them for what they ve been through like their hardest work or something Okay So you mean they had jobs they had work it was right to feel that Very good good job Okay I think Martha because she earned the jacket instead of buying it Okay In my opinion the grandpa showed the greatest leadership because he was wise and a great leader is wise Okay I agree with Alejandro that the grandfather is the leader because he didn t pay for the jacket He didn t pay for the jacket So you thought because he didn t pay for the jacket then he s a great leader You think you know just because he did not pay for the jacket that s what made him a great leader No I think that what makes him a great leader is that he stood up for himself instead of just saying oh okay here s the money Okay so a greater leader should stand for what he believes Is that what you are saying Yes Very good Thank you very much for clarifying that Go ahead Daniel I was going to say that I agree with Jennifer I think that a great leader should stand up for what they believe Thank you very much Go ahead In my opinion I think Martha showed the greatest leadership because she showed wisdom because she earned that jacket by getting straight As and being a good student All right Thank you Go ahead Lisette In my opinion Martha s grandpa is a great leader because a leader needs to be a strong person like Martha s grandpa Very good So you need to stand your ground Very good I think that the person who showed the most leadership was Martha Even though she thought she was going to lose what she had earned she believed that even though the teachers they they some wanted to give it to someone else but some knew that she had earned it and she she spoke up not keeping it quiet and keeping it to herself Okay So you feel a great leader you know she speak up you know when something is wrong or in the way She shouldn t just keep it Very good She has to tell someone Very good good job Go ahead It seems to me that Martha showed great leadership because she did all the things that she did so she could win the jacket Okay what are some of the other things you know that Martha did She got she got since she was in first grade she got good grades and she tried not to get in trouble and be a good student Okay so that means you know she has worked hard all this time Very good Thank you Okay go ahead I believe that Martha showed very good leadership because she wanted the scholarship jacket so bad that she didn t give up on trying to get it So a good leader you know she ll try to do whatever it takes you know to get what he or she wants Is that what you re saying Yes All right Good job Thank you In my opinion I think Mr Schmidt is a great leader because he was fair you know to fight for Martha and not the other girl Thank you Who is the other girl Joanne Huh Joanne Okay so Mr Schmidt was fair enough you know to fight for Martha instead of who Joanne Joanne Thank you very much In my opinion it s Martha because she fight for the jacket and she tried her best All right In my opinion I think Mr Smith because even though Martha was poor he still said that she deserved the sweater because of her good grades Because of her good grades Good job In my opinion I believe that the one that showed leadership was Mr Smith because he was honest and fair to Martha Very very good Thank you very much I agree with her because Mr Booney just wanted the person that had money which is Joanne Her father owned the only store in town So Mr Schmidt was actually being fair Okay Thank you for adding on to that Now who is Joanne s dad You know because everybody was saying I could hear Juan you know when Juan said because of Joanne s dad Who is Joanne s dad How can we describe him He owns the only store in town Hmm He owns the only store in town He owns the only store in town What else He s also part of the school board He s rich School board Huh He s part of the school board so they had the decisions like in the school like what they do and stuff In the story he gives money to the school so maybe that s also why they wanted to pick Joanne so they got more money Very good Thank you very much Now that everybody has contributed now let s look at the next question The next question is this what does Martha represent to you Think about the leadership qualities that Martha showed What does Martha represent to you Not only the leadership qualities all the other things that Martha represents okay Anybody can start Anybody can start Just jump in I believe that Martha to me represents a great leader Her experience and triumph illustrate importance in leadership such as never giving up Thank you for sharing that She represents someone who will find the truth and will solve it She stood up for herself and she listened to what her grandfather had to say Very good It seems to me that she was a smart and outgoing girl because she worked hard and speaked up and no matter how you look or where you live you have to be treated fairly Great Like that Anybody can jump in It seems to me that Martha is not a leader because her grandpa speaked up for her about the scholarship jacket I disagree because Martha did speak up for herself Her grandfather just told her what to say I disagree because like her grandfather gave her most of her ideas If it wasn t for her grandfather she probably would ve tried to get the money But like her father said I mean her grandfather said that a scholarship is not a scholarship unless you pay for it I agree with Daniel because like well yeah I agree with Arkie because the grandfather actually had to tell the principal that they shouldn t have to pay for it instead of Martha going to speak to the principal in person I disagree with that I disagree with that I disagree I disagree with Daniel and Javier because even though her grandpa told her what to say her grandpa didn t go up to the principal and actually tell it was actually Martha who went up to the principal and got ideas of what to say I agree with Myra because it s true I mean he didn t go Martha actually had the guts to say what her grandfather had said So that s why I say that Martha had most of the guts to do that instead of the grandfather The grandfather might ve said that but she was the one that stood there and said it That took a lot of courage to me Okay So you know that was a great leader should be courageous enough So I like what Arkie said Arkie said you know I disagree that Martha was a leader and Arkie open up that Thank you very much Archimedes Thank you all of you for sharing that Any other person To me Martha represents a hard worker because since first grade she worked hard to get her good grades and not get in trouble Okay She worked really hard Thank you Any other person that wanted to add something It seems to me that Martha is a that proves that it doesn t matter her race or color she could do anything the same as anybody else can do Wow I agree with Ashley because a lot of people discriminate like Mexican people or like Mexican Americans just because their family or their ancestors came from somewhere else and they re not from the United States So you know what has Martha done to straighten that or to disprove that She showed that who cares where you re from or who you are you can always do your best Okay So you know there was Martha is representing to us that we can do whatever we put our mind in doing If we really work hard we know that it will work Is that what I m hearing from all of you Yes That it doesn t matter what race you know if you work really hard you know that you can achieve Thank you very much for sharing that I really admire her because I know some people who have been made fun of just because of their race and it s somewhat sad because some people aren t allowed to do things just because of their skin color or where they re from What I think is that it doesn t matter what you are No one is bad except for the person who s making fun of your race You are not the bad one it s the person who s making fun of you Thank you very much Any other person that wants to add something to this I agree because in a poem it says you can t persuade anyone unless you have the courage to make them like persuade them Thank you very much Now let s go on to the last question Thank you very much for sharing I could hear from all of you The last question is what other stories have you read that share a similar theme with Scholarship Jacket Think of other characters that have faced difficult choices or situations Okay So think of that What other stories have you read okay Anyone can start I think Crossing the Wire is somewhat similar because Pablo was Mexican too and they mistreated him and denied him a job However he worked as hard as Martha Thank you for sharing that You call that Crossing what Crossing the Wire Crossing the Wire Thank you I think the story of Martin Luther King is pretty similar to The Scholarship Jacket because they discriminated a lot against African Americans because of their color but Martin Luther King stood up for his race and said that we should not discriminate others because we re different We re all the same just because of color doesn t separate us Thank you very much for sharing that I agree with Jennifer Martin Luther King said that it doesn t matter where you re from or who you are everybody inside is the same and all of us are brothers Thank you very much for sharing that I have seem the movie The Blind Side which is pretty similar to the story Michael shows great leadership because he is an African American and he is poor and he tries to pull himself up to be able to play at a Catholic school to play football Thank you I agree with Carlos I ve also seen that movie and the movie has a lot of great leaders definitely Michael I agree with Carlos because in that movie Michael from the beginning he didn t want to go to school he actually had really low grades and the family he had they re from another race and even though he had really low scores they got him a tutor and they helped him like reach his goals so he could play football for the school he wanted to play Wow Thanks again I have read The Outsiders which is a story about two classes of people the Greasers and the Soches The greasers get treated real dirty because of their lower class Okay At the end what happened Did they succeed like Martha Did they achieve Some of them died Some of them died okay 
 Present your position to the other side Make sure that you include the SFI that backs up your position Okay After that three minutes we ll swap sides All right So three minutes pros go right ahead We re talking about how minorities have made a lot of progress since Reconstruction and political things Originally there was no black senators or congressman but after Reconstruction around 1865 there was two black senators and fourteen congressmen and now there s four black senators and I m sure more black congressmen It s like quadruple the representatives And other minorities are representative represented in the House and Senate so they ve made a lot of progress becoming a representative government They didn t have the knowledge of earlier So that s one way Reconstruction positively affected education in the South in America Also these statistics show that even though even though certain states are slightly low on the circulation per capita statistics Virginia is number fifteen which is relatively high for a Southern state Except Florida is number thirty four And not all Northern states were held higher than education held higher than Southern states Like Pennsylvania West Virginia and Delaware which are all Northern states are in relatively low positions on the scale And former slaves were able to kind of give back more to the culture and they influenced technology and science and advances in those And kind of started influencing culture in the South and kind of in all the United States So and it really basically spread freedom through the South and finally gave the former former slaves a voice and a place in the country And finally brought them together Y all have anything else I found The ones they could like progress forward and they could because they have so many African American positions and authors for that for that I think overall it finally gave blacks a place and gave the South a place in the country again where they had been separated for so long Kind of started bringing everybody together again Because after the Civil War the South still thought that We don t have to cooperate with the North All right guys That was pro All right Three minutes let s here the anti Three minutes and then we ll after Listen real quick guys After this three minutes we ll give it another minute okay and one more minute after that for a rebuttal okay For the final statement of the pros okay Go ahead antis 1865 time of Reconstruction and during nothing really got done If you look at the statistics the infant mortality in Mississippi is number one and if you go on to the lifestyle statistics Mississippi is the very has the least number of museums concert halls and observatories in city centers showing the link between Reconstruction and just how it affected the South and how nothing got done after the Civil War Let me I m sorry to interrupt let me ask you this What caused I mean there had to have been something I mean during Reconstruction everything was progressing Something happened to cause that overwhelming shift in numbers that you just pointed out That you know the Southern states the old Confederate states dominated the bottom of that poll Why do you think that is Why would that happen Because the North is trying to punish the South after the Civil War They re more focused on helping themselves and not helping the South Because they re more focused on slavery than actually trying the help the South because they were trying to punish them So they didn t They were trying the free the slaves they weren t trying to help the South because they didn t want them to become stronger also Was there a particular event that really solidified this that really made that come to fruition What is it the time frame of your question 1865 to 1877 Okay so During Reconstruction Right So what happened at the end of Reconstruction Why 1877 What happened in 1877 They took the military out of the South Exactly So if the military was pulled out what do you think caused this result economic constraints imposed by Northern owners and eventual overseas competition hampered development and Birmingham never developed into the world class steel making center that it was supposed to be So yeah it did sort of improve but it just never reached its potential because and it even says hampered by Northern constraints So the North basically said you can t produce more steel because we say so So you can t so Birmingham just couldn t really get any better at that point So the South has more industry now like everything in the South is in the lower twenty eight percent Okay guys listen We re going to give you one more minute You have a one minute period the pros if you want to add a little rebuttal to what you just heard okay After this minute we re going to take two minutes to compile our final position okay like our final little thesis all right that we re going to present then to the class Okay So one minute for a rebuttal from the pros Go ahead Because since the military left everybody revolted so They had no motivation Everything that had been implemented for those years went out the window and But I think it s still a positive way was that it at least it still left kind of some ideas of how to keep order and the South still kind of had gotten a taste from the military on how the Americans wanted things run and how they needed to do to function as America and so I think that mostly the military Reconstruction like that was good because it kind of came in and helped them that way What is the number of African American senators and representatives What does it show What is the difference between Reconstructive Era huge difference All right guys listen up You get two minutes I need each side to compile your final argument okay your final statement This is what you re going to present to the rest of the class Remember you need SFI to back up your position okay That SFI can be census data More importantly it can be book data Okay Just normal normal information from your text So two minutes go ahead and write it out if you want Go Each side comes up with their final points We could go into more detail on the three fifths compromise and we could mention the Ku Klux Klan intimidated even though they got the vote they were still controlled by the white people Yeah the social system still was there OK I ll write that down Could this be applied too Absolutely Remember you have to explain to the class in a way that they can understand it okay They don t have that particular census data in front of them So make sure that you re clear when you present that as SFI in front of the class Tell them how many libraries and Virginia is the only one that s in the top fifty percent Completed out of fifty and so All the Southern states are in the bottom And then this is trying to say what Twenty five right here Oh so the bottom twenty five half Existing at the time which was Should we tell them that these states aren t or should we just not tell them No I would just Most African Americans that were unskilled at the time worked through this program to become more independent workers and to learn to read and write and so I ll go back to my statistics here Virginia and Florida All right guys we re going to go in this order Listen up We re going to go in this order We re going to go economic then social political then educational Okay The pros are going to give their positions first to the class All right Now the chart that you have in front of you what I want you guys to do is while the rest of the groups are presenting their findings their positions I want you to take down three different pieces of information that you hear specific pieces of information that you guys hear from the presenter All right Because you re going to use this when you formulate your own response at the end of class to how you feel about you know the efficacy of Reconstruction based on what you ve heard Okay You re going to make your decision so you need to make sure that you have information down to support that okay to support your idea And make sure you re getting that from their presentations All right So we re going to go with economic first Economic pro you have two minutes Camille you it Yeah All right Everybody listen to Camille Okay So we came up with a thesis and it was Reconstruction positively affected America economically by bringing a broader selection of products to the South and North And the North was trying to find ways to help the South with the 13th and Alabama and Mississippi and everyone they started mining for coal and iron and everything and so that helped their economies because they were able to make more money with that instead of just cotton And the North put a few restrictions on that but that still helped their economy for more products And the North manufactured more like grain And we talked about other things that weren t really economic That was about it that we could come up with Okay Thank you All right Anti Who is our speaker today Okay Grant go ahead All right So you mentioned the steel and iron and coal industries and yes those did help But at the same time the North industries the North s economy was growing and it was growing faster than the South And there was the whole economic deals with inflation where So the South basically was making more like a higher number of dollars but it essentially was the same work as before the war 
 Look I can be a serk Now my whole house is great I can do anything good I like my school I like anything I like my dad I like my cousins I like my aunts I like my Allisons I like my mom I like my sister I like my dad I like my hair I like my hair cuts I like my pajamas I like my stuff I like my room I like my whole house My whole house is great I can do anything good Yeah yeah yeah I can do anything good Better then anyone Okay Ok what cha learn from the video She can do anything Ok what else She likes to sing Be positive She likes to sing be positive What else What else did you learn about the video Believe in yourself Believe in yourself Okay now how is this going to be related to our yearbook class Stay positive about it People get a what s gonna what the outcome s gonna be Okay and the outcome is something that we wanna be able to serve the entire school Okay what else How is this also related to yearbook and what we re trying to accomplish We shouldn t blame ourselves I m sorry We shouldn t blame ourselves Okay good good Okay so what we re going to do after this this is a good start I think for the work that we re gonna be having to do this afternoon We re gonna have to work on our ladder And I know that we ve spent some time on it we ve had to make some considerable changes But I think that the compromise the agreement that we all talked about yesterday I think it can be implemented today So what we re gonna try to do is based on These are the signatures that we have allocated One signature for elementary school One signature for middle school And five signatures for the high school I think let s try to fit it in Let s try to stay within the seven signatures Don t forget we have ads also Okay so I think Tanisha and Dustin and Jazz will be on team one And Sammy Emily and Colleen will be on team two Let s work together What are the rules of getting the teamwork going When we re trying to discuss What are the things that I want you to think about Everyone has a voice Okay everyone has a voice What else We all have to agree to a middle ground Okay And it s not just for the high school seniors Okay so it s for the entire school The elementary school middle school and high school So let s be fair and try to get everybody involved What else Discussion wise among yourselves What would I like you to be working on Collaborative work Compromise Okay let s go ahead and start You have the books there you have copies of the previous ladder Let s get it good Yeah I understand elementary school middle school high school In what order It s up to you honey If you want to start with the middle school elementary school high school I don t know maybe just cause I m a senior I kinda like that plan It just seems weird starting at the elementary school I think it s just that they re not as important just that Cause it s always started at high school It starts with the seniors and it s like this is what for Okay now remember just because it s always done before I know but If we started with the elementary school We d be starting with the fourth grade And that s really our Kind of an awkward place to start Okay now remember with your signature you were gonna start with Student Life correct With the High School So you could start with that I mean look at it and you can see And then we re gonna start it with like the introduction Um like um Pictures Student life candid shots Right And then we re going to the seniors and all the senior stuff and our classes And then the sports and night clubs Yes We re not gonna have a class class division page anymore Cause all of the classes are scrambled Are we still thinking like doing division pages Like how it was worded originally Except not for the classes Because all the classes were split up Yeah now it makes it easier to do your me right Don t forget what s our theme Me Okay so keep that it mind when you re creating your signatures And I think now that solicited more allocated the sections are allocated Your division pages maybe more adaptable They ll fit in there more Yeah They ll fit in there more Don t ya think I guess So should we just do one like just high school division page then middle school Yes try it and see See Now you might still need a division page for sports you might still need a division page But you don t need as many I think We definitely won t have one for the classes Cause they re all split up They re already split up And I think this is what helped save us pages Remember you re getting eight signatures Um Question Yeah The yearbook two pages and ads is under the high school Only because I just put that as just to remind you that we need to have ads at the very end Okay So whatever is your last section you have to have ads We have to start selling ads And again if you have any questions on the photographs Sammy is here she can help you with what ever photograph you want Show the blood drive scales And then But their only sport is the seventh grade basketball Everything else is going into high school Does it make sense Yeah yeah They all happened right there together Are we still gonna do straight lines and single lines like they did I think we might just do a big column Yeah We can still do that and then after our seniors we can explore all the classes in line And it makes sense If you have that quote Yeah We are gonna do Student Life seniors all the senior stuff And then classes Make sure that you have your page counts Are doing school division pages or are we doing section division pages I guess we could do school and then We would have to have the division pages that we thought of the spread division page with all the things It could just be different little division pages Yeah okay so Or like have the title at the top of the page Don t forget she has control of the photographs So you need to consult with her okay You can ask her Okay um So are we going to do a senior opening page I think we could just have an opening page on the division page I thought we were going to do the top Instead of doing a collage how they put in their like the song and all that on the second page Around all the photos we should put Cause in our theme or whatever it s just a strip Of pictures Blended in the big picture So we re have written around it to add in these So I think that we should put these on the first opening page Now remember we did this only because we had no choice I like well I like the happenings that we decided not to do for the opening page for the seniors Because it s new life Since our theme it s just one strip We could arrange it like this I think that we should put on that page we should put these Oh definitely Yeah good idea Well what happened is the reason why I placed it and you placed it here because when you sort it all originally it was so empty and it didn t mean anything so we went ahead and did that I think it would have been better to do that from the beginning And then we can have Alex start doing the onward for two others Do we want to put favorites before the formal I think we should put favorites So we re talking this one right These are the formals you want before the favorites No we want our favorites before our formals Oh Okay And then we re combining formal and baby pictures in quotes right Yeah Well you know what do you think Well I like combining it Can you pull up the other ladder Do you still have that one If we have that picture and then another picture and then another This one Is this the ladder you want to see Which section do you want to pull Student life I think it s on that Right here Yeah Let me know Because then I can go back and let her know So you want to start off with that So it ll be like The formal then the baby and then the quote Can you tell Emily what she missed yesterday About the quotes No were you present When you said that a lot of seniors who didn t have quotes last year They would rather have a big list of them and just have them pick and cross it off If they can come up with their own And I have a quote book Somewhere and we can start deciding We can go from very funny to very serious So the kids can have a good choice Did you want me to go back to the other one How are you deciding the order Is it just from serious to funny or Well it s more funner stuff the memories into the more serious stuff And you re ending it with the grauduation Yeah You rather repeat our homecoming But that s spirit week There s another one That s what homecoming fills This is the problem On the other ladder that we had the only high school Student Life we had was Holten Hemming and Spirit Week That s the same thing Yeah Hemming and Spirit Week Like one spread and then the awards honors Well that doesn t make up for all the signatures Oh then we had prom You had the prom and then you had how about the senior the um Sports Banquet Sports Banquet should award everybody Not just seniors Yeah it s got uh Do you want to put that under student I don t What if we You cut the prom down to one page but maybe we could put it back to two pages we could show like the planning of prom and setting it up Okay but Cause I m on the prom committee Okay so and you have your committee meeting start taking pictures Guys remember we have seven cameras So take cameras with you when you re having little meetings Just make sure you re flexible enough just in case we don t have enough pictures you can flip back to one page instead of the signature I mean instead of a spread Well I don t know how we re gonna fill up the signature then Well you don t have to have we can move everything up And then we move seniors up into another half of the signature and that half would have to be colored Because it s the senior signature Um Do you have a section for committee We had those in with the clubs With like all of their what they do in the community Okay if you want you can bring it up a little more Just the overall community that doesn t have a club And use up that space Like the blood drive The blood drive is not part of the school Rotary does that Rotary yes but that s the interact is with Rotary yes Yeah we help with that We help Rotary But you also do the Victorian Classic Yes You don t have enough space You need to put the blood drive up I mean how much space breaks A spread Oh Interact has a spread Yeah we ve covered this three times now Okay sorry Yes but we ve changed it three times So Find other community things Well if you want do you want to talk about the tax bill Well that s not really student life It s going to affect your life Yeah but 
 One eighth plus one eighth is Oh one eighth okay Is she adding one eighth together a bunch of times Where do you see that Can you come up and show us You have to get seven of them Okay Katriana could you add that number sentence up above your picture also So I like how you re all thinking while she s writing this There s a couple different ways we can represent this I think Anielli and lots a groups had their hand up were right that she did I can see she took seven pizzas and divided it into eight pieces for eight people And I also see where and when I talk to Katriana she said Well I got one eighth plus one eighth and one eighth and one eighth and one eighth How much is that gonna add up to equal She s got one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth Seven eighths Seven eighths okay And that s how much pizza she told us What about seven divided by eight A bunch a groups kept their hand down after Anielli shared that number sentence But it s not a complete number sentence until we can finish that equation What would seven divided by eight come out to equal do you think Talk at your group for just a minute again I think we re just a little bit unsure What are you thinkin for seven divided by eight Let s come talk it over with this group You check with this group I ll check with this group What are ya ll thinkin up here Well what do you see in her representation You see how many pizza s Okay seven pizzas Eight people And eight people Did she divide those seven pizzas into eight groups Okay so we ve just gotta figure out how much then that s gonna come out to equal I m not sure Talk about it as a group You can draw it on the back Okay Yes thank you ma am Okay thank you so much for talkin with your group What did you or someone at your group think again If we ve got seven pizzas divided by eight people Katia We ve got 56 divided by eight because there s 56 pieces and it s kinda Okay so you noticed there s and it s cut into Eight Eight slices So you were thinking something a little bit differently Savannah We I thought the same way except I thought that it was gonna be 56 Divided by seven because Each one of them is shaded in and they re all going to eight people Okay Let me ask us all this I love that we re relating this back thinking about some of our math facts and how that can tie in and help us But what did Katriana start with here What do you think the first thing she did was What did she do Steven Drew seven or eight pizzas Did she draw seven pizzas or eight pizzas Seven Seven pizzas Is that what she did first Okay She drew out her seven pizzas So we wanna know or we need to know that that s what she started with What did she divide those pizzas into Into eighths Into eight We see she cut em into eight pizzas Brennan I did I was thinking either 700 or seven tenths Okay So we re thinking back to fractions I think since we don t have a definite answer we don t need to yet Let s leave this kinda open ended but I m gonna circle it so that we remember to come back to it So we ve gotta a great number sentence that one thing Katriana did was add up one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth plus one eighth and she got seven eighths and we re gonna keep thinking about I saw a bit of agreement that seven pizzas she divided by eight people But we need to figure out ladies how much that would mean each person gets So put a big arrow So as we continue let s keep that in our mind Okay thank you Can I have The person who put this one up in black Faith was that you Will you come tell us what you did and what you think the answer might be here How much pizza each person got Well I knew there was eight soccer players so there were seven pizzas so I did seven pizzas Then I divided six of em up in to fourths and then I numbered em all And then when I got to eight I started one two three back over again when I got to another eight I did it again but then I realized that there wasn t enough or more so I split the last pizza up into eighths and that equals up to eight people Okay and that equaled up to eight people So how much pizza do you think each person gets Well I think that each person would get at least one fourth and Okay so let s write this up here So you said each person gets let s put it up in black How much Like let s say person number 1 How much pizza do they get Will you show us They would get one two three They would get three fourths Okay And then one eighth Three fourths and one eighth Like this Okay do you know how much that is all together That would That would equal up to four Okay So let s think about this one for a minute Do you have any questions for Faith about how she figured this out Okay I think she did a great job explaining her picture So she showed us where each person gets three fourths plus one eighth Will you talk at your group How much is that How much is that total Thank you if you wanna join a group Good explanation Okay group what do we think Four twelfths You agree with her four twelfths How did you come up with four twelfths By adding those two together How did you add them together Three plus one would equal four and then four would be the numerator because you added the two top numbers And if you added the two bottom numbers it would equal twelve for the denominator Okay so is there a picture or is there a way that we could show this with pictures that that would come out to equal four twelfths See on the back of your paper once will you draw a representation of four twelfths How come Because I thought that if the denominators were different we couldn t add them up directly Oh So we tried to get the denominators the same What do we call that Equal to fractions I like that your thinking back to remember your vocabulary I tried to tell Katia that if it has a different number on the bottom then we re supposed to add the on the bottom to I don t know Have we learned to do that before Well no but I just thought about it and I ve been practicing Okay So if we haven t learned it yet we ve gotta think about how are we gonna figure it out right Okay so keep thinking It s okay that we re debating between a couple different answers just tryin to explain to each other why you re thinking four twelfths and why you re thinking something different I thought it was because Whenever you add it up And the denominator Okay So I understand where you got the four slices But what size are those slices Would be my next question Because we wanna make sure every soccer player gets the same amount cause I would be upset if I didn t get as much pizza as you did I like pizza Okay Okay well it says four twelfths so we re shading four Do you have 12 pieces there We have one two three Okay If I can have your attention back I know some of you are still discussing and doing a great job But I wanna make sure that we ve got time to get through the rest of our solutions before we re out of time for the day Hailey if I can have you close the door again for us And can I hear what a couple of your groups came up with I heard three or four different things as I was going around Three fourths Hannah said each person gets three fourths of a pizza and one eighth Faith said How much is that Yes I m sorry Faith said since ya ll sat next to each other I still mess that up Three fourths and one eighth How much did you or your group think that came out to be Nathan We came up with seven eighths Seven eighths Because when you take three fourths and then you take another circle that shows one eighth then you divide the three fourths into eighths then add the the ones that used to be three fourths and that equals seven eighths Can you come up and show that to us I think I think I followed in my head but did you all have trouble making that picture in your head Yes A little bit yeah Can you show us You can draw it here or over here we ve got lots of room Nathan you re right Shhh Okay let s see what he does Okay can you step to the step to the side so everybody in the class can see you There you go And then if you divide that into eighths then you add one of the eighths then you add this over here It comes out to be seven eighths Can I just get in agreement or disagreement somebody who had shared with us What do you think about what he just did I saw him draw three eighths at one pizza and one or three fourths of one pizza and one eighth of the next And then I saw him cut this one into eighths How many eighths was three fourths When you cut it Six eighths And then he put one more eighth over and seven eighths What are you thinkin about that Brazy I agree with him Why Because our group said that we know that four eighths is equal to twelve fourths is equivalent to seven eighths and his picture we can see that it s two and when he was workin it out we could see that it was right and so I agree with him Okay Brennan I agree with him but I have a different explanation Okay One fourth is equal to two eighths but then you take Oh I m sorry Let me write this as you re saying it so we can follow it So you said One fourth is equal to two eighths Okay So We multiplied the three and the numerator with three fourths Okay By two which comes from the two eighths and it would equal up to six eighths plus that one extra eighth it would be seven eighths Okay so you said three fourths is equivalent to Six eighths Six eighths okay And then just add the other one seven eighths Okay so then you did six eighths plus one eighth equals seven eighths like that Okay can I just see a quick on your remotes do you agree or disagree with Nathan and Brennan So A is I agree B I disagree or I m confused What s confused We ll just do A and B A is I agree I understand or B is I disagree or I m confused How are you feeling right now about what Brennan and Nathan just said They re two different explanations I just wanna see right now do you agree or disagree with what Brennan and Nathan just said And again they were saying that three fourths plus one eighth is gonna come out to equal seven eighths And they each kinda explained it a different way One with words and one with a picture Need a couple more people to vote if they agree or disagree Number three number eleven we need a vote from you please Where is remote number three There it comes Okay What do we what do we know by looking at this graph What do we know by looking at this graph Thomas 
 What if it comes from like a polluted creek or something or some kind of bad water system in the ground Number three I say crystal clear and filtered I said how dirty the water gets How good the water is for you It doesn t have stuff dying in it it s crystal clear and it doesn t smell Okay class if we can pull back together please as a group I was hearing excellent discussions between each of the three questions and I think we have some very valuable points to go ahead and talk about So what we re gonna do is kind of create a little bit of a list up here to help us remind later when I go to show you something So we re gonna start again with that first question and I m looking for you to participate and share some of those questions together So it says again how do you know if water is safe or not And I heard wonderful responses so can I hear some of those please Brandon please start us Color and odor Okay so you know if water is safe or not depending on again the color and the odor Good what are some other responses Brandon Remember where you got it from Like if it was in a creek that looks fine it s probably safe to drink but if it s from a polluted creek that has a really weird color to it or it s in a weird location don t drink it Okay so I m commenting here I have it depends on the source you re getting it from and so if it s a creek that looks to be clean or clear then you know it s probably okay And if it looks to have like a weird color I think you mentioned again to it or polluted or in a weird location then maybe it s not safe All right what were some of your other responses Jack Um if it goes through a quality filter Okay if it goes through a quality filter And Jack can you maybe think of an example of a quality filter A Culligan filter for the drinking water Okay so a Culligan filter that you can use to filter out the water Okay good Madeline There s no large pieces of trash or anything in the water Okay so you can look for visible signs of large trash and Madeline what was the second part of that Nothing that looks unnatural in it Okay so nothing that looks unnatural Great Anybody else any answers for number one Again how do you know if it s safe or not Lexi I think you had another answer that may have been covered up here What did you say when I was talking with your group about The smell Okay the smell again the odor of it Okay great Brandon you thought of another one If there s something dead in it If there s something dead in it so again we re going based on those visual aspects of it Good Well we re gonna come back to that here in just a moment so we ll move on to number two When are times when the water might not be safe Walker After an earthquake or another disaster Okay so after an earthquake And Walker can I have you expand a little bit What would be so significant after an earthquake or another disaster that would make the water not safe Because maybe something fell in the water or I don t know I just heard that before Okay so you heard it before and if something fell in the water Did you happen to see at all in Japan after the tsunami came through there Do you remember any of those images Yeah kinda they were different colors and yeah Okay and I think I heard somebody else say that they remembered seeing a point that maybe we can add onto Elvis At the beach At the beach What do you mean by at the beach There s different times where the water might not be safe Okay can you think of a specific example like have you experienced a time when you weren t allowed to be at the beach When somethings dangerous in the water Okay if something s dangerous in the water Sometimes they might tell you that it s not safe to be there Okay Any other times that might make the water not safe Amelia can you think of any times where the water might not be safe I have after storms like um Walker did Okay what are some things then because this is something I m hearing so far What are some things after the storm that might be in the water besides I think you said some stuff can fall in the water What are some of the things that might be in the water that would make it not safe Aashi can you think of something that might get in the water Um like tree branches or animals Okay so tree branches and animals that s good Can you think of anything else that might get in the water that maybe wouldn t normally be there Kris Trash Trash okay Can you think of a specific kind of trash Lexi Glass Glass And what would be the danger of glass getting in the water It s sharp and can cut yourself Okay so there s a chance of getting injured if you cut yourself What else think outside the box a little bit more What else could get in the water that you would not normally want in your water Madeline Plastic bags and then you can suffocate animals Okay so plastic bags that they suffocate animals something along those lines Elvis Oil and gasoline Oil and gasoline good Brandon Toxins Toxins okay Jack Plastic six pack holders Because it strangles the fish and everything Okay now lets think I m glad you guys are all concerned about the fish and the animals and all of that but what about we as humans can you think of anything that would get in the water that would be potentially harmful to us afterward Go ahead Pesticides Pesticides okay Brandon Fertilizer Fertilizers Elvis A car What is it again A car A car okay All right well we ll come back to those in just a minute So looking at we ve kind of come up with a list here of how you would determine if things are safe or not So then I guess my question would become if you look at it s color and you look at if it s in a source that looks safe or not how would you be able to determine if something is safe to drink So maybe that might change your perspective a little bit So is there a difference between being able to drink something and maybe being able to swim in something In fact let me give you just a minute to talk about that with your partner for a minute so my question to you again is it are there different things we should look for in water that we drink versus maybe water that we swim in or take a shower in And I want you to talk about that with your partner and jot down a couple notes about that so go ahead That s interesting to hear you saying shower water isn t as filtered as your drinking water Our pool is safe they put a water cover over our pool so it was different At our pool they changed from too much chlorine can burn people s eyes so they changed it Yeah definitely a bigger job but they put a small amount of chlorine in it so all the bacteria that s on us if you go swim in the pool it wouldn t matter as opposed to in the shower because it s different Even if you do have a water cover still it could seep through and that s how they clean it When they open the pool it takes like a month because they have to go through the water thing and all the filters Okay we ll come back together as a group one more time Thank you all again I hear great discussions going on So let s talk about this There s some very neat ideas of whether you think something is safe to drink versus whether or not it s okay to shower or to swim in So what were some comments you were talking about in your smaller groups Again I heard some great discussions going on Mikenna what did your group talk about Shower water isn t as filtered as drinking water Okay so in their group they believe that shower water was not as filtered as what the water is that you drink in so if it s not as filtered where would your drinking water be coming from that maybe your shower water isn t coming from Okay is there a reason that maybe you thought along sometime where the shower water is not as filtered as your drinking water No No okay It just makes sense to you that maybe the stuff that comes out of the tap to drink is not necessarily the same thing coming out of your pipes for the shower Okay what were some other comments about that Larry what did you guys talk about May I have your attention please Would all Spelling Bee winners please report to the auditorium at this time for the Spelling Bee Again all Spelling Bee winners please report to the auditorium at this time for the Spelling Bee Thank you Okay so Larry to expand upon that and I think he brought up a really good point He said that maybe the water that you were you saying Larry swimming or showering He was saying that the water we drink Hold on just one second Isaiah just one second Okay good I wanted to make sure I wasn t saying it incorrectly So what he was saying is in other words when you shower or when you are going swimming that water is not necessarily going in your body you re not consuming that water so there would be a difference possibly between the water you re swimming in versus the water that you re drinking Walker I said that you would swim in darker water than you drink or shower in Okay so sometimes you think that the water you ve been in when you swim is darker So going back to the color difference that talked about here Okay interesting Lexi The shower water and the water that we drink I think is sort of the same but they go through a different process but if we go swimming at our community pool it s different because there s more chlorine and stuff so you have bacteria on you and you re just swimming you not really intaking it But at your house when you drink or take a shower it s different Okay Would you say that Because I think it s probably safe to say you guys mostly agree that there is a difference between drinking water and water you would shower in versus water that maybe you would go swimming in So what are some of those differences What might be what might they have to do to that water Lexi was talking about maybe it would have to be treated differently or that there would be chemicals added to it So can you think of what they would do to the water in a swimming pool versus water that you drink to make it different I think Jack mentioned about filtering and Mikenna also brought up the point about it being filtered different Brandon Well they put more chemicals in the swimming pool because there s gonna be more germs and when people swim in it so that will kill off the germs As in drinking water is not as much chemicals because there s not really any germs you re just drinking it so Okay good So what I m hearing is the amount of something so would you all agree as a class if we were to drink swimming water would you die No No probably not right But the amount of the chemical that is in the water might be something that would cause some effects or cause some harm to you So do you think that there is chlorine in your drinking water Because we said it s in the swimming pool probably to help kill off bacteria Do you think that and I m hearing a little bit of a disagreeance here so I d love to hear your conversation in just a minute Elvis what do you think There is chlorine in the drinking water but then they purify it so So they purify out the chlorine after they put the chlorine into the drinking water Yeah Okay good And Isaiah what were you thinking about I think you were saying no that there isn t the chlorine My question is if there was chlorine in drinking water I mean you can purify it but it may still stay around that water then why would you drink it I mean sure it can knock out the bacteria and germs but why drink it if it has chlorine in it Because that s not good for you Okay and going back to the amounts of it and you re thinking that even the smallest amount might not be healthy for you to put in your system Okay Jack Well for a normal tap system I think it s the last or second last step they do is they insert really small amount of chlorine into all tap water usually in a normal town And so then a lot of people have chlorine in their drinking water but for some people who have specialized filters for drinking water they re designed to filter out all of the chlorine so that it s mostly just water that they re getting So some people have a filter installed Okay and would you be able to tell based on the color because that seems to be what a lot of people are using as their indicator of good water Would you be able to tell just by the color whether or not there s a lot of chlorine in it Maybe maybe not I don t know if this contributes to it but sometimes I look at my drinking water compared to the tap water and the tap water is a lot more foggy so I don t know if that s because the chlorine or because it s aerated or something but I don t know Okay good thank you for sharing that Elvis You can buy those little filters that you can screw onto your taps so that way it filters down the water I have one and it filters out tap water Okay and it s filtering out more of the amount or maybe none of it at all Okay Let s go back oh go ahead Madeline I would just like to say to Isaiah s comment we sort of have to have chlorine in our water because there would be more bacteria if we didn t so there s a reason for it and it s not that much So it would do you less harm to have the chlorine in the water than to not have it Okay so the benefits of what you re saying is that you would at least have to have a little bit to kill off the bacteria and that would outweigh the fact of you not having anything at all and then being exposed to maybe whatever is in the water that the chlorine is not killing off right Okay very good Let s look at We ve used again some criteria and let s look at that final question of what is your definition of water quality So in other words I think Jordan I heard in your discussion could you read your answer for us one more time about what you think water quality is to you Water quality is how good the water is for you to drink Good how good the water is for you to drink Can I hear another definition of water quality Kris what did you decide How clean the water was How clean the water was okay And how would you determine if the water is clean or not What was your number one indicator When you drink it When you drink it okay So if you drink it and you know that it s clean then it has good water quality to it All right Isaiah My definition of water quality is how much of the water is polluted and how much of the water is pure So polluted versus pure and then kind of a ratio of if it s polluted and more pure then it s better water quality Okay Rachel how about your definition of water quality We said that water quality was how much of the water is pure water and how much of it s polluted Okay so going back to that same definition together as you all talked And Ashani what did you think water quality would be How good the water is because some water it like tastes different you can tell Okay so the taste Have you ever experienced where water might taste a little different can you think of an example My aunt s house when we go to her house it s always different from our house And what kind of taste would you say It s gross It s gross water Maybe back to when we were talking about well water in here versus the regular city water and it has a different taste to it So what we re gonna do is using your ideas so far you guys have told me again based on color and you mentioned about the smell of it and you ve mentioned about tasting the water So I have here three different liquids that I m going to go around and show you and on your paper you re going to determine if these liquids are safe or if these liquids are not And since we have already discussed that there s probably different qualities for your water versus the water you drink versus the water that you swim in or the water that you are going to take a shower in so when you comment upon whether those liquids are safe or not I think it would probably be a wise decision to comment if you think they re safe to drink versus safe to shower or to swim So I ll start here with cup letter A So you can go ahead and mark A on your paper and then I will walk around so you can just take an observation of the liquid And you determine again if you think that it is safe All right so what do you all think Logan Do you think that this is safe to drink So if I gave this to you right now you d go ahead and drink it because it would be safe No No What would make you change your answer then 
 And one more There s this one spider and he s around all day and then he comes and comes out Oh so it s waiting for him You know i ts like a trap It covers itself in the flower and like it sets in the flower It sits perfectly still in the flower and then when something lands on it it attacks it and eats it Wonderful so they re not really attracted to flowers they re attracted to the insects in order to ambush them Is that what you re telling me Yes Okay all right So and we talked about what is it that attracts these Well we see a lot of bugs we see humming birds and Jack mentioned this word pollen Do you know what pollen is Do you know what pollen is Ah Do you know what pollen is Are these things attracted to the pollen Yes Well not really though No not really Sometimes Sometimes I guess Say that again please It s an ingredient to make honey Pollen is an ingredient to make honey Oh nectar Yeah So bees are attracted to flowers because of their blank Nectar Go ahead Jimmy How would you fill this in The bees are attracted to flowers because of their blank Go ahead and write your answer in Oh okay I see some people writing pollen You have color They re definitely attracted to their color We have nectar And we have we actually have all of them here So which one is it Is it one of these or all of these All of these All of them All of them tell me more Tell me I think it s pollen and nectar because the nectar s in the pollen and the bees take the pollen and then use the pollen to make stuff or honey out of it So it s kind of like taking it to its So we say that flowers attract insects so we can connect these two ideas here And we ve talked about their color The insects were attracted because of their color and they re also attracted because of their Nectar Nectar okay let s put nectar right here And they re also attracted because of their good smell No Yeah Yeah No The nectar smells good that s why butterflies go to them Maybe look that up on Google Why do you think flowers take all the trouble to make them smell good So bees will go to them Why do people go to trouble to smell good Why not Because it would be gross Say that again Attention You want attention You want to be attractive to other people too Heck no Maybe you re too young for that Yeah when you get older don t you want to attract other people Sure Don t you want other people to find you pleasant Yes You know it s not a big thing but are these fragrances signals to these insects They re attractive right And we ll talk about I agree they are useful but that s not going to fit into my process just yet But all of these things do attract the insects right But what is it that keeps the insects coming back It s sort of like the color the smell you know the maybe the shape of the flower All of these things are like advertisements to the insects Why For the nectar For the nectar It s the nectar that s going to keep them coming back All right you see this bee here What s all this yellow stuff on the bee Pollen Pollen Does the pollen attract the bee No Does the bee want the pollen No Yes and no because the pollen helps all of the flowers to stay alive The pollen is definitely important to the flower right Mm hm The bees just spread it around The bees spread it around How many people are aware that bees spread pollen I see just about all your hands go up So the insects are spreading let s put that up here they re going to spread the stuff called pollen Right Of course the insects are really getting what Nectar Yeah so let s put they are taking or they obtain this nectar here right And nectar is another word for what Food You all understand that nectar is their food For the bees For the bees Just the bees No and hummingbirds And insects Us And hummingbirds Us us we have honey Nectar is technically honey So nectar is actually a food for us because we steal it from the bees right Yeah And we hide it from the bears yes Isn t there this one point where it has saliva or something in the bottom of it and it s in the shape of a picture and all of these flies and everything are attracted from the sweet smell and everything and they get into the water they can t move and everything they re paralyzed Okay it s a trap Yeah Like the venus fly trap Just like the venus fly trap Yeah I don t know what it s called Do venus fly traps have flowers No they have clear white The mouth smells really sweet That s because it catches flies Okay we re going to talk about that in a minute A lot of people when I was reading your paragraphs a lot of people told me that venus fly traps were one of the many kinds of plants that don t have flowers All right but let s look at this thing about pollen for a minute Why is it that the flowers want these insects to keep stealing their nectar What s going on here They want them to spread the pollen but why To make more food To make what To make more food You think it s to make more food What do you think Olivia To make like honey The flowers want the bees to make honey No they like need it to make more food Pollen is an ingredient for nectar to make I understand that but why does the flower go to all this trouble Do flowers just like bees No They say hey you re a nice guy We ll make you some To keep them alive I think To keep the flowers are making the food to keep the bees alive No I don t know That s okay that s okay What do you think Joe To fertilize other flowers Fertilize What s fertilize You mean to like give them like fertilizer on the ground Or are you talking about a different kind of fertilizer Different You re calling it a different kind of fertilizer Interesting How many people understand that flowers are related to fertilization How many people have heard that before Hands up here okay So if you want to ask what pollen is you might want to ask what flowers do All right and to answer that I first of all let s make sure this dandelion is this a flower or is this a weed Flower A weed Okay thumbs up or thumbs down Who says it s a weed Okay I see most of you thumbs up a couple of you have sideways or down Next how about this one how many people think it s a flower Okay How many people say it s a weed and a flower Now I see some people who don t know Well let me ask you this If you re to look at this here s a pretty good picture of it what makes you think it s a flower Are there characteristics about this plant that make you think it s a flower Yes I don t think it s a flower That s not my question Are there characteristics about this that make you think it s a flower Yes What would those be The petals The petals Excellent Anything else It s color It s colorful Anything else It has some nectar maybe You think it has nectar Maybe a little bit Have you ever seen insects hovering around dandelions Yes Who have seen who have seen Yeah it s very common Well you can actually see bees on top of on top of flowers Here s a close up of the dandelion What do you notice there That looks a lot more ugly It looks ugly Yeah Really No it looks cool It looks like water spouts goin like It does look like water What do you see on the side here Pollen Does that look like pollen What does pollen look like Just tiny balls of stuff Of stuff yeah There those tiny little like they look like little leftover pieces just hanging off the side of the stem and it s with the bees and it sticks to the bees when they land on the flower so it stays with them for a while A ball and then it sticks to the bee like if you want to see the bee it s got all the yellow stuff on his leg Yeah we had the picture earlier yeah Yeah I saw a bee on a flower in the summer and he had a bunch of that yellow stuff on his body Cool Actually that s the pollen So the pollen so it is picking up pollen So it sounds to me that I guess what I want to convince you is that dandelions are flowers They are Yeah they re definitely flowers Let me show you a picture of a dandelion A little video it s about one minute long and let s go ahead and turn the lights off And as you re watching it just tell me what you observe happening in the video Just go ahead and shout it out The flower is opening it s blossoming Okay this is time lapse so this is happening a lot faster than what it really normally but you saw the flower open It s dormant dying now And now it s closing up and it s dying It s going dormant It s dead How many people think it s dead No it s still growing It s dormant It s growing into that white stuff Say that again It s turning into that thing in the ball That s like Marissa s making a prediction It s gonna grow taller No it s going to break up Do you see the insects all over it Every now and then you can kind of see an insect on it Oh yeah Yeah there s one down at the root At the very base of it Yeah something s happening Something s happening It got taller on the screen Oh the bottom petals are starting to die What s that It s starting to look like an onion What s that thing on the top It s going to blow away It s going to grow into a dandelion That was the flower wasn t it That s the thing you blow on What s that They re seeds they re seeds Yeah you blow on them and it s really fun It s reproducing I m hearing Steven say they re seeds And Brandon oh that thing disappeared That whole top blew away That s the stuff that you like to blow How many people think these are seeds I know they are Ah Andrew s thinking So the flower turned into what A seed A reproducer A big seed No they re all little seeds No they re all individual seeds Are they blowing Yes Make a wish Can I have the lights on please So you have Like a month period Yeah that took a while And I think you ve seen dandelions you may not have you ve probably seen the dandelions in two stages Sometimes they re like gel flowers and later they turn into these little white puffy seed pods right You puff on them and they blow in the wind Yeah what does the wind do It blows them away and it starts reproducing So each seed is like a little parachute Yeah And it s dispersed to new lands Yes All right so if I were to say flowers if I were to make a connection between flowers and seeds what would you say about that What will you say What is the connection between flowers and seeds McKenzie They both reproduce They re both related to reproduction Okay uh huh One makes another Okay so one flowers make seeds or flowers produce seeds and there s that word that McKenzie was using reproduce because seeds grow into Flowers Flowers which then Grow into seeds Which then Grow into more plants What does that sound like Life cycles Wonderful wonderful these are life cycles What I m going to ask you to do right now is we re going to look at a seed very very closely I have some you know what these are Lima beans Oh I love lima beans You do really Yeah Oh I don t like lima beans I ve never tried them I like them in my favorite dish chicken pot pie My dad loves lima beans anyway I have some They have been soaking overnight in some water and they re going to look a little bit different because they ve been soaking under water What I want you to do is when you get one I want you to open it up like a book Dig your thumbnails into the side of the seed and open it up very carefully and I want you to look inside That s what the magnifying glasses are for I want you to be able to tell me what do you find inside the seed Everyone clear Go ahead one person from each table come up and get a couple of seeds How many Oh you know what Get maybe three of them in case one of them doesn t work We have a spare Three not unbroken nice plump seeds Take them to your seat I just want you to look at them They re bigger They are bigger aren t they What else are they They re sort of hard They look like mandarin oranges Why s that what makes you think they re like oranges They re not hard anymore They re no what They re not hard anymore They re not hard We grew them last year What s that We grew them last year Oh you grew these last year What do these turn into Farmer s They turn into plants What are we supposed to be looking for Well you tell me Don t break them open Here s how I want you Can I borrow this Okay I want you to go to the round part here and you notice it has like a seed coat Yeah Okay you know kind of peel that back Oh cool And then open it up like a book Okay I m looking at the skin Like this Yeah open it up like a book and look inside and see what you find There s a little surprise there What is this It s a bug It s located yeah Oh gross Mine s already broken so Well you have a good one right here This is perfect Oh I see it Look at that That s a really good one I don t see it Yeah go ahead break it Just like you did I can t open it And oh yours is right here Yours kind of fell apart Do you have another seed Be there in a second Okay Oh there it is right there Do you see that I don t have one Look at it very carefully with the magnifiers What do you have Let me see what you got Yeah right there There s actually part of it right here broke in half and that s attached and there s also a little bit here Perfect look at this Patrick That s what you want to look at I can t open mine See it see it there What do you see I don t see it Oh there is a little bit of green there isn t there Yeah Who else is having trouble Me I already opened mine Yes you did Are they supposed to smell bad Yeah they do kind of smell don t they Yeah they smell Did you see that whole thing right on the tip Look at that under the magnifying glass Okay okay look at my photograph up here Here we go This is kind of what you re looking at You have these two like little half circles little kidney shaped starchy figures but what is this thing right here It s a seed It s starting to sprout What is it It s a start of a lima bean I thought this whole thing right here It s the start of a lima bean plant This is like a plant sprouting out Is that what you re trying to say Steven What s that Is there anything about this that makes you look like a plant or makes you think it might be a plant Like that like the big parts might be like maybe like the soil or the stuff that needs to get bigger Like when we add water to stuff it starts to get bigger Well did you notice there are two parts to it Yeah Yeah it like goes down There is what s this right here It s the sprout Okay I heard you say it looks like a stem Anybody think it looks like anything else Uh huh Go ahead McKenzie Why are these pointing here Why are these pointed It s kind of new That makes sense Looking to break through Break through the The soil And what breaks through the soil What part of the plant breaks through the soil The seed The root Does it look like a root Yeah How many people think it looks a little bit like a root And this looks a little bit like a stem What does this look like to you A flower Let me see it looks like this and there s another one that kind of looks like that What does that look like to you Leaves Leaves What do leaves okay Do you ever see anybody draw pictures Whats that It looks like a carrot It looks like a carrot doesn t it Okay look at those leaf like structures very carefully with your magnifier I want you to look for a detail You see a little characteristic Oh I see it I see it What do you see I see like the veins of a leaf Wonderful I don t Oh yeah I do Wonderful you have little veins there on the leaf Yeah you can see 
 They re coming around They re coming around When you have it You re a Grand Old Flag goes under your seats What Do the Stars Do Put them in your hands William why don t you come sit next to Victoria Do you mind Because then you re a little closer Just move a little closer to Jeffrey Stand Reach Stand up Stand up Big breath Oh my goodness Relax Put your hands here Get a diaphragm breath instead of

we go I am so impressed that you remember so much of that That was beautiful We re gonna do it again We want a really round ooh and I need a little more emotion on Do you feel it Think about it You re singing to the stars How cool is that Right Here we go Not like celebrities either like the actual stars in the sky Here we go Love what I m hearing Is the word do interesting Or do we just kind of seem to hold it forever and it s kind of boring Speak really loudly Christopher what was your idea We could crescendo We could crescendo I think that s a great idea I think it needs some kind of motion So let s put a little crescendo on the word do Ryan what s your question A sforzando We ll try that in a second Let s see We ll choose which one we like better Let s try just a crescendo on do just to keep it interesting So it s Try and do it in one breath If you have to breathe Don t breathe at the same time as your neighbor Stagger Ready Here we go I love the crescendo We have to get it together for up Right Let s try Ryan s idea You want to do a sforzando on do Okay Let s try it Ready So it s That was your idea too Maria Let s try that Ready Here we go You like that You like it Raise a hand for crescendo Quiet A quick quiet hand Raise that quiet hand for crescendo Raise a quiet hand for sforzando Okay Sforzando wins That s what we re gonna do on the word do Love it It s really really pretty Make sure the word do You keep it really nice and open Claire are you sitting on a chair Or are you sitting between Rose and Garrety Just go grab a chair You don t have to squish like that Ready Here we go It s okay I know she came in a little late So that s why she s You looked a little too close for comfort over there Yeah very strong Yes Ready Just Lauren move in a little bit What happens there What happens there on that one It goes one up higher Thank you Rachel Right Can we start right before 11 Pick ups to 11 Ready Here we go What comes next Where are we That s how far we want to get today on that Look at where the clouds where the clouds can fly Notice part three does Is your pitch after the word higher lower or the same as the pitch in part three Higher lower or the same as the pitch as below Are you sure We start on the same So that s how you re gonna know to Yeah Is this gonna be beautiful This is gonna be Sorry I think this is gonna be really beautiful like which one we just did Yeah It has a lot of the same kind of qualities but there s some really rich harmonies and some really rich beautiful opportunities for crescendo and decrescendo and all that kind of stuff Yes The whole song isn t a cappella It s a cappella in parts Yeah It starts out a cappella which means no piano Jeffrey sit up It s a cappella for a little while and then the piano comes in Then it s a cappella again and then the piano comes in and then it ends a cappella So it kind of goes back and forth What we want to get from this for today from this piece is I want to hear your expression I want to hear that crescendo that decrescendo Same thing on the word clouds What do we think What should It s another one of those long notes So we need to do something with it What should we do with it Decrescendo Put a crescendo in it Energize it a little bit Should we try each Should we try a decrescendo and try a crescendo and see which one we like better So the long cloud Two of them We have two of them So let s energize them and then we ll try backing off Let s see Ready I believe that s our pitch Ready Here we go One Two Do we like that Just energize it a little bit That was crescendo Do we want to try backing off Which one do we like better you guys Let s try the decrescendo Ryan question Oh one of each That s what you re thinking Rose So make one crescendo one decrescendo So maybe which one So first one grow second one decrescendo Yeah kind of pulling back a little Posture First one is gonna grow Ready I love it I love it Let s do from the beginning of that piece All right Think about your expression Singing about stars One two three one Beginning So it s and our do What were we gonna do with it I know it s hard when I m by the piano I won t be Ready Here we go Beautiful Beautiful I think that piece is gonna be gorgeous I can t believe it s only your second day on it Yeah You know what The clouds or the clouds can fly had a really beautiful crescendo lovely expression Put that one under your chair and take out You re a Grand Old Flag 
 confusing for people to understand but we re looking at density today We re looking at how much stuff is packed in a certain area So if you flip over to the back of your paper you ve got that little box at the top And it tells you one of the reasons some of the objects float while the other objects sank is because of their density If you could write down the definition of density in your box I would appreciate that The amount of matter when I say stuff like when we were learning about solids liquids and gases at the beginning of the year stuff is matter So the amount of matter that s in a certain area is an object s density It s not its mass it s its density So the marble is more dense than the Styrofoam ball Okay So now that we know the word density we re going to start using the word density for the next part The amount of stuff packed in a certain area or the amount of matter The marble had more matter in that small area than the Styrofoam ball The Styrofoam ball is spread out and have all those air holes making that matter more spread out less dense Krayla Yes right now Okay All right So that was simple I want you to go ahead and put a C over your 10 at the top of this if you haven t And I want you to take a look at the part one on your paper Yesterday we looked at how pressure could effect the mantle but now we need to look at something different I want you to answer number one and two first and then we ll talk about it This is just what you know before you come in my room to get you into the lesson So number one wants to know list a few things that you have seen float before Number two wants to know what do you think might cause these things to float So first just make a little list of two three things that you ve seen floating before and then tell me on number two if it s a hypothesis you may not know for sure that s fine but what do you think causes them to float Nathan Are we allowed to write both Yeah Yeah so right now you re just going to make a little list on number one and then number two you re going to tell me what do you think actually causes these things that you wrote down to be able to float We re going to start with that first This is just to get us thinking about what we re doing today One and two please What do you think causes them to float You might not be sure of the answer to number two but I still want you to make a hypothesis You don t have to write I think because but you can tell me what you think causes that Number two s going to be harder than number one Yeah Let s take four things tell me four things that you ve seen float before We ll take four because we can probably sit here and name like 100 Cole give me one Ice cubes Ice cubes Sadie Boat A boat Alex Shoes Shoes And Emily Dog toy Dog toys okay Now we know things can float and that s great But what do you think causes these things to float Why do you think dog toys and a boat and ice cubes and things like that why are they are going to be able to float Ebony what do you think The air in them The amount of air that s in them Anybody else Dylan They are less dense Okay Sean Surface tension Surface tension Little air pockets that are in them Okay air pockets I was thinking like the less density inside of it Okay alright we re going to take a look at that today So you ve got a kind of idea we re going to look at what causes something to sink and what effects if something floats Alright we have two parts that we are going to be going to our last stations for So let s take a look at part two last station observation You have two setups at your lab station You have a black tray that has three objects in it You ve got a bouncy ball a marble and a styrofoam ball alright You also have a setup at your lab station that has liquids in cups This is for part three Alright I don t want you touching this stuff yet We re going to come back later and you re going to look at that stuff I don t want any of the cups knocked over I don t want any of the objects put into the cups okay These two things are separate your black tray and the piece of paper with the cups are separate What you re going to do first is use the black tray and the objects in it You re going to tell me with the marble the bouncy ball and the styrofoam ball if we were to put these in water which we are going to test them but if we were to put these in water do you think these objects would sink or float So you just go through and if you want you can just write an F or an S You re going to say what you think and I want you to wait until you get to your lab stations so you can pick them up feel them to see that might make a difference in your guess Then I also want you to tell me why While you are at your lab station float or sink in water and why You re not going to do the did it actually float because we re going to look at that when we come back These are our results So you re going to do the first two columns float or sink why float or sink why float or sink why Then we are going to come to that And we are going to come back and we re going to do an observation together So these two columns have got to be filled out before you get back to your seats Got it Let s go Marble sink Rubber float Rubber float Styrofoam float The marble will probably sink it s heavy It has no air in it Bouncy ball The bouncy ball probably can float Yeah I mean it s not light It s gonna float Bouncy ball same thing Bouncy ball heavy Marble heavy with no air pockets No This one will definitely float because it s lightweight and it has these little pores This bounces a lot his bounces a little bit and this bounces not at all Yeah but this one but this one If this one can float then why not think that one could float Okay If you don t go with your group that s okay but you still need to a connection If you are finished before the timer goes off you need to come back to your seat This will float This will fall Fail If you finish you need to come back to your seats You guys all finished I want to go ahead and take a look before we see the results Before we look at the results and test this I want to see what we think So first off let s start with the marble since it s at the top Raise your hand if you think the marble will float Okay so we re all together on this one it s not going to float Who can tell me why they re thinking it s not going to float We ll take like three guesses three explanations JC It s heavy with no air pockets Heavy with no air pockets good Frayla It can t capture air it can t float Can t capture air can t float Alright and Emma Heavy and solid Heavy and solid Alright now what about the bouncy ball Raise your hand if you think this is going to float Alright there s a mix What that s heavier than the marble Well let s hear Somebody give me an explanation for why it would float If you guessed float tell me why you thought that Sean Because there s air inside Okay there s air inside Alex I dropped it in the pond and it still floated Bouncy ball floated in the pond when you did it before Ali I ve seen it happen Okay you ve seen it happen Now some of us said it would sink Why did you say it would sink Matt Weaver Because it s heavy It s heavy Frayla Okay Jared Okay so prior experience Now last one is our styrofoam ball Float raise your hand Alright somebody give me a reason why it s going to float We re all together on this one too We all agree the marble is going to sink we all agree the styrofoam ball is going to float Matt Cook It s light and has air pockets It s light and has air pockets Alex You re talking alot of things the pond was last time okay Frayla It s very lightweight Okay alright let s test it out We re just going to test it out upfront here so I m just going to use this big beaker What do we want to see first Marble Bouncy ball Alright record sink for your actual I guess we ll do bouncy ball we ll just go in order Alright bouncy ball ready The moment of truth And styrofoam ball Yeah A different bouncy ball didn t float But you saw the bouncy ball I was using right Yeah So it was fair right Yeah Very simple but let s take a look at what s going on For number four I d like you to tell me I want you to answer first and then we ll discuss What I d like you to tell me why do you think some of these objects were able to float while others were able to sink And I want you to be specific At the beginning I asked you the same question on number two in prior knowledge Why do you think some of these things float I want you to revisit that question again So why do you think the marble and the bouncy ball sank and the styrofoam ball was floating I want you to be specific on number four I want you to answer first on your paper and then we re going to share okay What kinds of things did we say for number four Now that we ve looked at this in a different way Before I just asked you to think of things in your past that you ve seen float Now we ve looked at our marble our bouncy ball and our styrofoam ball What did you say Nick Bouncy ball didn t have enough air to keep it up and it was too heavy Okay anybody else say anything Nick said bouncy ball didn t have enough air to keep it up so it sank Anybody say something different Ebony Density and buoyancy All right what do you mean density and buoyancy Okay Frayla I said that some objects had air holes and some were just solid Okay Now let s think of this in a different way We ve got this really small marble and we ve got a much larger styrofoam ball So normally if something s smaller you think it s going to be lighter it should float Something heavier this is much larger but it didn t sink If I have one book if I m carrying one book versus carrying five books that s different because five books are bigger than one book So what is going on with the amount of stuff in the marble and the amount of stuff in the styrofoam ball Is it the same amount of stuff in the same amount of space Does the marble have the same amount of stuff in the same amount of space that the styrofoam ball does Which one has more stuff more matter in a smaller space I want you to talk with the person sitting next to you for one minute Okay so we ve done this before Okay so marble s number one styrofoam ball two Which object has more stuff more matter packed in a smaller space On the count of three right here marble one styrofoam ball two One two three Marble Good marble So let s write that down This is pretty much what number five is asking you So when comparing the marble to the styrofoam ball which one has more mass more matter more stuff in a smaller amount of space which we call volume That would be the marble alright People today if you flip over to the next part I ve heard the word density a couple times and density is kind of 
 Dan do you have any background knowledge about density Like if someone says It s dense out Yeah Then it would be kinda wet So if something s really like if there was a dense fog yeah it d be So if there was a dense fog what does that mean to you That there s a lot There s a lot of it okay So you re in San Francisco and they re like Hey there s a really dense fog You might expect that there s a lot of fog Alright what would be the opposite of a dense fog A not dense fog No fog or like a really thin fog Okay Jackson do you have any background information Well I thought that isn t it like how close the molecules are together How close the what The molecules are together How closely they are okay Yeah Like say you re trying to go through a screen door And like they aren t really very close together because they res holes Okay And say you re trying to go through a brick wall Okay And they re really close together so it will be harder to go through Would you say then which one would be densest the brick wall or the screen door The brick wall The brick wall and you would say that because Because the molecules are closer together The molecules are closer together Okay anybody else have any ideas about density Yes ma am Isn t it like how compact something is Okay so give me an example Like um don t know how to say this kinda going back to the container thing If we could have luggage and you fill it up so much the luggage case is like so filled up it s so dense Okay so let me take that to the next level So let s pretend we re going on vacation Okay we re going on vacation Raise your hand if you have a place you want to go Or maybe you re going there next week I d be so jealous if you said Hawaii Oh yeah I could be Reese where are you going Or where would you want to go Uuh Mexico You re going to Mexico Well not this break in the in the summer In the summer Alright so let s build this scenario He s got one of those big huge rolling bags that you re gonna put all of your swimsuits in To go to Mexico because you don t need other clothes Flip flops swimsuits and a t shirt and that s it Okay so you got your huge luggage we re gonna pile all this stuff in there I m gonna zip it up What does that have to do with density If it s absolutely packed full what does that mean for the luggage Yeah That the particles are so close together that it s leaving them in Is the volume of the luggage changing if it keeps its shape Or is the mass of the luggage changing because you re adding more stuff to it The mass So you change the mass because the luggage is staying the same Okay your mom says You can only bring one swimsuit one flip flop a pair of flip flops and one t shirt So I take everything out now did I change the volume by it or did I change the mass of the luggage The mass I just changed the amount of matter right So then the luggage with tons of stuff in it we said was what dense or not dense Dense And dense and so the luggage with a little bit of stuff in it was Less dense What changed the density of the luggage What are the other conclusions to what changed the density of the luggage Peter what changed the density of the luggage Less amount Less amount and in science which word do we use Umm Volume or mass on that one Umm mass Less mass less stuff less matter in the luggage Awesome we re gonna do this little scenario with a demonstration so you guys need your clickers it s gonna be an A or a B type answer on this one So get your clicker ready and I m gonna show you a couple of clips Cheese Ooooh Cheese Can we eat it when some people in here don t like it I know well more for me right What What Alright so this is cheese This morning I went to Safeway and I purchased this cheese that is extremely difficult to open And I bought certain kinds of cheese Can I have some Alright So Do we get to eat the cheese You do not Aww dang it Sorry Why can t we eat it So here s your question This is cheese A okay Anybody know what kind of cheese that it is Grayson what s cheese A Umm Swiss Swiss what s your observation that led you to the inference that this is Swiss cheese That is has the little holes in it The little holes in it Okay this is regular old Cheddar Raise your hand Yeah Dan know what it is Cheddar or This is a Cheddar cheese Okay So this is cheese A and this is cheese B I want to know which cheese is denser Okay so with your clicker I m gonna put this up on the screen I want to know cheese A the Swiss cheese or cheese B Are they supposed to be numbers Well it s gonna be an A or a B Right so cheese A or cheese B Alright and if you need to see the cheese again walk around In the meantime I ll put this question up I want to know is cheese A the densest Or is cheese B the densest Okay so this is multiple choice A or B There we go go ahead and click it And let s see what you guys think about which cheese is the densest So the Cheddar is B So A is the Swiss B is the Cheddar That doesn t make a lot of sense A is the Swiss Are we each going to be able to get a piece Please don t talk while we re doing this My clicker isn t working It s not working Which number are you 83 Is it on Yeah Are you pressing the right button Send Oh there it goes Okay good It probably didn t power Alright make sure you clicked in please And then let s look at what we think Okay 92 of you said that the cheddar was the densest So we had another 8 so two people said that this was the densest So here s what I want you to do I want you to pull a partner who s just the person next to you So you guys are gonna be partners you guys are partners you guys are partners and you re gonna be a group of three Partner partner partner Mattie and Grayson and you guys will partner Sydney and Jackson and it s kinda gonna go crossways here So you guys will be a partner You guys are a partner and you guys are a partner Right you re going to turn to your partner tell your partner which cheese you thought was the densest and then I want you to come up with a conclusion that you could say Cheese A was the densest because or Cheese B was the densest because So take 30 seconds to talk Less mass Cheddar So what is the definition of density from here to the cheese Which one is denser the one with more stuff or less stuff More So which of these has more stuff Ooh Nice of you guys and you re not very nice Okay that was 30 seconds Okay choose which person in your group is gonna be Swiss cheese and which person gonna be Cheddar Swiss Cheddar Swiss Cheeses raise your hand please Woo Swiss cheese And I need a conclusion from you so make a statement for me We thought cheese A was the densest because so Erica We thought cheese B was the densest because it didn t have any holes Because it didn t have any holes okay Does anybody have a different explanation why they thought cheese B was the densest Matt Well because cheese A had holes the holes don t take in the part of the technical isn t part of the cheese Okay So So the inside of the holes what are the holes actually made up of Air So there s air in there but it s not part of the cheese So then what s true about the Swiss cheese then Reily It has the less cheese Less cheese compared to its what Compared to has all of it So it s all cheese and this is part cheese What can we say now about their volumes Umm they re pretty much the same Okay so the volume is the same Jackson what can we say about the mass of the Swiss compared to the mass of this guy The Swiss has less mass than the Cheddar cheese So the Swiss has less mass then the Cheddar But they have the same volume can we figure out then which one s the densest Which one s the densest What s both alright You had a chance to talk about it let s vote again Do you think cheese A is the densest or cheese B is the densest After our little discussion Cheese A or cheese B A is the Swiss B is the Cheddar So we want to know who s more dense More dense yep Which one is more dense More dense Is A more dense or is B more dense Let s see if we get an agreement on our inference here about which one s denser Look at that we were able to change two people s minds just through discussion That s pretty awesome I thought it would be eight people Well we went all the way to 100 here So that s good That means that everybody agreed at least in terms of the cheese So as a demonstration What Well I need a snack this is really hard work being a teacher It s hard to be a student That s true Okay ready for demo number two Yeah So cheese number one number two first we need to talk about what sinking floating and suspending means I know it So in order to talk about this I have these fun objects I don t know has anybody stayed up late enough to see David Letterman Yes Oh gosh I lost an animal has anybody on David Letterman ever seen the game show he plays called Will it float Yeah I ve seen it happen Have you Wyatt What does he do Do you know what he does Well I saw it a while ago so I don t relaly remember So you re not really sure Anybody wanna guess what he does on the show He throws stuff in water He takes some stuff then he puts it in water to sees if it floats or not That s pretty much the gist of the game show So I have for your viewing pleasure recreated a game show So I have objects we re gonna play a game called Will it float And the first object you re going to predict this through the clicker Is I wanna know if our little dolphin friend is it going to float okay sink or the third option which is tricky you might not know this word suspend And suspends means hang out kinda in the middle of the water So you have three options alright We re gonna vote on this with the clickers Do you have a question before we do that When you put it to the test can I move forward Absolutely so if you can t see you can either stand up or you can squeeze up into an aisle yeah absolutely Yes sir Which one is it A B or C Oh I m gonna tell you right now okay So we re gonna see if the dolphin floats sinks or suspends And if you can t see when I do it we ll count and you can stand up and watch So A is gonna be sink so do you think it s gonna sink B answer B will be float C will be suspend Okay so sink float suspend which means hang out in the middle of the water Okay so this is an A through C option Okay A sink B float or C suspend Well that was fast Yeah that was really fast So let s see everyone oooo object is going to sink If it sinks what will you observe If it sinks what will you observe How fast It falling into the water Well he s going to fall into the water one way or another but where will he end up On the bottom At the bottom of that okay Some of you one person said that it s gonna float Okay so raise your hand if you re the person who thinks it s gonna float Okay thank you for taking a risk that s okay You don t know yet right it s for fun So if its floating what will that mean what will you observe That s she right When I put this in the water what will it look like when it s floating Like I don t know Will it will be sitting on the bottom No Where will it be located Floating on the Floating right on the top okay And then we had oooooh three whole people said it would suspend right in the middle Raise your hand if you think it s gonna suspend Oh yeah Okay Leia why do you think it s gonna go right in the middle I think it s too light for it to totally sink and I think it s took heavy for it to float so thought it would be right in the middle Okay so you re making the hypothesis it has something to do with its weight Okay alright so that s one idea Too light to stay at the top But too heavy would go to the bottom Is that what you said Okay yes So does suspend mean it stays in the middle Yeah suspend means it literally hangs out right here Yeah Okay that s not true Okay are you guys ready Yes So stand up if you need to be able to see Here s the game show there s a little song that goes with it like Will it float will it float Okay there s my game show you ready Alright it s very suspenseful Can you see Okay here it goes Yes Aww yeah So it sank So go back and have a seat please Now raise your hand if you have any explanation for me why that sank It did sink oh no We ve all been down to the bottom of the pool Why do you think it sank I thought it wasn t flat enough or didn t have enough space enough to float up So now we ve got two different ideas about sinking and foating So Leia brought up the idea of heaviness you brought up the idea of surface area See if I were to put something that has a bigger surface area is it gonna float No Yes Maybe did you tell me that if it had bigger surface on top of the water Okay should we try this Yeah It s gonna sink Oooh Okay so maybe Aaaaw It got swamped Now it floated for a little while right So maybe the shape does have something to do with it and maybe weight has something to do with it Or what it s made out of might have something to do with it So we have all kinds of ideas now about sinking and floating Yes sir Is it because it s denser than water So here s another idea it has something to do with the density of the object It s denser than water So here s a tough question so think about this one What is the difference between how dense something is and how heavy something is If Leia talked about heaviness now we ve got density and now we ve got shape and what it s made of and all these different things so I just want to know this one thing What s the difference between the weight of an object and the density of an object This is a really hard question take a second I want you to rotate back to your partner talk to them about what you think the difference between density and weight is Okay when we talked about number of particles it s later than mass Mass Mass so the relationship between mass compared to the object Okay Okay who spoke last time cause I need a cheddar Oh yeah A cheddar who s willing to talk Emily what did you guys come up with So density is like how much mass or how many particles are in the object And weight is how much gravity is pulling down Okay So would that mean that something That s heavier automatically sink Hang on one sec And then we ll try to work through this one If something is heavier than something else will it automatically sink Are ships heavy Do ships sink Occasionally right Especially if you re on that cruise ship like last week did you hear about that It depends on the Okay now we re talking about depends what it s in So now we ve got all these different ideas working Holy cow Yes ma am anything else to add I was gonna say I don t know why I m just gonna hook on this whole list of things but like a tin can will float if it s empty because of the air that s stuck inside of it holds the object up So if that was hollow I m guessing that it would most likely float So the ships are hollow in the bottom the air that keeps it up but the bottom how part of the ship goes in water is because part of it isn t hollow That part sinks but the air in the boat will keep it up and that s how things float 
 What I need you to do is you re going to be looking at both sets of data the one from October in the morning and the one from last week in the afternoon So I want you to work with your shoulder partners okay And the first thing I want you to look at this table you can do all three Isabella you can come sit right here You re gonna work with your shoulder partners and I m just gonna take a second and I want you to see what is common what is in common how is the data aligned Okay So I want you to work with your shoulder partners want you to talk about what is in common with both days of data Okay where are you all standing What is the same between those two days You re looking from this day to this day overall what is the The heat that was trapped inside the heat that was trapped inside got trapped because the black it was on and the black soaks in the heat so when the black soaks in the heat into the covers it traps it into Okay y all figured out about the black look at your other You have three other kind of solar water heaters look there see what other types you can find What did y all find out The black cover covers it Okay The black cover it s highest on both sheets On both sheets And what did you say White is the lowest and white uncovered is Whites are lower than blacks and white uncovered is the lowest Okay okay Okay everyone find some similarities Okay if you can hear me clap once If you can hear me clap twice Okay just one thing Don t tell me all the things that you have found the same Table four what did you find that was the same in those sets of data Elijah Only one went down Okay which one went down White uncovered Okay so you saw that white uncovered went down What s another scientific word for going down everybody Decrease Okay so white under decrease in both okay What else did you find Alex That the rankings were the same for each one Okay and when you re talking about the rankings what are you meaning Like white uncover had decreased the most Uh huh Um white covered was was really toward the middle Uh huh Black uncovered was also was the next one and black covered was the last one In order from the heat Okay does everyone agree Yes You all see the same thing Now what does it mean that black covered had more of a change than white uncovered What does that mean Justin That black absorbed more heat Okay that black maybe absorbed the most And what did the white do Everybody It reflected It reflected or Anthony what were you gonna say Absorbed the least Absorbed the least because it was reflecting Now okay that was the easy part Now I want you to look at your graphs and I want you to try to figure out things that are different okay Things that are different this is a little tricky okay So you work with your partner try to figure out the things that are different okay Okay and how does that relate to the results Look at these results and how are these results different Okay and so you have a wider range than you do the width okay So what were you saying now That I think that the they are so seperated out the first time we did it than last week Okay girls what do y all think I think here it s like up Now think about why it would be a lot closer Ooh Okay okay well let s take he said hotter the morning what was our temperature 24 24 And the afternoon what is So think about what y all talking about Okay y all ready to report out Okay if you can hear me clap once If you can hear me clap twice Okay different Give me one thing that was different Stephanie They all got different angles Okay the lines are different angles you re right What else Chloe At 10 30 A M all of them had all of temperatures were higher as well as to the 2 30 P M Higher temps in morning okay Um what else Kristin can you think of something else What do you think Nick There s different air temperature Okay there s a different air temperature Okay what else Just looking at the overall graph Justin Just looking at just the picture of the graph how does the picture look different from the morning to the afternoon All of the temperatures went got decreased In the In the um at 2 30 Okay and when you say decrease which graph looked like this The morning or the afternoon The morning The morning which one looked like this The afternoon Okay so overall the graphs look a little different from the morning to the afternoon Now why do you think that could be Why do you think that could be Kristen Because it s like on the side Oh okay here s our school okay This is where we did our experiment And Kristen s saying that the morning time the sun s here okay Where was the sun in the afternoon Anthony It was like barely Okay okay Semijah It was in the clouds Okay it was sometimes it was going behind the clouds Where was it Alex where was it in the sky You don t remember Behind the school Okay behind the school So this was our morning experiment and this was our afternoon experiment Okay and did we get different kinds of data Because what was truly pretty much the same Between both days besides the sun what was the air temperature in the morning 25 25 Okay so our air temperature stayed the same but the thing that was different was what Where the sun was Where the sun was okay So thinking about that we are going to try to get a solar water heater installed at the school okay a solar water heater installed at the school so what other do y all know a solar water heater a hot water heater in your house okay When you get in the shower or get in the bath and you have warm water how do you think that water s heated Does anyone know Peyton You have the water in your well you have a water heater in your garage or um Okay it s in your garage but what s heating that water The sun No 
 Like learning is supposed to be a privilege not a burden It s like Supposed to be Like that s why we re America We have the choice you re not supposed to be forced to do it Okay Um but like about them picking a random person they might they might not just go pick a random person if they have to vote because if they have to vote then they re gonna go see that candidate candidate s political beliefs are and what he or she is gonna do for the country Okay Trevor But if um they re not gonna know which one to pick if they re not educated or don t know about the person Okay What if they don t know how to read In their researching They don t know how to read Okay Do you want me to say my question Yeah go ask your question Okay um If only like when we don t have the law only 60 percent vote so how is that supposed to show what America really wants How is that supposed to show what president we want and what choices we wanna do But if we do get the other 40 percent that already don t wanna vote then they would just pick one and that still wouldn t be the the will of the big United States And outta the 60 percent votes you could just make your uh votes outta that What do you mean Like the people that did vote just choose a person who did get the most votes But we wanna see what America as a whole really wants not what a little over half of America wants Um our founding fathers vote for the right to vote for for freedom and so I think we should use that wisely Okay elaborate on that a little bit Say that one more time Um if our founding fathers vote for the right to or fought for the right to freedom then I think we should use that correctly So you think that if the founding fathers looked at this law they would say this is not what we meant when we said you know we want people to vote for our leaders they didn t want us to force people they still wanted it to be a freedom Didn t we like like have the law for like trying to get the opinion of the whole population of America The other 40 percent it still wouldn t be like their decision because they would just pick one they wouldn t really care So they re not really getting any difference by not having the law But we re not forcing them to do that we re forcing them to help America So you re forcing them Okay Jackson can you respond to that point Um Yes if you like if we don t force people to vote then maybe the poor just can t make it there And if we say oh you have to vote then we then we could like provide them transporation to get to there Also if poor people won t vote that means rich people will vote and they ll just vote for the person who they believe is gonna keep them rich and that they d not go against that Do you think that that represents the majority of Americans if only those wealthy or at least middle to upper class people are voting No No Because if the poor people don t vote they re already poor that s already bad enough and they don t get to voice their opinion and in a democracy too That s just even worse And that s a big segment of people right So you re saying that really a lot of these people maybe it s that it s not that they don t want to vote it s that they don t have the opportunity we need to provide some more public um opportunities like opportunities like public transportation to allow them to vote to make it easier Okay Cause it s not only poor and uneducated people it s just people that really don t care that much and like when making those people vote like kind of what she said they could most a lot of em could try and break the law if you force them to vote Because they just don t want to and they really don t care and like if there s somebody who has who doesn t care but they re being forced to vote and they have a really busy job and they have a lot going on they wouldn t have time to research or anything and so they could they would just have to go out there when they did have to vote they d just vote for someone cause they never had any time to do any research or look at something about the people to vote for Okay let s come back to that point cause I think we still have some questioners who haven t asked their question who s who s up next Jaylen Um you say there are different ways to give them their complete and to vote but what are those ways What d she say Well if you have things Hold on Let me let me make sure they heard what you re saying Say it again but say it louder Okay Um I say it s different ways to get them to vote but what are those ways that you get them to vote Does anybody have a ready response for that I can t hear her She s saying you guys are saying there are better ways than compulsory voting laws there s other and better ways so what are those ways Like just because they re poor doesn t mean they can t know that like you can like hang up posters or like get someone to hand out flyers or something It doesn t have to be all electronic I m not talking about poor people Well she s saying It could help anybody really but Okay Respond Well but there are poor people that wanna vote they don t have a chance to Excuse me Well hold on hold on a second Hold on hold on cause I I m not sure that y all are understand what her point is Say your point again Um With some passion With passion Cause that ll make your point Just scream at her WHAT are different WAYS that you can get the American people to vote Besides Besides posters because a poster s not gonna It s compulsory voting And besides these laws what are some better ways to make people vote Well y all keep sayin go and like pick up people and providing transportation well instead of doing that to make them vote you might as well just do that so that they might have the opportunity to vote rather than having to vote So you don t necessarily have to have these laws to still provide some public services to encourage people to vote Okay And like we all know that we get those like very long phone calls that are like vote for this person because they re gonna do all this stuff and like that then like someone who gets that phone call could actually think about it and then like maybe I should vote for that person and you see the big billboard thingies that have the big names on it and all the signs in the yards and so that could make you think well maybe I should go vote since all these people are saying we should vote for that person So you you think they should have an increase in in publicizing elections we should we should have more advertising when elections come up Okay Okay Well if you were to like have election um that would like cost a lot of money to have like a lot of um transportation going around So um and it s like not a lot of people are gonna use that transportation then why just like so why not just make them vote cause they already have public transportation out there Okay Let s top on that one we ll come back to it because we ve got one more question Uh if we didn t require people to vote what would happen if what would happen if like nobody voted decided to vote Say that one more time If we didn t require people to vote what would happen if like nobody decided to vote Or a small majority of people Okay Well people have different opinions like some people think that we put a voice out into the government and say what we want and then some people think like that we that every vote counts And basically there s like five three million people in America and I don t think every single one of them would not vote Okay Any other responses But we already have 60 percent voting I mean and so we know every some people are going to vote It s just the people who don t care about politics and just like when we had the survey people a lot of people didn t vote for the midterm election But on the other hand some people did We re always gonna have a group that doesn t vote and a group that is voting and if you make them vote they re not gonna care Even as more as they did when they weren t voting Okay I m gonna go ahead and open up the floor because we ve asked all the questions so pretty much anybody can answer or ask but let s try and keep it on the same topic so if you are raising your hand make sure you re responding to what the last person said Okay Uh let s see Connor Oh like you said every vote counts but like we need more people to vote so we know that like we know the exact number of like who is going to be the president or in the House of Representatives or the Senate So that theres a better chance that they will get elected Okay so we need a more accurate portrayal of what people think We need more people to vote so we really know what Americans think Okay Well I agree with Connor but going back to what everybody over there is saying they re all saying oh they they won t care they wont they wont care or anything and they wont pay attention to what happens but I mean if we can make like some kind of exception for like special needs people for the deaf and blind and then um also we can get people to stand out in front of a booth and once they ll go get there you can do a speech about both candidates and their ups and downs Okay so you re saying actually have people at the voting polls that are kind of breaking down the two sides Maybe for those people who didn t take the time to research it Okay Um one of y all keep sayin we keep sayin that they might not care but like in actuality if you if someone doesn t care and you force them to care not only is that kinda like convincing like brainwashing them it s also if you force someone to do something they re not going to want to anymore So that wouldn t be helping anything So you re saying it s it s gonna actually make them more bitter toward voting if you force them to do it Okay And someone said that it s gonna be for the good of the country for making them vote but if they could choose a bad a bad person cause it wouldn t be for the good of the country then Okay so if you force them to vote and then they go and vote for a bad person that s not gonna be helping the country at all Okay Jason Um like um you could um for those people that can t vote or um you could put the they could put the polls the voting polls near where those people uh live and um so that they could like if they can t drive there in a car they could just walk there because it d only be like maybe a block down their way Okay You could like open a public train like so they don t have to pay to go as much And then make it free Yeah For that day Okay Alexandra what do you think Alright um well like making people vote is gonna make them more interested in like the country and then they ll actually care cause like they re not gonna wanna like break a law and so then they re gonna actually care about the country and so they won t just be choosing a random person they re gonna actually start caring and start thinking about who they should choose You really think if if we force them to vote then they they will become more interested in politics and they ll go out and research it Okay Like just like if you make some make everyone vote then it s really not gonna change their opinion they re still gonna have like they re still gonna not really care as much as the person that would go out and vote without being forced So you re really not getting an accurate number of what they think they want because they still just because you re making them vote doesn t mean they re gonna necessarily pick the right person Okay Um they re always saying like that we still have this 40 percent that haven t voted well everyone like even the poor people and the uneducated well everyone knows that there s a presidential election or some kind of election going on you can t it s like impossible to not know about it and so really it s their choice that they didn t vote most of the people who aren t poor but they re like middle class like they won t make the choice to vote if Okay So you re A lot of people have made the choice to vote So you re saying the presidential election everybody knows about it everybody probably has an opinion because it s all over the place so and 40 percent are not obviously those 40 percent know that they don t wanna go and vote They ve chosen not to vote Most of them have chosen not to vote Okay You know I have to disagree with you when you say that if we just tell people to vote they ll just pick a random person What I think is that if people are being told to vote they ll just go in there and say well if I m being told to vote I just might as well just pick someone good You d think that they would actually try and think about something before they vote like the term look before you leap So you think if they have to go to the effort of voting they re at least gonna think about it They re at least gonna form an opinion Okay Um like you put of um you you could like make the offices make the person take the day off and like sort of give them the day off And that s 
 Like the chocolate one with the strawberries that we looked at that is going to serve approximately 24 people So if you multiple that by two that s approximately 48 that you should charge if you re going to charge for your cakes Now it s going to depend on did you really put that much time energy and effort into it and do you feel like you really need to charge that That s going to have a little bit of basis to how much you are going to charge but that will kind of give you an idea what to charge for your cakes Think about it too serving sizes for cakes are typically two inches square They re small so when you are thinking But that s a little cake well serving size is tiny It s not that you are going to serve them a whole meal out of cake It s just for them to get a taste Sculpted cakes like the catfish cake that we looked at 100 plus When I looked these up specifically for something as big as that catfish cake because it was a pretty good size catfish cake We tried to make it as realistic as possible and it was about this tall So probably somewhere at 150 200 level had we bought that at a bakery The wedding cake like Jessie s wedding cake that we ve seen somewhere in the neighborhood of 600 because it was a seven tiered masterpiece as well Who has a question Come on somebody has got a question I wanna make a 3D cake Okay when do you wanna make one I don t know They re fun So if you were going to make a 3D cake what would you make Catfish Okay Britney s making a catfish Okay Erica s making a dinosaur Oh my favorite Piggies butterflies what else What would you like to try Penguin duck basketball panda bear would be cute A tire Brandi I wanna see your tire cake when you get that done A monkey would be fun That would be really cute So you guys are starting to think 3D We need to be thinking about your roses too Because we gotta work on those roses and get that technique down Let s go over to our table and I ll show you about making those roses Okay so when we get our snow day tomorrow I expect you to go home and practice practice practice practice practice If it s snow we probably will get out Watch Facebook Brandi Or listen to the news That s how we ll find out I always post it to my Facebook whenever they tell us You guys already know about fixing your pastry bags and this one is already fixed and it s all ready to go You know me I like wrapping it up One of my just little tricks I like to use for this if it starts getting sticky on the outside Which actually I know you have struggled with this these are not my friends These are my friends That s my first tip My second tip is if you re going to use a plastic bag take a paper towel and just turn it into your handle And the other thing is don t fill your bag so full It really only needs to be filled to about halfway maybe a little bit more than halfway okay Then what you ll do is you ll start rolling it down As you re rolling it down typically what I do first is I fold it in kind of at a triangle Then I start rolling it down The reason for that is so when I start putting pressure on it s got both those folds and then another fold to keep it from escaping Other people like to do the toothpaste thing and twist It s totally up to you how you want to do that Either one is totally acceptable Just feel what works best for you okay Then I make my little handle out of my paper towel Remember on the tips You will notice on the tips especially the Wilton tips has a number That number is representative of how big the hole is The larger the number the larger the hole That works on the writing tips Someone tell me what number is on that one Okay tell me what number is on that one Erica It s on the outside Okay yours is a number 12 Five You ve got a number five It says a 230 Okay a 230 One Okay and why A one what A one M that means one monster No I don t know what the M stands for What is the difference though between this tip and this tip They re pretty much the same thing What would you use this one for For big cakes Or for Wait don t I got this You ve got it okay come on Ashley What would you use it for Borders Borders Yes great answer Absolutely I m telling you by the time you have finished your masterpiece and you re ready to do the borders get the big ones cause you re ready to be done with it If you pick one of these little teeny tiny ones by that time you re sick of working with frosting and you re ready to do something else But this one s just a number 16 See how tiny that is Okay rose tips The bigger the number the bigger the holes Also on your rose tip make sure that the large opening end is going down If this is awkward for you all you have to do to adjust your tip loosen it and then twist it around and then tighten your tip You don t want to tighten it so much that it s gonna take a pair of pliers to get it loose okay Let s see if I can get this back in business Okay you ve got your rose nails You re just going to put a little squirt of frosting and it doesn t have to be very big and I m making a big mess now Hold it down Lay it straight down on your waxed paper and now you ve got your basis for your rose This is what we re gonna build the roses on We have to make a pyramid of frosting to start out with Remember that on the Power Point The first one I m gonna do is I m gonna rotate this counter clockwise and make my little pyramid See that little circle in the middle That s going to be the very inside of the rosebud Actually you could pull these off after you let them set up Stick them on a plate or on a cookie sheet stick them in the freezer and you could have lots of little rosebuds to set on your cake Just add your little leaves add your little vines and make you a really pretty little rosebush out of that If you want it a little bit bigger you just squeeze and rotate all at the same time It s about pressure and release So if you wanted a little rose you would pull it off right about now If you want a little bit bigger we re gonna build it up My frosting is getting warm but that s okay There s a little bit bigger one It s starting to flop over on me because it s getting really warm in here The more petals you add to the outside the bigger your rose is going to be Did you see that It just about flew onto the floor Could you tell me what this would be used for Yes That one is actually to decorate cupcakes So if we had a whole bunch of cupcakes this is so you can do some really delicate work inside the very delicate areas Like if you have them all lined up and you re trying to do them really fast you can just do that Usually what they will do that for is you know the little curly things that look like a little snake on the top Have you seen them They just go shhhhh That s what they use that for It kind of is fun One other way that you can do your frosting pyramid is just go straight down and squeeze and just bring it straight up So now we ve got our cute little middle of our cute little rose going Yeah it sticks straight up and we re just gonna wrap our little petals around it There we go See how cute that is It looks just like one that you just picked right off my little rosebush Some of my white roses at home look like that That one is cute that one s a good one Let s see if I can finish this off We ll do this one tiny The smaller you want to make them you just add a smidge of pressure instead of a lot of pressure If you add a lot of pressure you re gonna make a big rose It is it s getting really warm Who has a question about making these cute little roses Okay and I know you guys are masters at using your little star tips for shell borders All right so lets see what you can do I think you got your tables set Who would like to use this tip Simone Do you need a rose tip Okay I ll come around and check on you and see how you re doing I want to see your masterpieces I wanna see a couple of good roses from each of you Kimberly do you all need a rose tip over here Do you need that Okay Sorry let me get out of your way Do we just do one or two I want you to practice your borders and I want you to practice your rose tips So if you have a rose tip at your table you ll probably have to share I ll come around and check on you and see how it s going and if you have any problems or questions let me know I have a question That is a good question It should be but it s not Don t use this one This works best if you take your bag and just snip it and just drop it straight back in the bag Because this coupler is not designed to fit on this particular one I ll get you a different one you can try Brandi have you used the super star one that makes have you used the leaf tip yet No Let s try leaves The big giant one This will not fit on here with your coupler You ll have to use a different frosting bag Most everything else that s out you can use This one actually you might have fun with this one This one makes swirlies Cool it just makes lines you just zigzag it All the star tips are right here Err not the star but the rose No I think all of them are out You guys will have to wait and trade out with each other Yep they re all out I just suck at this No you don t Let me see Start with this Christina Hold your handle Handles are our friends Ooh it looks like a square rose It does look like a square rose that s cool Okay Britney make sure the big end goes to the bottom The small end goes to the top Remember your angles too 45 and these to Brandi and I ll be right back Brandi Here How do I make this one work Oh this one is kind of fun This one quite literally is something you d finish off like if you re making grass you just kind of swirl it around You can do it like this Yeah there are two lines Like if you wanted to do ziggy zags You can do circles You know like that It s all about your pressure Oh What happened What happened They re laughing at my rose What s wrong with it That s a good start Keep building on it Now remember Leticia this big part right here on this side that goes down There you go If it s not in the right location You may want to unscrew this and realign this Try that see if that works better for ya Then remember you re twisting all at the same time You re making like upside down U s remember Oh you did miss that part of the lesson too didn t you All right let me show you and then I ll let you do one okay What you re gonna do this big one always goes down You re making like an upside down U Just like that You re gonna U and turn it all at the same time so that it s a slow turn and this motion all at the same time okay Then when you re done you just set that aside and do another one Show me what you re doing There you go Hold it just like that That s good Hey you re getting there You re making a pyramid of frosting and you can do it one of two ways You can either do it this way or straight up and down Just make a big glob of frosting and turn this all at the same time There you go just like that Pull your frosting off there you go Okay now that s a good start and now you re gonna start making your upside down U s Usually you have three on your bottom layer There you go You re turning it all at the same time It s all about the hand motion there you go just like that Just make little tiny ones all around There ya go that looks good There ya go See you can do this Leticia There oh look how beautiful that is It is Oh my gosh That s a perfect rosebud Thank you That s it That s all you have to do The bigger you wanna make your rose the more levels you put around the outside edge okay If that s all you want then pull it off set it aside and do some more That s it All right you ve got the techniques and you know what to do I ll come back and check on you Yes Yes yes yes Oh come on show me Show me show me At least it s better than theirs Hey you re getting there I think you re doing the same thing that Leticia was doing See this big piece You ve got it back It needs to go down If this is awkward for you and you need to twist this part of it Just unscrew and re navigate Britney that looks good Wait it is on bottom now It is now because I just turned it When you were doing it it wasn t See how these are heavy on top That s the reason It ll be okay Do you need some more Is there anymore cut out things No but there s stuff to do it All right I ll come back and check on you Sierra I m gonna leave you in charge over here If they need some help let me know okay Okay Good job Where are you over here Yes Yes yes yes Star borders deluxe Okay so how are you doing You re doing really good on those leaf tips Have you tried any standing up So you know how to do that Literally you start here and you pull straight up on it at a 90 degree angle What Just like that Like that sometimes they roll over The stiffer your frosting is the stiffer they are See how you can get them to stand up Just like that or if you want them to lay on the side If you go slow they stay up faster Yeah and it has to do with the consistency of your frosting too Remember what you put in it to make it a little bit thicker Powdered sugar Or you can do what There you go Sarah Sarah I have never seen Don t look A big no no Oh man that s good frosting Okay all right yell at me I stuck my thumb in it I had to lick it off It s really good by the way It is Don t do as I do do as I say That s kind of like momma s say Ya know I m your school momma It s not monkey see monkey do It s monkey do what monkey say I m telling ya today it s Ms Morris is doing something silly All right so Sarah show me another one Show me some shell borders cause I know you ve practiced those She will she ll be I ll be back That s cute That s very stylish Now the tip that Ashley has the one that looks like the little grass that s got the two holes at the same time If you re gonna do something real fancy if you ll do this one white and then put a colored one in there and do it back and forth it will kinda look like this Holly try it again Try again Where s the leaf Leddy s got one of them Do you guys have one Okay show her what to do It s pressure and release Pressure and release That one actually turned out really good That one is a very good leaf When you re working on your leaves for your cake this is what you want it to look like If they start breaking off like this you ll probably want to scrape them off It s just a matter of the pressure and release thing But those are looking really really good I know I m gonna sneeze too Okay maybe I m not Bless you Hey Mariah Show me what you can do Oh come on Those are good ones Those are cute That s a cute border Samantha you re doing a really good job on that too Kailyn that is awesome So have you practiced at home yet No Why not I figured you would be I figured you would be practicing every chance you got No I don t have time What do you mean you don t have time Yeah Drew told me you re working on your scrapbook Good job Brandi All right show me something that you can do I wanna see somebody make a rose I showed you how now I wanna see them Yes I wanna see you make a rose Make another one Oh Let me You can use my frosting I ll bring you some Look you did it So what is the rule 
 All the water goes into the jeans and this water dripped out the bottom Mmhm So it ll drip out the bottom as it dries and go into the ground Okay Other ideas about A Other ideas about A Okay How about B It disappeared It no longer exists It s gone forever Maybe not forever but it s gone Anybody choose B No choosers for B Okay how about C It s in the air in an invisible form Kyle I think it s evaporated into a gas and you can t see it It evaporated into a gas and you can t see it Okay other ideas about C I just have similar to Kyle s but water vapor you can t usually see it Okay so it became water vapor which you can t see Alright How about D it moved up to the clouds Lots of Ds How about Mina What do you think Well I think it evaporated and then it went up so It evaporated and went up And when things evaporate they form clouds Mm no Okay So who Can you explain your ideas Well it was like actually it did go into the clouds because the water s still wet so Okay so when it evaporates it goes to clouds Alright Other ideas about D Moving to the clouds Luke I do think that it turned into water vapor Okay But I think that maybe clouds are there and then it gets soaked up by clouds sort of Okay So okay Let s talk about some of these ideas So I m hearing the word evaporate from a couple different people What does that mean to evaporate What are your ideas about that Emmie Doesn t it mean to like when the water gets at a certain temperature it turns into a gas Okay so when water gets to a certain temperature it changes to a gas Other ideas about evaporate or what that means When it changes to a gas what s happening Ideas about that Mitch Well maybe it first comes out of the machine maybe the sun could make it heat a lot and sort of the bubble question like maybe it could be a heat bubble under each town Not be an actual bubble but go up to the water cycle and then go come back down Okay so when you say go up to the water cycle what happens to it It s evaporated up It s evaporated And where is it when it evaporates In the clouds In the clouds Okay other ideas Jake Well when it evaporates the way it works is the heat makes it so the atoms get go farther apart and that makes it change into the state of gas Okay the atoms go farther apart So is it still water Yes but in a different form Okay Okay Other ideas about evaporation And how about clouds So some people are saying when it evaporates it turns into a cloud What is a cloud Ethan share I think it s like a gas Okay But then I think when it evaporates and goes up to the cloud and then I think it will be turned into rain I agree Yeah So first it s a gas when it s a cloud and then it turns back to rain Uh huh Okay Jamie other ideas I think a cloud is like water turning into mist and it gathers in the cloud So when it gets dark it builds up with more water and then when it rains all the the cloud gets too heavy with water and then it rains Okay so it s a mist Yeah Is it a liquid or a gas A liquid slash a liquid slash gas Okay a little of both Okay Okay alright Let s move on How about E It changed into a new substance No takers for E new substance Okay How about F it went to the sun It went up to the sun No takers for F either There s a lot of hands I m not seeing up How about G It broke down into atoms of hydrogen and oxygen Alex I said that because well it goes up into the sky and it must be really humid because it like I can t remember is it when the atoms separate or and because we re humidity ing it Yeah Okay so it becomes more humid and that makes the atoms separate Is that what you re saying Well not exactly It s hard to find the words Okay Can you try It separates and that s what makes it humid Well I don t know I guess I ll come back to you Keep thinking about it How could you explain your ideas Joey what are your ideas I can I go off of Alex Yeah Oh so when hot air rises so when the water gets to a certain temperature I forgot who said that but it the atoms spread apart and change into a gas And it would be more humid because hot air rises and the gas rises into the clouds Okay so as the hot air rises the gas rises with it Is that what you re saying Mmhm Okay And the water becomes hydrogen and oxygen as it goes up Mmhm Okay Other ideas Dylan Well so there s oxygen and hydrogen in the atmosphere and the atmosphere is gas and gas doesn t sit at the bottom It s in the air which means it s obviously floating I guess And so if water turns into vapor which I think most of us know and vapor can float and obviously it s turning into a gas like oxygen and hydrogen And so how would water be able to float if it s turning into gases it s breaking down into atoms of hydrogen and oxygen It s still almost like a liquid gas but if it wasn t a gas that consists of things like hydrogen and oxygen how would it be able to float How would it be able to turn to clouds Okay so it can t be water still if it s going to be floating around in the air Well yeah Is that what you re saying It s still water but it s in a different form that it has components that make up it s pretty much a liquid gas almost It s a liquid gas Yes yeah Which makes it float in the air Well yeah gas Gas can float and hydrogen and oxygen Okay So it becomes hydrogen and oxygen in the air Well as it heats up then it breaks because as it heats up then it creates vapor Water evaporates and so as it heats up when it gets to that point then it breaks down into atoms and everything else Okay when it gets to the air Yeah when it turns into vapor Okay when it turns into vapor that s when it becomes hydrogen Because yeah that s how it when the atoms of hydrogen and oxygen break down I m guessing that that means that that s when it s turning into vapor Okay Okay okay great Luke other ideas I think it might become the combination of the two because I think more than just one because I think it does split into different atoms which makes it a gas And then um and then also it could go into the clouds or something like in other parts of the answer Okay so maybe it turns into this hydrogen and oxygen gas but then goes to the clouds Yeah because I think that that s kind of the only way to go to the clouds and I think its probable that it would so Okay Okay okay Lots of different ideas We re going to move on so that we can get to the others How could we observe this What could we do to know if some of these options are the right option or be able to eliminate them as possible options What could we do Turn and talk to your partner quickly What could we observe And see what happens Okay Would we be able to eliminate any of these if we agreed with Owen s suggestion Eliminate F How come Because the sun s very far away Okay And it s really really hot so Okay if we did it in the classroom would it be able to get to the sun No it d be stuck in the classroom right Okay Are there others that we might be able to eliminate if we did that Good Okay let s hear your ideas What could we do How could we observe this scenario Trenton I haven t heard from you today Okay so to eliminate some of them if soaked into the ground you could check if the ground was wet or anything and it moved up to the clouds You could check if there s any clouds Okay See if a cloud forms Okay Miley other ideas I agree with Trenton but I think I ve seen them where the area s curved over like our roof and the sun is out you can see mist kind of stuff coming out And I think if we did that then maybe we could observe something that could be useful Okay what would we have to do though to set this up What do we need Owen You can wet a paper towel and then hang it from somewhere and then heat it by a light and then or you could have a fan Okay heat it with a light or a fan So perfect I like your idea So we have a cloth It s wet Is it wet Kind of Kind of It s not wet enough Should we make it a little more wet Yeah Okay let me make it a little more wet That better Yeah Okay And in this scenario this is hanging outside right Well we re going to hang it in our classroom And since we don t have a lot of sun today we re going to make our own light energy with this lamp So don t look at the lightbulb because it s real bright There we go And we re going to set it up here So as we watch this which one of these or which ones might we be able to eliminate So as we observe what can we how will we know which ones are true or not true Let me give you a minute to think I want to hear from someone new I haven t heard from yet Who haven t I heard from yet Augustine A because I wasn t sure if the ground was wet or dry Perfect yeah It can t soak into the ground right So we ll see if the counter is wet if there s a puddle there then we ll know that A is the correct answer Excellent Others that we might be able to eliminate just by observing Jake B it disappears and no longer exists because nothing can t disappear Something can t disappear unless it goes into a black hole Okay will we be able to observe that though No Not really yeah So that one might be tricky but that s good prior knowledge Jamie others that we might be able to eliminate We can tell if it moved up to the clouds because there s no way it can move up to the clouds because there s a ceiling Yeah there s a ceiling Well so if we saw a cloud forming in our classroom right then we d know that it makes a cloud But if we don t see a cloud then we ll know that we can eliminate that one That one s wrong Good Others that we can eliminate Miley F it went up to the sun because it can t we don t have a sun in the classroom If we saw it right gathering up the light right that might tell us that maybe F is true But it can t get to the sun because it s stuck in our classroom Good Any others that we might be able to eliminate Emmie We might be able to well C because if the cloud isn t wet anymore and you can t see anything or feel anything we would know that that s true Okay okay So if it disappears we can t see it or feel it in the cloth but we can t see it anywhere else maybe we ll know that C is more likely Okay good Very good Excellent So we re going to keep observing for these things Those are the things that we want to keep an eye out look for a cloud forming look for water puddling at the bottom look for water gathering at the light See if it chemically changed into a new substance we might be able to see it right in our classroom somewhere So we ll be observing for that Is it going to happen immediately No No so we ll have to come back to this one Keep looking back as we go In the meantime uh oh No here we go We ll go to the next one next scenario What s in the bubbles So turn to that scenario in your notebook if you re not there right now What s in the bubbles So Hannah is boiling water in a glass teakettle She notices bubbles forming on the bottom of the kettle that rise to the top and wonders What is in the bubbles She asks her family what they think This is what they say So who agrees with Dad Who may agree with Dad Owen Well since it s being heated and being heated from the bottom the bubbles will form on the bottom as heat and then the heat would make it rise to the top Okay the heat makes it rise to the top Good Other ideas Other people who agree with Dad Mitch Well I agree with Dad and Calvin Okay And for Dad if the bubbles are heat maybe the heat forms the bubbles and then the oxygen in the bubbles makes it float to the top Okay okay So let s move on to Calvin then Other thoughts about Calvin Who agrees the bubbles are filled with air Reed I forgot Okay we ll come back to you Anybody else agree with Calvin Anyone I haven t heard from yet today No Trenton anything for you to contribute Well I didn t at first and I don t really know if I do still but like I kind of do because with the water all water has oxygen in it which is kind of like air and then the air could be in the bubbles because the bubbles would probably heat up and be at the bottom and then the air would fill up from the water and go into the bubbles and then Okay so there s air in the water and as it heats up it comes out of the water Okay other ideas Miley I agree with Trenton and Mitch because they could be both filled with air but they could be hot because it s where the source of heat is Okay alright Reed did you remember Yes Okay go ahead Well the heat can take the air out of the water The heat would take the air out of the water like Trenton was saying And since air s lighter than water it would rise to the top It goes to the top Okay good How about Grandma The bubbles are an invisible form of water Anyone agree with Grandma Rupo I said I believe with Grandma because I thought that they d go up to the top I thought it was just invisible because I thought it was just going up and the cloud s just evaporating higher and higher Okay so there are the bubbles are evaporated water And then go away Okay Matthew Well it had to be a form of water because it came from water I guess and they re invisible so yeah Okay so it had to be water because it s coming from water and you can t see it so it s invisible Uh huh Great How about Mom The bubbles are empty there s nothing inside them Who agrees with Mom Who agrees with Mom Jonathan I think that there s nothing inside the bubbles because how could anything get in the bubbles in the first place How could that turn into bubbles Okay how could anything be in there Where would it have come from Yeah Okay Anybody else agree with Mom Anybody else agree with Mom Okay how about Lucy The bubbles contain oxygen and hydrogen that separated from the water Lots of hands Who haven t I heard from today Jodie Well I don t really know why because it just sounded more scientific Sounds more scientific Okay Any other reasons No No Alright Kyle can you add on to that I think in the water when it s not hot that there s oxygen and hydrogen and other things in it and then when it heats up it forms into I don t know It rises up Okay so where did the oxygen and hydrogen come from I think it s part of the water It s part of the water Okay Good Emmie Well I know that I m pretty sure water is made of two oxygen molecules and one hydrogen molecule Opposite Oh other way around Yup two hydrogens and one oxygen You re right Okay and I m with Lucy because bubbles usually kind of probably form by the water and inside and since the water s the molecules that that s what s happening Okay so water 
 Let s go Okay Continue Yes All right scholars here s my question What do you think actually let me start by quoting the passage So it says they can either trust or predict what Chacko s attitude would be and they were trying to hide that get rid of it all before Chacko returned So what do you think Chacko s opinion of all of this chaos would be Could you just be particular with the chaos you were talking about What s that The entire situation the steamy love affair and the reaction on Baby Kochamma s part And Mammachi s part Got it I don t think he d be happy about the love affair cause as it says it s like she had defiled generations of breeding like the little blessed one blessed personally by the Patriarch of Antioch Antioch an imperial entomologist and Rhodes Scholar from Oxford so it s like she had taken what their family had worked for for so long and just thrown it out the window I m gonna have to disagree with that Becca I mean I think that Chacko is a liberal type He is very progressive he s a Marxist he didn t allow his father to beat his mother as most Indians Traditionalists probably would be OK with I think that Chacko would be no more angry about the whole affair than anybody would be if some guy was having an affair with his sister As a social ideal I think he would be fine with everything I agree because I feel like oh God I had this whole plan of something to say and I can t remember Sorry No it s not your fault Well what is the only thing that made Chacko upset at Mammachi Was it that she abandoned her children Oh I got it Yeah I feel like the most of this passage though it s third person narration it really feels like it s coming out of Baby Kochamma s mouth and it s like her diction throughout all of the italicized stuff The whole central paragraph where it uses a lot of dirty diction like mud and filthy and coarse and black To quote the passage once again So I feel like that all really Baby Kochamma s words and not necessarily Baba s beliefs and I feel like they have really contrasted beliefs Yeah I mean I feel like all the diction you were talking about for instance when it says Mammachi s rage at the old one eyed Paravan standing in the rain drunk dribbling and covered in mud And it repeats mud a lot and I think it s that s just kind of dirty and the action is really impure and they re trying and almost like mud covers things up So it s almost like it should be covered up And they were trying to cover it up But don t you feel like they used Chacko not being there and coming back as an excuse to do everything they do Oh he s coming back so we have to do this They kind of use him as the excuse to do it Well it s sort of like Chacko could intervene and so we have to do it now so we can t miss our chance to do it again I think that s important actually I think that a theme of unintended consequences like it says here It wasn t their fault when the whole thing spun like a deranged top I think the theme of unintended consequences is really crucial to both the book and the movie In the movie for example when Mahuditi says she thinks she knows what the consequences will be if Kayani gets married but the unintended consequences confound the defilement that she commits by him being around I think that s this book and movie is really trying to say is this is what happens when you set up rules and don t adapt to social conditions which are inevitably bound to change I ll just go In the fourth paragraph they talk about having a plan It s very orderly and they said that Kochu Maria was a midget lieutenant They had this very organized and planned out even though in the second paragraph she shuddered with a school girl shudder It s like her childish emotions are being turned into or coming out through her adult form where she has the power to do stuff Yeah on that I really want to say cause it says school girl shudder at the beginning And then it back in the fourth paragraph when it s talking about their plan they re referred to as the two old ladies So that s contrasting in a way to be described which obviously it s important Yeah I think that s one of the themes of the passage Conflicts between age and which one is ultimately I don t want to say better but a better advantage I guess Like in authority Between age and youth you mean Between old and young Yeah age and youth Which one can have a better life according to them They also play with age When they locked Ammu up it s kind of like putting her in time out like they tricked her in to her room which is also a parallel I saw in the movie when they locked Kalyani up so she couldn t get married It was to keep them from doing stuff I just want to bring up another theme of the passage Where it s the very beginning where it s before we are completely ruined by the It kind of presents this idea that society is not built on the basis of individual needs what you do In this society at least affects everybody around you And it kind of contrasts Ammu s individualism with what societal hierarchy and how these two women are higher on the hierarchy so they have authority over her and so they re telling her not to do this And they re presenting their authority over her And Chacko s even higher than them just cause he s a guy When the passage lists the life cycle events the weddings the funerals baptisms and birthday parties it says for generations to come so I feel like what Peter was saying it affects all of society That also ties in with the age because the weddings are for younger people The funerals are when you die The baptisms are when you are just born So it s saying it will affect everybody at all parts of their life that s how profound it is And even that sentence that Peter was talking about before it goes any further Before we are completely ruined I think that s also just family selfishness because they re just projecting what her the consequences of her actions will be for them Not necessarily for her And in the movie where the leader of that house of she s just really concerned about herself She ll sacrifice all of the other women just so she s comfortable But does she also use a we I think both Baby Kochamma and Diti say the same thing We re gonna be ruined by this We we we In regards to that I think In water you know how all the widows they sorta put them together and they sort of create this unity It s all out of despair because they all lost something In a sense Mammachi lost her former love and so did Ammu Ammu had babies without It wasn t a formal tradition The way she had her babies And so in a sense she has She s in grievance and so those two aspects unites these women Yeah they re all widows Yeah they re all widows and that really But does that give them right to be Oh understand that s why I feel like it says we Not we like our family but more of like we women who are widowed Austin what do you think Do you think that gives them the right to because they ve also lost and because Baby Kochamma and Mammachi has also experienced trauma so that also means Diti as well Her husband died when she was young Does that give them the right to take that I don t think so cause that was actually one of my questions Especially when it says Her tolerance immense needs as far as her son was concerned became the fuel for unimaginable fury at her daughter And then just my question was is Baby Kochamma s actions motivated by Indian society or her own emotions So I don t think that they should be able to from their past experience take it out on everybody else I think that what we re talking about right now maybe be reason that Ghandi appears at the end of the film Because Ghandi as he is portrayed in water is a symbol of rationalism And it s when he shows up nice Diti sees that may have a refuge from cycles of hatred and of tradition conceived for the purpose of basically personal gain Ghandi s existence in the movie is indictments of almost every action taken in this passage by the scheming old women I think that Ghandi in the movie represents more of rebirth because they talk about how much society will change once Ghandi takes power The widows will gain power The untouchables won t be untouchable anymore They ll gain more rights So I think they look at him as not really rationalism because some people think that he s just crazy The Brahmin caste don t see him as rational so I think it s more of a hope in an idealized society Building off of what she said how Ghandi represents re birth I think coincides with the movie s title Water For me at least the way I saw it I felt like water was rebirth throughout the movie They washed themselves it was washing away their sins Being reborn I thought who s the girl The one who killed herself Kalyani I thought that it was symbolic when she drown herself Because the way she was killing herself she was submersing herself in water and I thought since water was clearing away your sins and stuff she in a sense she was clearing away her sins And so she would go to the next life sinless I think that the drowning of Kalyani parallels to how Sophie Mol drowned How it s like the innocent life was taken by the water Which isn t really innocence too But was Kalyani innocent I think that if she hadn t been forced to do things she would have been she didn t feel right about what she had done I m gonna take the opposite view point to the water that symbols of inescapability in the movie because of the way in both the movie and the book It says the fisherman had already found Sophie Mol She They drowned trying to cross the river and Kalyani loses everything when she crosses the river and realizes who Norian really is The river is important in both works It s an inescapable wall So I don t think water is portrayed as a good image I mean it could possibly be both I think Peter made a pretty good point about it Sam did with Kalyani s death and Sophie Mol s death But I think it could be both I think it s a duality thing And then going on combining what both ya ll said where you said it s an inescapably and the way they view it as washing away their sins View it as a cleansing thing also for example emphasizes the irrationality of all their beliefs And they re cleaning themself in this if water is just viewed a symbol they re cleaning themselves with something that s bad I also don t think that They depend on the water too to get their food from it They wash themselves in it Yet it s also it creates this it s something that the Paravans are trying to overcome A lot of people are trying to overcome this barrier but they depend on it They still need it So it s contrasting what they believe Just like a duality thing Yeah It s the family and God s talkings Their immediate family They depend on each other because when you re a child you have to have an older figure to help you grow up But they are also They cause the turmoil with each other They create their own problems pretty much It s like you can t live with them but you can t live without them Susan did you have a question Yes I did Well a lot of them are about similarities between characters But one thing that I thought about was how Norian dealt with his lover s loss and how Velutha was able to deal with being separated from Ammu And do you think that their status influenced how they were able to deal with the situations Sorry I missed all this So she I heard Well Norian because he was a Brahmin the highest caste I think he said we ll either going to Calcutta or India to start his life You mean Kolkata Or I m sorry or England To become a lawyer So he had the option of completely starting his life over wherever he wanted to go because he had education and he could provide for himself Velutha was an untouchable so he had no opportunity 
 Tell them what you wrote Describe your three pictures and then they re going to share what they saw and the three pictures they picked The cat I picked the roller coaster Man What did you get for what I only did two I think the Earth Y all did the roller coaster Max is that possible Why not what did you write There s no gravity So in that picture he s weightless but where is he In front of a building So he s on a planet right Yeah So what should happen if this was a video and we saw the next two seconds of that video He s falling He should fall right All right write that down next to that picture I don t mean to do that All right so let s look at the roller coaster He couldn t even fall like that because you got the gravity pushing down so that s why why he wouldn t fall like that And that s either like strange stuff But I don t think he could fall like that Unless he He can t fall like that That s impossible Get his weight and Yeah exactly cause he can t do that Yeah cause you can see his shadow under that And don t think he I think he got like a hoop or something So like a little string or something Or like he fall Yeah cause he can t do that They must have took that while he was Cause that s impossible Earth s gravity pulling him like that Unless he in space or something All right so why would he fall Because the force of gravity pushing down So why would he fall that way and not fall that way The gravity would push him down and not up so There s like there s gravity on Earth so like if you consider like how Newton found the apple when it fell to the ground Okay so you know there s something going on that s pulling you down And you say What if you were on the other side of the Earth Would it be pulling you up then If you were on the other side Or would it still pull you down to the ground It would still pull you down to the ground All right so on the planet what can we say about gravity Where is it trying to pull you To the center Ah to the center so it doesn t matter where you stand it s not pulling you down it s just trying to pull you where To the center To the center okay All right one more minute for sharing Make sure you have three pictures described on your T chart If you need to borrow an idea from your neighbor do that now And you got the Solar System Okay so it says planets can move because of gravity Where are they moving around the sun And what has them go in a circle and not flying away All right who would like to share what they wrote with their group Their favorite one their favorite picture All right Arquel which one was your favorite picture The roller coaster Roller coaster who picked roller coaster All right so let s all look at the roller coaster And Arquel tell us what your team wrote down and Sarah will add it to our list We had put that the gravity brings the speed to the to the roller coaster So if you wanted to make the speed increase you would want to bring your hill higher So therefore the the speed will increase and it ll go faster All right so Arquel says that gravity makes roller coasters go faster So if you want a faster roller coaster you need to build a higher roller coaster Did anybody write anything different for roller coaster Carlos what did you write Oh the same thing but the steepness of the hill when it s going down it increases its velocity and it s more G s All right so he says the steeper the hill more velocity more G s What s a G Let s have Carlos try first then we can help him out if he needs help What s a G You said G Yeah A G is a pull Okay so it s a pull Adriana you want to add to it It s a force pushing against you All right pushing against you Anybody else want to add to that It s a pull its a force it s pushing against you How do we get a G force What do you think Austin You have a push or pull you have excess friction air accelerates Push or pull excess friction Arquel All the forces together All the forces put together on you Okay So let s write G force down and put a question Cause we re still not sure what that is maybe we can get there So we re not sure quite what a G is But we know it has something to do with gravity All right let s pick another picture Who had a favorite picture that we haven t talked about that wasn t a roller coaster What was your favorite picture Greg The dude The dude who is the dude He has a name We know who that is Who is that Enrique Johnson It was Newton right What was Newton s first name Not John Isaac Issac there we go Issac Newton all right And what does the dude say Isaac Newton What s he saying What s his quote Not that dude this one Oh the floating dude Okay the floating dude He d rather talk about the floating dude above Isaac Newton Okay so let s look at the guy floating in the middle of the air He looks like he s planking Is this a possible picture if you just saw the picture No Greg why do you say this is impossible Because the Earth s gravitational pull right Okay so he says the Earth s gravitational pull what Like this wouldn t work because when you pull Okay he should be being pulled down to the center of the Earth Why do you say the center Cause that s where the gravitational pull s coming from Cause that s where all the gravity wants to take you and that s where all the gravity s coming from I like that answer Anybody want to add to it Vanessa But if you have pressure against both forces you could possibly stay up longer Okay so how could you get pressure to make you stay up longer Chloe Force Where would that force come from Your body So how could he if he s not touching the ground make himself float What s underneath you that you don t see Gravity Well we don t see gravity but what s underneath him It s around us right now Air The air right So let s think about the air If we could make the air thicker what would we also increase The gravity Not the gravity we re trying to go against the force of gravity The weight The force against our weight What s that called let s think about a boat Floating in the water Bouyance Bouyant force right So if you could increase the bouyant force of the air and Vanessa said if you could make that strong enough you should be able to float Does anyone know a planet where there s more thick clouds than we have here It s our neighbor Mars He has clouds Who has clouds who has thick clouds Jarissa Venus Venus Yeah is that what you were going to say Venus has super thick clouds right And if we could go there maybe there d be enough air underneath you that you could float in the air If they was pushing enough bouyant force on your body okay All right anymore for the floating guy Did anybody write anything different for the guy who looked like he was floating in the air I know that Karima and Anthony had a good answer What did you guys write down Anthony Put that I put that the gravity will pull you to the center of the Earth and it will like Like it would It pulls you to the center of the Earth and what did we decide about where you stand on Earth Like on the other side So what would happen if you went to the other side of the Earth Would it still pull you the same way Or is it going to pull you an opposite way The same way The same way where is it always going to pull you Down Towards the center To the center to the middle okay It doesn t matter what planet you stand on doesn t matter where you are it s trying to take you to the center of the object okay So why do we get stuck to the Earth and that the Earth s stuck to us in this picture Cause the Earth s solid and it doesn t let us go out into the Okay so he said the Earth is solid Are we solid Yes Hmm okay so maybe it s not that we re solid cause maybe there s something else going on What do you think Carlos The Earth has more mass than us The Earth has more mass than us Jenny what s mass Mass is well all of us then We all have it How would you give a definition of mass what is it about us The type of weight It s the type of weight Okay we re on the right track Who wants to help her out What s mass The amount of density Amount of density Okay we re getting better Jarissa The amount of space that it takes Well what would that be what s your space Volume okay So space is volume We re still trying to figure out what s mass We ve heard some density words we ve heard volume words what do you think Ky The amount of electrons Oh we re getting closer So it s your electrons your Atoms Ah your atoms So it s how many atoms you have inside your body That s your mass So now someone else said weight so let s go back to that How do you get weight So you stand on the scale How do you know your weight What is going on What do you think Hakeem Pounds We measure it in pounds Okay so how do me measure it How do you get pounds What s happening to your mass What happens when you stand on the scale What is it measuring Your weight Your weight So then how do we figure that out What s going on What s going on on a scale Carlos The gravity is pushing you down Gravity is pushing you down So what happens to your weight if you have more mass You re heavier You re heavier So your weight how would we give a description of weight now We know mass is how many atoms you have We know volume is how much space you take up So now what s weight Carlos has kind of said it for us How would we put it as a definition It s the pull of what on your mass Gravity Pull of gravity So let s look at the guy in the picture again If this was going to be true what would we have to say about his mass to be able to float Would he be allowed to have a mass on Earth Hakeem says no Vanessa says yes If you re going to float and there s gravity always trying to pull you down in order to float what do we have to do With our mass Decrease our mass okay So let s think about if we go to another planet with our weight Does your mass change if you go to another planet Yes no Do all of a sudden you have more atoms in you No Depending on the gravity What did you say You have the same atoms but your weight and mass changes You said the same amount of atoms so your weight and mass changes But if you have the same amount of atoms isn t your mass the same Yeah Okay so what s the only thing that would change Jarissa The gravity The gravity so then what would that change about your weight Would it change or would it stay the same It would change It will change So what can we say if we went to a smaller planet You ll become lighter You ll become lighter Why Because it has less gravity Has less gravity so less pull You weight less okay So let s put weightless next to G force as another word we should look up Ready All right so what I want you to do now using all your notes that we just took and what we just talked about I want you to flip your paper over And in the circle I would like you to try with your partner to write a definition for what you think gravity is I ll give you one minute You and your partner try to figure out what you think the definition of gravity is and write that in your circle back Make sure you guys share that okay A lot of weight or What s the other word of how many atoms you have What s it pulling on Very good so it pulls on your mass And think about where it s trying to pull Oh that s a good definition of gravity try to write your definition on your paper Make sure your neighbor also has a definition on their paper Pulls what Pulls the Weight You almost said it Mass Mass Make sure you guys share that okay You guys done Okay so what is gravity It s a force so that means it s a what A A short pull Gravity s pulling us right Okay so what s so what do you think is it pushing or pulling Pushing Pulling Ooh we have a disagreement Better figure out which ones right Okay so it s a pull So where is it trying to take you to And what is it trying to take about Your Your definition All right what are you having I wrote that gravity is an invisible force that pushes or pulls you towards the center Okay so the word I want you to make sure we say is invisible Cause we ll talk about that okay All right so let s share our definitions Who would like to share their definition first All right Ky We put gravity is a force that always brings you to the middle All right Gravity is a force that always brings you to the middle So Sarah can you add that to the circle Arquel what did you guys write Gravity is a pulling force that brings you to the center of the Earth and it wants to the mass Okay so you added mass to that Okay so it s pulling on mass What do you want to add Angel I want to add to Kyle s answer that it s invisible Invisible So let s think about what we learned about forces If it s invisible you can t see it Is it touching you Yes Or is it everywhere It s everywhere Everywhere So is it a contact force or a non contact force Non contact Why do you say that Israel Because it s not touching you It s not touching you So even if you re floating in outer space will gravity still be there Yes What do you think Carlos Yes You say yes So those astronauts will they still feel some gravity Even though they re out at the space station What do you think Angel Outer space has some gravity but greater than that s why they wouldn t feel it What do you think it depends on We have mass so far But the strength of gravity also depends on something else We have mass but what could it also depend on Vanessa Force Okay gravity is a force Angel was getting there he was saying that it s still pulling on you it s just not as strong The weight That s mass We talked about mass and weight Trying to get the other thing that s going to control gravity How big the planet is Okay so that s mass Let s think about the astronauts who are not as close to the Earth Are they weightless They have the same amount of mass their mass didn t change But they went farther away from the Earth So why are they weightless Why do they float What s the other factor going on with gravity Moving away from the center of the Earth So what do we call that Has to do with how the gravitational pull depends on We have mass and we re looking for the other factor we could change to change gravity What do you guys think If I m really far away from Jarissa am I able to grab her as much as if I was closer No If I go real close to her is it easier for me to pull on her Yes But what happens if I go far away I have the same mass my mass doesn t change can I reach her as easily now No So what s the other thing going on with gravity Distance Distance So if you re far away from the Earth can gravity pull on you as hard No No But the closer you get the little bit stronger little bit stronger So then why do we feel the pull of gravity here on Earth but I don t feel the Sun We re closer to the Earth than we are the Sun So we re going to feel the Earth before we would feel the Sun But now if we left the planet we started going somewhere else say I was going to Mars What would happen the closer I got to Mars Who would start pulling me now Mars The Mars center of its planet would start to pull me Okay So let s look at the picture of the planets Thinking about pulling to the center why in the picture of the planets is the Sun in the middle of all the planets Because it s the biggest Oh it s the biggest one We got a couple of different answers so let s share with our neighbor first See if you know why the sun is in the center You got 30 seconds It s got the biggest mass It got the biggest mass and it s the biggest So like it got the most gravitational pull That s why it s in the middle All right Marco Why do you think the Sun is in the center of our solar system Because I don t know You don t know Okay Javier what do you think You re his partner what did you guys talk about Based on what we just talked about why would the Sun go in the center It has more mass It has more mass So what does it also have more Gravity So he s always going to be in the middle right What if we had a bigger star come our way Like what about a black hole Say one of our neighbors blew up One of our 
 Get out your journal I ll read it aloud and I ll put the time on the timer Get our your journal We re looking at journal entry number 14 And you re not allowed to write I don t know take a guess if you re not sure but don t write I don t know So question 14 is very simple Why do you think an earthquake happens You can write it you can draw a picture So I m asking you why do you think an earthquake happens You have three minutes right now to write what you think Why do you think an earthquake happens Why do you think an earthquake happens and why do you think Remember there s no right or wrong it s what you think is the answer Remember you can draw a picture if that helps you Okay if you want to draw alright you ve got like a minute left so you can draw a picture Write down what you think I m gonna give you about 30 more seconds Many of you are still writing and that s fine but I thought before we talk about this let s take a look at a little clip because I realize maybe not everybody has experience with an earthquake So this one s kinda cool It was shot obviously on somebody s iPhone so it s not the best quality but many of you know that Japan has lots of earthquakes all the time they re very used to earthquakes So this person lives in Japan and so again they re used to earthquakes right So they weren t like panicking so he actually took his iPhone and filmed the ground So I want you to take a look We re only gonna look at about a minute of it but I want you to notice how the ground is moving okay And we re gonna use that idea to talk about why earthquakes happen So this is pretty cool So this was back in March 2011 So notice Now they re gonna go to another part Notice the ground in the back watch the back You ll see something happen Watch what s happening Alright so that s real it s not like there was a machine underneath there doing that So you guys we can solve what s happening so let s take that and let s talk about this through Why do you think an earthquake happens Why do you guys think an earthquake happens And remember when we talk we re gonna let one person go at a time and we re gonna make sure we talk loudly so that we can hear Alright so let s just start on this side We re gonna work this way Tony what did you write Why do you think an earthquake happens Well I think there s something wrong with the mantle that s coming out through the crust and makes it vibrate the earth and causing an earthquake Okay something to do with the mantle causes the earth to vibrate Also I liked how you used a complete sentence So remember if you re not sure there s some sentence starters up there Jheyline what did you write I think earthquakes happen because two plate boundaries overlap each other Excellent because plate boundaries overlap each other Jose I think that earthquakes happen when plates crash When plates crash Together Anybody else Adrian and then Dajana I think that earthquakes happen because plates slide Because plates slide excellent Dajana I think an earthquake happens from too much stress Also I think the plate boundaries overlap Ooh I like what you said and that s exactly where I m going next So in that video clip you guys saw the ground move I m gonna give you 10 seconds And that 10 seconds you re gonna share with the person next to you how did the ground move What direction was that ground moving So you have 10 seconds share with your partner next to you or share with the people across from you Go 10 seconds Alright finishing up in five four three two one zero Okay so I heard lots of people talking so I m gonna pull a name this time remember you can say what you said or what the person next to you said So what kind of movement did you notice in that video clip Let s see Now Neferly what kind of movement did you see They were moving apart Good moving apart what else did you notice Angel They were moving apart Moving apart what else did you notice Dajana Well it was crashing everywhere but I saw the Ooh kind of like water coming out of the sky Josh what else did you notice Oh so a little bit of up and down movement Alright so up and down movement Anybody else notice any other type of movement So you guys said up and down you said moving apart Oh did you see how that piece literally slid Yeah Alright so that s movement You guys know some words for this What are some words that we ve learned to describe movement and Dajana said a couple What words Jina Shearing Yes so there was some shearing happening What else was happening Rodolfo Tension Yes some tension pulling apart And what else did you notice Daniel Compression Yeah compression squeezing together Okay so we re getting this idea that didn t Dajana you said it was stress or you said stress Dajana right So something about stress being kind of important So we re gonna take that idea Give us a moment okay thanks Alright so sorry about the interruption So stress Dajana was saying stress So let me give you an example So let s imagine that this rubber band is not a rubber band Let s imagine that it s a rock And let s imagine it s a rock I know it s a rubber band but let s imagine it s a rock So I m gonna take I m gonna go like this it s a rock remember So I m doing this to the rock and then I m gonna stand here for an entire year and then a year from now I m gonna put my hands further apart And then another year I m gonna put my hands further apart What s happening to this rock or this rubber band What s happening to this rock over time What s happening Lupita to this rock It s stretching It s stretching what else Add to that Tucker and stretching it out stretch is added to it Stress is added too nice Victor So maybe it s getting a little compression Okay maybe a little compression too My hands are getting tired Tony Continental drift Ooh like okay so if there were other pieces like my hands were Africa and South America they d be moving apart Ernesto Thinner in the middle Thinner in the middle Sakura Tension So tension now I m gonna stop because my hands starting to hurt but what would happen if I kept doing that I m gonna have you take 10 seconds to talk to the person next to you What might happen if I kept doing that and I kept doing that and I kept doing that What might happen to this rubber band or this rock So 10 seconds to the person next to you ten seconds Alright finishing up in five four three two one zero Okay I heard lots of good discussion So if I kept doing this I kept doing it I kept doing it Moses what might happen It might crack and break It might crack and break Everyone what else maybe might happen Victor It will scrape the mountain and it will create an earthquake and it ll break Ooh oh I like cause you remember this a lot right Little earthquake excellent Tucker It s just like when you shove your fingers go all the way back it will break Oh yeah that would be painful Jheyline It d probably explode from so much tension and stretch everything Did everybody hear that word she just said Which word did you say it would Explode Explode wow That s a big powerful word but that s pretty equal to what happened right Big amount of power Or like when you were doing that with the rock like when you were moving it like it would get more thinner and get more it would kinda get wider when after all while it s still going it s gonna like Good so let s step back a little bit So who was it someone had said earthquake right You had said earthquake So it s sounding like what if that happens first So before the earth actually moves before what we saw in the video what did you guys think was happening And Moses had used the word for it too What was happening to the rocks over time So over time what was happening in that rock that would eventually lead to an earthquake What s happening over time Ernesto what s happening over time It s stretching It s stretching keep going with that Diego It was standing It was standing Tony It s spreading apart Spreading apart Jheyline Widening Widening Tiger Breaking Breaking so wait before the breaking though you guys were saying it was stretching it was pulling so what word can you describe it building up in here building up Stephanie Through stress Ah okay so it sounds like if we re gonna make an earthquake we need to have stress first We have said stress that builds right Stress builds and then what s gonna happen when the stress builds and it builds and it builds and it builds and it can t take it anymore What s going to happen Manuel Collide This is stress keep going Not collide what s another word that s kind of same idea So you said it when I was over here It s gonna keep stressing and stressing and what s gonna happen to the rock Rip It ll what Rip Rip what s another word you can say It ll explode Explode Adrian Break Break great so there s going to be a rupture Or a break And then is that it End of the story Nice day that s it Where does all this energy go right There s all this energy building up where does it go Yeah it ruptures it breaks and then is it over No No what where what happened Where did the energy go Where did that energy go Irma where d it go Plate tectonics Yeah it has to do with plate tectonics absolutely Where did that energy go Where did it go Rodolfo Plate boundaries Yeah plate boundaries So okay we got stress builds ruptures it breaks and then is that it No That s the earthquake What action Yeah Anna It becomes an earthquake Yeah it becomes an earthquake and so what do we experience Jheyline Shaking Shaking oh So it sounds like there s a rupture or a break and then that s gonna lead to shaking and that shaking is actually what being released An earthquake It s an earthquake yes and what is that shaking actually being released So the shaking is released what Victor All the stress Yes it s releasing all the stress What s another word you could say Releasing all of its Power Power is a good word or Diego Energy Energy right So it seems like all an earthquake is is stress building up building up building up breaks and then we feel that What do we experience the energy as So what do we experience think of the energy as What do we experience it as an energy That That what s that Shaking Shaking right Alright awesome So now we re gonna you guys did that perfectly So we re gonna write that down in our notes Woah I know that earthquakes release energy right So that s what happens as a result So we are not in any way done with this because we are gonna talk all about different You guys have made a good start on what s happening So we are gonna take two notes today They re pretty short I m sorry the first one s a little long The other one s super short But this is what you guys were just telling me except now we re gonna add the word elastic strain which is what you guys were telling me You were telling me that energy was building up you were telling me stress was building up and that s gonna cause elastic strain Yes Dajana The pictures that you showed us What It only cut through the Kind of yeah Yes So like maybe cause on the bottom that came out of the ground Yeah And then it just spilled it over then it came out of the ground Yeah so thank you for those of you who got started Rodolfo let me just read this off for people So our first topic today is earthquake energy And this is what we just talked about But now we re getting a chance to write it down and we re adding in a bigger word And that word is elastic strain So elastic strain is the energy stored as rocks change shape So elastic strain is the energy stored as rocks change shape Okay so that s step one in an earthquake Step two Energy is released when the rock ruptures or breaks So elastic strain is the energy stored as rocks change shape and energy is released when the rock ruptures or it breaks and released energy travels in seismic waves and we will learn all about those next week But you can still write down you just think released energy travels and it s felt as shaking 
 The corners The corners that s fine How do you get exactly one painted face Which one of these have just one color on them The middle Yeah just the ones in the middle on each face And how many of them are there Six So that s 6 out of 27 So that s fine And realize that if you did it right those are all your options Each of these cubes has either zero colors up to three colors Nothing has four colors So that means all your probabilities should add up to what 27 27 out of 27 Does it No No so what s the issue One of these numbers at least has to be off So figure out which one that is See if you could figure what one So keep in mind these look right But realize these are all probabilities because you re picking them out of that hat So these should all be out of 27 Right because there s 27 cubes you re picking from Right And if you did it right and these are all the cubes then they should add up to what 27 Right does it Yeah it does 27 okay so fine Good So when you do the next one it should all be out of We can figure that out You can figure that out Isn t it 16 times 4 so 64 So where are you getting these numbers from My mind Okay so I get no painted faces There s just the one cube that s right in the middle So that s one out of Because you re picking them out 1 out of 27 You gotta do a probability right But then how many have one painted face How d you get six Which six The middle ones Sure the middle ones And there s six faces so it makes sense 6 out of 27 How do you get three painted faces I didn t do that one Okay The corners So that should be eight And then realize if you did this right it should all at up to what 27 27 out of 27 So how do you figure out how many have two painted faces Just add these together and subtract them Yeah you could do that Now there is a pattern to the two just like the other ones But you can also subtract and figure that out So yeah good Oh that brings up a good point Everybody for your first cube For your very first cube everything should be out of what number 27 27 All your probabilities should be out of 27 Is it possible you can reduce the fractions when you figure it out Yes Yes I m gonna tell you don t reduce them Leave it out of 27 Even if it s 3 out of 27 don t reduce it to one ninth Just leave it at 3 out of 27 it ll help you down the line So those look good And you know One of the ways you could check if you did this right is all four of these should add up to what 27 27 And does it Yeah It adds up to 27 out of 27 So you got all your bases covered So that s good Okay good keep going How many have no painted faces Four Why four which four The four is right over here inside and then there s four Okay but let me ask you this there s these four But you said go inside a layer And then you re right there s four underneath But then there s another layer underneath that So there s eight So there should be eight And one of the ways you know you re right about this besides just hoping that you re thinking about it the right way How do you know there s three painted faces Which eight are you talking about The corners The corners So you know you re right with the eight but these should all add up to what And they do so you re okay Okay good So keep going and you re good it s all out of 64 So that s a good start Will this still have one painted face Well there is a pattern to it just like the other ones But it s fine if you can t figure that out yet Just keep going you ve got the right number So see if you can figure it out now for the 4x4x4 How are we doing on the front side Everything good So let me ask you this about this stuff I assume you all have the same answers Yeah So you said one painted face there s six of them Which six Just one color painted Sure the center of each of the six faces And there s six faces so six times one is six That s fine No we got 8 out of 27 for three Because which ones are you looking at The corners No painted faces there s just one in the middle If you added all these up what should they equal But what does it equal up to Not 27 So what s the issue What s the deal there No idea Where is there something going wrong Because you know that one has to be eight You know there s exactly one because it s the center one in each of the six sides So you know that has to be six The issue is with the two painted faces It s not eight Now you can figure it out by subtracting and just figuring out what adds up to 27 Or you could go back and just look at those how many of those have the two painted faces Where are you getting eight from Which cubes here have two painted faces These ones So that s four on this front side There s four on the back side That s eight Two on this side 10 12 12 Does that make sense And that adds up to 27 then when you add all those up So now do the same thing for the one out of 64 Okay Good How we doing These should add up to 64 shouldn t they They should add up to 64 How do you get no painted faces How do you get the four with no painted faces The center pieces So over here let s say these four in the middle But you re not looking at those Those have one painted face but you look a layer below that And that s four right there But you can go a layer below that So that should be eight So does that mess up something else I don t know how you got the other numbers So the equation for this it d be distance divided by two to get three Does that work up here You re on the right track You re thinking the right way Minus two Does that work I mean once you get this I would try to do a 5x5x5 cube Even though I didn t write it down there See if it holds up Yeah because there d be 27 in the middle That seems to make sense And that ll help you on the back side when you get there So these look fine Let s talk about this one for a second If you add these up you have 24 24 18 4 If you add all those up what do you get Do you 60 60 Right now you have 60 out of 64 So there s four squares you haven t counted yet Where did they go And you kinda know you re right with the three colored cubes because you know which ones they are Which ones are those So would we add it to the non painted faces Why You can t randomly What s the pattern Which ones have no painted faces The ones on the top So basically you have these four right here but a layer below right But there s also another layer below that Oh so it s eight So that s where there s eight Does that make sense Oh yeah I see that So that s where that s coming from So now it adds up to 64 It looks like you re probably good Why don t you try doing it for a 5x5x5 cube before you go to the back side so at least you have some patterns you can detect It ll make the back side easier But it should be a breeze now to get the 5x5x5 cube Wow Chris You re on a roll Smart idea making a graph And that should be eight over what Over here how many squares do we have We have 27 And you got that because it s Three cubed Three cubed And the other one is four cubed If you do the 5x5x5 it would be five cubed So if you have an nxnxn what is that n cubed So everything should be out of n cubed on the back And you re right that it s eight out of n cube for the three painted Why don t you try the no painted That s probably the next one to get But what there s the one middle How do you figure that out And this is where you gotta go back and look at the pattern you got for no painted faces How did you figure that out And maybe the numbers help but maybe just look at the picture and figure out how did we know how many had no painted faces Right What do those numbers have in common Okay How we doing Well you re definitely right with eight over n cubed That makes sense right Because always the corners in the cube It s always the same How did you get 6n here And you got it over here You guys have 6n in different places Well see I thought I got a brain blast What But it didn t work out I mean I felt really smart for two seconds But I was thinking that since there s six sides it has to be six times something Okay Okay that s not a bad way to think You know the answer here was 12 Yeah That was with the 3x3x3 cube Does that work If n is three you would get 18 But that s not what you got on the front side So there s some discrepancy Okay But that s not a bad way to think Some of these things have to do with six faces Like there s some multiplying by six involved You know the corner ones are gonna be eight no matter what That has nothing to do with six faces Right Right that s just the corners How do you do this Go back a second Sorry a lot of flipping You feel confident about these two sets of numbers Yeah So why don t you try doing it 5x5x5 cube even though I didn t ask for it But see what numbers you get for that because it ll make the back page a little better Because now you ll have more numbers to use and try to find a pattern You guys have different numbers Why is that What do you mean On the front side What do you mean Sarah has 8 out of 64 here You have 4 out of 64 here Oh blood Oh my god Do you need to go Go go Go to the bathroom I don t care I care go Do you have band aids now I don t know I don t think I do Go to the bathroom Things still happen So you have eight out of eight cubed That s fine We know the three painted faces are going to be which ones The corners The corners And there s always gonna be eight So that s fine Eight out of n cubed How do you figure out how many have zero painted faces It s always the ones in the middle Yes always the ones in the middle So when you had a 3x3x3 cube what was in the middle One And what s the dimensions of that cube 1x1x1 When it was a 4x4x4 cube what were the dimensions of the middle That you couldn t see 4x4x4 Well 4x4x4 is the whole cube 2x2x2 2x2x2 If it was a 5x5x5 cube what would be the middle 3x3x3 3x3x3 If its an nxnxn cube what s the middle You kinda have it If it s 6x6x6 what s the middle I don t know I m kinda lost Okay go back for a second You lost me at the 5x5x5 one Okay you know its 3x3x3 And the center was 1x1x1 That s the ones you couldn t see any color 4x4x4 cube what s the center 2x2x2 If it s a 5x5x5 cube let s say What would the center be 3x3x3 3x3x3 If it s a 6x6x6 cube 4x4x4 If it s an nxnxn cube n minus two Times n minus two times n minus two So what s the pattern for no painted faces n minus two cubed Exactly That s the sort of pattern you need to find for those first two now How are you figuring these out when you actually have a concrete 5x5x5 cube Is this what you re supposed to do Because it s saying that n is the number of small cubes so you can t just say it s a 4x4x4 n is representing the whole 125 cubes right Right So is this the correct equation for one painted sides For one painted side Yeah For one painted side Well how are you finding the one painted face Or how many painted cubes did you have here I had six Six which six It s basically the one in the center but there s six faces so we multiplied by six So I get where this is coming from The multiply by six So n represents the 125 n represents how many across you have Oh I thought n represented the whole No I mean 
 boys and girls for the last week we have been looking at videos about Dr Martin Luther King We ve been reading books about Dr Martin Luther King to get a feel for who he was why people loved him so much why laws were changed because of things that he said and things that he did So today we are going to watch another clip of Dr Martin Luther King This is probably one of the most famous speeches he ever gave It was his I Have a Dream speech I don t want you to so much listen to his words today as I want you to think about what else he does as he speaks or while he s speaking that makes him such a great speaker How does he capture his audience How does he get people to want to listen to him Alright So I want you to pay close attention It s just a short clip Then you ll turn to your partners So let s see Let me go ahead and get this started I have a dream that one day down in Alabama with its vicious racists with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers I have a dream today I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted and every hill and mountain shall be made low the rough places will be made plain and the crooked places will be made straight and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together This is our hope This is our hope and this is the faith that I go back to the South with With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope With this faith we will be able to Okay I m going to stop it there And I want you to tell me first of all what are some things that you notice that he did to capture his audience I want you to think about it for a minute I see lots of hands up What I want you to do is turn to your share partner first Talk to your partner about what you saw Okay Let me have your attention back up here I m going to write Dr King in the middle of this web What I want you all to do is to tell me what are some things that you and your partner discussed about what you saw that made people want to listen and to focus and pay attention to what Dr King had to say Sara He had hand motions He had hand motions But there was no hand motions in that clip Yeah there was I m glad that you all saw that I almost said something You could kind of see this hand go up but it was so close The video was so close That s why I picked that particular segment because I saw his arm and I thought Oh I hope they get that because I couldn t find a better clip Zachary The way he said a few words at a time Okay He said words at a time and stopped Very good He spaced his words for lack of something a better term to use Zachary said he would say a few words and then he would stop so that people could absorb almost what he was saying and then he could go on Annie Okay Emma He spoke in a very low voice so it was really easy to hear him Okay So his tone of voice right We ll put tone of voice So it was easy to hear him Yeah And then he didn t mumble He spoke up really loud He spoke loudly He did not mumble she said He spoke loudly He spoke very serious Yes He spoke very serious Jesenya He shook his head He shook his head didn t he He nodded Very good That was my idea He shook his head Or nodded Dalen He was looking at the audience Very good He was looking at the audience We call that eye contact He had notes in front of him but he didn t do this did he No He looked up constantly He might have looked down to see where he was in his speech but he always looked back at his audience Lenare He said nice words that the people knew Okay The words that he spoke he had a good message didn t he If you have a good message people are willing to listen to you too He was a good good man One more Kalen He even had a gooder life a better life Very good And that goes kind of along with the words that he spoke the good message about having a better life All right So you guys came up with some really good points right here What I want you to think about when you do your readers theater I want you to think about how you can incorporate what Dr Martin Luther King incorporated into his speeches to get people to listen to him so that you re believable in your part that people can understand what you re saying So what we re going to do is we re going to create a rubric together that s going to help you So it s called Rubric For Speaking Out for Justice Dr Martin Luther King Jr a readers theater play grade two because you guys are second graders Now let s take a look at what I ve written listening speaking viewing There s a three a two and a one Let s do listening first okay Now if three is the highest how do you think you can get a three Sayid By getting a one plus two Okay But don t think about math right this moment Oh I want you to think about if I were grading you you were grading yourself or your peers were grading you how would you give yourself a three or someone else a three Emma We start with listening You wouldn t be just fumbling through your pages of your book and just traveling around You d be listening to the other people because you have to know when your part is You have to be ready Very good You have to know where your part is Part of doing readers theater is listening to the people that are reading before you because that is going to give you your cue of when it s your turn to speak okay So I was a good listener Let s look at number two How do you think you would get a two How would you score a two for listening If the best is that you were a good listener what would two be Annie Looking at your paper and then like doing something else Looking at your paper but doing something else Maybe looking away maybe fidgeting So maybe you tried to listen most of the time but you had difficulty with it So we could say I tried to listen most of the time Most of the time So what about a one Kennedy I didn t listen at all Very good Like purposefully not paying attention I forgot to listen Yeah you don t decide to do that on purpose Whitney Now the next thing you re going to be scored on is speaking So how could you get a three for speaking Sara Don t speak like just normal like how the actor would speak Speak how the actor would speak Good Lenore Let s do a body check please I need you all on the carpet You re supposed to like listen to what he said Okay Annie Like speak a little louder When you speak loudly then I spoke loudly enough for people to hear I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character I have a dream that one day the state of Alabama will Will be Will be transformed into a situation where little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers My dad and I have that dream too When we let freedom ring we will let it rumble We will let it ring from every village and every hamlet and every state in every city We will be able to see that day when all of God s children black men and white men Jews and Gentiles Protestants and Catholics will join hands and sing the words of the old Negro spirit Free at last Free at last Thank God almighty We are free at last Dad when I listen to Reverend King I know that he s right I know that things are going to change I think you re right Act IV It is now spring of 1963 The speech of Reverend King has continued to lead people and speak out their He has met with another president Lyndon B Johnson and has seen changes sweep across the country May Billy please come in here I have some news What is it Mom Reverend King is dead He was shot in Memphis Tennessee No Mom That s not fair He was helping all of us I agree Billy It isn t fair But remember Reverend King lives on in us Every time we remember the words every time we speak out against things that are unfair we are giving remembrance Okay So go find the people that had your card and have your conversations get your feedback about how you did Miss Walters I got all three too Great Great Did you see me I had nine points You were a good listener Very good Great feedback 
 Starter stopper opposite side Okay Everybody has their marbles How many trials are we doing Five Five trials If the first one doesn t work raise your hand I will come help you and we ll talk about why it doesn t work and what we re gonna do to change it What you re gonna do to change it Okay Timers Get your people ready Remember you re gonna say Ready set as soon as that go All right Go Ready Set Go Oh You re supposed to get it Right here This great piling direction Did y all s work Yeah Good Good Did you record the time Look Tell him You guys are ready to keep going Five trials Good job And we ll discuss why yours worked in a minute We gonna take Okay hang on Tell me what happened When it got here it stopped It stopped Why did Friction Okay the Probably because the speed wasn t great enough Okay So you think you needed more speed No I think we need to take this off Okay Let s try taking that off Where do you think you can put those to get more speed Up here Ok Now what is that gonna give the marbles More momentum Yes Let s make it bigger Three centimeters Is this our second one Are we gonna do a second try You re going back to your first one because you want to make sure it works So reset it Okay Try again Did it work Yeah Let s discuss why did it work this time Look how we gave them these By doing what By um Making it higher Elevation Ooh And what s another word that Altitude Yeah That s good Okay So it worked How long did it take Seven seconds Face the recorder Got it Okay Very good Keep going You re ready for your second trial Okay We re done Y all already done five trials Okay Well let s just stop for a minute What comes down Let s pull together here Let s talk I want you guys to talk about why you think it worked Because the big hill helped The hill What force is that The hill was enormous so it gave it more momentum Good job So gravity pulled it down What did you say I said the hill s bigger than the hoop so it gave it more momentum so it would go To make it through the loop Right And the force pulling it down was what Gravity Gravity Good Now talk to me about the order that you put it in Why would you you kind of just did We put the hill here so the hill would go faster to go in the loop To get more speed behind it Good And the turn would Make it slow down Yeah So what do you think would make the marble stop down there at the end Friction Friction Okay Very good We got all five trials You guys need a knee Start recording your information It went really fast Really fast Just three seconds Did it work on the first trial No Okay Tell me what happened on the first trial It was like that And it just went off right here Okay Why do you think it fell off What was going on right here to make it fall Twist There was a twist in it So you just had to fix it so that it went straighter And so you pushed it Renny put it like this like around here Pushed it in So it might have been a little to steep too That incline might have been too steep What order did you put your elements in Hill loop and turn Okay And why d you put the hill first Because it s higher And it would give more speed What force is giving it more speed right here Gravity Very good Okay And then talk to me about why you put your loop right after that hill and not your turn Why didn t you put your turn there If we turn there s not enough speed For the loop Okay Y all both said the exact same thing Repeat that to me so I understand If we put the turn first it won t have enough speed for the loop Good Very good All right Good job guys Have you got five trials It s all three seconds All of em were the same That s interesting Very good We ll talk about that after you each need a knee and record your information Anthony what was your job Record So you were the one that found that they were the same each time Make sure you get written down everything Okay guys Talk to me We got three Did the first one work No Tell me what happened on the first one becuase I didn t see it The first one we had this open and we had it sitting right there and we had the chair right here and when we set it down right here when the chair was right there it kept on falling off So it just dropped So you think the incline was too what Straight It was too steep There you go That s the word I m looking for It was too steep Because it was right here and it was going all down Very Good So what did you do to fix it We kept on sliding it down a little Did you have to slide it down more than once Yes Good job guys So did you get it to where you could do five trials Yes And we got three for each Three seconds They did too They got the exact same for all of em How about that But look at your coasters They look different Yeah That s interesting too Cause their incline is steeper than yours Lets talk about the order that you have your elements in What s first The hill because it gives more speed when it s going down a hill so you don t But that s on what force Gravity Good job And why d you put your loop right after that Because it would have the most speed to keep going and then the turn return it Because if we did the turn it wouldn t have enough speed to make the loop Good job Good job Need a knee record your information and start figuring your speed Have you guys got all five trials Nope Uh oh What happened It stopped because of the friction When it get right here it started getting out of friction Friction right here What s causing friction right here Can I watch it Its gonna work this time because we taped it down Why do you think it s gonna work Because we taped it down You know what I want you to use that one How long did that take Seven Seven seconds All right Do it again Let s look at it again So it was stopping right here It always was stopping right there and then I taped it down Oh you taped this down That thing could be higher Okay I think you should try that We can use this clock No we need some more I was gonna get one of them books Guys you can use any state So what are you doing to the hills Making it bigger So the speed will go more faster More faster So that it ll increase the speed All right Let s see what happens Let s see if this one works Angel what are you doing Timing Ready One Oh We use good team work You are using good teamwork I m proud of it Ready Set Go It didn t start from the beginning I did not start that one Let me ask you this Just to give you a different idea because you ve already tried to change in the elevation of your hill Maybe how big the loop is How do you think that ll help So the will go faster and will make it go through All right We re gonna try this Help her out guys So we re making the loop smaller and that s gonna So now you might want to move this up a little bit there You see how this is gonna have to go There you go What about your taping If it s will the Yeah Let s try again Wait We were gonna time that honey Now you re ready to go So what was the solution to your problem To make the loop smaller so it would go through much faster All right Good job Now you re ready to time five trials Ready Go Look how beautiful Good job guys How many seconds Four Four seconds That s good How many trials Three We got two more I want to know You got three seconds on each one So your speed was the same Where did your distance come from We did how many feet and then we found out how many inches And times it by 18 because it s 18 on there How long was each tube Six feet Six feet How many inches is that Let s work it out Make sure you ve got it right on here 72 So you ve got 72 inches We only did one tube And how many tubes are there There s three tubes So 72 What would you do next Times three Yes 72 times three How did you guys get 216 You did 18 inches instead of six I mean 12 Okay So now you ll have to go back and redo your speed Figure in your speed So how do you find speed I still got 216 Well then you were right That s right So you guys are ready to go on to make a graph Let s talk about the graph you re gonna make Let s talk about the graph Thinking about what you ve learned in math and what you ve been doing with graphs in math using this data table right here What is this right here Time I want you guys to think about what we talked about with graphs I want you to decide what kind of graph you should make Line graph because it s over time Yeah Line graph I decided Yeah we decided to put a line graph because it s time So any time you use time the line graph is the one to use Very very good Do we write the numbers on here Yeah How are you gonna know what numbers to put on there Think about it You ve got the trials the distance the time and the speed Do you need to use these You re probably just gonna use your trial and your speed So you ll label your line graph One will be the trial and one will be the speed And do you remember when you did the race car activity Not the race car activity I m sorry Remember the Stanley the Sluggish Snail What did that line graph look like It was a straight line Because it was a constant speed So what do you think this is gonna look like Constant speed A straight line Good Okay You ve got your trial You got your times Let s talk about your speed First we need to look at your distance How did you figure distance We need to divide by those speeds But your distance is how far the marble traveled right 18 Yeah 18 Yeah because you said each was six feet Six feet You re doing it in inches Oh So let s go back and refigure that I want you guys to talk about how to do that Cause we want it in inches So what is the first thing you would do Y all talk through it Y all talk to each other Let s talk about it After you re done erasing I was thinking like how many inches each Okay There you go Talk about it Anybody know how many inches are in a foot 16 Nope Try again If you have a ruler 12 Yep Good So that s 12 x 3 Good 36 Okay So 36 inches and then how many of these are there Three Uh huh 36 multiplied six speed So you need to do 6 x 12 6 x 12 is 72 Make sure you got it right I did it before It is 72 So now you will do 72 times Three Good Do it on your paper It s 216 inches Okay Now what are you gonna do Write it down And then what Multiply 216 to this So how will you figure speed now Divide Divide what Three to 216 Very good Can you tell me that again Jeffrey You re gonna do what Divide 216 into three And you ll only have to do it how many times One Because you got the same speed each time You can do three into 216 72 And no remainder That s nice Isn t it Now knowing what we know about graphs what we re doing in math Jeffrey are you listening Y all stop writing for a minute and listen Knowing what we know about graphs what we talked about in math and using this data and speed what kind of graph do you think you re gonna make Line Why did you say a line graph Because it s the same I want you to think about this right here Over time We discussed we need to use a line graph okay When you make your line graph which two columns there s only two columns that you can use on there Which two do you think you re gonna use This one and Well you ve already figured that out This one and which other one And speed good Right Because you were figuring all this for speed What do you think your line s gonna look like Straight Straight Because it was the same every time Good 
 In the Lion King like I was thinking about it there s no democracy in any of the movie No there isn t Yeah and how the Lion King s like everything seems really British you know like very England monarchy type stuff But in the Lion King what bothered me is when it said like the two hyenas like Cheech from Cheech and Chong was one of them and then Whoopi Goldberg was the other one I was just like how could they do that and like not realize that they were feeding into this racial stereotype by being the voices of the hyenas Like don t they think about that stuff Yeah I was thinking the same thing Did you think about it before when you first read Cinderella I think when I watched the Lion King like I thought about it I mean even when I was little I think it registered in my mind like That s a black woman s voice Why would her voice be in this animal and not any of the other voices Right I don t know Disney intentionally did this They were building up into an already existing culture of racial stereotypes so I think the mentality of that was why fix what s not been broken and when they should have fixed it But at the same time Mufasa was that really what s his name James Earl Jones who s like Morgan Freeman Right Mufasa was an evil Like if I had to pick a God it would be James Earl Jones or Morgan Freeman Mufasa was the good Simba s father right Yeah With like the really deep voice You made a good point though about no democracy in Disney movies There isn t because there s no democracy in marketing There s no democracy in the media What are the six big media conglomerates Disney Disney GE What else GE GE Newscorp Yeah Newscorp Then Viacom Viacom Time Warner And Time Warner But why can t Cinderella be a first lady Why does she have to be a queen Like why can t she have some other magical power Why can t we instill some like actual life in there But that s still not this is still not the classic but then I wouldn t be surprised if Disney will come up with another story I hope they do Well they came up with Tiana right Which added the gender stereo the roles the racial roles or the racial stereotypes Tiana is absolutely beautiful The image However there are again the pre existing culture and norms that Disney is too scared to move away from because that has provided them or given them this 80 billion dollar industry I did promise you a reading on we do have time I promised you a reading on China as to what happens in China Before I do that I just want your input on the Disneyfication of children s culture with the article that you read I know you wanted to talk about it you were really excited If you have your article in front of you you can use that You can look at it I also jotted down plenty of notes but when you reflect on what we did today I want you to think these books these books are books are media music is media videos are media okay Food for thought for next time when we have our discussion Does media construct an image or a message There s no right or wrong answer but think about it Does the media construct an image or a message Okay As you read your read articles So Hannah to you go ahead The whole like Aladdin where how they changed the verse the lyrics that was like awful That was crazy Like I think I have a different opinion from everybody like truth hurts to me I think it s just like I don t care that it says that Like I didn t notice that no one notices that while they re singing Like while they re singing that no one like realizes oh Cut off your ear Kids don t Like if your was in And that actually happened back then that actually happened The ear one didn t bother me as much because that s kind of true But the whole it s barbaric the like that was awful It shouldn t be Because if you think about where it is if you look into the history it is barbaric and they used to do it And in some places they still do it It s the whole Hammurabi An eye for an eye You know it s that culture Yeah it s true it s true so why not teach what actually happened But I don t really have a problem with it I mean like But if that s the only way that you re looking at the Middle East then that s wrong Because they have a history with beautiful art they invented math and like they gave us all this wonderful stuff that you can t just look at the problems that they have now or the violence that was in their culture because there s violence everywhere I mean that s just stereotyping They cut people s ears off in the Middle Ages in England just as much as they did or at least as the same They did worse things probably in the Middle Ages than they did in cutting off people s ears It s just unfair that they portayed the Middle East like strictly as a barbaric violent place in that song It just makes it wrong I think it was like in general and it was because Arabia was so bad in an oasis like that Yeah they weren t specific it was just Arabia but like it took there was like Indian things about Aladdin that it wasn t supposed to be India it was supposed to be like Israel or totally different There were a lot of like Middle Eastern elements rolled into one so it would make one thing like if you went to the Middle East if you went to like Pakistan it wouldn t be what they say it is or if you went to India or you went to Israel like they just took bits and pieces and combined it into one Which looks like a different Why did they do that What would you think They didn t look into it they didn t bother to do the research Yeah they probably didn t Because their culture is so different than American culture that they just thought that they could just skip over it Like I thought it was gross that they didn t even bother to translate what they wanted to say on a manuscript Like if it was in English they would have had the actual letters on the piece of paper but they just you think that you can just go like this on the board and that looks like Arabic writing That s not Arabic writing is really complicated And the whole thing with all the accents how all the bad guys had accents and the good guys didn t The bad guys had like Oh the beards and noses Bigger beards and then the good guys they looked American I think it made you assume the worst like reading that just made me like Wow like Oh my gosh it s not really giving you the information But yet you didn t notice it when you watched it though right Yeah I mean you didn t at all I did though But then when we re older we go back in history Maybe that s because I have that class and we realized that it s all war with religion and like I know those times Go ahead Religion what about it She noticed that I did notice those things like you can kind of tell like different culturally wise like the different Indian elements in Israel or the different like Pakistani influences but and they had like Hindu going on It s just really really weird But I did notice that but like I don t know maybe like Hannah said she didn t notice that but because she didn t grow up like learning to write Arabic No And like reading about all that stuff I guess it s also like how you grew up Right Someone who showed America like without photos I have a question When you think about it when we talk about American culture we view it as pretty homogeneous of the American values Okay there are these values and that s all there is But we know that that s not true Do you find that to be with these movies by blending all of those different spaces and all those different cultures do you find that to be the message is not carried out the right way to children that the Middle East is highly diverse okay And not everybody looks the same or writes the same or behaves the same but Disney has done something that the media does What does the media assume That everybody who watches a movie Is going to react the same way It s going to react the same way right So the media assumes that homogeneity attitude Yes The problems in the past 20 years in the Middle East like when little kids grow up and it s like if I look at a picture of Osama bin Laden I think Jafar because he has a beard and he looks like that Like we re taught that that is evil Do you really I don t That the person with the turban and beard is evil because the terrorists that are doing these awful things to people all over the world just happen to be Muslim totally extremist Muslims that most of the people that carry out their religion don t practice Kind of like most Christians during the Middle Ages didn t go out and chop people s heads off in the name of Jesus It s the same thing Right You know But we look at those pictures of those Middle Eastern men and we think bad because of it which is like Jafar and Aladdin That s when acceptance comes in like You have to accept what s true and what s not Exactly Talk about ignorance I mean why do we have to accept that Because it s not true Because it s not true there are thousand and thousands You don t see me going like Oh I m making bombs I m not like saying acceptance like it s not true I m not like saying acceptance like Osama bin Laden like accepting that s what he looks like to like Jafar Like that s who he was so that s what he looks like You know what I m saying Yeah but I don t see that If I see if I look at Osama bin Laden I don t see Jafar No I don t either I don t identify it at all I don t either but you know what I m saying Yeah like little kids like 10 years from now if they watch Aladdin and they re going to grow up and what s going to be in the news is September 11th and Osama bin Laden But what the point is is that evil people look like everybody else Like Ursula could have just been a really pretty mermaid and still done all the horrible things that she did to Ariel Right Like it doesn t matter what you look like they create these evil images of people like all old ladies are either really smart or they re evil They either have wisdom or they re out to get you There s no in between Or the zoo keeper in he had a German accent he was evil and that was during a war the movie Or like the three crows right That were talking in like the very like I don t know African American inner city slang and they were just all that stuff that was just really It kinds of makes it like just like the story was describing what a bad person must look like we have that image like up here like tell them it looks like this so when we see them we automatically assume like Oh man it could be a terrorist just like when we watch a movie like Oh that s the bad guy So like it s the same as if they re doing a cartoon and if we re in real life Right so that leads to problems that we have with profiling for example Putting people on one side or yes It doesn t really relate to the article but I was watching a movie with my mom and I don t know what it was called but there s this like I guess class project or oral presentation that someone had to do and this girl chose to write about her religion which she was Muslim and she wrote about like 9 11 and she was like Just because they did that doesn t mean we re all evil And like I don t know she had all this stuff and then the principal like told the FBI or something and they came to her house and deported her family back to where she came from Just because of that That s it That s when like a school needs to teach acceptance That s not the end Or like families and the school needs to teach acceptance Everyone was calling her like a suicide bomber and like Go kill yourself or Are you gonna bomb all of us And we call ourselves a country of freedom of religion I remember when I was in sixth grade there was a girl she was Muslim and people used to throw markers at her and stuff and call her a terrorist It was around 9 11 and stuff like that and it used to like upset me because I used to feel really bad Because she like didn t do anything she barely even knew how to talk They d like throw markers at her and stuff just because she was Muslim Like because like no one has acceptance like no one learns that it s just like people make inferences like Oh man it s a bad person so let s stay away let s shy away let s make fun of them instead of like when you re going down the street and just like we were talking about earlier how there s like if you see a big black man you re gonna put your phone away you re going to take your phone out and try to call your mom put her on speed dial You don t have acceptance either Like you may say we should get it but you don t have it It s just the way we grow up We don t suspend judgment You don t suspend judgment It s difficult to do so There is this conflict between acceptance and our values Because the values that we have that think by this individualistic view of what it is and in doing so you divide people into groups and construct images about those people and it s as simple as reading a children s story okay or as watching or turning the TV on in the morning and just watching the Disney Channel or Noggin or Nick Jr or whatever There s messages that we impart on our children there s messages that we impart on ourselves Or picking up the newspaper I don t know if you guys have noticed in the newspaper but there is a big there s a dichotomy between how different areas are described Immediate areas our city compared to our surrounding areas Right so media is biased They re systemically biased okay There is no democracy but here is the fundamental thing as an American we pride ourselves in democracy we pride ourselves in leadership so what do you do What path do you follow How do you 
 So does percent always have to be 100 No Because I see none of the percents up here are 100 They re all lower than 100 So you think a percent can either be 100 or less Yes Okay okay So that means you think this can be called an improper Okay Ian Three fourths and the decimal 0 75 are the same What do you mean by the same One s a decimal one s a fraction Well I mean like they re equivalent Ah Equivalent So does that go back to what Alana said Alana which ones did you have there One half and 5 So you re saying the same kind of relationship is one and the same with one half and 5 10 Yeah Okay Alana no Well I did one fourth three fourths 0 75 and 0 25 because they re all part of quarters Ah you did one fourth what was the other one One Wait one fourth three fourths All right 0 75 and 0 25 because they re all part of quarters Ah Okay quarters I can think of money Quarters Or Yeah 25 cents 75 cents Yeah 25 cents is one quarter 75 cents is three quarters Three quarters one quarter Excellent Good good Ian Everything can be made a percent or a fraction or a decimal Oooh So you found a way to connect every single one of them So everything can be made into Say it again A percent fraction or decimal Interesting So you re saying that I can take this percent and write it as a just a percent Or as a What else Fraction and decimal So okay he s connecting all He thinks all three of them can become equivalent From the views before Excellent Ian Six fourth one fourth and three fourth they all have a denominator of four Ah yeah What does that mean that they all have a denominator of four Well they re all like sets of fourths What does a denominator represent in a fraction The um bottom number When we write it as the bottom number when we re literally writing it what does it actually represent What s that for How many equal parts it s split into Ah the number of equal parts it s split into So let me go back to Ian Ian is saying that everything can be written as also as a fraction a decimal and a percent So can everything be in four parts What if it s in five parts Does that matter I can do the five parts as a percent or I can do four parts as a percent Yeah What about what Alan said Percent is it up to a hundred and that s it No depends on the range that you set it So can you give me an example of when something would be more than 100 Well like when something you did in Earth Science we did to see if our grow dino grew over 600 Good connection Okay So what did that mean if it grew over 600 It like grew bigger than times Over six hundred times its size Yeah 600 times its size Okay So is it possible so is that an improper percent No but we sort of get stuck into thinking that percent is 100 meybe we can t go over 100 What happened here You tell me about that percent It s less than one percent Is that possible Can you think of a real life example when you d have less than one percent about growing something expanding over and over to 600 times its size Can you give a real life example of when I would have 0 When you fail a test Oh Well I could fail a test with 64 What does it mean if I fail a test with 0 Other than I m in big trouble at home What does it mean What would that mean if you failed it with 0 What would that mean about what you did on the test You didn t get anything right Yeah you got zero right nothing right Didn t get a single question right Can it be less than zero Is this less than zero Yeah No It s less than one So where is zero here Tenths is that zeros No Where s zeros Between Where would they go Would they go in the ones place tens place Ones In the ones place We have zero ones So is this less than zero Yes No No No because it s 0 1 Interesting okay So can I have less than zero percent No You can have a negative but If it s negative percent Can you have a negative percent What do you think Well I was going to say something could be like one point like point one percent less than something if you re comparing two things Okay your percent of increase or decrease have you looked at that in Earth Science yet Standard deviation Okay We ll talk about that somewhere else the percentage of increase decrease I m talking about a negative increase in or decrease in percent And whether that s below one or zero Okay so can you give an example of where this could occur Where I can have less than 1 It can occur I think with that fraction Okay but that s just a made up Can you give me something in real life that I could have less than 1 You can have an example of more than 100 So my question is does percent go from 100 to one or zero or is there anything less in between What do you think Like a gas tank in your backyard Okay Like when you call in to get it filled and it s really low The meter s low and under one Okay that s typically not going to be measured in percent it s going to be measured in how many gallons for your tank it s going to be a volume situation Oh Okay but we ll talk about that So let s keep that in mind We re still trying to find an example when we have less than 1 Think of one Alice Like on the labels and stuff on the vitamins less than 1 of your recommended day or something I just so happen to have here vitamins You re right And there are some examples when if I take this I m not going to get my daily 1 I m going to get less than that But there s some of these in here ooh like if I take one of these I get 100 of vitamin C Now I drank a glass of orange juice this morning when I took my vitamin What happened to the percent of vitamin C Where s it at It went over 100 Over 100 So there s a real life when I can get over 100 of something Anybody get over 100 on a quiz or test ever Over And how do you get that Bonus Ah bonus questions So we re good with coming up with more than 100 But we re still trying to figure out if we can think of an example where it s less than one percent So we ll go back to that Any other connections Let s see if we can connect the ones we haven t done yet Anything with the leftover ones One fifth and 20 are equal Okay Box right there They re equivalent to each other right How did you know they were equivalent Because one fifth of 100 is 20 Okay she did one fifth of 100 because we think of again we keep going back to a hundred for 100 is 20 out of 100 Excellent What else One tenth and 10 Ah what can you say about one tenth and 10 They re equivalent Again equivalent Going to go back to Ian Ian they re finding the percent and the decimal but there s no fraction there Fraction with a percent but there s no decimal Is there a third for all of them You said there s an equivalent fraction decimal percent for all of them No But there can be The decimal would be So what would you like to add here Ian Let s go to the which one You pick one Find the equivalent relationship and see if we can find that third piece we re missing Well 150 and six fourths is equal Okay Do we think they equal each other No Yeah Yeah Convincing but not yet you haven t convinced everybody Do you think that equals Okay four fourths would equal 100 And one fourth each fourth is 25 and if it s two over then I ve got two fourths left over And that d be 50 And they can also equal 0 5 So now we need the decimal piece 1 5 What did you say Alan Uh two fourths can equal 0 5 So what do you think six fourths give me the decimal that I ll put here We agree that these are equal 1 5 Oh so there is a decimal that goes there How d you get 1 5 Oh because one and a half Got it See where the half came from You said Ruby you had told us that one half and five tenths were equal So if we have that one half here we do the same thing we combine it here to get the 50 Okay So any others What s the missing piece Ian Uh you mean like another decimal to put in or do you mean like another Well pick two that are equivalent and give me the missing third piece One in one thousands One thousandths One thousandths and 0 1 Ah Are these equivalent No Yes No You re going to have to convince them Ian It s the day of Ian convincing I don t know They are Why do you say they are Because one percent over a hundred Well because that s tenth that s not thousandths It s not one tenth it s one tenth of a percent So here s another question then Are those equivalent No No So be careful That s not one tenth that s one tenth of a percent So could one tenth of a percent be the same as one one thousandths Yes Yeah but when you divide it by 100 Ah so we keep hearing divide and multiply by a hundred so when I convert from a percent to a decimal or percent to a fraction I m using powers of what Ten Ten So the question is Is that the equivalent to that Yeah How do you want to do it Ava Um Can you fill in the missing piece Can you give me the equivalent decimal to try to convince me to go from here to here with a missing decimal that I have I have the percent and I have the fraction but we think we re going to get all three of them Can you tell me what decimal that is Um zero and one thousandth How did you get that Um divide by 100 Ah Dividing by 100 What do you notice happens when we divide by 100 It goes back Okay when we divide it It moves two decimal places And the decimal place moves two places over So did that happen So are we convinced that these three are now equal Yes Can we see that now But you divide 0 1 you divide it by a hundred to get Oh yes you re changing it back because you multiply a decimal by 100 so you have that Okay Yeah Now that Ava gave us the decimal is it easier to convince ourselves that all three are equivalent to each other Yes Because now you when you read that you read it as what One and one one thousandths So are we convinced that we can find an equivalent fraction decimal percent for every fraction every decimal and every percent Yes So why do we have all three Why not do everything in fractions do everything in percents or do everything in decimals Why do we have in real life all three things going on Alice Because for some things it s easier to picture it in percent in decimal Okay so picturing a visual to go with it can you think of an example of one we use or in real life Well like with money It s like easier to think that it s going to be 25 cents or 0 25 than like 25 of a dollar Yeah wouldn t that be interesting if they said how much is that salad today Well it s something percent of a dollar Okay Ian Well with fractions one third is equal to 0 333 and keep going Ah so if we did with fractions or decimals we might have some repeating 
 Plug in two You got it We got it All right First question is Once energy is used up it s gone for good Talk to your partner no Let s try that one more time folks eyes up here What was the rule on the darts The rule is don t do anything until you say so Thank you Don t act until I say so Go Yeah There could be a little bit left of potential Is that what you mean Yeah Well All right On three I m going to need eyes up here please One two th Don t flip your card until I tell you to I shouldn t be able to tell what your card is It should be much more secret They re colored guys I can tell what they are Okay Here we go on three hold up your card please One two three Okay We ve got mostly disagrees And then we have very one confident Oh we disagree So here s what we re going to do Put your cards down I m calling on Mark first So where should we be looking Mark At Mark Okay Okay So I strongly disagree because say So you know you when you You know how you eat food you get fuel in your body and you have energy and you go out running And then you re out of energy you re tired you go to bed you wake up the next morning it comes back You eat more food and it comes back Okay So you re getting it from a different source Yeah Okay but that energy you have originally So that initial energy that you have and then you ran Does it go away Yeah you have plenty more but does that original energy go away No Where does it go Because you still don t have it right You have to eat more food This is supposed to be challenging Great job Who has another idea Or who can tell me where does it go It s awfully quiet Awfully quiet What do you got I don t think it literally Well I don t think it goes anywhere You just It just keeps making more It makes more So the energy I burnt right So I m running and I m running and I m running Where does it go Out Out where To the air To the air in what form Breath Now this is tricky This is where it gets tricky Breath is made of what Vapor Carbon dioxide Water and carbon dioxide And we call that matter We call that stuff Is stuff and energy the same thing No No and this is really a tricky idea in Science So we re going to keep working with you on that So where does the energy go Out into sweat Out into Now okay sweat is Stuff It s stuff right But where So where does the energy go Does anybody want to change their answer And say once it s used up it s used up for good Anybody Some people I think Now Tatum what do you think I think that when you run it s Some of the energy go into the ground How many people agree with Tatum That some of that energy is going to go to the ground Oh yeah Yeah Okay In what form does it go to the ground In static stuff What s that I think you said static stuff Is that what you say Yeah Okay so static stuff is Now this gets really tricky because now we re getting into electrons But you re thinking about the rubbing kind of thinking Is that what you re thinking How it rubs And then you shock people Okay So that can happen That s a little more complicated so I m going to put that on hold for now But what So if I m running and that energy s going into the ground somebody said that Who said that Tatum Tatum Okay So Tatum said the energy is going into the ground In what form is it going into the ground Yeah Energy transfer It is an energy transfer right This is going from my foot to the ground What form is it in Do you guys know what I mean when I say form Yeah Yeah We talked about kinetic and potential and heat and what else we talked about Elastic and Light Gravitational and light and chemical Sound Heat sound Ooh there s just hey is any of that sound energy No No Maybe it could be sound energy Yes Sound Because you re You re stepping hard You re Okay so if I m running I m probably going to produce some sound Anything else that could go in there Jason Huh Okay I think that as you step on You ll actually transform some potential energy to the ground because once you step on you all react to gravity to the ground So gravity s pushing down now remember what gravitational energy is is how far it is away from the ground right So how much room it has to fall basically So would there be If I go like this would there be any gravitational energy there Wouldn t there be if you raise your foot Now it s got gravitational Here s what we need I m really doing something to say But here s what I want you to think about this one Actually let s do this one more time I want you to re vote on this Once energy is used up it s gone for good Talk to each other for 10 seconds You re thinking it s going someplace else I don t know where but I don t think it just disappears for good I think it s going somewhere That it s somewhere but just not sure where Yeah All right folks we re going to re vote on three One two three All right put your cards down for just a second Here s what Henry just said and I want you to raise your hand if you agree with Henry And we re going to talk about again guys we re not getting answers to all these questions today we will at some point I promise We re going to do it in the formal labs but not before I m through telling you Henry tell me what you just said I think that it s not gone for good I m not sure where it goes but I think it doesn t just leave It s still somewhere but I don t know where How many of you agree with Henry That you think that it s somewhere but you re just not sure where I don t know where though All right Do you know what form No No Anybody else Know where But wait Doesn t it just transform It can transform into something else but then my question for you would be What What kind of energy is it All right but here s what we re going to do we re going to move on to the next one If a person is pushing a box the person has energy but the box does not otherwise it would help out Ready set go What s the evidence that the box has energy What form of energy is that that s moving I don t know Well it s kineck kineck One more try Kinetic Okay Because it s currently in motion Yeah Okay All right So now here s what I want We re going do a challenge question What about the person What kind of energy does the person have who s pushing it That I don t know You guys all have it Okay here we go Eyes over here please Are we a little bit on balancing in agreement All right here we go A person is pushing a box the person has energy but the box does not otherwise it would help out On three hold up your cards please One two three So what you re saying then is you all think the box does have energy am I correct Yeah Okay Chloe tell me why What is your evidence that the box has energy I think it has energy because when you re pushing it it has a friction with whatever you re pushing it How many of you agree that there s friction there Because it s rubbing against what The ground It s rubbing against the ground There could be some rubbing against you but most likely it s going to be rubbing against ground But here s my question what is your evidence that it has energy It does have friction and now it gives you some sort of indication that it s doing what Moving It s moving What do we call that something s moving What kind of energy does that Just shout it Kinetic Kinetic So it has kinetic energy So here s my next question so does anybody disagree The box does not have kinetic energy Tate I didn t believe it I thought it was transferred I thought that it was energy transfer Yeah Okay So you think energy s being transferred from the person to the box Yeah Okay but the question is still does the box have energy Even if I m transferring it there Does it have energy while it s moving Yeah Well do you mean before the person I mean while I m moving it I m in the process of pushing the box Does the box have energy Yeah but don t you think part of it would be from you and part of it I think all of it is from you Oh But does it still have energy Yeah Yeah it does So what s your proof Chloe just said it What s your proof that the box has energy Friction It s moving That it s moving Okay now the friction is proof that s it s moving perhaps But you also see it moving that would be the proof that it s moving Okay so here s my other question I m going to make this point this is too easy for you We re going to make this more challenging What about the person pushing the box So here is me this is how I push a box So if I m pushing the box what kind of energy do I have Think about it Jack what do you think Kinetic How many of you agree with Jack that I have kinetic energy How many of you think there s something else going on there as well No So I have I can only have kinetic energy right Because I am Moving Pushing Because I am moving and I m pushing Okay What other kind of energy must I have I have to say something else like it s kind of helping to and what disagrees Yesterday you told us the classic pool You re talking about energy transfer You guys know what she s talking about We re talking about the pool and handle Yeah I think of it kind of the same thing only the pool hall has some of the because you have the stick in your hand and you have the energy potential energy and then you start moving it and then it s kinetic and it goes through the stick and through the ball and it moves So you re saying that I have some form of potential energy as well Yeah before you start And then In what form is that potential energy Because I think Emily was about to say this too Think about this guys Where am I getting my energy from Is it gravitational No Muscles Okay so I ve got my muscles I ve got my body But where s that energy coming from Food Which is a form of what Marcus Fuel Which is a form of what Potential Time out We re asking Marcus Marcus what form of potential energy is fuel Um This is hard Did you want a lifeline Yeah Anika can you help him out Chemical Chemical right Make sense Yes Okay All right we re going on to the next slide Are you ready Yeah Woo hoo hoo Okay here we go Now goodness gracious Okay this is a hard one Cold moves faster than heat Ready set go And but also I remember my mom on hot days she s like Don t go upstairs because it s hotter Heat rises So is it is it move So your evidence that it s moving faster is that it goes up Yeah and also when you put it in hot hot water it s looser because Okay so you re saying if cold moved faster it would go up as well Yeah Faster than heat Okay How about moving in other directions other than up Is there Do you have any Wind Okay so that would So does one move faster than the other Tatum what do you think All right Think about it All right here we go Okay here we go So on three hold up your answers please One two three We ve got strongly agrees We ve got an in between We ve got an ooh we ve got a strongly agree And we ve got a couple in betweens All right We re mostly in orange land we ve got one green So here we go You ready Yeah And stand together you re going to back them up Yeah So okay so we agree that Are you sure No Just kidding Because I think the answer you just gave me was certain So you re a strongly disagree Okay Well I read it wrong I thought it said heat Yeah I thought it said heat moves faster than cold Okay so tell me why you strongly disagree then Tim Well because there s just as heat rises So it has to be lighter to move And so it must be moving faster Yeah How many of you agreed with this How many of you thought about this whole heat rising thing Interesting And how many of you Nope you guys it never crossed your mind Okay Let s hop to another Tatum do have anything else to add to that No What is your evidence that cold moves slower Because he was just saying heat was rising do you have any evidence that cold would move slower Let s see Alex what do you think Well because when we did that investigation and stuff on molecules they move faster when they re hot The coke can Yeah the coke can investigation Okay so I m going to ask them for specific evidence So what was your specific evidence in the coke can the hot molec that they were moving faster Well there was steam coming out of it and then in the solid everything s Molecules in solids are super slow And then as they move on to liquid then gas they move faster Okay And then you need heat to make liquid into gas How many of you think that this whole molecules moving faster in a gaseous state proves that heat moves faster than cold How many of you are kind of stuck on this idea of cold So let me ask you a question and I want you to think about it for 10 seconds then we might move on let s see What is cold Not looking for examples of things that are cold but what is cold What is the idea of cold or coldness Okay think about it for a second Ellie what is cold Well it s like It could be water that s frozen in I was thinking that heat moves faster than than cold because if something was frozen the molecules wouldn t be moving that fast because if they were they could try to push out on that Oh then it might be Okay so she gave me an example of what is cold But is coldness So what what does that even mean What does that even mean Anna Shivering What s that Shivering Okay shivering is because you are cold What is coldness Okay I think it s when the temperature is really low and everything s kind of darkness when you think of the sun warm it s really warm when you have the sun But it s when you think of something cold it s sometimes Okay I want You guys are giving me some really good examples of what cold is Here s what I want to think about Okay how to phrase this Is there a such thing as cold And if so how would you define it It s a hard question Oh You got to answer Get ready to answer Get ready and do one quick response and then we re going to put it aside for now and we re going to move on Come on Hunter No because it s just heat that s a That s just water that can be heated or Heat heat is cold Heat is that Yeah it s like Heat that s cold Yeah Oh So it s all just kind of a scale Like you got hot over here and cold over here and you re talking about there s less heat over here than there is here Heat has cold molecules Heat has colder All right So here s what we re going to do we re going to talk more about this later We re going to move on to the next question for now Here we go 
 Gina I wanted to test the amount of acid in different brands of antacids example Alka Seltzer Maalox and Tums can effectively neutralize Okay so far we ve been listening to this are we talking mostly the same equipment same supplies Yeah Right Maybe some beakers maybe some pipettes and some base Right Okay is this similar to Juan s This one is right So maybe we can start grouping these two together Christina The goal of my investigation is to determine which laundry detergent is most effective Tide Clorox or OxyClean by determining which is most basic Any concerns Yeah Adrian How do you know that the most effective detergents are gonna be the most basic Maybe there s some other factors that go into that and they re it s just basic ness Juan That some of them have really strong bases and maybe the vapors I mean Some of them have safety warnings that say like don t get too close to the vapors that come out Okay so there could be some toxic chemicals that are associated with these which is why we shouldn t use them Is that what you mean Yeah Okay okay we use them in our homes but don t bring them to school right Yeah I m a little concerned too about your idea that it s about which one is most basic Okay Cause the active ingredient in Clorox I think is bleach and bleach Sodium hypochlorite Is sodium hypochlorite Which has a pretty interesting smell I d stay away from that And then we have Tide right Tide is not bleach all right I m not sure what the actual detergent active ingredient is but I m pretty sure it s not bleach So this is probably going to require some cleaning up and making sure that we test something that we can test and that it makes sense why we re testing it Okay All right we ll come back to this And OxyClean is powered by Billy Mays so it doesn t matter it wins anyway I think he died didn t he Yeah he did it s too bad You know that guy must have made so much money I better not complain Adrian Go ahead I will find the molarity of one of the magnesium sulfate bottles in the lab inventory To do this I ll mix 50 milliliters of magnesium sulfate with 50 milliliters of one molar calcium chloride in a beaker I ll mix it to form a precipitate of calcium sulfate After as much precipitate as possible has formed I ll weigh the precipitate and calculate the molarity of the magnesium sulfate solution with the data collected Any ideas Jimmy I m kinda wondering why it s important to you like you said to make the lab meaningful Yeah it should be So Adrian do you have a response It s just cause bottles that don t have molarity kind of annoy me and I feel like I should there should be like a label that says the molarity I just kinda You know my room is open fifth period every day you can come on in and do these experiments and get them so that you know their concentrations I don t have a free fifth period After school s fine too That s cool that s cool What concerns me is I thought the theme was titration right Is the theme titration Okay where is the titration aspect to this Do you know what I m asking here Yeah I know I just didn t realize Because you re mixing you re doing a precipitate reaction everybody see it that way I think you re doing a precipitate reaction and so I just feel like you know this you had the wrong theme going on here Anyway we ll move on Nicholas Artel Artel Sirhan Sirhan although he was a bad man though I think right He was accused of being a bad man Go ahead The goal of my investigation is to see which of two pills have more Vitamin C per pills and weigh them to 100 milligrams and cut away mass as appropriate crush them dissolve in water and use a base to titrate it I would also use a pH sensor to see what the solution to see when the solution is at seven to see when it s neutralized Doing this will let me know which company I should buy from for my Vitamin C pills What do you guys think Vitamin C is ascorbic acid I don t know if you wrote that Did you No okay so if it s an acid you can titrate it right Is anybody concerned about like anything here Jimmy Don t the pills tell you how much Vitamin C is in them Like the bottle Wait let me make sure if you buy a Vitamin C that says 100 milligrams of Vitamin C my assumption is when you pull out one of them tablets and you crush it and you do this experiment it s gonna be close to that 100 milligrams So are you testing because you think they re not accurate Yeah Oh Okay so you re testing for accuracy on their part just to keep them honest Because I mean 100 milligrams it s kind of a non specific number All right Ian Actually another way you could look at it is that just because it says 100 milligrams that s how much of the Vitamin C is in it that s not how big the tablet is Being that sometime I mean you could have and say just arbitrary numbers you could have a 500 milligram tablet that has that 100 milligrams of vitamin C or you could have a 200 milligram tablet with that same 100 milligrams of vitamin C so you might wanna know which one actually had more stuff in it actually had more stuff in it per density Okay but is that what you want him to do I thought are you doing it because you wanna make sure that when they write 100 you don t care how big this tablet is unless unless what s the danger here Some of that other that tablet contains acids or bases in them then that would affect your results right One of them I have is pretty pure it s pretty much just ascorbic acid the other company I have does have some other stuff in it so I was wondering if anybody else had like one that was mostly Vitamin C Have you ever been to like the CVS and looked in the section I mean I could find one I just haven t There s a bunch you could even What d you guys figure out It s turning yellow Why do you think it s doing that Maybe the bicarbonate when it dissolves gets out some CO2 and turns it acidic I didn t think it would be that big of a deal because Wait Hang on so you mean so far what you ve done is you ve crushed these things you tried to dissolve them and you added some bromothymol blue Yeah And that bromothymol blue is not quite the color that you want That s right That s what you re saying Yeah What color should it be Blue I guess It s kind of green It just looks as if this coloring is just green dye Have you thought about using like phenolphthalein That has a distinctly pink color otherwise it s clear No we did not think of that You wanna try that Yeah Yeah that d be better So the phenolphthalein is gonna be it s probably going to be behind If it s pink it s acidic right No if it s basic Do the bubbles matter All right could I just stop and ask you guys did you guys get your color change you were looking for Yeah So the titration is working out Yep Very clean What So tell me what you got here This is a disinfecting Clorox we re just starting out we re just trying to measure out 10 milliliters That one we re done with we got it to the brown like it didn t stir anymore that was it That s as far as it went We put in 61 and that was it Now we re going to start this one And that worked with the one molar So is this oh so this is a different concentration Or how is this one different this is just a different This is a different type and it s a different percentage of the hypochlorate That s disinfecting spray and that s bleach With a different type of Clorox cleaning product All right Did you make sure that mixing some of these would not produce anything poisonous No we did not make sure But they re I just wanna you know we don t wanna create any of these strange gases coming out of here When we looked at the reaction this is the reaction that they showed on the thing And this was fine like it said it should be done in basic and everything Okay God bless you Excuse me How s everything going Not good with this one What s in there It s red wine vinegar But it hasn t changed color The treatment s too powerful Yeah we re thinking it s too So we re gonna do the white What s the solution to that then Why don t you just use less Less of the vinegar Right All right So we use five milliliters instead of Well I mean right If you use less then don t you think you ll be able to titrate it Easier Well you d need less base to get there Right Okay Let s go over here see what happens over here So squeeze that out What are you guys so you ve got Vitamin C crushed in there you used is this bromothymol blue what did you use Yeah we used BTB and now we re gonna see how much base we used Just out of curiosity why did you use a graduat what is this about 50 You didn t want to use like Cause that is are you gonna All the other ones were like dirty Yeah they were kinda And I think this is accurate to two sig figs which is our experiment s limit All right coming along okay it looks like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Hi You re adding 20 drops of bromothymol blue Yeah Is that too much Well has it occurred to you and it probably hasn t it s okay bromothymol blue itself is either a weak my guess is it s a weak acid it could be a weak base but all indicators are going to be weak acids and bases So we always want to use a bare minimum amount Therefore how about if you use something that has a distinct color change roughly at the neutral point like phenolphthalein Cause then it ll go from pink your This is acid These are acids so they ll go from clear to a pinkish color Okay okay but do you think the pink will be able to be seen Well Like the blue one You know the blue you need to use a lot more to get there although I don t know I suppose since you already did this one I mean we could remeasure out You may wanna well we don t want to run out of time here so right Stay consistent and then consider it how you can make improvements later Okay All right Now that s very nice You guys have questions What was your results in comparing what the company says and what you There was a little bit less since we used 500 milligrams and the company labeled it as pretty much pure pure ascorbic acid As in the first trials it was around 480 per kil to which is it s pretty close and the other one was around than what you re probably paying for But But that s then again it could ve been because Because not all the powder dissolved some of it was still settled on the bottom So they could be really accurate Yeah they could be you know dead on For the trials did you guys use different amounts of stuff for the two trials For the first two trials we used 500 milligrams of powder for each pill and then for the third trial we used 100 right A hundred And then for those trials like the third one you said you used a different concentration of NaOH Yeah Why did you use a different concentration First of all there wasn t much left of the 567 and also you know who s to you know maybe that could ve been contaminated it might not have been 567 so it s also good to use some different stuff sometimes Right You can t always base it you can t have it all on one thing Yeah that s smart How did yo actually figure out the amounts What was the math Oh We did the stoichiometry Yeah but we assumed that it was a one to one ratio one hydrogen ion dissolved from the ascorbic acid from one OH from the base And so we just calculated moles and changed moles to grams using the formula mass of Vitamin C Do you know with certainty that ascorbic acid is one H plus No we just assumed that for the experiment Maybe you should look that up Yeah Yeah The other thing anybody else So the other thing is and I just wanna make sure when you said 500 milligrams that s 5 grams right We did it accurate with Yeah cause that thing the scales here give you two sig figs right Okay I mean to the hundredths hundredths of a gram right So you crush this thing and you weighed out 50 Yeah That s what you did it How much was left in the I mean of one tablet when you you know what I mean When you crush it Yeah How much We had excess I mean one of the pills I had was 1000 milligrams so we you know we had about we had a like about It is my fault for Oh you were using 1000 milligram tablets And then my pill was 500 milligrams and then we weighed them and it was actually six five seven like milligrams That s how we removed So we had to we removed mass Oh well how bout this if it if they say 500 but the thing weighs six What d you say six or seven hundred Oh yeah Then aren t there other ingredients already in there Not that were listed like Yeah they weren t listed It just said it just said Vitamin C Because they might just list the active ingredient right Yeah In other words if the pill itself weighs more than the 500 that they claim my guess would be there s more of something else Okay Because here s another thing Don t you need possibly a binding agent to keep all the Vitamin C in a clump Do you see what I m saying Yeah yeah And they ll typically use some there s gonna be some certain chemicals they re gonna use that s in there So I have a feeling before you write the company be careful they re Yeah yeah They probably added other ingredients Yeah Because what I think might ve been even better is if they claim 500 then why don t you just crush the whole thing regardless of how much it weighs And then titrate that You see what I m saying Yes Cause then they re claiming there s the You see what I m saying So that would be taking further just simply Yeah that would be The experiment Wouldn t that be like the next Yeah Thing that you could try Same thing with 1000 right I mean if they claim 1000 Yeah Go crush the whole thing and see what 
 All right so we re going to need someone from all the groups to kind of summarize for us Grace Guys raise your hands So I figured okay you guys should All right I need everybody on the floor and you two groups sit right here okay Everybody s on the floor criss cross applesauce in five Five four three two and one Okay I need you to stay where you are and just turn around and I ll just have the people come talk to me and they ll talk to you all right We re going to start with let s see We re going to start with group one all right People from group one raise your hand Okay Will you girls come up and tell me what you guys talked about And I m going to listen Our question was select three characteristics that you think is most important for school and tell why So we had our score card and it said stuff So then the first one we did was my manners because if you re nice that means that you re polite and then you get more friends All right Next Following directions because you won t have good behavior and you won t do good on a test if you don t follow directions and you don t do like your study guide or study then you won t do good on a test And our last one is behavior in class is because behavior is sort of like not listening because then you probably won t listen if you re just doing like All right Thank you Now tell us everybody we re doing this and everybody can answer So how do you think that relates to a job Behavior Yes If you have good behavior then you ll get somebody to hire you because you can work good If you have good behavior most likely you ll get hired because you Anybody else Nobody else Yes ma am Um it s sort of like what they said but if you have good behavior when you re working your job you won t get fired Okay You won t get fired And you know good behavior is one of those things such as coming to work on time okay If there s nobody there to work your position then your teammates have to pick up the work or the work doesn t get done Okay group two let s see Lauren go ahead come up and read your question and answer please What is a non traditional career for a male and a female And um Go ahead We wrote for a male a fashion and a nail designer That s right And then for a female a pilot and a car designer Good good Can someone thank you Can someone give me some more ideas about some things let s see I m going to call I m looking at colors I m going to pick somebody with this color on And you can take your jacket off and I m still going to call your color if it s your color red Give me a job that you think might be a non traditional career One for a woman What did you I mean you can use the video as an example You want to think about it Construction worker A construction worker as a woman My color s red Yes sir For a woman or a male It could be for a male or female Or you can it doesn t even matter Skyler For a girl maybe a football coach For a female definitely a football coach If you guys watch Glee you see the football coach is a male a female And so yeah But now Sakwan we re going to go with you last and then I m going to go to group three Um for a male probably a teacher A male as a teacher Exactly So let s have Grace not Grace Alex Alex Mallory Mallory do you have a V under your name Yes You re from group three So let s let me read yours and you guys answer You can stay there Let me read it and you guys answer So group three was using what you have learned about non traditional careers what would you say to someone when they say that a boy can t do a job or a girl can t And I will just let you guys read I would say that it doesn t matter if you re a male or a female as long as you like your job and you can do your job well Nobody can tell you that you can t do something just because you re a boy or a girl Good Does anybody disagree with that one No Does anybody agree with that statement Okay All right Sakwan come up do you guys are going to do number four and we re going to move to the next activity Our question is what plans do we have for being successful in schoolwork We wrote do your homework follow directions paying attention being respectful good grades and not shouting loud And the oh yeah And don t have some like yelling or like stealing things like Report cards Yeah but no Yes Well we did a couple like Writing is a little challenging Reading easy some books Okay So they went with the idea of you know not too easy not too hard Good Thank you Now what we re going to do now is we re going to do some research on non traditional careers Now some of you will be where the purple papers are Some of you will be where the white ones are And it s just so that you guys will be able to talk about this later and say okay this is what I experienced on a policy job and this is what I experienced on the other one So everybody point your attention to the front and I m going to go through one of the worksheets with you I m going to go through the harder worksheet with you okay Just point your attention to the front And I m going to go through this one with you because this one is the hardest one and then all the other ones are the easier ones Okay the worksheet that we re going to do today is going to tie in what you guys talked about with careers subjects When do you all get report cards We got it yesterday You got them yesterday What I want you to do is I want you to think about your report card your favorite subject whether it be English math science social studies whether it be PE art whatever it is and I want you to pick from this site You see this site It says www bls gov k12 okay I want you to pick from that site your what subject you did the best in or what your best interest is There are some of you I know somebody here likes nature They will pick nature and in that job if it s a boy he s going to pick a job that he thinks mostly females have Who thinks they can give me an idea of what job mostly females have Molly Maybe a veterinarian A veterinarian Most veterinarians I ve seen have been female So I would go there And if I was a boy I would read through this sheet On this sheet it has some questions It says how to get ready You ll find that tab and you ll give me a summary of how they get ready for this job It says what is this job like You read that and you ll give me a one or two sentence summary of what the job is like And it says are there other jobs like this That s to the bottom And you can write those jobs down Another one says what about the future And you ll write a one or two minute summary of that section Also we have some reflection questions at the bottom of this worksheet and the reflection question is one is what did I learn about careers The other one is what s a non traditional career and the last one is what did I learn about myself So make sure you answer all those questions in the worksheet Now if I was a girl and I went to nature what job do you think I would pick Alea What job do you think most boys have that s over here for nature Zookeeper Maybe a zookeeper So the object of this is to do research in the area that you find most interesting Is this what I have to be when I grow up Mr Nealy No You just have to do research in that area So the big important part is to have research done in that area just so that you can explore different jobs And I think was it group three that had that question Yeah Group four that had the question about what would you tell somebody Who had that question Us Group three had that question and I think you guys gave a pretty convincing argument Okay I m going to tell you who s going to sit at the purple stations If you re sitting at a purple station you re going to click yes you want sound And your worksheet is already there And I want us to compare and contrast the different information you get from the two worksheets Okay purple station Skyler go to a purple station Mr Y 
 Clipart Okay You show me well if we wanted to insert a Clipart picture where do you think would be the best place to go Click on insert And then where is Clipart Here you go And I bet you we re going to find some really cool spider pictures Click on spi type in spiders and see what you come up with Hold on I ll be right over Yes Wow look at all those spiders You have tons Oh your project s gonna be neat cause you have all kinds of neat pictures Um I think something in our computer is off Okay Let s turn this off These computers sometimes get a little fussy and it s making bad choices When I get em I just keep pressing enter Well it s sort of like hitting an elevator button But you can t really make it go any faster but you feel a little better about click click click click click So go ahead and look over here Hopefully that will come up a little faster Sometimes it just is a little slow Start with there you go You know what to do Okay there s a big picture That s a huge picture That s a neat spider I think that ll be a neat one for your for your project Yeah Okay Um well when we when we clicked on the uh and it asked if we wanna include pictures from all the ones before Yeah We did want to do that We did And we clicked no Okay So that s probably why Okay So let s go onto Clipart office online and you re going to be able to find some really neat pictures here too This is the same thing Type in squirrel Let s see what we find Make sure you spell it correctly Q U I R R E It s a hard word I R R E And then the color Can I put S Doesn t matter Hit scroll or anything Okay And see what you can find Look at all those squirrels You should pick that one a moving one Yeah Okay So you copy it to your clipboard Now here s the problem You need to accept the service agreement and you ll have to do it again Yes Okay Now click on your scroll and add it to your clipboard Three times I I know Did you copy it to the clipboard Did you click on it Okay Then go back to PowerPoint Let s see if it works Uh You know how to copy and paste things so go ahead and paste it in there Yay He ll move but not right now When you go to make him a little bigger though I would say Make him fat Now you can check to see how he s doing If you wanna go to your slideshow and from the beginning and see if he ll move for you There he goes Yay See Now you know he worked Yay Good job We are entertaining using second person stories Last time we were together we started a story here today called Aliens in the Library You saw that I put my name up here on the line and it says Aliens in the Library The introduction page is the part where I underlined those you s Did you notice how these you s are underlined over and over again The reason is because we don t typically write like this This is kind of unfamiliar for us We had fun making the beginning of this story We only wrote half of the story using this graphic organizer Do we remember why we only wrote half of the story Why did we only write this side of the story Because that was like the one story Right There are two main things that you can choose from If you look up here at the board everybody should be looking up here you can see that there are two choices for each one You have your introduction and you have your two choices We only did this half of the story so right now we re going to hide the other half because we re not even thinking about it yet So the story was that you re in the library you hear a noise like what did we say rats in a blender And so you go out to investigate what the story was Now that s the coolest part about this project guys The reason we are making our own stories rather than me grabbing the book from a shelf and copying it on here is because we want to use information in our own way What s that called when you take someone else s information and put it on a piece of paper What s that called Who can remember what that s called What s that called Copyright infringement Copyright infringement or there s another big p word too that we talked about That s a tough one do you remember what that one is Plagiarism Plagiarism And if you take a story of someone else s and stick it on there it s a problem And so when you have a story in your mind you want to make sure that it is your story and your story alone The best way for me to describe this is right now for reading team we designed our own t shirts for a t shirt contest Maybe your t shirt isn t the winning entry and the team doesn t make your shirt on their shirt But you go to the competition and another team from another school district has your shirt design on the front of it How would you feel about that How would you feel if someone took your idea and walked around with your shirt on Your idea that you came up with your in your own brain How would that make you feel Kind of angry It would make me feel angry How about you Sad Sad is another really good word for it I would be furious if we used our exciting words for our writing But I would also be really disappointed Maybe kind of flattered that someone liked my idea so much they put it on their own shirt but it s the same thing Is it wrong to steal someone s bicycle Yes You think it s wrong Why is it wrong to steal someone s bicycle Because that was just like stealing You steal without even asking Right And that would hurt someone s feelings and it s illegal Is it wrong to steal someone s pencil Is it wrong to steal someone s pencil Is it wrong to steal someone s pencil Why is wrong to steal someone s pencil Because it s their property Because it s their property and it s not yours So stealing someone s ideas is the same idea So when you go to write your stories boys and girls and the reason we re writing our own stories is because we re making this our own We re making this our own design And I think that s really important for us to remember because the more that you use your own ideas the better it is for you You have all these ideas in your heads and I know you all have wonderful creativity so we re writing our own stories We re not taking the story of a TV show you saw last night like SpongeBob and you re not making a SpongeBob story I want this to be your own idea So we have Aliens in the Library and we have our half here You re a librarian you hear a strange noise it sounds like screeching rats in a blender what should you do We decided our two choices were open the door or hide under your desk If you open the door you see the cutest little alien standing in the doorway I think we had a majority of people here I don t know if everyone here likes the cutest little alien idea but this is our story and we re sticking with it It has a big pink bow in her hair antennae and a pink polka dot dress What do you do You could either invite her in or slam the door in fright You invite her in She surprisingly speaks your language She explains that her name is Lott and she became stranded when her spacecraft crashed She asks if she can come home with you What do you do You have two choices here You can either take her home or find another place for her to stay Lott is a great house guest she even helps with the dishes You re glad you decided to take a chance on making a new intergalactic friend You guys have seen this before We made this story and I m not going to go over this story again and again but I wanted to review with you what we talked about because over here I m going to show you what the final product is going to look like This is what the story is going to be made We did PowerPoint together You re familiar with PowerPoint We ve done dozens of PowerPoints by now at least And so on our screen here I m going to open up my document that I made while you were gone and it is what the PowerPoint is going to look like when you re finished It is a choose your own adventure PowerPoint And this is showing that you ve mastered the skill of being able to use PowerPoint You need to show me that you understand how to use this This is kind of like our I would say our final exam for PowerPoint so we know we can move onto the next thing or the next project the next exciting idea that we re going to do So while this is loading you re going to see that there are hyperlinks and we re going to work on those as well which will take you to different parts of your document So up here we have Aliens in the Library by Mrs Albright I chose pictures that are graphics from PowerPoint or from Clipart The reason I did that is because we own those I did not take them from the internet and drag them here What happens if you take them from the internet and drag them here They re someone else s ideas remember They re someone else s pictures Yes You have to put the date and you have the put the website We have to what do we call it Cite those But we re not even going to do the citation because this is more about the writing of the project So we re going to do that instead My Aliens in the Library I m going to show you the start of this and then you re going to go start writing your own story So here s my Aliens in the Library story Now the best one from this class the one that we find or two that we like the best we re going to put on my website so the younger students can access these from home which I think is a really great idea These are not going to be graphic or bloody You can have some things happen but you can t have guts falling out and eyeballs popping out of heads Okay Because this is for a young you have to remember your audience This is for first and second graders to use in the library when they come So we are not going to make a big bloody messy gory story Okay We re going to make cute little alien stories apparently This is what we made last time together All right You are a librarian You stay late one night working on your computer and you hear strange noises coming from the hallway It sounds like rats in a blender What should you do We chose to do open the door So when I click on the button that says open the door it should take me to that page Ta da You open a door and you see the cutest little alien standing in the doorway She has a big pink bow in her hair and antennae and a purple polka dot dress What do you do next We re going to invite her in If we invite her in she actually speaks your language She explains that her name is Lott and she became stranded on Earth when her spaceship crashed She asks if she can come home with you What do you do I want to see what you guys pick for this one Who wants to pick one Who wants to pick a direction What are we going to do take her home or find her another place to stay Find her another place Find her another place Let s see what we decided for that part of the story You hear her shuffle down the hallway You may have missed the chance of a lifetime to meet an alien but at least you are safe The end Now notice my ends always go back to the beginning So this is PowerPoint that you re familiar with used in a different way Are there any questions about what we did here Yes How do you get the green buttons That s what we re going to talk about and that s a new part of the skill that we re working on but right now we re going to just be making these I m handing out these You re going to be in your groups and we re going to start writing our stories After you re checked and over there you ll make your PowerPoints and I ll help you with your hyperlinks individually in your tables Does it I m sorry she s talking Does it have to be Aliens in the Library No no No no no That s a great question It can be anything you want Any kind of story that you re interested in As long as it is not Bloody or gory Bloody or gory or Violent Violent or what s the other thing that we just talked about Inappropriate Inappropriate or guts you guys are really stuck on the guts Copyright Copyrighted by somebody else I wanted to show you a couple other ones that you can choose when you come for book exchange One of them looks like this This is actually a non fiction choose your own adventure about George Washington crossing the Delaware and it s about you changing history which I think is a really neat idea If you re not much of a reader but you still wanted to read some books this one is very similar to actually what we re making here in PowerPoint It has graphics it s called a graphic novel and there are different pieces that look almost like comic books I have several of these also I have the newer versions of the old ones that I showed you and read out loud The ones from 1986 remember I told you how I liked them when I was a kid a few years ago This one just has new covers on it so if you re looking for those And then this last one this is a brand new series that I m hoping to get more on it s called The Golden Path and it s the same idea just different characters and a different set of authors that made those So if you re looking for a choose your own adventure story and you go to type it in the library catalog you can type in choose your own adventure The problem with that is you need to know how to spell adventure A D V E N T U R E That s exactly right Thanks I wasn t even expecting that The other thing to remember when we re keeping in mind I m going to be coming around to help you with your PowerPoints Remember we have to use that rubric that rubric Show me that you know what I m talking about Which rubric am I talking about Show me Show me your papers Yes This is the one that you need to do Also you can put that down This other one that I want you to remember the other thing to keep in mind is we color coded these and we numbered them The slides need to go in the order that you need it to be This is a review of PowerPoint so this shouldn t be anything new that you haven t seen before This is kind of our graduation project for PowerPoint so that we can move on to the next project next time So we re working with PowerPoint Who remembers how to insert a text box What were the directions We went over this before and we went over it a couple different times How do we insert a text box You go to insert you go over under the text box click on it and then you ll drag it and there it is There it is And how do you make it change color Does anyone remember how we make it change color How do we make it change color We re on insert and text box And make sure you make one down here Yep And then you can type in it and then you do what with it That s not wanting to cooperate is it That s okay Let s work on this one together If you click on text box you make the text box and you start typing in it Who remembers how we change the color of the text box That s what we re going to need to be able to do for our buttons and our hyperlinks that we talked about Who remembers You double click on the box and it will show up Right You double click on the box or sometimes even triple click until you get those three a s at the top then you can change your color I ll be around to help you Are there any questions about this right now Anyone have anything that they want to talk about before we get started Every slide has to have a picture What happens if you do not have a picture that you like from Clipart What do you do I want you I m encouraging you to use Clipart because it s something that s already there and we don t have to worry about where the source came from But what do we do if you want to find a different picture somewhere else What do we do Find your picture You can find your picture under Google images Then what do we do Then you copy it and then you put it back and then we copy the source You have to have the source Very good Very very good Okay If you would like to have a whole separate slide with sources you can do that And we ve done that before And the date And the date is very important I m glad that you remembered that Okay so I ll be around to help you go ahead and get started back again on your project Make sure the slides are in order Do you want to format your designs You go under design you two can agree on a color scheme Do you like that one That s good Let s look back at your thing Let me see which one was number two That was number three Click on number two And it should be exactly boys look at how you did that You put the words at the top now I did check the word vial on yours and it s spelled wrong V I A L Maybe my writing is hard to read And then you have the two text boxes here at the bottom If something gets stuck can I have you guys be the experts and go over and help them Sure Okay great Thanks Yes Can you help us Sure What s the problem We can get Well this one we want to get rid of Remember when you go to do the insert and you insert a new slide you want to make sure that the layout is the title only Remember how we talked about that one So you want to insert the text box You show me what do we do Right And then what do we do Okay so you drag it What are you typing in there Okay So you need how many text boxes then Exactly All right so you go ahead and type in there so you can show me you know what to do with that Can you click on it and then use typing Upstairs Okay now you want to how do we make sure you pull that up There you go Are you okay with all the pink I don t care Good Make sure everyone s input is added though Maybe he can help with the graphics Everyone needs to be able to do something We have to make sure this is fair for everybody You re working the mouse you re working the keyboard and he s holding the paper Let s maybe switch it up a little bit closer okay So everyone has a turn 
 Um that one substance there s no other types of substances laced into the main substance Okay And what is yours A substance that has nothing mixed into it or added to it Okay so I hear three different things here okay I hear pure means one substance not mixed with anything else I hear pure is something that s not altered or manipulated in any way And then I hear something s that natural I want to know what your thoughts are about those three definitions So do you agree with those three definitions or not And tell me why And tell them why Well I don t think it s natural because natural is stuff that can be mixtures Can you give me examples of natural things that you think are mixtures Um like trees So what And you re saying a tree is a mixture because why Because it like has different colors and different like feels to it Oh so different colors and different feels so like different textures Is that what you re saying And why does that mean that it s a mixture Cause it s not all the same How do you know I don t know I don t What do you guys think Do you agree with her that a tree is something that s natural but it s a mixture So and that was your definition that you got natural I would say it s natural Like some things are natural some things aren t natural I guess cause Think about like when a diamond forms It s a natural thing and it s only that substance Sure I agree with you with that example A diamond is a naturally occurring substance that is pure But for your definition what I want you guys to think about is a definition that s true all of the time So for a tree I want us to use that example about a tree really quick Cause you re saying it s a mixture right So you re saying it s a mixture cause you have different colors and different textures Why is that statement different colors an indication that it s a mixture Well it s like it Okay And a difference between substances What is color an example of Michelle Characteristic properties Characteristic property which we know what about characteristic properties It is characteristic to that one substance It s characteristic to that one substance Okay So would you change your definitions based on what we just talked about Yes Okay So what I want you to do is write down what you guys now agree is the definition of pure on this piece of paper Okay Hey you guys I know you re discussing it and I hope that you re kind of arguing against one another and defending your argument for your definitions Here s what I m going to have you do Based on your conversations it is now your job to write one definition for the word pure on this sheet of paper that your whole group agrees on I ll then share all those with the rest of the class to see if we re all on the same page or not Okay We already had one discussion where we had three different definitions My guess is when I read what they write down they re now going to have an agreement on what a definition is But I may be wrong so let s see Write your definition As soon as you have it done hold it up in the air Pure substance same thing Pure or pure substance Okay so what do you want to do What was your definition My definition well huh What did you write literally First time the first time Yeah the first time What did you write initially I wrote that a pure substance is a substance that is like clean It s not dirty or anything Good and then what did you change it to A pure substance is a substance that has not been touched Okay and why did you change your definition to that Like what made you Did it happen because you guys talked about it Yeah Okay so what did he say that made you think that you should change it to something that hasn t been touched He said like a pure substance is something that naturally comes from the Earth Okay So you said it s something that naturally comes from the Earth So is that what you mean by not been touched Yeah So it s just natural and not manipulated by people Yeah So it could have been literally touched but Unprocessed Unprocessed okay So give me an example of a pure substance that naturally exists Um Tree Okay so tell my why you think a tree is pure It hasn t been really been really processed or anything it s in the forest Okay so then what do you know about color of substances Um Sometimes it s a characteristic property It is a characteristic property right Which means each substance has it s a certain color And for that substance it will always be that color When you think of a tree do you see one color or do you see multiple colors Sometimes multiple Multiple colors so what is that evidence of Multiple colors Characteristic property It is a characteristic property but I mean how is having Hey Brett Can you please focus on what you need to be doing Do you have your definition done Yes Okay here s what I would like the rest of you guys to do including Brett s group You now if you have your definition written down I want you to go ahead and start doing number two Give me your examples of pure substances And give me your explanations I m going to give five minutes for that That means 10 38 So A tree has multiple colors Green is going to be an indication of of what Would you be able to say that green would be an indication of one substance Not really No okay why not Because leaves or grass Bark is a tree Okay so you re saying that more than there s more than one substance maybe that can be green Okay But okay so that s fine If there are different colors of green do you think that means different substances No What about characteristic properties though What do you know about a characteristic property It never changes for a substance It never changes for a substance So if I have two different greens do you think I have two different substances No I would Cause that s the definition of a characteristic property Right one green would be characteristic for that one substance always Never ever something different If I see a different color that must mean I have a different substance Okay If I have two substances together do you think that s a mixture or pure Mixture Mixture So a tree Do you see multiple colors on a tree Yeah What does that indicate A mixture A mixture of multiple substances Is a tree natural Yeah Yeah so does that affect your definition for pure If you re saying it s a mixture it can t be pure but it s natural so maybe our definition needs adjustment So think about what you might change your definition to be now okay Okay and write one down Are you done with this problem It s anonymous Okay well then Water isn t is it Oh interesting so you guys you don t know if water is or isn t You explained on the board that one time that it was a mixture of oxygen and Something else Okay so let s Okay well what s the chemical formula for water H two O H two O so what elements are combined to make water Hydrogen and oxygen okay So I agree with you there hydrogen and oxygen are bonded together which makes water okay So do you think water is pure or a mixture Well when they do the water definition we were trying to decide like if something s straight like we could some not a mixture Okay Then is it pure Okay I m going to read your definition really quick okay So a pure substance is a raw substance Nothing inside of a pure substance has been changed or added it came straight from nature There is no trace of any other substance It is not a mixture Okay I see two definitions in there Here s what I see I see a definition that talks about it being I see three One your definition is something that comes from nature Another one I see is Something that has not been changed Another one I see is no trace of another substance So that sounds like one substance Okay those are the three definitions I see But is there a substance from nature that hasn t been changed No Water is a substance from nature that hasn t been changed I mean yeah we add things to it It hasn t been changed but it is a mixture Is it a mixture though Yeah But what about when like animal live in it and stuff does it change So you re kind of thinking maybe it gets contaminated that way If it gets in contact with something else Yeah if they re even from nature So here s what today we should be able to figure out by the end of the period And you guys pretty confidently should be able to tell me if water is or is not pure Here is my hint My hint to you is the way we can tell by looking at something if it s pure or a mixture cause you can or maybe not just by looking but experimenting with it It s based on characteristic properties of matter That s what I want you to think about So it s just the primary colors then What do you mean Primary colors Well the primary colors I don t know It s just that color So is color a characteristic property of matter Yes What does that mean then Wait but can t you change it When something s a color But when you add one color to Something Like if I add a color to the water doesn t it change the water When you add a color into water it mixes with the water So it s not still water It still tastes like water I didn t say that I just said it was mixed It s a mixture oh Okay I didn t say that either but If you put the food coloring in it So and why are you saying that s all of a sudden a mixture Because they re So different substances together okay So what then does pure mean Not mixed a substance by itself A substance by itself So you believe water is just a substance Okay Alright Alright you guys These crutches are going to kill me Are you okay Those hurt you re hurt Okay you re okay We re going to talk about it right now okay Do I have everybody s piece of paper Are you done Okay This is not true Really Yes Alright turn here and stop what you re doing Listen to what What I want I know that you may not be done with your examples yet Because you re still struggling with your definition of pure I want to show you what other groups are thinking So I m going to show you all these I ll ready them for you too so that you re going to see that we have differences And the idea is by the end of today based on what we do you should be able to change and finalize your definition Okay And competently be able to give me examples Alright So the first one and I ll try to move this Let s make sure you can see this If it s hard to see Tim will you turn off actually why don t you go ahead and do that now Tim I think it will be better I don t know But just the front set of lights Thank you We ll come down Okay The first definition An unprocessed material which is one substance by itself instead of combining multiple substances to get the material I see two different definitions I see one pure means to be unprocessed and then I see another one substance by itself Okay Here s another one A pure substance is only one substance that is not a mixture So you re starting to see that pure and mixture which I will agree with are basically opposites of one another So you ve got to explain the difference between them So a pure substance is one substance that is not a mixture So I m wondering what your definition of mixture is Who wrote does anyone Who wrote this one are you willing to share Do you have a definition for mixture then Um well multiple substances that are mixed together Good so you re saying so great your definition for pure is one substance while mixture would be more than one substance Okay This one says a substance that has no mixture involved So you re saying that there s a clear difference between the two I still don t quite see a definition for the word pure yet in this definition A pure substance is a substance with no other substances mixed in It is one single substance So I m starting to see a little bit of a trend A pure substance is a raw substance Nothing inside of a pure substance has been changed or added It came straight from nature There s no trace of any other substance It is not a mixture So we definitely have agreement that mixture and pure are something different but I see three definitions One it s something that is raw or something that and I think this is what this is saying Correct me if I m wrong but you mean by raw kind of in some way connected to natural Okay so something that is natural versus something that has no trace of any other So I kind of see the idea of one substance versus multiple Okay as a definition Okay maybe I only saw two Okay Oh I thought this one was typed I was like How did that happen How did Was that you is that your handwriting That s insane Okay I like it It s like prefect Woah Okay There you go Alright A pure substance is a substance or material that hasn t been mixed with any other substance It is only one substance Okay um Two Two more A substance is only one substance and it is not mixed with any other substance right And our last one Oh this one s actually different A pure substance is an element Okay that s a different definition than the other things I ve heard They are made up of one atom They are not mixed with other substances nor do they contain other substances within them So I hear two definitions in here One being pure means that it s just an element And then I see another one that it s a single substance Okay So I want to hear some of the examples you re coming up with right now And I m not going to say if they re right or wrong I m just going to try to probe you with some questions Okay Naud What is one of your examples Salt Okay so you say salt is pure Why do you say salt is pure Because we don t think any other substance is combined with salt to make salt So you re saying that to be pure means one thing one thing in that container and you re saying if it s just salt that must be pure Mm hmm Okay Miriam It has to be raw and like like plain like raw salt Like not like mixed with preservatives or Okay so literally just salt that s it Yea Okay Alright so let s take another example Or if you disagree with them you can also offer up your argument for that Shaina what do you think Well we all thought that a diamond might be a pure substance Why Well I think a diamond can only be cut by itself and can only be cut with a different diamond OK So that s really dense so we thought that if anything was added to it something else would be able to cut it And that would be something else that was less dense So interesting What is um You re talking about density What is density It s a characteristic property A characteristic property So this is good You definitely should be starting to lean towards what you know about characteristic properties of matter Okay That is key to helping you understand the difference between pure and mixture Who can tell me what a characteristic property of matter is Hannah A property that stays the same regardless of the amount of the substance Yeah a property that stays the same for a substance regardless of the amount So what I m hearing you say is that you think the ability to cut into a diamond has to do with its density And you re saying that because you can only cut a diamond with a diamond it must mean that the densities are the same And so since the density is the same for the whole diamond that means it s one substance 
 She saw sparks in the sky and a beautiful panda bear appeared in front of her Don t be scared I m your Fairy Panda Bear I will turn you into a beautiful princess so you can go to the parade But I don t have anything to wear I will wave my bamboo wand and I will take care of it The Fairy Panda Bear waved her wand and suddenly Daisy was dressed in a lovely gown On her neck was a dragon necklace that glowed Don t forget when the fireworks are over the magic is done Daisy walked up to the celebration and everyone looked at her No one knew who this beautiful princess was The Prince of China saw her from across the parade He went right to her and said Hello beautiful princess I like your outfit Do you want to hold my dragon puppet with me Sure Daisy was having the best time of her life at the parade Suddenly she saw the fireworks show in the night sky and she knew she must leave before the magic wore off Sorry I had a wonderful time but I have to go Daisy turned and ran but she caught her dragon necklace on a stair post and it fell off It stopped glowing as it hit the ground and the prince picked it up But I don t even know your name I feel nervous because something bad might happen The Prince looked all over town for the girl who would make the dragon necklace glow He went to Daisy s animal farm Out in the distance the Prince saw a little shadow by the animal pen Could that be the girl from the parade Can I try the necklace on Daisy tried the necklace on and the prince smiled when the dragon lit up like the sun Tomorrow we should be married right in the morning Alright then we shall And they lived happily ever after Let s give our puppeteers a round of applause Bravo Bravo That was awesome you guys Class Yes You re going to earn yourself another smiley Class class class Yes yes yes Boys and girls if you are on the list of children that are going to go out to work on an art project could you quietly stand up and walk to the door If you are staying in with me for our work will you sit hip to hip with the person that I ll get it No Ms Turner wants to do it Please sit hip to hip with your partner Good job Zoe that was awesome That was so cool Okay just a second then Alright turn your bodies this way Okay Criss cross applesauce Okay Who s your partner Zoe Can you sit hip to hip with her DeShaun face this way Alright if your legs are criss crossed then look up here Wow Theodore why don t you pop up and go close the door for me Alright this morning when we were talking about the books about China Xander wrote down a lot of the things we were talking about that were different between us and the people that live in China So as a class we figured out that they have a different flag they eat with chopsticks which is really neat We do too Sometimes we do right They have a different alphabet they have water buffalos there they have the Great Wall of China and they speak a different language And they also have dragon puppets which you just saw on the Puppet show What we re gonna to do now is we re gonna talk about things that are the same between our culture and the Chinese culture and we re gonna use our listening stones So Toban I m gonna be coming around and I m gonna give a listening stone to one of the people in the group and if you re holding the listening stone you re gonna say one thing that s the same and then you re gonna pass it to your partner and they re going to say one thing that s the same And then they re gonna pass it back and we re gonna go back and forth and see if we can start to talk about what s the same We know a lot of things that are different I m curious of what s the same Could you please sit knee to knee with your partner Can we show them knee to knee Zoe Like this Facing your partner like we do There you go I ll give you a Band Aid in a minute Finn okay Can you sit knee to knee with Graham Like this I have another thing that is dis Another thing that s different Uh huh What They have more dramatic designs on their clothes They have more dramatic designs on their clothes We saw that in our research material As soon as you get the listening stone I want you to say something that s the same and RJ you might want to start saying like we both might be a way to help okay RJ you have the listening stone Okay So look at Zoe listen with your eyes and your body and say we both and see how many things you can think of Can I be the stone keeper You may yes We are the same as them because we all We all have eyes We all have eyes yep We all have clothing We all have hands We both can see We are the same as them How are we the same as them We wear clothes We all have to wear clothes right We all have beds We all have beds Can we do something different You may say something different yeah We both have

all walk and we can all do things We all have bodies Did you guys see anything from the puppet show that made you think of something that s the same between us What We all can make things We can all create things and be really creative Did you see something from the puppet show that made you think we were the same We all have clothes Did you see the clothes on the puppet show We all have dragon puppets There are a lot of dragon puppets at Chinese New Year Oh we all have puppets We all use puppets That s what I was just going to say Okay we all use puppets We all have an alphabet We all have an alphabet even though it looks different Alright I m going to see if we can earn another point Class Yes That was so good Boys and girls hey can everyone turn their bodies this way Alright let s share out now we had the chance to pass the stone back and forth I just wanted to quickly hear one thing per group of something that you thought of that was the same Zoe and RJ can you tell me one thing that you talked about in your group We both have imaginations We both have imaginations And RJ said we both have brains We re all pretty smart aren t we Finn and Graham can you tell me something that was the same We both see We both see We both have rotten teeth What do you mean by that We sometimes all have rotten teeth We have to go to the dentist sometimes Yeah okay Xander and Nazarette what did you guys find in your group What You tell me what s the same We both We both can make things like necklaces and fireworks and actually Chinese people were the first people to invent gunpowder and that s what makes fireworks Did you hear that boys and girls Finn did you hear what Xander said He said that the Chinese were the first to invent fireworks Because they were the first to invent gunpowder and gunpowder is what powers the fireworks a lot That s cool Wait wait wait it s Anna and Toban s turn Anna and Toban tell me something that s the same We both have families We both have families Did you think of one Toban We all have dragons We all have dragons What does that say I ll tell you in just a minute okay And DeShaun and Gabrielle you re the last ones What s something from your group We talked about We both We both What s something that s the same We all have rainbows We all have rainbows Yeah they see rainbows in China and we see rainbows here And DeShaun what about you What s something that s the same between us and the people in China We re gonna have the same melanin as somebody We have the same melanin Yeah What do you mean by we have the same melanin as somebody Here sit up so I can hear you I think he means we have the same melanin in our skin We have the same melanin in our skin Cuz we both have light skin Yeah but what if the people in Africa have I m not talking about them The people in Africa have dark skin they have more melanin Yeah but the people in Asheville Oh in Asheville In our city we have lots of different colors of skin and different kinds of melanin but in China did it look like their skin was pretty similar Yeah yeah Alright so this is what we re gonna do Does everyone see these circles over here Yeah You re gonna come up and you re gonna pick one off our chart and you re gonna go draw a picture of something that s the same between us and the people in China and then you re gonna come and you re gonna stick it back up And this is actually a word bubble chart Okay So when I see you re sitting nicely I m gonna call you up and you come pick your color and I have brand new markers at the table Alright Zoe and Finn come pick your color Xander and Nancy come pick your circle You re gonna draw a picture of something that s the same between us and the Chinese culture You can write words too Okay the rest of you It says We will go on hug patrol today We re gonna see if we can earn it You re gonna do orange I wanna do pink Can I do green You have to do orange or Alright So what s the same boys and girls Thank you I love brand new markers We have to do something on the same Something that s the same Anna what are you gonna do We all have families We all have families Can I sit by Anna I m doing green Can you sit by Anna yes Anna Toban s gonna sit next to you Sometimes you can say we both Or we all Xander that was cool How do you spell melanin You just sound it out We all have brains we re all pretty smart Can you write that in words on there You guys are such good writers RJ what are you writing what are you writing RJ Can you read it to me What do you mean by it we all have rooms We all have our rooms We all have art rooms Bedrooms Oh bedrooms we all have bedrooms We re gonna make a word bubble Can you read it to me We all We all have a heart We all have a heart 
 Just take it in but take your tube off first Before you pull it out before you pull the needle out take your vacutainer tube off and this is Pull it out again Yeah Use your two by two remember Oh yeah There you go Good job Faye And guys it just takes a while This is not something you re going to learn overnight This is a skill that it takes a little while to learn You ve got to get hand movements down you ve got to figure out what works best for you You know if you need things placed in a different position But after this you all can start sticking the arms when you re not doing your book work Then whenever you feel like you got all your hand movements down you feel like you re proficient then I ll watch you which I ll watch you doing then you all will stick me So what do you think Cassie Hmm What do you think Is it easier than you thought or harder than you thought Easier Yay Faye Those arms are a little harder to get Those veins are not as easy to feel as That s okay She s doing a fine job Two by two Sorry You to draw blood from them Pop your tourniquet Engage your safety Good job From down there Yeah They say not to use these and you can use hand veins but remember first choice second choice last choice and then hand veins If you re going to do hand veins you all have been through a lot of the book work already if you re going to use hand veins what kind of needle are you going to use Butterfly Butterfly Okay I know you all have seen them use butterfly in the clinic You guys will actually rotate through the clinic lab We ll do it at Dr Maderis clinic so that you all can get more sticks there Is there some people who draw only from around here Not usually Now there are some people they ll come in and they ll say You can t get blood from anywhere from me except here What that one lady told you is right here right I m better at popping it out Remember I couldn t get it in Good It will be something that after you get these hand movements down it ll just happen Because when I m not talking while I m doing it I mean it just flows Because I have done it for several years but for some reason after you get older it s hard to talk and do something at the same time That s what we re going to do today is you all are going to learn how to draw blood You re going to learn how to actually stick the fake arms that we have or the phlebotomy learning aids is actually what they re called And each one of you have gotten to a certain point in either phlebotomy or medical assisting where you re ready to start drawing blood And I know that Wanda has gotten a little further but it never hurts to refresh on the procedures because guys when you get out there in the clinical area a lot of people don t follow a lot of the steps that you need to do as far as blood draws Guys that are medical assisting you are not going to have to do as many venipunctures and the phlebotomy students but you may be responsible for drawing blood in a doctor s office When you re there in the doctor s office it s just you and the person So you quickly develop really good phlebotomy skills because if you don t get it then you have to send them to outpatient hospital to be able to get that blood drawn The first things I want to talk about is your vein choice And I printed off your veins And the median cubital is your vein of choice and the median cubital runs right here in the middle You can see this one better Yeah you see that one better Your median cubital runs right in the middle and then your basilic is the one you want to stay away from That s the one that runs little finger side And then your cephalic is on the thumb side So this little finger side toward the inside of the elbow is the one you really want to stay away from And the reason that this is your last choice vein is there s quite a few nerves that are right underneath it So if you go too deep or you move the needle around too much you can actually cause nerve damage And I will leave this on the table as y all are practicing with your phlebotomy arms so that you can look at your vein choice Nerve damage is a very real possibility and some nerve damage is permanent so be very careful when you re choosing your vein You can only advance or withdraw the needle only You cannot go sideways I know those of you who s already been in the clinical site you ve seen them go sideways you ve seen them come out and go back in And guys that could be a liability for you and you re the only one that can protect your patient and you I ve got the materials set up Whenever we repeat this you all will set your materials up so take notice of what we ve got here because you ll need this every time you practice on the phlebotomy arms When you go to clean your arm you re going to clean in a circular motion So I m going to go ahead and get started First thing you re going to do I don t need your gloves just the two hands First thing you re going to do is put on your gloves I just washed my hands but I m going to put on my gloves And why do I want to do that Jim So I don t get infected Yeah I don t want to come into contact with someone s blood Now who could protect me from coming into contact with someone s blood Yourself I m the only one that can do that And I can tell you from having my blood drawn people have drawn my blood without gloves on though they didn t know me from Adam And one person in particular got quite a bit of my blood on them So I am the only one that can protect me If I see you practicing without your gloves on it is an automatic grade ding for that practice day If I see you drawing in the clinical area without gloves on then we re going to have a big talk okay Because you ve got to protect you I have a question With some people that you draw blood on do you have to wear a mask Like an eyeshield type thing If they are on precautions then yes you would And you ve seen at the hospital on the doors where they have contact and respiratory isolation If you were to go into one of those rooms yes you would In the ER when you draw blood you usually have on that splash mask Now usually with a venipuncture you re not going to have that much pressure It s not going to shoot the blood back out at you like an arterial would but still it s better to err on the side of safety But also if there s nothing wrong with me except I need a CBC to have a surgery and you come at me with a mask and a shield I m going to think Oh my gosh Why is she doing that You know So make sure that it s appropriate If you re in a trauma area then yes definitely If you re in an outpatient clinic unless that patient tells you My veins squirt blood really bad A patient will tell you One time I was doing a finger stick and it squirted and I had on my glasses but I turned my head It hit me in the hair So sometimes the venous flow will do that Good question Cathy All right so got my gloves on first I m going to do is I m going to put the tourniquet on And guys the tourniquet can be kind of tricky the first time or two you do it And you re going to put it underneath the arm You need to make sure it s tight so your vein will pop up but not so tight you re going to cut off the blood flow and not so tight you re going to cause petechiae which is little red patches on the arm I m going to cross my hands over What I do is I put my left hand in position I take my right hand get ahold of the tail of this pull it and then I stick it underneath with my little finger You always want your tails up toward the top so they re not in your area where you re going to clean and draw When I m going to clean well let me show you how to feel first Well it s not going to cooperate today You can use my arm That way they can see better Can you move the Sharps container I m going to stick it underneath there And now it should stay on there Now to locate a vein I m going to take my index finger and I m going to feel back and forth And guys you all can do this on each other Jim s excellent to feel veins on and he s a real good volunteer Bounce back and forth It feels like a gummy worm or something soft underneath there If it feels really hard like I have one that I ll let you all feel that is very sclerotic or hard you re not going to get blood out of it It s got to be it s got to bounce So when you go across and you find it then you re going to find which way it travels So you re going to go up it and down it so you know which way to put your needle in Some veins will go off to the side and some remain very straight So I found my vein Now the tourniquet can only stay on for one minute Has my tourniquet been on about a minute Probably so so I need to take the tourniquet off give this patient s arm a rest and then I can talk to them about the weather I can go ahead and line up my tubes at that time and then I m ready to draw blood now So I come in here I put my tourniquet on and guys when you put this tourniquet on you got to be ready to go because you only have one minute And I m going to clean I m going to clean in a circular motion and then if you re having trouble with the alcohol you re not able to fan it you can t blow on it and you can take one very clean 2 by 2 go straight down dry it off and then many of you already did that This part of the needle this part with the rubber on it has the needle on it You screw that in take the end off this is a safety needle You anchor and then you stick in the bevel of the needle that is the pointy part the bevel goes up and then the pointy part goes into the skin I pull my thumb away as I m going in I take one of these Vacutainer tubes thank you Jim and I push it in And guys when I push in with my thumb I m pulling back with my fingers And you re not able to see but there is and I don t do this in the clinical side but there is blood coming in there You let it fill until it stops Now it s stopped flowing I m going to wrap my fingers around it and push because the more still you keep the needle the less it s going to hurt the patient Pop my tourniquet and I m going to take a different 2 by 2 than what I cleaned with Fold it lay it on the arm and guys I m just going to kind of hover there until I bring the needle out and push down If I push down while the needle is in the arm it hurts really bad And I m going to hold here and I m going to hold until it quits bleeding And you can peek Now if the blood oh sticky needle engaged It s hard to talk and do stuff at the same time isn t it Sharps And you toss that in the sharps Now if this patient is on blood thinners I ve got to hold longer A lot of clinics will just put a 2 by 2 or a cotton ball on there put a CoBand on them and send them on their way If they bleed out outside of the lab you re liable And again you re the only one that can protect you So I make sure that they ve stopped bleeding And now how hard is that going to be when there is a lobby full You guys have been observing Can we ask them to hold it Well you can But what if they don t hold it tight enough What if there s a whole lobby full Jim what have you seen them do in the past and check Yeah You need to check it If there s a whole lobby full sitting out there then you ll get to them when you get to them because you ve got to protect your phlebotomy certificate You re the only that can do that A lot of places they will put a 2 by 2 or a cotton ball on there tell the patient to hold their arm up That breaks platelets that s going to make a huge bruise and it doesn t really help with the clotting that much just kind of bruises So we re going to look here Okay this patient has quit bleeding so I am good to go here Now another lesson I will teach you about writing on the vials the blood draw vials and what information needs to be on there So before you all draw let me ask you a few questions What s your first choice vein Median Median Okay And why do we avoid the basilic Nicole Nerves and tendons Nerves Okay What can happen if I powder on the shirt What can happen if I dig around in there and I do injure somebody What can they do They can bleed or they can have their nerve damage Right And they can come and say This phlebotomist drew here And then guys if you re ever in a setting where you have to go to court they re going to call somebody that s a phlebotomist like you are and they re going to ask them What s your first choice vein And they re going to say The median and they re going to say What s your next choice What s your last choice So you re going to have somebody there that knows You really don t want to draw from that one unless it is your last choice Okay what can happen if the patient s on blood thinners Cassie what s the most important thing to remember about the patient that s on blood thinners To keep pressure To keep pressure Okay How do you clean your site Martika In a circular outward motion Circular you don t ever go back over And how long do you leave the tourniquet on Faye One minute One minute Good job Okay You all get your First thing you do is what Gloves Get your gloves on So you all are going to draw With drawing blood are you supposed to record where you drew at and everything just like a nurse is supposed to I would if I were you because that just protects you So you can write median You can write an MC median cubital and that way you may actually you could put it on where you put your initials where you draw And that way they know that you drew from the median That you didn t draw from basilic I need another needle Okay Anybody else need another needle Thank you You re welcome I m going to send tourniquets home with you all and you can practice on everybody Feel their veins feel all the different types of veins Some people have garden hoses is what I call them Some people have very large veins And feel for your vein The tourniquet pinched my thumb The gloves are hard to you trading them out It s this arm Jim I think because I had trouble getting it When I was doing it too Okay Just make it a little tighter with your Oh Did you stick yourself Mm mm Okay I screwed the wrong part I think she s bleeding and I haven t even done anything yet Oh yeah hand me another one There it goes again Okay Casey Let me see what I can do for you Good job Martika Want to just chill how s the weather blah blah blah blah Is it not come undone now You might want to pull your tail just pull it in there with one of the smaller tails It ll stay down Okay It s moving again You re kidding See Okay Just keep going Okay Just keep going It s easier on a person That s my stomach Jim It s hungry Sorry Yeah this one Jim knows which ones stay better Okay you got to anchor your vein with your non dominant with your non dominant hand you anchor your vein I have to stand I can t see you take your thumb and you pull down here Anchor your vein There you go Casey are you left handed too Mm mm I thought you said non dominant hand Non dominant hand to anchor Back it out Put it in this hand Are you right handed Mm hmm Put non dominant hand thumb there anchor Okay Now did you clean it Yep Okay Then go in Uh oh It s okay It s okay Well that s okay Put that on Start over A lot of this is hand movement A lot of this is prac 
 Okay so tell us a little background about Ed Alright well it showed that he had chest pains and also his vital signs showed that his heart was very weak so we thought he was having a heart attack and also he was unconscious Okay so because of his complaining of chest pains be subtle from conscious or no He called and he talked to the paramedics but it also said he was obese and so that could contribute to it as well How do you suppose that contributes to having a cardiac condition Generally it can clog your arteries What can clog your arteries The fat that builds up Okay from being obese Yeah Okay is that one of the I guess physical signs that someone may have a heart condition Yes Okay okay alright Go ahead It is also his blood pressure It said it s at variable levels so that means his heart isn t working properly or consistently So that means it could also contribute to a circulatory system it could damage it It s also another sign of a heart attack Okay so the variable heart or actually the variable blood pressure And some of you had questions about that when you were doing your research You were wondering what did this variable mean and I think what you said is exactly right it s not normal okay They state the variable meaning it wasn t working how it should Okay so sounds like this guy had some definite issues both with his vital signs and with his history So tell us a little bit why you ranked him number one compared to let s say you ranked who was your number hmm Who was your second who proceeded him Nelson Nelson so you got Ed ranked over Nelson where some other people had Nelson ranked number one so what do you think Well he s unconscious now so that means his heart attack started some time ago and once you have a heart attack you need treatment immediately and since his heart attacks aren t his title he needs it I think it s important to see to get treatment To get medical care Yeah Okay if he doesn t get treatment what do you think could happen Probably he ll die from the heart attack if he doesn t get treatment or paralyzed What do you mean by paralysis Why do you think he could become paralyzed I m not sure if it s a stroke or a heart attack if you go through it if you get paralyzed or not Okay you re not sure if it s a stroke or a heart attack that leads to possible paralysis Yeah Anybody like to comment on that Question go ahead Jordan It s a stroke It has a brain clot and then that will cause partial I can t say it Paralysis Yeah that word but heart attack You could have a heart attack after that using different parts not paralysis Good point So Jordan says having a stroke can cause paralysis What system is being affected when you have a stroke that could lead to paralysis What system in our body is that Nervous system Yeah nervous system Okay understand Doban Jake got that Alright so you guys have Ed you ranked him number one and then you ranked Nelson number two along with quite a few other people It looks like we have some consistencies there Let s look at group B You had Nelson ranked number one but then you did have Ed ranked number three So you didn t think Ed was as serious having this heart condition compared to Nelson and or Monique Well Nelson and Monique had the most critical vital signs They seemed the most the worst because their temperatures were in the critical zone and above where they started so they were overheated and they probably had heatstroke or hyperthermic So they were not and they were dehydrated too When your body starts to dehydrate that s not it really messes up all your systems So they were What systems Cardiovascular system the respiratory system the immune system everything s just being attacked here because with Eve let me see this his heart rate was way below normal and that s the cardiovascular system His temperature was completely 109 from all the heat from the canyon What s the normal body temperature for that of a human The normal temperature is 98 6 and he s at 109 He s at 109 folks Okay I think this was one of our hypers if you remember Nelson and Monique were our two hypers that were airlifted into the hospital okay So he s at 109 Isn t this like the immune system Mmhmm Yeah so that s the immune system and then his breathing rate is way down It s at 10 respirations per minute 10 respirations per minute And the normal s like 20 so he s down to half So I think that his vital signs were way more out of whack Did you count in on the blood pressure The blood pressure It s really low and that means his circulatory system s not working right which means blood s not getting everywhere it needs to be Which means he could end up having I don t actually know if it would lead to a stroke but like if everything s not getting blood everywhere his brain might not get enough blood He could have brain damage or something like that It s interesting she said stroke talking about Nelson Was Nelson having any type of nervous system symptoms Seizures It was seizures He was having seizures Is that is a seizure an event that occurs as a result of something going wrong with the nervous system Absolutely Think about all the systems you just named What s going on with Nelson Cardiac nervous circulatory immune Dehydration Entire bringing in dehydration Digestive not enough water This guy is having a rough time isn t he So if you re pretty confident in why you ranked him number one Yeah Okay comments Anybody Well the reason we ranked him three was because we thought that he was most likely going to die and so we thought that his daughter was a higher priority because Monique Yeah because she has a better chance of survival So you ranked him three and it s interesting you said We thought he was going to die He was maybe beyond that point of help Yeah Okay so why d you rank him three Why not rank him seven Well what if he has a shot He s got a chance Yeah Okay he has a chance over Mark That wound to the chest Yeah because Mark got shot in the chest didn t he You d save him though It s interesting you said if he has a shot Mark s the one that got shot He was more stable than Nelson was though Mark was Mark was more stable Yeah Interesting you re bringing in the whole fact of now you re triaging it You re saying okay Mark s a little bit more stable even though he s got this gun shot and they were kind of vague in what they said about the gun shot We don t know what kind of gun it was But I feel like if you rank him a three he s at such a critical position that it s either you rank him one because he needs treatment right away or he s going to die Okay so you re saying he s got to be one based upon all the symptoms based upon his vital signs the condition that he was brought in If you re not going to rank him one you might as well just let him die Is that what you re saying Or early on Like you can t wait too long I guess You ve got to rank him one to three otherwise So he s like what group were you We re F You re F so you had him okay you had him at a two Yeah Okay alright so you re saying he s a top three Yeah especially You had a hand up Oh I was just agreeing with him If we thought we had any chance we should be like let s not waste any time to finish this either that or just make him seven Okay good point Brian Well were were thinking Speak up a little bit please Well we were thinking that even though he s unconscious and having seizures he was a crooked patient but compared to like the other ones like Albert or Mark his symptoms weren t that of like great danger as the others and even though his body temperature was 109 that could have been because he was going through heat stroke but now that he s in Asprins they re a cool environment You bring up heatstroke Why do you think he s going through a heatstroke Well I don t know because he was unconscious and they said he was dehydrated and everything Well dehydration can be due to heatstroke and like I also figured it d be heatstroke because his daughter Monique Yeah I m sorry Monique it said that she was dizzy and nauseous and if she was in the same environment as Nelson was then it s more likely that their symptoms are close to each other because if she s going through like nauseous and like dizziness then it s most likely that he is too because they re both in the same environment Very interesting I want to come back to this point Ryan you ve got your hand up What were you going to say I was just going to say that Monique has the same symptoms for heatstroke You re exactly right Now my mind instantly goes somewhere here Jordan your hand was up first I was just going to say that since their temperature s so high they re probably in shock and always their temperature is almost basically fatal levels so just putting them they re going from a really hot environment to a really cold environment Or really cool compared to where they were If they ll put them into more shock which can also be fatal which means they re not exactly just because they re in a hospital doesn t mean they re necessarily going to get better right away Okay obviously they need some treatment You don t want to go from one extreme to the other but do you agree that they need to be cooled down quite a bit Yeah They need to get cooled down and what else do they need Water Water lots of water correct Yes You can t really say that Monique s symptoms can apply for Albert too because Monique was having like an allergic reaction to the bee sting So that s probably what most of the symptoms are from We forgot about the bee sting It says she s dizzy nauseousness has cracked lips is having difficulty breathing has a rash on her legs and stomach Okay she got stung by a bee Like you were saying the reason we put Monique as number one besides experiencing possible heatstroke we also have her experiencing a very bad allergic reaction to the bee It shows here that with the difficulty breathing the bee sting her body is having a very poor reaction to the bee sting and that if left untreated for longer times without getting pills and stuff like that or EpiPen Getting what EpiPen You know what it is Just say EpiPen EpiPen yeah Epinephrine Epinephrine Yes It should elevate them in the largest sense where she could potentially have life threatening without her entire like respiratory system is closing off she loses her breathing possibly Absolutely she s having the preliminary signs of an allergic reaction here Here s where my thought went and I said we d come back to this point Maybe Sean you were going to comment or somebody else They re both out in the wilderness this canyon they re both having heatstroke symptoms Actually Monique got stung by the bee she s having separate issues there You don t see anything else different about these two individuals Sean One got to stay put for a long period of time and assured a maybe cooler spot while the other still had to keep going up through the sun and the heat to try to get to the top Do you think that would have a difference in their physical One gets to rest while the other still has to keep going and going and going another what third of the way Excellent point you know What s the other issue between these two Jack you know Well like they re both in the same environment and they both have symptoms of heatstroke but Monique got stung by a bee and at the same time Nelson has no signs of any external trauma or anything that happened to him that caused the symptoms So it could have even been a seizure or a stroke made him lose consciousness and causes a temperature to rise so high is because he was probably thinking that there was something off Interesting interesting Yes Would it be their age Age excellent Look at the difference in their age How old s Monique 18 Yeah she s 18 Nelson the dad right He s 51 I m not saying 51 is old but there s a big difference between 18 and 51 plus the fact you add in what Sean said he s got to hike out of this canyon he s going to try to find help right Is he having to expend a lot more energy Yeah And he s got to go uphill He s go to go uphill yeah It s hot he s got no water he s got to go uphill he s losing basically control of his body No energy no water Erin And that s why we had Nelson as number one and then Monique would go second because they both had like the heat problem but Nelson was having it was much more severe with him because of his age and everything And Monique she was sitting there for three hours after being stung by a bee so it wasn t like so we put her close up to the top because there was she s already been waiting for long enough She needs to get help like right away because she was sitting in the shade waiting for hours while her dad had to go struggle up the top of the canyon So they were in a really bad situation and they just needed help immediately because they d been struggling long enough Absolutely What During our discussion we were kind of using Speak up a little bit sorry Okay so during when we were discussing the age we were thinking also Monique but Which group were you real quick E You were E okay So like what we thought was that since Monique is 18 years old verses Nelson is a 51 year old well like it makes sense that Monique has a stronger immune system because she s more young and she has more nutrients in her body whereas Nelson could be different but we don t know if he has any diseases like diabetes or high blood pressure It doesn t show but I m just saying in general We were writing specific about his other health because I wrote that down Age related diseases Age related diseases yeah So we re missing some medical history Yeah so it s possible there because he s older and because his immune system isn t as strong as Monique s is we have to like or doctors have to like protect them with treatment more early because his immune system is much more weak compared to his daughter s Absolutely As doctors medical history is so important It s so important in the triage process and we ve been through this folks You know you go to the doctor s office you go into the hospital you know in addition to while they re taking your vital signs what are they asking What are they asking when you go in Medical history Oswell Have you had any previous stuff What s stuff mean Like surgery so like problems Okay other medical conditions Yeah Okay what s another question they ask Very simple Has it ever happened before Has it happened before Is it hereditary Could it be hereditary what s your family s history And I think that s what Brian you were relating to back there What are you here for today Okay let s look back in the chart should I At this moment when he comes into the hospital he s obviously not having symptoms of having high blood pressure in the past and high blood pressure might have actually helped Oh so you re asking about you re referring to Nelson Yeah because if he had high blood pressure then that might have actually helped keep his blood pressure up to normal if it went down severely because of what happened in the canyon But because it s so low I would guess that he doesn t have a history of high blood pressure Okay you might want to disagree with that and take history out of it Blood pressure is obviously low I think we addressed this a second ago Why do you think it s low Sarah Because everything else that s going on it s also affecting blood pressure Yeah I think I truly believe with the limited amount of information we have I truly believe that because of the dehydration the heatstroke the no energy no nutrients I literally think this entire body all the systems Shutting down Shutting down I really do think that But it s a good point that you bring up because his blood pressure s 85 over 50 Does anybody has anybody ever taken their blood pressure before Okay 85 over 50 that s low I mean that gets to borderline point where you know you re dizzy I mean you could have an episode because that pressure of your blood going through the circulatory system it s not high enough I mean that gets borderline with instead of having to take medicines for high blood pressure you got to take medicines to bring your blood pressure up I think his body s just shutting down and you bring up a good point but I think in this case just with everything else going on I think his body s just shutting down Okay Honestly on the side of that besides you were saying like high blood pressure could actually help During the scenario that he s in high blood pressure like with it s problems that it could cause with it s possible weakens the heart could have actually killed him during the long extended time of trying to get to the paramedics That was due to the fact that the high blood pressure has the of hurting muscles at a much different rate than most people That this test could have possibly failed during the time to get to a paramedic without And plus even had he survived the high blood pressure and got on the top the shut down of major systems in his body would have still caused the blood pressure to get down so that there s no possible low levels that could even cause problems True yeah Blythe Like on the graphs I feel like there s Nelson his blood pressure and the blood pressure of Elders was like similar because it was 80 over 50 whereas Nelson was 85 over 50 But we just talked about how like Nelson s blood pressure could be low and this other instance it might not be but with Elder he has a head injury and 
 Today I m going to introduce to you our new project and it s based on the concept of surrealism When you look at this word you should recognize a smaller word within it Does anyone recognize the smaller word Real Real that s right The word real And we know real is the way things really look when we see them or the way they appear But the word sur transforms that word And because this is a French word sur means beyond So now what the word surrealism implies is beyond reality or the way things really appear So what does that look like It looks very dreamlike It doesn t necessarily make sense A lot of different things go on in surrealism and I m going to show you a few examples right now These are the three characteristics that we re going to focus on The first characteristic is out of place objects If you look at this example up here what s out of place in this picture Can anyone tell me Trevor The guy s face What s over his face just floating there Can anyone tell You re up close Matthew You see what that is An apple It s a green apple okay And that is an out of place object Definitely surreal These are examples of surrealism This example right here What s in here Jordan Train There s a train coming out of a fireplace Okay again an out of place object These are two examples of one of those characteristics of out of place objects Another characteristic that you see are unreal scenes Scenes that do not make sense They re beyond real What s going on in this scene Kurt There s like giant butterflies Yeah The butterflies grew They re huge Now they re like the props on the windmills What s going on in this Can anyone tell What makes that surreal John Like huge makeup Yeah the si again the size of such little things grew tremendously and they re filling up the room Also the interior of the room is now looking like the sky So what made these unreal is the artist changed something that was small and made it really really big The last characteristic that we see in surrealism is there it is Normal objects acting abnormally So in these examples I ll go through real quickly Do you see these clocks They re not acting normally These clocks are melting they re dripping they re stretching they re falling down You can see that In this one the artist drew a person looking into the mirror but does he see his reflection No No The mirror s not operating normally It s surreal It s beyond real What it s doing is it s showing the back of his head And again in this one it s kind of hard to tell but there are three swans and the reflection is of three elephants So the reflection in the water is not acting normally These are three characteristics of surrealism all right So why surrealism Why this style of art Does anyone have any guesses of why anyone or why these artists created something like this Yeah Because it s like a modern form of art Okay yeah That s actually a very good definition Cara Maybe to make it look interesting Okay good To make it look funny Okay good Guys those are all excellent excellent answers Here is another thing that went into surrealism Like lots of art it s influenced by what s going on around it or what happened before it So these three boxes represent three other styles of art that influenced the ideas of surrealism And the first style of art is known as Dada art This type of art is where the artist took things and they tried to make something that wasn t considered art They took random objects like a bicycle wheel and the stool and put it together and said Okay this is not art And that was an example of the style They also took a famous painting like the Mona Lisa scribbled mustache and a beard There it is That s not art And that was really the whole idea of Dada It was like anti art Another thing that influenced surrealism was symbolism Symbolism was a style of art in which the artist tried to depict an idea of something And in this example it s the idea of death There s this dark angel depicted over this man who s already halfway down in the ground All this white snow that symbolizes life around him And it was just the idea of what that might look like using symbols And that s what that one depicts The other example or another influence of surrealism is metaphysical painting This one s very very hard to understand and that s what the idea was with the style It was to kind of paint an unreal or illogical situation Basically one in which you do not know what you re looking at You don t know what the objects are You might know something but you don t know why it s there or what part of it it is And it s very very illogical and doesn t make sense These three styles of art in the boxes influenced surrealism So when you look at these three styles of art you can kind of see what they led to They led to this style of art which is known as surrealism So now where to start Here s what s going on today Today you are going to start with and you can open your folders up and you ll see this slide What we re going to do is we re going to start drawing today We are going to start by making a connection all right And if you look at this example up here on the board or and you can look at your slides too What we re going to do you can just take your stuff off Leann leave it back there and then join your table okay What we re going to do is I want you to come up with something that means something to you and that s like your theme to start with Maybe it s a hobby an activity a memory anything that s meaningful to you that s your starting point Then what we have to do is we have to give it an element of surprise So these are our options that I just discussed Those are the characteristics Do you want to move it around change the location of it Do you want to make the sizes different and create an unreal scene Or do you want to make objects in it doing something that they shouldn t be doing Let me give you an example Lily what s your favorite food Strawberries Strawberries What s your favorite holiday Joe Christmas Jacob what s your favorite animal A dog Okay So this is my surrealist example to you You have a Christmas tree but instead of a Christmas tree you have a big strawberry standing up with decorations on it and then you have dogs putting those decorations on it So that s kind of an example of taking things that are meaningful to you and putting them into a surrealist example These are some examples that I have that I did These are some of my drawings This first one and sometimes you don t even know where these drawings are coming from I wanted to take an object and stretch it I wanted to make it act abnormally So I chose a spoon And what I did was I thought well a spoon needs to catch something So this spoon is stretching out trying to catch the raindrops Why Because it s really dry wherever it is You can see all the cracks So that was kind of like my first idea The second sketch that I did was I wanted to do something with a tropical type of a setting An unreal scene in an unreal place So what I thought was well pineapples are tropical Why not cut open a pineapple and there is my tropical beach with all the little palm trees okay You re probably wondering what we re going to do with these Today is sketching but what s going to happen is this is going to turn into a watercolor painting This is an example of what the painting might look like when it s all done I chose the pineapple one all right So we are going to be doing a watercolor painting but today we need to kind of come up with ideas of what that painting s going to look like Up here on the board I think this is going to help you a lot This is a bunch of different examples of surrealist paintings and there s a variety of different things that the artist has done They might be food they might be animals they might be instruments they might be people they might be landscapes There s lots of things to look at I want you to use this as your primary resource to help you and guide you through your drawings I m going to give you paper right now Use this sheet Start with making a connection all right Start with making a connection and then look at the different options and ways that you can make it surreal all right How do you draw hands Hands That s okay hands You know what This is just a sketch So this is a detail that doesn t or this is a part that you don t really need to worry about So tell me what s going on What makes this surreal Um That s what I want to know Because it s the birthday party in the present Okay So which of these options do you think you re focusing the most on This one Okay and why Because a present usually doesn t open Okay so the present so the party is within the present So the present gets opened up and then there s a party Okay What else can we do to make it like maybe a little bit more like bam something going on That s the only thing I was thinking about you know Like maybe Like balloons and Yeah balloons Like they re com they re flowing out That d be really cool All right that s good What should I like do for like for like the face The face on a Baseball Baseball And what are we using for the parts of the face So this is a baseball bat Okay And I Okay These are the baseball bases Oh the bases okay Yeah And this is and this is Okay So you re combining you re combining A lot a lot of different things So why freckles Because like I thought putting more into it would make it more interesting Okay You know what I think would make this really more interesting is the background What s going on around the face Um Think about it Think about it What could we do Where could this be In the sky I don t know So what would represent the sky What could you draw to represent the sky Clouds Try that Maybe draw some clouds I think I think that s going to make your picture more interesting Something like that Because like someone hit a home run Yeah okay And maybe some action lines around the ball You know like a little Yeah That looks really good I like that I like that one a lot A dog eating pizza Okay Brittney Yeah I don t know how to draw horses A horse Yeah Why do you need a horse Because I want to draw like a horse What were you going to do Like A horse A horse with a farm inside of it Inside of it So what do you mean inside of it though Like in here do like a farm and cows and Well here s a suggestion because I like your idea a lot Why don t we we can use this as a resource Why don t we draw I ll help you with this just the back of the horse okay So we ll just work we ll focus on like the neck and the back and then the tail kind of coming down like this okay So you see where I m going with this Now what I m thinking is why don t you draw your farm scene on the back Like almost that it s like kind of been placed on there like a little miniature scene Like so maybe on here you could draw the silo the barn and everything on there Good Eyes on me One two three Okay guys you re doing a really really good job with your sketching and everything and I don t I want you to keep going But we do need to stop for a minute And based on the drawings that I m seeing I see some really good examples of surrealism and you re showing me that you understand it I bet you that if you saw an example of surrealism with some other styles of art you could pick out the one that represents surrealism Take a look up here on the board I have three Tabasco sauce posters okay One two three and four Show me with your fingers holding them up in the air which one of these is an example of surrealism Think about it for a minute While you think about it I m going to wiggle my mouse so I can okay What s an example of which one is a Jess Okay everyone had four That s good Why Why that one Why d you pick that one Because like Nope hold on I was going to let Jessie answer first What makes that one surreal Think about it Michael go ahead The sides are like coming off the bottle Okay And the pepper s like putting out the sauce Okay good Anything else Erin It s like out on this like island Yeah definitely definitely Like a lot of things make this one surreal What does surreal mean again Who remembers Me It means like not like like not real but like in a different form Right Beyond real Beyond real Okay And this is a great example of that Beyond reality Okay Here s what I need you to do now okay I have one more Oh I might have to re I have one more slide that I want to show you up on the board and if you open up your folders you ll see this You ll see this slide And I printed it out for you What I m going to have you do right now in the next couple minutes I m going to have you switch your drawing with someone at your table You might have to switch three ways or four ways or one way And I want you to assess the drawing that you get Now if you get one that has lots of drawings just pick one of them okay Here s what I want you to do on the sheet This is easy First thing What s the first thing that you notice about the drawing that you just received Write it down Maybe you noticed a big basketball Maybe you notice whatever it is write it down Then I want you to check these little circles Whichever of these options that you see that that person used I want you to check them out Okay Michael And then I want you to write This is the one that everyone stumbles with They re like What does this mean All I m saying is what do you think that person meant in that drawing What do you think the meaning is If you don t know put a question mark All right And then what suggestions do you have for that person Maybe they you know if you did a background it would look really nice Or maybe you know what Maybe you ve got to lose something You ve got way too much going on I can t tell what it is So this is not going to take you very long but it s important because it shows that shows me that you understand what you re looking at and it also helps the person get a better drawing which is going to be used for the painting So I want you to switch drawings right now Everyone switch And I want you to use the sheet and I want you to fill it out based on the new drawing that you re looking at okay So you re going to do this independently and I ll come around and I ll check with you in a little bit That s the first thing that you see Write down the first thing that you see all right So Lily what s the first thing that you see in your in this picture Okay What do you think it is Okay What do you think this is as a whole Don t say anything because I know it s yours But this is good because this is going to help you to make it better if you need to So what s the first thing that you know That you th what do you see Just maybe you recognize it just as water Anything else Maybe a blanket Okay Write that down Okay that s a good start What s the first thing that you saw Almost everything is crooked That s a good ob that s a really good observation Because everything is crooked Good So what options do you think were used in this Now which one did you select Normal object acting abnormally That s right It s clearly these objects are acting abnormally That s good That was a good that was another good observation So you just keep moving through Did you write down your first reaction Mm hmm Okay And okay So normal objects acting abnormally 
 Okay so They re equal because of Right Angles Theorem You are skipping a step Again Trevor tell him the definition of an altitude You tell me I have an altitude You have to tell me then what s the consequence of an altitude Read the definition of an altitude Say it The definition of an altitude is that it intersects the opposite side of the angle at a perpendicular angle I don t know how to word that right but Somebody help him out He s making sense but somebody Yes Alright It goes through the opposite vertex and it intersects the opposite line perpendicularly if that s a word Don t say through because an altitude is bounded It starts at a vertex and it goes Okay so Now Isaac What should be the consequent step two there Right here Yes Whatever they gave you in those definitions Trevor s and the improved definition by Trey nobody said anything about congruent angles What did we talk That they re both right angles That they re right angles No we didn t That BD is perpendicular to AC Ah ha That s what I got Nice That s what it is So just write on top of that honey Right here Yeah the step two you should have that Right You have to go with the definitions when you have a justification because that s what reason says It comes from a defintion And why is that because of Tell him Why is that Definition of altitude Definition of altitude Okay You see how when we were working with the picture we put those boxes on the triangle What did those boxes say indicate That they re right angles They re right angles okay So that should be And why do we have right angles Somebody tell me Why do we have right angles Definition of perpendicular lines Yes That s a consequence if you have perpendicular lines So I m going to write ADB and CDB are right angles Yes Yeah Okay You guys the rest of you might have started with the fact that it s an angle bisector right Yeah Yeah And that s okay if you started with that It s okay Doesn t matter You could have started with the BD is congruent to BD You don t have to start with a given but that s traditionally the way we do it I can t believe I got this It s because of It s the definition of perpendicular lines What s this Okay wait Breathe in and out Now let s go see what s going on Okay step to the side ADB and CDB Okay Still you need to have an angle a side and an angle Do you have a congruent angle After all that work I m going to do that now Okay what are you going to put Angle ADB is congruent to angle CDB because the definition of right angles Nope Right Angle Congruency Right Angle Congruency Theory Well I haven t What is the definition of right angle That all right angles are congruent What s the definition of a right angle 90 degrees It measures 90 degrees Yeah yeah All right angles are congruent is the Right Angle Theorem that he s writing Okay let s see what we have If you would number them that would help That s one And what s the consequence for after one I m trying I am old and somewhat blind from here But I know Is that a 2 right under that At the perpendicular line you have 2 What is that AD is perpendic No after that Angle ADB is congruent to angle CDB Wait He wrote it It s all jumbled up and it s all there so But wait a minute Let s make sense out of this because it has to flow okay You know when you have your perpendicular line What should be at the perpendicular line The direct consequence if you have perpendicular lines is what That the angles are Somebody somebody That they re right angles I want to say that but then I just don t want to say something that s wrong No you re fine You were not here yesterday And it seems you re doing great Hey so take the blue marker so that everybody can see Take the blue marker because I would like to re number it so they can see it okay So re number them again One is the given the altitude So you want me to write over Yes And then that s two Now what should be three Don t put three on that one What should be three Somebody tell him What should be three The angles The right angles Yes Okay now honey after you have right angles what are you going to say That uh Definition of Right Angle Theorem No Okay so right angles What happens after right angles Because remember angles are angles I need to talk about angle congruency But you haven t said that You talked about right angles So now what are you going to say You have it there honey Angle ADB is congruent to angle CDE Okay so that should be the next step That s four Okay you remember Good Great Remember when I asked you at the beginning when we first started doing proofs to keep track So you have mentioned an angle congruent to an angle Yeah right here Not yet we haven t touched that guy yet We don t even have a number for that guy He s just floating in there What angle is congruent to what angle Have you mentioned that one angle is congruent to another angle Yeah ADB is You just did right Okay go cross out one of the As I don t think you specifically did this but I ve noticed that some of you I ve noticed in Abby and I would notice in a couple of you Taylor that you were always After you prove something you found it within your proof You would kind of cross it out in here Okay I found this Or some of you would come over here and actually write it here It s like you re taking attendance I need angle for an angle I already have an angle Keeping going See what I m doing here I showed you this way back Yeah He s probably getting confused because of number three How he put ADB because it should be ABD and DBC instead of ADB Wait what what what Number three The original number three Yeah The B should be in the middle instead of D It should be ABD and DBC That s right That s why That s why Yeah I didn t noticed that Yeah I thought he put that You guys are smart Yeah that s how you got confused with everything else Okay so now segment BE is congruent to segment BE because of reflexive property so that s another side And then it s given that BD is an angle bisector so that means angle ABD is congruent to angle CBD Okay but the issue here is he hasn t listed that as a given right Just like people say Well you re making that up How do you know that And you just say It s given but you didn t write it Yeah he did Yeah yeah he did It s right there It s number four He just did it wrong It s backwards It s all there So that should be step Wait a minute One two three four five Four should be one Whoa Three should be two One should be So there s a one two three four and then five Wait five right here Six right above it six seven Okay can you change the numbers Fix the numbers Yeah please fix the numbers It s there Okay we got it We have an angle bisector the consequence of an angle bisector We have an altitude the consequence of an altitude We have reflexive property so do you have them all Yeah So what could you say now The triangle I m going back to the black marker Okay let s get him out of the hot seat okay Micah Yes Micah You tell us is he finished with the proof No Why Because you said no Who said no You But okay you re supposed to tell me if there s something Well you have to put that it is the I don t know Frank to the rescue He hasn t proved that it s isosceles yet And how do you prove that it s isosceles I don t really know That sounded so tough Frank Yes Okay you say segment AB and segment BC are congruent by C Wait how do you say it CPCTC Corresponding Parts of Congruent Triangles are Congruent I always mess it up I can t do the CPC I can t do that I say the whole thing Okay now Frank is he finished I think Is he No Not yet No he s not Okay why Tell him why Since you have the two sides congruent and the isosceles triangle needs two sides congruent then you can say that the triangle is isosceles now because AB is congruent to BC So what should be his number 10 Triangle ABC is isosceles And that would be the definition of an isosceles triangle Yes I m so proud It keeps getting better I told you it would get better Teamwork I was stressing last night because I was like it s so hard Okay you guys understand what this means but I m trying to hurry it Good job Isaac Yeah Isaac a good job Very good Isaac One big clap for Isaac one two three Alright Yeah You did good Okay so You know what This is the proof that the new program where I give you because I want to make sure you get it enough information to do this on our own okay And then I m not going to write it out We re going to talk about how to do it And then you re going to complete it tonight at home So what do we need to do What is given there Jonathan What s given The middle one This one honey CB is an angle bisector of ACB CD is an angle bisector of ACB Okay what does that give you Once you have an angle bisector No that s not it Don t look at that one That s a totally different proof This is one that I m going to give you tonight So what does CD being an angle bisector of angle ACB mean 
 More important cause their friend Maser something died the day before and they stayed in the village for that long They didn t have to stay but they decided to stay They didn t have to do that but they just chose to do that because they felt it was more important Well and it may have been a choice for safety also if they stay with him If they run to another village they may be you know picked off Trying to stick to the customs that they are so used to like back in normal life and stuff like that So trying to get back in that But the fact that they did wait kept them from their real life like their parents and stuff But saved their lives Yeah Okay Emily and Simon Simon Emily Emily and Spencer I mean Simon That s her last name Do you believe the boys were right for getting mad at whatever his name is after they got to the village and blaming him for missing I think anyone would get mad They need to get it out on someone What do you mean by being right to get mad Do they have like A valid purpose A valid reason for getting mad I mean yeah They were probably just mad out of frustration If you would have went in with them before like earlier before the rebels attacked they wouldn t have been able to see their families So that s what their drive has been for the past couple months or however long they ve been running It s to get back to their families Even if they would have died I mean That s what he was saying is that he was mad at him at Dishmrael for holding him back because he could have seen his family He would have died But then later on when his mind cooled down he was like yeah well he saved my life cause I would have been killed It was probably like an in the moment thing I think in that kind of situation you always look for someone to blame Cause there is no way he could have known soldiers were gonna attack them so we should hurry and go see them He thought they had time to go and see their family Like let s stop and rest and stuff like that There s no way he could have known that was gonna happen so they can t really blame him but they need to blame someone Yeah I d want to punch someone too I d be so mad if that happened to me I understand why they would blame him but looking back on it And how does his age impact that also Well he s not He not really old enough to really think about it All he s thinking about is his family With maturity you think before you act but as a little kid you just act and don t know the consequences Well and he has no life experience to prepare him for this at all There s another aspect And he used to follow Junior and everything he did but now that Junior s gone he doesn t even have that Right Exactly Okay keep going War is hell Oh yeah you can Sorry about that It s okay So want to go Kaylee Okay Ask the question The question Girda is a young woman at the time of the book and so was Valentino and Wutuzuwut How do they change through the course of the book due to the tragic events in their lives I think they re forced to grow up real fast because of all the pressures At the time I mean Valentino doesn t know his age but let s say like 15 and 20 and when I haven t read the end of this book but she comes home to America and so does Valentino and they just come over and even though they re like like a 40 year old So it s kinda weird coming back to America and trying to enjoy all the child pleasures Yeah the whole event just kinda makes them you know kinda step it up a bit If something like this happens to you you don t easily forget it It becomes more of a part of you It kinda takes out who you really are inside Yeah it shapes you Yeah Well and how did the stages in their life coincide That s a good question Kaylee Well first of all genocide I thought was basically kind of done the same so it was usually like they lost their families they re forced to go out on their own they re forced to make a life for themselves And both of them kind of think or know that their parents are dead And so they kind of use their families in a way to keep them going and just like other people in their lives that have motivated them cause I think Ile or I don t know how to say her name She kind of motivated Girda to kind of stay in the camp with her and have maybe a friend there where with Abek s family she wouldn t really have a friend she d just have like she d owe it to their family to do things for them And then with Achek he had William K to help him Just had a friend to make it through Yeah So they both had a strong friend What kind of life did they both live before disaster struck They both had the perfect ideal family life you know They were happy They were all together It was you know like what would happen in a Disney movie pretty much Everything s kinda perfect And then something happens in the first Both in the person that happens to meet their family ties are cut And their survival depends on whether they can kinda ban together with the people around them and kinda grow and become stronger Yeah I think Yeah No you go Okay They were just I mean they were forced to grow up And they just lived like Ryan said like the ideal life with their family or whatever But once their parents left they had to find a friend or someone to group with in order to Well what were they replacing What were they replacing with William K and Ile Yeah They established a family without being blood related They just had to make it through by that It s cause if you don t have motivation then you re not going to get through things so even though they didn t know that their I mean they assumed their parents were dead but they didn t know for sure Cause on page 80 of this I mean she said that she never saw her father again But just to know that their parents are alive and they just want to regroup with them at the end keeps them motivated and alive Not knowing They both have that in common Right Assuming that they re dead but not really knowing for sure Just to keep them motivated to survive so it s a good tactic So what is a really simple message that we can take from that from both of their stories What do you need in your life Motivation You need family You need some kind of family unit to Survive Or friends Everyone needs like someone to kinda like go to and they can depend on no matter what the situation is Right and if you re going to friends a lot of time at least in like a high school or whatever you go to friends with questions instead of your family or whatever sometimes you ll get the wrong side of view on things and it will change your life drastically Cause your friends determine how your high school is gonna be determines how the rest of your life But also you got a different perspective cause your family doesn t necessarily know what s going on in your own high school Yeah so it s good to get both but family is more important cause you can count on them more usually And they re older and wiser You need that kind of like wise person cause my mom knows more than I do or my friends Yeah But you need those relationships as connections right Right to keep motivated Both of those stories show that really literally life and death situations those connections with other humans It is a human basic need that we have to make those connections Or you cannot survive I think both of those stories That s a really good question in looking at the stages It also shows globally Globally what can we say about families At the beginning of the story you were talking about it s like a Disney movie right Yeah So what can we say about families literally around the world They re all usually together Nobody ever leaves their children when their toddlers to go find where like how they re supposed to live and like what s good and bad You usually nurture your kids til they re about nineteen and then they go off to college I think that s just how it is everywhere It may not be that way in some places but you usually have schooling and then you go off and then you figure out for yourself once you ve got a base Yeah they re usually pretty perfect or ideal until like a third party like Nazis or the Arabians come in and just wipe that out and changes a lot drastically to where they have to depend on themselves and I guess their friends since they didn t have family And that family unit seems to lend to safety even if you re living in Sudan or if you re living in Poland The children both at the beginning feel very safe in their lives right Right And if nobody knows you what makes you if you die who would care That s what I would think Like if nobody cared about me or nobody knew who I was That s what a lot of suicidal thoughts Yeah I was just thinking I don t think that but I m just saying if I had nobody to be like I care about you You need to stay alive or like your parents There wouldn t be a reason to live Yeah but like in those stories like they find symbolic fixtures or whatever I think in both yeah the moon They look at the moon and they see they just see the moon and it s like their kinda friend But they also hope that the moon will find their parents somewhere or wherever they are cause they don t know Yeah their parents are looking at the same thing that they re seeing kinda Yeah so it s kinda like right there keeping them together And what s funny is that s a main the moon is a main symbol in a long way gone Yeah And he refers to that also I think cause the moon can be seen anywhere on earth It s a connection I think somewhere Yeah Yeah totally It s kinda like the bright light in darkness You know the night it s a pictch black but the moon s shining You know kinda there no matter what Good Okay keep going And the German s are just coming in and everything s getting really bad And like going back to their past and showing it as such a nice place What she does is she ends up showing how much darker it is by comparison Okay what was the question How does the author implement setting to contrast good and evil How is it affected Okay purpose And we just finished talking about how it shows the atrocities to be even darker because it s happening in this nice place But she s forced to saying the dark side of things cause she s forced into her basement where it s all dark and you know there s mildew on the wall and it s flooded and it s just really gross down there And that s what s happening outside of the happy little hometown that she grew up in And then her childhood is marked with flowers and the sunny days You know running with her friends and chasing butterflies and eating sweets And it s just really happy and bright and cheery And so there s a major contrast And as you go into the book does that darkness continue Or is it broken by light How does she portray darkness and light even when she goes to the camps There s Go ahead but I have an answer OK At least up to the point where we ve read she s kind of reached a climax of how bad things are when her parents were taken away from her and everything Arthur s letters stopped coming And that s kind of the climax from how far we ve gotten where the darkness is So now it s about finding the good things that are in that darkness Right I think she has little flashes of good things and the smallest of things to us brings such hope to her of a bright future But it is surrounded by darkness And in the camp did she talk about physically light and dark also Like the dramas and she wrote plays And they had fun there The single light shining in the dark room Do you have anything to add Abbey Can you think of times when she talked about light Physically light in the camps I was trying to think And how does she portray it Cause that is an interesting motif in the book the light and dark And it will continue to play a part Which camp is she in at the middle part She s in the I can t pronounce it It s the first one where she s they re sewing they re weaving So they re at the looms right Yeah they re at the looms Did she pass through Auschwitz Or was that the one she was in jail I think she passed through Volkenheim Yeah Does she ever get outside That would be a key at Volkenheim Outside of the camp itself Just outside in the outside Well here s a reference to outside She talks about how the night was starry and beautiful From Heirgonk I could see the hill through a window Slowly the full moon rose So that is like a light in the darkness literally Because the stars the moon and the stars are the brightest things at night in the sky and just her finding that comfort in that also shows really extreme light and dark But her comfort comes at night in the darkness And she has one source of light So keep looking for those motifs of light and dark cause they play a part throughout Have any of you gotten past the halfway point Yeah Yeah we ve gotten a little bit past In the march you know that becomes very important Alright good Good job Alright you guys Bell s gonna ring Keep your questions for tomorrow 
 We have been talking about being a good speaker and a good listener And in class your teacher had you do an activity in your classroom where you sat across the way from a student and you read them a paper that you had written about dingoes And then you had to stand up in front of the class and you had to present that Do you remember that Okay So we talked about what it sounds like to be a good speaker and what it looks like to be a good listener and your teacher and I worked on a rubric and you got a grade for some different things about speaking Do you remember what any of those things were that you got a grade on Do you remember what she was looking for Posture Posture What do you mean by posture Not moving around Okay So when you re standing up in front of the class what would you look like Standing straight Okay Not leaning against the wall Okay good Do you remember what else we talked about being a good speaker looks like Voice Okay What about your voice What should your voice do Use your presentation voice Yeah like a presentation voice Does it sound like this What does a presentation voice sound like Kind of loud but not like an outside voice Yeah kind of loud but not screaming right I like how you said not an outside voice All right What else for speaking Do you remember what else One of them I know didn t really have to do with speaking but it had more to do about your report And it was did your report make sense Right Did what you write make sense What about if I read my report really slow Is that good I can t remember It starts with an F Fl Fluency Fluency Good And what does that mean You re not reading slow or too fast Good not too slow not too fast just right Okay So we have posture voice makes sense fluency do you remember what the last one was You re not doing it right now Eye contact Good All right You want to make eye contact right Right So when you re reading you want to be able to do what See the people Yeah look at the audience right Kind of look over your paper and make eye contact with people Okay now if I m a good listener if I m the person sitting in the audience how can I show my classmates that I m being a good listener No distractions Okay So don t distract them What else Don t be distracted by someone else Okay So you want to focus on the speaker All right How can you show them that you re focused on them How would they know Look at them Yeah look at them Right Okay look at the speaker And what else What about at the end when they re done Ask questions Good Ask questions Anything else Sit up straight Okay Good Could you tell them maybe how they did What do we call that Like feedback What they did well on or maybe what they could do better Right Okay Put a star next to the ones that you think you already do a good job at What do you think you do a good job at Okay You re focused on the speaker All right you sit up straight Okay You don t distract others That s good Okay Now out of these two which one do you think you need to work on Which one could you do a better job That one Okay So maybe you could ask more questions at the end Okay All right What about speaking Which ones do you think you do a good job at already Posture Okay You do a good job on that one Make sense Mm hmm Eye contact Mm hmm Okay so out of your voice and fluency which one do you think you could do better Which one could you work on The voice Voice All right So what do you think you need to do better with your voice Speak up louder Speak up louder Maybe a little bit closer to like that presentation voice Okay On your rubric it was what five four three two one Do you remember what you got on your volume Three A three okay So Miss Welch thought you could do a little better too so maybe next time you could get a four or a five Okay So we have been talking about famous African Americans and you had said that Walter Payton was somebody that you had thought was interesting Right All right So we are going to look at some information about Walter Payton and then see if we can maybe do better on asking questions and maybe working on your volume Okay Cool Okay So Austin the other day you and I met and we did a videotape of ourselves giving a little speech about Walter Payton and the first one was I was speaking and you were videotaping me And then we flipped it and I videotaped you So what I want to do is have us watch those and see how they turned out And then we re going to use this rubric that you use in your classroom to kind of grade ourselves and see how we did and talk about what we can do better in the future Okay So we looked up some facts about Walter Payton and let s watch my speech first And I want you to be thinking about while you watch me how did I do on eye contact How did I do on my volume How was my fluency Did it make sense And how was my posture Okay on a scale of one to five five being Woo hoo Miss Suzer you did a great job and one meaning Miss Suzer I didn t even see that at all Okay All right you ready All right Let s see how I did Walter Payton was one of the best running backs in the NFL He played for the Bears after going to college in Mississippi Sweetness has over 110 questions But he died in 1999 of liver cancer He s one of the best football players of all time I wish I could have seen him play He was my favorite football player All right So let s see What do you think Do you want to use purple or blue You want to be purple Okay So how do you think I did on eye contact What do you think You think a four Okay why do you think a four Did I give much eye contact No No Oh you re saying yes I only saw myself look up once so I m going to give myself a two I don t think I did a very good job You re too nice Alright How was my volume Pretty good Okay I think I ll agree with you there How was my fluency or my rate Good Okay I think I m going to give myself a four because there were kind of parts where I thought maybe I could have talked a little faster I don t know All right Did it make sense what I said Yeah Okay And how was my posture Was I standing up straight looking ahead Okay I wasn t like swaying or rocking or anything All right so it looks like overall I think I need to do better on eye contact And you thought I could probably do a little better on eye contact And I think I could do a little better on my fluency I think I could have maybe spoke a little bit faster It sounded like I was kind of in slow motion Okay So now let s watch how you did And then we ll grade you Okay All right so here you are Okay Let s see All right How do you think your eye contact was A one Why did you give yourself a one Because I didn t really look up You didn t look up at all did you Were you looking at your paper What were you concentrating on Paper The paper Okay Yeah I would say it would be good maybe if you held your paper down at your belly button right and then you could look up All right How was your volume Not evident Okay I m going to give you a two and a half for your volume because we could kind of hear you I think the reason we couldn t hear you is because you had the paper in front of your face I think your voice might have gone out a little bit more All right How was your fluency or your rate What do you think I didn t hear myself at all Okay All right I thought it wasn t bad at all I thought it was pretty good because when I could hear you I thought it was probably like a three and a half or a four You weren t reading really fast You were reading so that I could understand you It was just kind of hard to hear All right Do you think your facts made sense Why did you give yourself a two I don t know I had some in there and I don t know All right Because you could only hear parts of it You think if your volume had been better you could have heard more Okay All right I m going to give you a four because I think it made sense All right What about your posture How was your posture Man you re being hard on yourself Why did you give yourself a one Because I wasn t I was like Wiggling around a little bit Yeah Okay Well I m not going to be that hard I m going to give you a three Okay so if we were going to do this again maybe in front of your class or in front of your teacher or something what would you do differently next time Now that you ve seen yourself what would you do differently Maybe the things you got ones on right Okay So maybe looking up over your paper Maybe your volume Yep Maybe working on your fluency or your rate maybe a little faster right What about your posture what would you do differently Stand straight Okay Try to stand still All right So it looks like we have a couple things we could work on right for next time Okay Sounds good 
 And then with Carl s example was down to MSB marginal social benefit So how can we put that into words Marginal social benefit Andrew Isn t it something that can t really be measured Okay Yes and it s harder to measure but how would you explain it What is it Think about what we did in the example and say like everybody is benefiting from washing cars Right So what is It is a social benefit and it s what he gets from the society It s what society gets from you Yeah you re on the track but it s what we get from his interaction Right Okay So it s the benefit to society for whatever market that is Okay So social benefit this is going to be the additional benefit okay The additional benefit that society those that are not involved in the transaction but from society get from one more unit Okay Now I m going to put next to this slash costs Oh just kidding That s that s the other document So down here is just something is a negative thing So what this leads to Do you think these two definitions lead to positive externality or negative externality Positive Positive they re things that market itself does not take care of Okay Market obviously in this example does not take Carl and offer YTB for all of our benefits considering it doesn t pay him at all Right There are things in society that when you look at the actual amount someone is paid they re maybe not paid to the extent of the benefit they get Okay So right now if you flip over to the back we ll come back to definitions later flip over to the back Oh I m sorry on the other sheet because I didn t put it on the back on the other sheet you have two columns I want you first by yourselves without talking to someone else think of try to think of at least two examples where there are things in society where there are markets for these and it makes everyone better off because they re there and we all benefit from them Okay Go ahead write them down Think about it You really think you re going to have to defend it So think about on your own what markets are out there things that happen that benefit everybody not just the people participating in the market So benefits more people than are just paying for the service not just the buyers or the sellers of that service but outside of it people are benefiting from it Write and think and then we ll talk about them Write and think write and think Wait do we need negative ones too Just positive right now we re going to go back to the negative ones So just think of the positive ones right now Okay benefit people again let s cover the definition again Benefit people outside of the buyers and sellers in that transaction Okay So we re not talking about just the buyer of someone who goes to a store and buys something and the benefit they get from it that s marginal benefit but that person buying this gives other people benefit outside of that person But like if they built a hospital in the neighborhood and it has a reputation of being not like they don t have a lot of equipment it s not very good Then could you like the property values of the of the town go down So you could talk about Okay So you re on absolutely the right track so then that would be a negative Like so what could always be a positive benefit Okay Well let s talk about some of the negatives Some of you wrote some stuff down I saw Matt right away think of something what d you write down I said flu shots Okay Why Because the more healthy people there are around the less you ll I don t know The less sick people there are the more healthy people there are Overall right Because if one of you Think about this If one of us If half of the class gets flu shots and the other half doesn t that mentality shows us that now that other half is more likely to get the flu right So that is an absolutely Flu shots What could you make that into a broader explanation Vaccinations Vaccinations Okay Vaccinations So go ahead and write those two down because those two are textbook examples Is medicine good Medicine It depends if it s contagious but go ahead and be more specific so you want to put flu vaccine or any kind of vaccine It s a perfect example because that is a big issue right now A lot of parents are talking about not vaccinating their children because they re worried about issues of autism that have been indirectly slightly connected to it but for the most part that has not been proven yet so now we re seeing other ramifications of that decision Over here go ahead Pro sports Pro sports tell me why People who play get paid for doing it and the fans enjoy watching them Okay good So pro sports and we re not even talking about people that necessarily pay for the ticket to go You might just get to watch on TV A lot of times on the main stations you don t even have to pay cable lines So you would go ahead and benefit from those If you pay aren t you technically then part of that If you paid for it then you re part of that market So like vaccinations You pay for vaccine Okay But that person that pays for the vaccination doesn t get it but all of us benefit because that one student got the vaccine Okay So that s the key It benefits people outside of the one paying for it So that s why it s social Okay Sam YouTube Okay Tell me why Because people can freely put up any type of videos they want That uses creativity and people that want to hear music from anywhere can do it wherever they want Absolutely So YouTube is a great modern example because we all benefit from that kind of laughter that enjoyment It doesn t cost us anything People do it for their own interest and we all benefit Cody Education Education Tell me why Students learn and they get to do well in the world and then the world gets some technology Okay Good Like you brought up tax payers So your parents pay for your education in school Right But by the fact that you re becoming educated even if they pay for your college tuition Now you don t give back just to your parents with that education you give back to society overall Right To everyone hopefully in the world one way or another you end up giving back to society For more people than are paying for your education Okay Yeah Clean energy like electric cars or something because even if you yourself don t drive one that makes like it improves Okay Anything green Absolutely Anything green like that You can put green technologies benefit the world which kind of brings us to one that we re going to talk about with a negative Okay Yeah I just had a question Could you put stock like since if someone buys a stock it raises the price for everyone else Yeah I ve never heard that example but you could argue that It s still benefiting a select group though I guess in some stocks though that s millions and millions of people so I mean you might be able to argue I didn t know because they re still involved in the transaction They re only involved if it s their initial one So that s why I think it s worth some argument there You might be able to prove that I think some of the other ones across the board are a little bit more general but that s definitely something to think about Andrew Well see I agree with him because when the stock prices go up people see that as Oh the public is spending more so that would bring the economy up which would bring That s a really good point because that s an indicator of the health of the economy Right So by the stock market being high it makes everyone employ people Yeah that s a good extra point to add in Yeah What about something like sorry You were thinking of the same thing at the same time Alright go ahead So like taxpayers and the government pays them and even if you don t pay taxes you still benefit from it You could actually put public works down in your column because now that we ve kind of opened that can we can think about parks right And I get the example all the time There s a really nice park I live right by Glenn Ellen and I am not technically in Glenn Ellen but right by there then I go down there I run by the park I take advantage of that public area and I add to my benefit So just by having that park it kind of benefits more people than just the people that pay for it So any public works Police you could talk about firemen they benefit many more people than the people that pay for them The people that clear the snow off the roads Delightful Can I get some negative externalities then Flip it back over Let s go right on Flip it to the other sheet and let s go to the other thing here and then we ll start graphing it Marginal costs Let s put that in our own words here What is the marginal cost of these Everyone think about it for a second Think about it write down your own definition This is something you should know like the back of your hand at this point In your own words write down the definition of marginal costs Write it down you already did Marginal cost You got it Andrew What is marginal cost What is marginal cost The extra cost of hiring one additional worker Okay One more whatever it is It doesn t have to be a worker We re all thinking about workers because we just got out of inputs we just got out of inputs and factor markets and resource markets but remember those units one two and three they had marginal cost too If you picture a monopoly graph what does marginal cost look like on a monopoly graph Upward sloping Upward sloping right So we can think of the system in every unit So what does it need One the additional cost of what One more unit One more unit Let s just keep it like that because input is just factors One more unit because in a monopoly it s marginal cost of making one more unit In a labor market it s the additional cost of one more worker Keep in mind again these are both people that are participating in that market So I m going to put This is the same thing except for it s the cost So you wrote it ready in your own words but make sure you ve got that basic idea Additional cost of one more unit So now we re applying it to this new idea What s the marginal social cost of something The marginal social cost Andrew How much society loses for one more unit Okay How much society loses for one more unit or how much it takes away or cost us when we make one more unit So we re going to think and I m going to add thoughts here It s for all of society So flip it over what are some examples or go to the other sheet What are some examples of negative externalities now that we ve got this down in your mind What are some negatives Zach Breathing in pollution Pollution That again he is on it this is the textbook definition Pollution is the most common example So what has government implemented to try to curtail pollution What kind of things have they done Smoking ban laws Okay good smoking bans So you could say pollution you could also say cigarette smoke is a negative externality So government stepped in which is the type of pollution The government stepped in and said No you cannot smoke in places of employment you cannot smoke in any public area in Illinois it s obviously done by state but the state has stepped in to curtail this type of externality Betty Don t they have pollution rights that they can buy in the market Okay Very good Who do they buy them from The government Good So federal government actually sells pollution rights So that s another way that they deal with it What agency was created to deal with pollution The EPA EPA So the EPA is out there trying to make sure that only so much pollution happens Yeah This is kind of more local but like banks in Elmhurst like they make a lot of banks a ton of banks but every single time they make a new one it seems like less use of all the banks like there s no point to them and it s like a lot of So you re saying that s a negative externality because there s too much Not just that there s just like Say you replace a store that maybe some people use and make a bank and then there s less to do in Elmhurst Okay Try to think of the best way I mean I see what you re saying because that transaction takes away from your enjoyment of living in a town You could put something else there like a new house or a restaurant or something just don t put a bank Okay So how would the government fix that They could be like We re not going to let you buy it The bank buy that lot they could have said no So they might limit they might say how many of these business could be That s a new one I ve never heard of that but obviously there s something there to that because you re saying it s taking away from the enjoyment of people in the community It is maybe adding to the wealth of the community with the employment and the income that s being raised but overall True no I think you ve got something there but it s a different lens Andrew I think that a better example for that would be parking lots because then it s just there and not doing anything whereas for a bank it increases the competition and it increases the rate of The parking garage closer to the Y encourages people to go down to the retail area of Elmhurst and it kind of does encourage people to All right I like what you guys are going with this either one of you could make an argument with it That kind of brings up another point though This is somewhat of Alex are you with me This is somewhat of a this is somewhat of an opinion right Because now you re saying that there s certain things that there s definite and those are going to be our perfect examples like pollution No one in their right mind can argue that pollution gives a benefit to society They can argue that what they produce that produces pollution is helping industrialize I mean talk to China One example Their massive pollution few regulations at all because they re trying to compete with other countries and step up but they re not they definitely would say it s worth it But pollution itself no one can say that it s good Andrew mentioned something about the beauty of something What are some things that people buy or do 
 All right So I showed you all that video for three reasons Number one I want you to see that volleyball is not a girl s sport Here in the South a lot of people think of volleyball as a girl sport because we don t have a lot of male high school volleyball teams I don t know why we just don t That s a common misconception that volleyball is a girl s sport Everybody in that video was a male Everybody in that video was over 50 years of age That means volleyball is a lifetime activity Raise your hand if you can take a guess at what a lifetime activity is Yes ma am A lifetime activity is something you can do when you re older A lifetime activity is something you can do basically for the rest of your life Would golf be a lifetime activity No Golf Yes Golf would be a lifetime activity There s people 70 80 90 years old that are playing golf As a matter of fact playing golf is an accomplishment to be able to go out and shoot your age So I m if I m 70 and I go out and shoot a good Golf is a lifetime activity How about bowling Yes How about tackle football No No Tackle football would not be a lifetime activity If I was to go to the YMCA do you think I would be able to find a league to sign up for tackle football at my age No No Can I go out to the YMCA and find a volleyball league for somebody my age Yeah Yes So volleyball is what we consider a lifetime activity Something you can do the rest of your life Okay the third thing those guys were pretty good Mmhmm And they were pretty athletic So by playing volleyball and staying active you re going to be more athletic than a lot of people that are your age So not only is volleyball a lifetime activity it s going to help you stay in shape help you stay active okay First thing we re going to do is the serve With the serve there are a few things we need to remember okay First thing I want us to remember with the serve is that the ball must stay at the waist When we hit it out of our hand we want it to stay at our waist If I hold the ball up here and I hit the ball is going to go up It s all about the angles okay If I hit the ball right here it s going to go up and out like I want it to go all right So then I want to hit it at my waist Second thing that we re going to remember is that my opposite foot needs to be forward If I hit it with my right hand I want my left leg to be up front like this What other activities have we done that your opposite foot is forward Yes Catching Throwing right With the overhand throw we step with our opposite foot What else Yes ma am The underhand toss The underhand toss that is exactly right I think Ms Beldo taught y all the underhand toss Step tick tock point Which foot do we step with The opposite The opposite foot Do you see a trend Can you make a little connection there Opposite foot forwards okay Now the next things that I want you to remember kind of go hand in hand They are tick tock Tick tock looks like this Tick Tock Pretty easy right Tick Tock Tick I want to pull it back Back here Tock our arm is coming forward Now we are going to add a little something to the tock part All the tock when we do tock I want you standing like this and do tock When we do tock we are actually going to transfer our weight from our back foot going forward into the front foot What do you think that s going to do If we transfer that weight forward Yes If we transfer our weight forward it s going to put more pressure It s going to put more pressure on the ball Am I plugging it harder or softer Harder Harder It s going to produce more force Right I m going to hit the ball harder if I do this than if I do this Does that make sense Because you re getting that momentum going forward It s just like in baseball If I m playing baseball and I m standing in the outfield am I going to throw it harder if I do this or if I do this The one with more force The second one right Because my momentum is going forward Does that make sense So my momentum is going forward Just like in four square If I m playing four square and I want to hit the ball and I m trying to get somebody out in four square am I going to hit it harder if I do this or if I do this That The second one I get my force from the momentum going forward That s right and the last thing I want you to remember with the serve is the follow through Follow the ball John will you stand up please If I want the ball to go to John my follow through should be towards John right If I want the ball going towards the flag my follow through The flag towards the flag If I want the ball going to the cougar my follow through The cougar going to the cougar But right now we re working on hitting it straight so my follow through goes to my target Watch see me take everything out Ball s at my waist my opposite foot is forward tick Tock Tock just like that Okay We ll do it a little bit farther Ready John Opposite foot forward ball at the waist tick tock All right Did you see everything that we had just talked about Opposite foot forward ball at the waist tick transfer my weight into tock All right You re kind of hitting it like that I hit it Good That s great Tony you ready Tony You ready Tossin it up and hittin it And stop just a second put the ball on the ground Ball on the ground A lot of people are doing a good job getting that opposite food forward but they re not transferring their weight to that foot they re getting that opposite foot forward and they re standing like this Am I going to generate much force by doing this No Think about baseball I could step with that opposite foot but if I step and then throw is that helping me generate any force No No I want to step into it Same way in baseball When I throw a baseball I want to step and throw at the same time to get my momentum going forward We re generating force So instead of Tony are you ready Instead of this opposite foot forward and like that I want to generate more force so I m going to start with my weight back here and go into it You see the difference Ball on the ground please Yes So work on generating that force going forward Okay Continue Go And stop just a second Ball on the ground All right One more way that we re going to try to generate force is by following through after we hit the ball So instead of Alex are you ready I m going to serve this to you Instead of doing this kind of almost like you re punching the ball and stopping I m going to follow through to my target If Alex is my target my arm should finish up here at my target Watch Do you see the difference in the force between punching it and following through to your target So that s another thing to work on Remember if you are doing a good job with the ball that you ve got you can switch to another ball If you ve got one of these big yellow ones and you re doing perfect every time I would recommend switching to either this or one of the yellow and blue ones Challenge yourself a little bit Let s go ahead and switch stations so that if you were here one person walk up here and get a clipboard and paper so you can leave notes for your partner If you were over there come over here If you weren t over here just put your clipboard on the steps there And everybody stop Put the ball on the ground just a second No balls in the air Everybody stand up Everybody stand up Alright put everything on the ground Everybody should have to free hands Together let s work on tick transfer your weight through to your target Ryan go in his place Tick arm back transfer weight follow through to your target I still see some people doing this Where s that ball going to go That way That way If I m aiming at the Ball on the ground If I m aiming at the white poster my follow through is to the white poster Everybody pick out a target Tick step follow through Go Pick out a target tick step follow through Go get that ball We ll get you another ball Who can raise their hand and tell me the first thing we need to remember for the volleyball serve Yes sir The first thing we talked about Yes ma am The ball should be at your Waist The ball s at your waist And what is that going to impact And what s it going to influence How far the ball goes It s going to influence how far the ball goes All right So if the ball is up here it s going to go where Up Up If I m down here the ball s going to go Go out so I want to add my weight in order to get that angle so the ball will go over the net and drop What s the second thing to remember Yes sir Remember it s what we talked about with the underhand throw four square and the overhand throw Our opposite foot is Forward Forward right Our opposite foot is forward Like this What s the third thing Shift your weight I want to shift my weight We actually did tick tock when I talk about shifting my weight but shifting our weight is one of the most important things because that is how we produce

 Okay so for our first trial we just wanted to see how long it would take for 25 milliliters of magnesium hydroxide to turn into acid by adding HCL and it took 73 5 milliliters And for our second trial we had the same amount of milk of magnesia but this time we diluted it with 100 milliliters of water And it took less HCL hydrochloric acid than in the first trial that we did And the first time we only added five drops of phenylthalene and the second time we added ten drops just to see if it would make it different and the ten drops definitely made it pinker but we don t think it affected the results because phenylthalene is just the indicator and not part of the reaction You guys actually brought up a good point How many groups added phenylthalene in large quantities How many think that you didn t add enough Let s just ask that Or how would you know if you added too much or not enough Alright go ahead Will Well as long as it turns pink you know that the indicator s working What if it s pinker It wouldn t matter because it turns clear towards the end What do other people think Alright Vivian I feel like if there s not enough indicator that when you add more and more HCL to the solution it becomes the pink color becomes so diluted that you can hardly tell when it turns clear and when it turns back to very pale pink So I don t think there s such a thing as adding too much indicator Our group added about five drops and that was enough Okay what Tad Actually adding too much indicator is bad for the experiment because that would distort the actual concentration of reactants So in an extreme case if we added like 100 milliliters of indicator that would definitely distort the concentration True what do people think about that Alright Jimmy The indicator doesn t participate in the overall reaction so it doesn t really make a difference What do people have to say to that Alright why don t you take Discuss would adding too much indicator would that affect your concentration Like in terms of volume maybe you re adding to more volume of your reaction would that affect the concentrations of your reactants Okay thoughts Alright Jerry I feel like if you added the indicator it would dilute the solution because it would be somewhat like water if you added let s say would change the concentration Okay alright Stephanie I think it would like because if you started out with 25 milliliters of milk of magnesia even if you add a lot of phenylthalene it would still be 25 milliliters of milk of magnesia and that s what s reacting So I don t think it affects it Alright Mackenzie Isn t pH determined by the concentration of hydroxide or hydrogen ions So if it s it would be moles over liters so if there were more liters it would be a smaller concentration right Alright Corey It s mostly about the moles because if the moles of each of the acid and the base combine they will neutralize It doesn t really matter the over liters as long as the moles are equal Okay Rick Well since phenylthalene is an indicator it doesn t actually participate in the reaction just like water so adding it would just increase the volume which as he said which would dilute the solution Adding a lot would have a profound affect but adding a little bit wouldn t actually make a difference Okay Richard It would because there s a lower concentration it would take a lot longer for it to react meaning that it greatly increases the risk of error Because when you re using a burette it s continuously dripping so then if you re swirling and it doesn t react as fast then you have more that goes in before you actually realize it So those are all good thoughts that you guys came up with and all reasonable It does affect the concentration and when you add a few drops just like Vivian said if you don t add enough then it s still indicating but in terms of the overall concentration the concentration of the phenylthalene would be relatively small and so that s why you see like a very faint pink but it s still indicating Now if you add more drops of course you re going to have a darker pink but the overall reaction volume would increase and so if you add drops of phenylthalene if you re adding like five drops compared to your overall reaction volume it wouldn t be that big of a difference So you would still have some source of error but since you re only adding five drops as opposed to five million drops five million drops could conceivably double your reaction volume and then your concentration on a greater scale would be affected You know it would make it so it s more diluted Okay does that make sense to everyone Alright those were all good comments Anyone else have a comment Alright so let s go to table two In last week s experiment we were testing how much HCL it would take to neutralize 25 mL of milk of magnesia First we measured 25 mL of milk of magnesia using a graduated cylinder and add the milk of magnesia into the flask and then we add three drop of phenylthalene as indicator to the flask Then we slowly used the burette to drop the HCL into the flask and it took us 55 5 mL of HCL to clear the solution Every time we d see that it s clear it took the solution longer time So the first time we stopped putting we stopped adding HCL but then it only took about one second to turn back to pink But then after the third or fourth stop that we made it took longer than one second so by the time it took so like towards the end it didn t turn pink anymore So for the second trial what we did instead of using just 25 milliliters of milk of magnesia we just used 15 milliliters and diluted it with ten milliliters of water to see if there s a change in the amount of HCL we used and it did because it took a lot less which was 35 5 milliliters of HCL as compared to the first trial where we used 55 5 So we thought there might be a relation between the concentration of trial two versus trial one It was roughly 35 5 is roughly two thirds the amount it took for the m o m to come clear as over HCL and we were kind of surprised by the results because we didn t expect it to keep going back to pink after it turned clear once Do you think you did something wrong Well we kind of did but then we remembered that this reaction was actually reversible so then we tried it again and then we eventually made it all clear Did anyone else did any other groups think that when the reaction was happening that you had done something wrong Or were surprised by the results Alright Ian Oh no just saying yes Okay anyone have a comment We thought something was going wrong because it took a lot of HCL for the indicator to start working What do you mean start working To start turning opaque because it was pink for a long time We had to add extra HCL to the burette We actually thought that it wouldn t stop turning pink because we stopped it for about three times stopped the burette from running and every time it kept changing color So we thought that happened throughout the experiment Did you think it was going to go on forever Yep Okay any other groups Alright Andrew We noticed that yeah what they said It changed to clear and then after we stopped stirring it it would go back to pink We thought it was the reversible reaction rates but then like we were surprised at how big a difference it was because it was really clear when we were stirring it but once we stopped became really pink Okay alright Will There was also a transitional phase where it turned light and we thought that was the phase it would turn into rather than clear so we actually stopped it there but then we looked around and realized that people with a less concentration turned clear so we started adding more Okay alright group three First we used 25 milliliters of milk of magnesia and then we took 200 milliliters of water to dilute it and then we added five drops of phenylthalene It took about 7 milliliters of one molar HCL to actually fully huh Yeah it took 70 milliliters and then it stayed clear from there For the second trial we want to see if we added less milk of magnesia would it would the time decrease I mean the time to neutralize decrease And so we add 15 mL of magnesia and the same amount of H2O and so we used up about So I heard something about timing because I heard the first couple groups timed some of the things What did you guys time and why did you choose to time that Here let s start here because you guys timed something What did you time and why did you choose to time that Well basically I think we re just measuring the amount of HCL we used up and see how many times we need to stop the burette for Well we observed that it kept changing from pink to clear but the more HCL we put the faster it was from the switch so we kept adding HCL and it turned all clear It turned all clear the faster The previous times were milky white and then towards the end it becomes clear Like totally clear Okay did anyone observe something different in terms of the amount of time that it took for it to turn back to pink Okay table six As we added more HCL the white color persisted longer and it took longer for it to turn back to pink Okay so yeah Rick I don t think time really matters in this experiment because the changing of the colors in the reaction depended more on the amount that was added rather than the time you left it in there So if you add more of course it s going to change quicker but it doesn t matter like how long you have to wait for So you guys were saying that when you added the HCL that it changed quicker to white and then it took longer for it to turn back to pink Okay Gabriel We timed it because we think that there might be a connection between the time it takes each time to turn back to pink and the concentration of the reactants because the longer it takes to turn back to pink might mean that there are less reactants and therefore it will take a long time to get back to the reactions right back to the products which turns it to pink Okay alright Corey I was saying that it was faster turning back to pink The reaction was actually it was slower going back to pink That s okay Okay let s go to table four In our experiment in our procedure actually we had two beakers of the magnesium hydroxide and one beaker we would heat instead of diluting it we would heat up one beaker to around 50 degrees Celsius and we would perform the experiment with adding HCL using the burette and in the other beaker we would leave it in room temperature which is around 25 degrees Celsius and we would do the same procedure adding the HCL with the burette Our purpose for heating it was to see whether the reaction was an endothermic reaction or an exothermic reaction What we found was that when we heated it it actually changing from pink to clear it actually took less time than when we did it at room temperature so we don t know if it accounts for the exothermic or endothermic or maybe the molecules are just moving faster so it ll react faster We also did not dilute the milk of magnesia like most of the groups did so that may have skewed our answers a little as well It took us a lot longer and more HCL to turn the solution clear again Comments Does anyone think that so this group didn t dilute How many groups diluted and added distilled water Okay so all the other groups did Do you think that their data would be affected because they didn t dilute and because you did What are your thoughts Alright Nina We diluted our second trial and it didn t affect the amount of HCL needed Why do you think well from your observations that s obvious but does anyone know why Or think why that might happen Why would your data not be affected Or think that maybe theirs was a fluke And your data should have been affected by diluting it with water Alright Joey Is it because the HCL only reacts with the milk of magnesia So it doesn t affect how much water because it doesn t react with water Okay what do you guys think Alright Katie I think it will affect it because the concentration s higher and the milk of magnesia by itself is more dense so there s less surface area I would say Okay less surface area Okay that s a possibility Alright Gabriel I think it wouldn t affect the amount of HCL that would be added but it will just affect the time because with water it will take longer for the reaction to take place because there s more volume and without diluting it their group just made it straight up so it would be faster for the reactants to go back to pink and then at the end it will just turn clear either way Why do you think it would be faster if they didn t dilute it Because there would be less volume and the smaller the spaces the molecules will react faster and have less room to move around Okay reasonable yep So our group kind of did both We had a control we redid the same experiment for number one and then we measured how many milliliters of HCL it took so if you change the concentration it does affect the amount of HCL it takes to neutralize it Alright Michael We diluted it and it took longer for us to we added more HCL for it to neutralize and I feel like if you dilute the milk of magnesia there would be less molarity and if it s not diluted it would be a stronger weak base than if it was diluted It would become weaker You can t change the strength of an acid or a base because it s based on what it s by definition You can t make a strong base weak but that s okay Wintel In our case we did two solutions different concentration The amount of HCL that s needed to neutralize the solution shouldn t be should be the same but in this case the time delay causes the solution with low concentration to take more HCL because during the delay the reaction the HCL hasn t still reacted with milk of magnesia yet and because of that delay there s more HCL that s needed to compensate for that Okay so there s a little bit of stoichiometry going on where the number of moles or the amount the amount s still the same regardless of whether of milk of magnesia regardless of whether or not you added distilled water or you didn t So the amount s still the same 
 Tyler pushed the ball Okay well how does that how does that affect the ball It makes it go faster And make it fall So why is that a problem Because she ran because she because she pushed it I know but why is it a problem that she pushed it Because it goes faster And that s a problem because Because why She didn t win Oh what do you mean win She win the game Oh did you all make a game out of it Uh uh we didn t turn a game into it Okay well what are you doing then He s playing a game what are you doing Kylie He s rolling and see not playing a game Just rolling and seeing where they go Wait a minute what Rolling them to see what How many sticks it takes So did you push all of them or are you all taking turns doing each one Taking turns Oh okay So do you think that to find out really how far they go everyone either needs to push them or everyone needs to not push them Not push them So is that what you re saying it wouldn t be fair if she pushes hers but no one else pushes theirs Because pushing makes it go faster you said Okay Alright so it makes it what Makes it go farther okay Alright so do you wanna do you want was anybody else pushing theirs Rebekah Okay do you want Rebekah and Kylie to do theirs over again Alright show them how you and Todd did yours so that everybody can do theirs the same Now I guess I m gonna have to get our ball I need ball number two We need a Captain Miss Henderson can I be the Captain We don t need a Captain You re all doing what you re being what We re not being Captain s we re being what Scientists Scientists So work together Wait don t pick up her ball She hasn t measured it yet Five six seven eight nine 10 11 21 sticks Where is 21 You looking for it on the hundreds chart Are you looking for it on the calendar You can get up and point to it I got 18 sticks for my ball I can t find it anywhere 18 sticks I m going to see how many sticks I got for my ball Okay how would you find 21 on the chart I don t know Where could you start By one Okay 20 Oh you found it Do you need more sticks honey 17 yes Okay go ask another group can you borrow some sticks Another ball 12 So it takes half of 14 Because she said No I m using it And she and I said I have a idea and she said no What was your idea John I was just trying do it on my head like on my back of my head then down Use your head as a ramp Uh huh And where did you have the ball hun In her pocket the whole time Why Em Does the ball belong to you or to the group Group So if you re not using it should you let someone else in the group use it Okay go ahead Roll it on my back And now roll it If it does it Right here No I mean like right here Where do you want them to where do you want them to start the ball I think is what they re asking In my head somewhere like right here Because a ramp starts where On the top Up high And goes down So if you re using his head I would lay like this Oh Did that work Yeah What do we do with it after we do our balls Okay you can just keep experimenting with the balls and the ramps and we re gonna clean up in just a second Put your name at the top of your paper please We used it on this one You re supposed to do all four of the balls Ball number one ball number two ball number three ball number four We would do ball number three Number one is this one How about number one But this one Which number is that one So get number three we ll have a race and we ll So what are you all doing with the ramp now We re putting it on the chair And whoever gets it whoever gets down to the bottom first We were actually gonna roll off it Well why won t it roll off that ramp Because why What stops it The block The block stops it okay So How much does it go Try the little one Whoever is in front of me move I got 10 Miss Henderson everybody is taking our balls Okay guys I would like for you to clean up your things please I saw some great science learning science work put everything back in your basket and then please meet me on the rug Put your paper at your seat Quickly Let s see how quickly we can clean up Id like for you to come to the rug and share some things you ve learned John you have to put everything back in your basket buddy All the sticks and balls please And then you may put your basket on the art table Thank you to everybody who s moving quickly Thank you to everybody who s moving quickly Okay let s come to the rug and let s share some things that you learned today Move that way please I said put your paper at your seat for now Miss Henderson Braxton said this isn t whistling Okay well we re not gonna debate whistling right now Okay thanks so much for everybody coming back to the rug Okay I would like to know who learned something about balls or ramps or forces in your science work today Tell us something you did something you figured out Bryson If you push the ball it goes farther If you don t push the ball it goes not farther Okay alright Who else learned something else through their science work John That when you put like a stick in front of it and then you put another ball in front of it and then like you roll the ball and see how much it goes And then you try another ball and see like if it gets to the stick and if it doesn t get to the stick then it gets farther and and we tried whoever gets to the stick It goes it s the same height then we just rolled it and then the green ball got the farthest Okay the green okay Todd what s something you learned today through your science work If you push it it ll go farther and that s it Okay alright anything else we haven t mentioned Eli There s a block in front of it and if you move the block a little it it will go past it If you make a ball if you make a block go all the way across it and you have a big ball it might bounce across it or it might stop So the block stopped it sometimes Yes Sometimes the ball was going fast enough to jump over it Yeah But sometimes it stopped it Okay Grayson Well sometimes what I did was I kinda put the ramp like that and a little block across and then I was rolling this big ball and once it hit it it kinda like jumped up in the air and went Harleigh And moved in And for like three blocks for three sticks Okay Preston what did you learn today If you like if your hand go fast the ball goes fast If your hand goes slow the ball goes slow If your hand goes fast what do you mean by if your hand goes fast Like if you re at the bottom and and you do that And go like that it goes fast What is that called that you re doing Pushing the thing So if you push the ball fast it goes fast and if you push it slow it goes slow The force Interesting The force of pushing okay Chloe I learned that when you lay it diagonal it goes When you lay what diagonal What is it called again What A diagonal line When you lay it down diagonal it goes down faster What is she talking about Eli the what She s talking about a ramp Oh the ramp when you lay the ramp diagonal Uh huh The ball goes fast When you lay it straight it doesn t go fast it just sits there Oh so if it s if it s less If it s a lower ramp it goes less If it s a higher diagonal ramp you re talking about then it goes farther Interesting Brody We tried it with our heads like down and the ball goes down like that So you made you made ramps with your bodies So did it go 
 So these two are gonna combine and make six X squared Yes Okay and then what about this guy Just bring him down Alright what about her You can bring her down Okay That s a four X to the fourth not four X squared Ah thank you Four X to the fourth And is this term positive or negative Positive And what about this term Positive And what do we call this guy Rock on okay good good good Alright easy one you ready Three X times X squared plus four X minus two And this time we re multiplying what kind of monomial is that Linear Linear good Times a quadratic what Trinomial Trinomial awesome Go ahead and distribute that and see what you get When you think you have an answer do you wanna show it to the person next to you and see if you agree or disagree with each other Alright alrighty So Any exciting disagreements No Nothing No one differs from anyone else No Larry Thayer He just forgot to write his down Okay but now you re cool So everybody either feels like they got the same thing or they fixed what thought they had Alright that s boring Okay so what do get when you your first product done Three X cubed Alright and then 12 X squared And then Six X And then Nothing it s simplified It s done Okay So we ended up with a cubic trinomial Now here s what I wanna show you Somethin a little different because what s the raise your hand if you can tell me the verb we did here Cubic We been talkin the verb Distributed We distributed and we also what Simplified Which one s right They re both we simplified and we used distributing in order to simplify Okay so I m gonna put a verb up here And I ll even put distribute because that s specifically what we did Now here s what I m gonna do I m gonna give you a different thing I m gonna give you this I m gonna give you four A cubed plus two A squared minus 10 A And I m gonna spice this up just a little bit I m sorry about that change that 10 A to a 40 A Alright It s already simplified It s already simplified okay So I can t give you simplify for a verb I m gonna give you a different verb Now there s a better word than what I m about to put up here This isn t really a math word we re gonna replace it with a better one very shortly And here s a clue Undistributed How do you undistribute Let s shove this expression that you said s already simplified in a time machine Imagine you got like a have you guys ever seen like fast feed photography where there s a seed And it s like they speed up the footage and you see the seed germinate and you see the little stem grow and it s kind of all jerky and everything Okay can you imagine playing that backwards and you have a little sprout and it goes back in and it ends up as a little seed Right Imagine that this was on the page as a final answer and we put it in backwards to see how it might have started as a math problem Do you use the You can do that Do you use like the factor tree Say that a little louder Alec Do you use the factor trees Alec that s interesting that you asked Alec is asking about our warm up problem today which was a throw back to when you guys were in elementary school and you talked about things called factor trees And with factor trees we talk about how you can take a number and use a sledgehammer and kind of bust it up into it s what To it s factors To its factors and we keep goin until we can t do it anymore right Huh The deal with that is you have to figure out what was originally inside and outside of the parentheses You just gotta kinda ignore the A I guess Even ignoring the A like I don t know if putting it in a facts tree you really put it into parentheses Cause you don t really have a whole lot to work with there to put it back into parentheses I don t know It s kinda going against every fiber of my being and Like why would you make a math problem out of a perfectly nice number Yeah Okay that s interesting we ll come back to that cuz that s a really good point Why would you take like a 12 and turn it into a math problem what good does that do Yeah what good is that We ll come back to that that s an excellent question With big answers Yes sir what do you think I forgot what I was gonna say Ya sure Lauren what d ya think Isn t this kinda like checking it Lauren just said something interesting She said Isn t it kinda like checking it So when you check an equation for example what do you do Put it back in So when you solve an equation it s kinda like tying a knot And then when you put it in put in the solution and you check it it s kinda like untying the knot to see if comes out the same way But we don t have an equation to plug those into You re right Carolyn what were you gonna say Okay so you know how yesterday I know this is kind of off subject but I That s okay You know how yesterday like you showed us this problem on our worksheet and it was like three times the binomial or whatever When you said we were gonna do those today Can you be specific with the problem so I know what exactly It was number 50 on Oh oh you mean the problems that look like this Yeah the ones that we said we ve already done but we really haven t Like this And you guys wanted to make this what did you wanna make this X squared oh it feels so right doesn t it We ll come back to that in a second That is sort of related to this What were you gonna say Zach and then we ll take a closer look I was just gonna say couldn t there be different like when you unsimplify that couldn t there be different answers Or is there only one correct answer Can someone restate what he s sayin here Or what do you think he means by that Sam what do you think he means by that I think he means that when like you unsimplify it it can be with the two parentheses or it can be with one parentheses and the term in front of it So you re sayin maybe it s like this and there s something here Or maybe it s like this Yeah Cause this looks I ll tell you this looks an awful lot like the answer we got here And this didn t start off with a number that was distributed necessarily like this one It started off like this didn t it How do you figure out how to throw it backwards Cause that s just like You know what let s start with the easier one Which one of those is less complicated the blue one or the orange one The blue one I d agree let s start with this way and then maybe we can go up to the orange So if I wanted to again this is not a math term we re gonna use a better term in a little bit If I were to quote undistribute or use a vacuum cleaner to suck something out of all three of these terms would you agree that it has to be the same thing that we suck out of each one In other words can I pull a four out of this and an eight out of this yeah Okay Any suggestions Let s just focus on the coefficients any suggestions on what I can pull out A two A two okay Anything else Four Can I pull a four let s go door to door Can he give me a four Can he give me a four Can she So if there was a four out there I would have to think what was in there to distribute a four two to make two I m gonna avoid fractions here Yeah see he s avoiding fractions I could I could technically pull out anything But with the factor tree we did at the beginning of class typically when you talk about that s a good point When we talk about factors we stick with whole numbers Okay Or maybe even integers but we usually don t go into fractions Sam what re you thinkin To unsimplify it couldn t you put in one of those boxes that we did yesterday for the terms Like put it in the middle and then find what it is Oh yeah Why you re talkin when we were doing this And then ask ourselves what would go here that s a weird question mark What would there and what would go there That s interesting Alec what are you thinking Couldn t you take out an A with that two Like on the problem Since it all has A s If you can take out a can you put out an A like you took out the two Can he give up an A Yes Can he give up an A Yes She give up an A Yes Well let s try that let s try that that s interesting So if I were to quote and again we re not gonna use this word much after the next Would you if you were to quote undistribute a two A from four A cubed what would that look like What would have to be here It would have to be a two A squared Well okay let s keep goin and then we ll check to see if this makes sense I ll get your question in one second Caroline So then what would be next So the two from the two would leave a ghost one And then the A from the A squared would be a what Oscar I was thinkin one A One A alright I d like that And then the two A from the negative 40 A would be a what Negative 20 Negative 20 A So now we re back to what Justin said We ve taken a perfectly nice simplified polynomial and turned it into a math problem Let s see if this is even right What do you think we could do to check ourselves like Lauren suggested Do the problem What do you mean do the problem Simplified Okay so let s simplify it real quick What s two A times two A and no peeking Four A squared What s two A times two A cubed I mean squared Four A cubed good And what s two A times A That s two A squared What kind Positive two A squared And two A times negative 20 Negative 40 A Oh it worked Yeah I have a question Yes ma am What exactly is the point of this That s an excellent question Shhhhhh ready Why on earth would you do such a horrible rotten thing Well one day shhhh One day what if you had this beast Holy Cow Whoa Do you guys know where to start No I don t know But check this out Didn t you just say we could take this and turn it That s the same thing we had right So can I factor that and turn that into two A times two A squared plus A minus 20 Are you cool with that Are you okay if I just leave the bottom Two A squared plus A minus 20 Anybody have an idea what might happen now Did you guys know that you ve been doin that since the fourth grade No Yes you have Just with much less obnoxious numbers What does 16 32 what does that let me use another What does that simplify to Here s why you guys probably already knew this Let s leave the 16 alone and isn t 32 two times 16 Yeah Ohhh That s the math That s the math that justifies simplifying fractions like you ve been doin since you were like eight years old That s cool What other occasion this is gonna be helpful How do you undo plus or adding when you re solving equations Subtraction Subtraction you call in the opposite right How do you undo multiplication You divide Divide well here s what we re leading up to How are you gonna undo the squared Factoring busts up the squared for us And it s gonna be a very important tool when we re solving what kind of equations do you think we can call these Think about it Look at the degree Oh quadratic Quadratic equations Alright let s take a look at another one Let me have you undistribute one again We need a better word for this Did we call this unmulltiplying No What did we call the verb here what was the verb on this Division
