 Does everyone agree on the first question Yeah What did you all agree on That it wasn t really fair for For First and Second Class to go through without any problems and the people from the Steerage had to go through examinations and this whole long hassle And why was that Why did people who were First and Second Class just get to come right on in and not have to go through examinations Cause of the money What about the money Because they thought that they had they were perfect They had no disease They had lots of money and thought they would work hard So the stereotype is what That rich people are more can work harder or have less chance of disease than the people in Steerage Do you think that that stereotype is still true today Or do you think it s not true anymore It was just for First and Second Class passengers for Steerage passengers before emigrating Well it s kind of like this It s not over the top but it s just a little bit What do you guys think about what Eric said I agree with him Why It s not fair because First and Second Class usually are kings or royalty and so if you re in Steerage you re just a normal person If you re in Steerage it s not going to be fair You have to go walk through that and Well First and Second Class Passengers they weren t necessarily royalty they were just people who had a lot of money People who had enough money to buy those tickets which they were really expensive What do you guys think about what Eric said That the stereotype today is still here but not really Just kind of back and forth It s back and forth They don t do the same thing anymore Who s they And what s the same thing The American Embassy The people that take care of the immigrants and everything and all about them They don t go to Ellis Island anymore They don t go to Ellis Island anymore You have to go on a plane or you have to drive here But do you think the stereotype in general that rich people are better or they don t have diseases and they re just better than people who don t have a lot of money Do you think we still have those stereotypes today Sometimes Sometimes Have you seen it ever No No but you just think it s still there I haven t really seen it at all Yeah I agree with Okay You can start the next one Hold on Josh did you have something else to add Yeah On TV shows sometimes they have rich people in huge carriages with horses sometimes And they re usually pretty snotty And how do you know they re snotty They re always like Don t touch that It s going to fall and you re going to pay for that Oh okay So you do see in TV sometimes Yeah All right Do you think immigrants were treated fairly at Ellis Island Why or why not I don t think they were treated very fairly because they had to go through I agree with Jacob because sometimes people just sent them back at Ellis Island but some doctors at least tried to keep us here to help us be better until we got to stay in America Yeah and that was good that the doctors are supposed to check them and see if they were okay Some of the doctors two people could have the same diseases but both the doctors one doctor could send one person home and one person could stay at Ellis Island which is unfair Possibly because of their religion or the way their language I think they were mostly I think they were mostly yeah So they were mostly treated well but sometimes not Sometimes not Yeah The doctors or the inspectors might think that one person can stay because of their religion or their language and others might have to be sent back And remember the book that we read It kind of said that the cousin he had to be sent back to well he almost had to be sent back to his country because To Russia Yeah to Russia because he had a scratch and they thought it was infected His father was trying to tell him but they didn t listen Yeah He didn t I think they should have translators with all of them so then it would make it fair That spoke English and that language That language So they can understand things So I would say mostly Yeah Mostly So should we check them both off I think we should check off the first one If they were sick or something or if they needed food they had places where they could get food Or if they were sick and had to go to the hospital like Sophia said So I m in the middle Kind of Because sometimes they were treated badly I agree with Josh because if they were sick they would probably be treated less fairly because they were sick and had their diseases Like Oh Get away from me because you re going to spread that disease to everybody It s going to be an epidemic I want to add if they were sick they could have been contagious and there were a lot of people at Ellis Island so they might have Usually if they were at a hospital they were curing curable diseases because if they couldn t cure it they didn t have a medicine or anything to cure that they got sent back Yeah I agree with Eric and Sophia Go ahead Were you going to say something I was going to say if we all agree on this So your general feeling here is were they treated fairly at Ellis Island They weren t treated not very fairly Like they were treated half the fair that they should have been but they weren t treated really good They were fed very well and all their needs were there but they weren t treated very good like if you were on an airplane in First Class It s kind of like I would like to add they were treated way better in Ellis Island because on the ship in Steerage they didn t have good food They couldn t really bathe and it was all crowded They didn t really have a good place to sleep but in Ellis Island they actually had okay food They weren t treated like Do you think that it was fair that they each had to have 20 on them in order to stay Yeah Sort of Sort of What I think is they need to take care of themselves and America is actually bringing lots of them over here America just could say Stop No more immigrants at all but they ve been letting people in A lot of people in and they ve been very generous by giving them food and letting them live here in this wonderful country So they ve provided enough I have something I have two things to say I agree with Sophia because I sort of agree with Sophia because if they didn t have 20 they wouldn t have much to live and the government is not really responsible for the immigrants They re responsible for themselves They re on their own and I would like to say is that going back to Sophia s It said that then they were fed well and that they were All wanted to get to America and even if some of them had money how do you know that they didn t have a disease or something How do you know if they didn t have lice or something I kind of agree with you because if they paid more I think they shouldn t get a lot a lot more but I think they should get a little bit more but they still should go to Ellis Island Yeah Sometimes they did have doctors who came on the ships and kind of gave the medical exams to First and Second Class Passengers to make sure they didn t have any diseases And then if their medical exams checked out fine then they could skip everything else So they didn t have to get asked all those questions and they didn t have to wait in all those long lines and things like that So what do you think about that I think it s still unfair that they didn t have to wait in long lines just because they were already examined on the boat I think instead of Ellis Island they should have checked them before they got on the boat for everyone Yeah I agree with you I think they got all seasick Think that s where they all got sick Yeah Like in the Steerage Some of them got sick because they were in Steerage and then when they got to Ellis Island they had to get sent back The reason why some of them got sick was because they didn t have fresh air and so they couldn t breathe that well Stuffy in Steerage I think all doctors should have been actually fair instead of sending some immigrants back just because they don t like them for their religion and stuff Could doctors send people back because they didn t like their religion Doctors could send people back why Doctors couldn t send people back but they would mark letters on your back Why could they mark letters on your back Because they probably thought they probably saw something different when it was actually a scratch So just if you were hurt and then they had to go through further medical exams to see but doctors couldn t just say I don t like you You have to go back They were just examining you to make sure you didn t have a contagious disease that could get other people sick When we were reading they said something about the doctors where they didn t have any diseases or anything but they d still send them back And you read that in the book We were reading one of the things Oh and why would they send them back Why would they get sent back by the legal inspectors and other people Sometimes it was like there were random reasons they sent them Just because Yeah That s not fair That s what you re saying Yeah I d also change the part where they had to why did they have to mark stuff on their own clothes Yeah I mean they should have given a sheet or something Or something Because what if that s the only thing they had You know I think they should mark on their skin or something so then you could just wash it off Like a marker or something No I don t think they should do it on the skin because then if there was a water fountain they could just wash it off and say I m in this line Right True They could They could do that We all agree they should do something other than your own clothes They should give you a sheet of paper and You could rip it apart I think that they way they did it for example that guy in the book did his jacket inside out They should have been kind of more smart about what they gave them Because someone could just say Take this jacket inside out and then go into the other line Or he could just put his jacket on tomorrow Yeah Oh I don t have a jacket Yeah Yeah If we didn t have Ellis Island not as many immigrants would be here probably because it d be a lot harder And Ellis Island they fed you food It was good I like it I agree with Josh because they gave you food and water a place to sleep They built stuff and made kinder cares and made stuff with the little kids and stuff for the grown ups The people that were there at Ellis Island didn t even have to pay for any of that That was all for free I mean imagine that happening to us right now That will never happen I definitely agree with Sophia because if you just come to Ellis Island and they just give you potato soup every meal it s kind of like they don t get a good impression of America I think they try to give a good impression for the immigrants on America from giving them good food and a good way to start their time in America and then they realize how complicated it is Yeah According to everyone I kind of agree It was good I think 
 Inner circle number two Again this was a question that was asked in a multitude of ways and this is where we re going with this Why did the accident happen The accident of May 10th 1996 Why did it happen Any questions Yes the May 10th 1996 thank you for clarifying where everybody died well not everybody but a lot of people died Why did it happen Because Okay so I think the reason the accident happened was maybe those people just weren t prepared for for the climb They thought it was going to be they re just going to go up with a guide and some other people they were just going to go to the top and come back down and it was gonna be an easy thing and they didn t expect the challenges that they were going to face I agree They probably thought it was gonna be a walk in the park Turns out that they weren t ready and it was no cake walk and it turned out that some of them it was their last day on the mountain You were talking about they weren t prepared and all that But they also said that the guide had never been through a storm like that and that that wasn t normal And I was kind of taken aback by that because I was like if there s a guide who s going to be guiding me on a life threatening thing I would want them to be seasoned trainer you know Exactly I would think the same thing That the guide should be prepared for that kind of storm unlike how he was and it turned out fatally for the rest of the crew I agree with all of you but during reading the article Krakauer also mentioned that he said that it wasn t really anyone s fault because people were so not in their right minds They were tired and injuries and how thin the air was they couldn t breath very well So when they looked at the sky and saw the storm coming they didn t expect it to be as bas as it was so nobody could really prevent it Anything to add to that I agree and I think that they were just having so much fun that they weren t really paying attention I think that they would ve all been prepared if they had been watching the clouds I know you mentioned the clouds but why weren t they watching them Why do you think they weren t watching them they didn t think that they were actually serious enough to actually I agree with Matt that they were so they wanted to get to the top so much they weren t too worried about looking at the clouds Oh okay we can make it back up and make it back down maybe before Not expecting trouble along the way Yeah I agree I think that they weren t really prepared They were too wrapped up in what was going on to think about the downfall and what was happening They re tired and probably weak they didn t have safe they weren t really all there to think about what are the consequences of this and what would happen Like the guide if it were me I would have made sure they had this that you re gonna help me out more than not really being able to Anything you wanna say Krystin Well I said that this quote at the top it says that Ambition has a steep price And I think part of like how you guys were talking about how like the guides weren t too prepared and weren t qualified but I think that well and the author mentions this too that climbing this mountian is it s taking a risk and your ambition for going up this mountain already when you re putting your life on the line there s nothing really anybody can do to tell you the qualifications that you have to have to survive it s just basically putting your life to chance and so that s what I really got out of it what do you think I agree I think that then not as many people would ve died They should just listen to what they re told and and not risk their lives to do something that I agree with that No but I think that what Krystin said makes a lot of sense that people were just too tired and I agree but I think it s understandable because just the thought of climbing the biggest mountain in the world is extremely cool and I would definitely want to go up there soon as possible and not worry about the weather like go all in or don t go at all I agree with lost or injured I mean but I m like half way there go ahead and accomplish what I set out to do and I think that would ve caused anybody to not really notice the weather and the risks involved in what we re doing I agree with what Ellie said a little while ago heard they should have turned around but they probably thought that this was going to be probably what could have been a once in a lifetime chance to be at Mount Everest I mean it says that they caught about safely but they should have have taken it more serious and not kept going risking their life One thing I noticed is that they relied a lot on each other but they didn t go back and check themselves and I didn t understand why they didn t go back and and like when the one guy says there s no oxygen here there s no full tanks Why didn t they go back and check that themselves I mean I would trust that person but yet again if my life on the line I would be checking it Does anyone else think the same way If my life were at risk I wouldn t be relying too much on other If my life were at risk I wouldn t be relying too much on other people I d be a little weary about something like that I don t so much disagree but I came up with something a little bit different I didn t really think that people relied on each other that much at all Who knows if all the deaths that happened could have been prevented but people were too tired or too injured or there was always something and everybody was more concerned about getting themselves down the mountain In a way I would say that it was selfish mission but in another way I mean if it was my own life I would be out for myself rather than trying to help somebody else and I think we saw that at least I saw that a lot happen throughout the story It s a choice between am I going to help that person and risk my life and they might not really pull through this does it matter Or am I going to get down this mountain and survive Some people were relying on others like at the end someone was trying to help was trying to help he tried to help her down she grabbed his arm and he tried to pull her down But she just let go and died I agree with Erin too I mean I think that right now wouldn t be able to You would think about yourself more Whenever you re out there and and you re with the same people for that long of a time and you re doing the same thing that you become sort of closer They would mean more to you then than they do right now You d be more willing to sacrifice something to survive to help them give them another chance to get out alive too That s definitely shown at the end of the article when he s talking about how he can t live a day without thinking about the lives of those people that he was so close to that were lost and how he couldn t even come to grips with their deaths for a very long time I agree with Erin I think there was a lot of at the end I think he was talking about the there was a lot of blame involved and why couldn t we prevent this and it brings me back to what you guys said I think they really wanted to help each other and I think that they wanted to do something but there was nothing that could be done in some cases I thought it was kind of sad actually dealing with that kind of grief where you couldn t prevent someone s terrible death Tyler what do you think about this Like did he grieve or even just the fact that who they were relying on Well what strikes me All right outer circle what d you notice What d you notice I noticed that people were and books and just kind of in inner circle and I felt that that really helped them to get the instructions Okay Blake what did you notice I just thought that it was more and more like Erin really led the conversation and Krystin really led the conversation and I think that those were like the two main ones but like Levi and Elliot and Alex they all also communicated a lot but there wasn t just one person who was talking Okay so there were definitely two leaders but there were other people that were contributing as they went along Okay good Anthony There were some well developed conversations Well developed conversations what do you mean by that Like Erin would say something and someone would build on it then someone else would and then another topic and new questions and another topic Yeah did you notice what was the question they started with Yeah we got a little off topic No you didn t What what was the question you started with What caused the disaster And then you went into something totally different but did you have good conversation about that Absolutely You guys really started focusing in on that life and death and relying on somebody else for your own life Okay I really like how I mean it wasn t like you were talking about cookies and then all of a sudden you were talking about climbing Mount Everest It was definitely very connected to what you were saying Dorothy what d you notice I noticed the conversation just kept going and it didn t stop or anything it just kept going from one thing to another Right it kept bouncing from one thing to another You could see like steam coming out of your ears they were all impulsive Blake I thought that also remember Erin said you re relying on someone and Krystin s like well I don t agree backed up Erin and other people backed up Krystin and there was people who didn t Yeah Is it okay to disagree with the people that are sitting around you Absolutely But you need to do it respectfully Like Krystin did Krystin said I don t exactly agree with you Erin then she proceeded to say Why And Levi was over here he was nodding his head and shaking yeah All right great I thought they did a good job of not having any dramatic pauses they always had something someone would pass on to someone else They paused occasionally but it was not pregnated pauses You guys ever heard that before It wasn t a pregnant pause it wasn t a big spacey gap okay Anthony Pretty much everyone talked Pretty much everyone talked Yeah pretty much Yeah did you notice that They built on to what other people were saying okay They agreed I still heard I agree a lot but then they told us why they agree with what they said All right Anything else you guys noticed Yes I think that we looked at our more because they had wider subject that they talked about Eventually it became narrowed down that is was kind of like you have to look for specific details It wasn t the whole story it was more like a paragraph or two and so you need specifics to deal with that All right Anything else 
 Are you gonna have any angles in there that add to 90 No so you won t have any complementary to worry about Is that supplementary though You will have supplementary Right You re not gonna have to worry about the outside You re just gonna look at your inside When you measure your angles you ll be able to see supplementary Yeah Then kinda go back to those parallel lines cut by a transversal rules to explain why We re supposed to draw a line Well I want you to see what s congruent sides Now you dont have to measure all your sides because have these so you ve got the same colors so they re all the same You re don t have to do angles Kinda figure out OK So they re all 90 degrees One of yours looks 90 So you know they re 90s So you got for the outside of your figure you got some a little bit easier work Yeah OK so you need to explain why things are 90 and what are congruent And then you re gonna get a lot more new stuff when you redraw and draw your diagonals in there Then you ll actually have to measure your diagonals and your angles So you know a lot about a square to start with Yeah the equal sides have to be congruent and certain sides so write that Then measure those angles and segments and see if you can t find some more rules that go with a square Oh OK So yes your first set of rules for the first page from here you know a lot You know that any point and what they are You know you have equal sides Then you don t have to measure these sides because you used the same color So you can explain it using the colors So you got a lot you know from the first part But then when you draw your diagonals here you re gonna have to measure your pieces See what happens to these angles See what happens to these diagonals And then see if you can t come up with some rules You re main part here you know a lot But now when we do this this will some of the new OK Square is the last one that we teach So you will be the last group up there today Right we re trying to get these rules today You can kinda build upon them so when you hear what these other groups are doing when you get up there Yeah There s just three of you OK How you doing Good What do you notice about some of these Corresponding is what I got here down here These are supplementary Supplementary because they re what type of angles Help him respond Well there are options focus on one If we were to look at If I was continuing these lines here they re gonna be same side interior Obviously yes so they re not quite supplementary So you might need to go back and do it again Sammy knows they need to be supplementary Same side interior Somehow your measurements didn t get there So go back and try to remeasure You realize you wrote the error That s good so you re using some of that previous knowledge and realizing your error Yeah so you need what we did on that worksheet the other day When you measured between 110 and 120 you read the wrong way You read 122 when it s going this way it s 118 So what you did is you read this way when you re going this way You said 122 when it s between 120 and 110 At least your teammates knew that we needed supplementary and worked it You said it was only off by one degree Any amount Then again to then explain your rules now what s congruent what s supplementary and then explain why like you were saying same side interior that s what you ll have Yes Do you have Chester Marlin Yes I do Please send him to the office OK What you did was perfect Because they re same side interior So you would say this Would you say equal angle one and angle four That d be fine because you can go ahead and when you re teaching it you can label those angles and that would be a really good way to do it So it s like angle one and angle four are same side interior Same side interior so that has to equal 180 OK bisectors are gonna come when you cut diagonals in there Your second page when you redraw the figure You re gonna draw the diagonals you re gonna see your diagonals cut each other you re gonna see if your diagonals cut your angles in half I ll be to Ashley then at Brandon s group in just a minute So make sure your congruent sides You don t have to measure your sides if you use your colors you can use colors to explain it So yeah you re exactly on the right track Here we re just gonna draw the same figure draw those diagonals in there and then we got a little bit some more things You might see bisectors you might not Some figures you do and some you don t All right OK it s up to you I love the way you put your letters there So you re getting really good with your letters You can say Since you only have one angle at each letter you can say angle J or angle H however you want to do that Could we just put supplementary and draw a little diagonal like that That d be fine Actually do all these and you ve got your congruent and your angles then you re gonna redraw the same thing over here put your diagonals in and measure again When you put diagonals in you might see some that bisect the angles or bisect segments You might not but that s what you re looking for So this is gonna be Well the diagonals We re not gonna draw one of them Oh we re not No we re just gonna look at our diagonals Otherwise you re breaking it into two other figures And that s a possibility but you don t have to I love the way that you ve lettered it here You re using those correct terms that ll be really good as you go up there All right Brandon What all did we mess up so far Let s see Well it s a four sided figure What should a four sided figure add up to 360 360 Does it No it s a little more than 360 So you might need to change things a little bit to remeasure it and one of your rules could be you know that they have to add to 360 There s some that I see really right away that s good It s like 370 OK so you re gonna try to make it work You know you need to make it work You know it s gotta be 360 so measure it a little bit better Can we just add one here and add two there Well go ahead and look to see what your actual angles are But one good thing you see you see that these angles are the same which is something you re supposed to come up with which is good Now if I was giving this when you re up there explaining it you need a way to explain and I know you said that the two obtuse angles are congruent and in your picture that s good But sometimes let s think for a minute If I gave you Write them out Yeah it may always be the obtuse angle So here yeah that s what I was thinking If you were to do it this way the angles that are congruent aren t necessarily the obtuse ones So what you ve found is good but in your picture it is the obtuse ones but if you can see as you move that it doesn t have to be the obtuse ones Let s look at a way we can describe You re saying that these two angles are congruent which is correct so instead of saying obtuse how can I explain that these two and not those two What s the difference between these two angles and those two angles They re 45 degrees Well it didn t have to be It could be 45 it looks 45 if I was to do this it s not It s the short side s angles It s where your short sides meet your long sides So the angles with the non congruent sides Or the short sides meet the long angles that would be perfect That would be a little better to explain it And even when you re up there explaining a good thing to do would be to move your figure to show how it didn t have to be And normally it s the bigger angles but it doesn t have to be Draw diagonals That s right and you re gonna look for all the angles again When you draw your diagonals a lot of times you re gonna see bisectors like segments might bisect each other they might bisect angles they might or they might not So that s what you re looking for when you do that And then you re gonna kind of come up to We just draw them like this Just like that that s right Then you ll measure all of those angles and all of those segments We won t be able to use the color to show congruent when we draw the diagonals on the inside because you won t have a piece that matches correctly for your diagonals so you ll actually have to measure that part with a ruler But again you re not as much concerned with the measurement as bisecting it or something else So that s what you ll do All right I ll be right back Yes So are we supposed to do this You don t need the angles that are out there I mean you could but it s not necessary What should of course our figure add up to The angles inside Uh huh 360 360 So make sure yours do What if they don t So I think if I was to look at your measurements here I know what I did I messed up I wrote these Good perfect that s what I was gonna get to you read the wrong one and didn t notice All right I ll be right back How are you doing So you want to make some general rules So the top and the bottom sides have to be parallel I wouldn t really want to use the words top and bottom because what if you turn it this way Yeah well A and B sides Yeah so you re gonna do that So you ve got your pieces What do you notice about your angles You ve got the angles that are equal but what if I was looking for supplementary Do you have any supplementary angles A and D A and D so you say A and D are supplementary what makes them supplementary What rule do we already know that was why they re supplementary They add up to 180 Right they add up to 180 but Are they same side interior angles Same side interior angles So you can say they re 180 because they re same side interior angles Then what you re gonna do you re gonna go to this page you re gonna draw your figure again but you ve got to draw your diagonals and measure the things When you draw the diagonals what you re really looking for is to see is there anything that cuts in half Do you bisect any angles or bisect any segments Some figures do some figures don t But that s what you re looking for So you re gonna redraw it draw your diagonals then measure you ll have more angles to measure You re actually gonna have to measure your segments because your little angle legs won t match your diagonals correctly You re gonna have to actually do the measurements and see See if the segments are bisected see if the angles are bisected That s kind of what you re gonna come up with It may be it may not be Some of the figures do and some don t OK I think I understand that We draw from angles to angles Yeah from vertex to vertex that s right So make an X in the middle All right you re good Yes I think we have about everything and then I think we have the other vertex Angle bisectors they bisect the angle number five All the triangles are isosceles Wow that s good I didn t think you d get that I m impressed He did it Good job And then diagonals make a perpendicular Perfect what I m gonna do is I m gonna give you another sheet make a bigger square 
 Glue Here we are Compression is really Compression is really getting it Hey guys what ya doin Adding our stuff to this Oh I ve been trying to tell you that this bridge holds one kilogram without breaking A thousand grams Wow That s really good That s probably why you want us to have a railing Uh huh So it doesn t just slide off That s true you do want to keep something on the bridge Well that s very good And we re thinking about it bends a lot so we could do this It s really bendy bendy And you just broke it Don t break it The last time she just dropped it and it splattered all over the place Okay so this is the roadway Yes Okay and then what s going to hold this up We re trying to figure out everything If we get all the pieces and then trying to see what we can do to add it all together Do we have um wait a minute guys we could have one of the railings on the front and the bottom The top and bottom Stick Cause I was thinking we could put this on the bottom Guys like if we had one on the top and bottom like on the movie it would hold it down and up at the same time keeping it flat Hey you know what we could do We could make kind of like a T shape and then bend the top of the stick and then glue it on that way What would you glue that to You say you re bending it into a T shape okay so you d have a T shape Go like Okay Try to bend that Hand me a book we need to put more compression I learned by that idea if I put a book on it it would keep the glue down and it would keep it compressed We need more compression let s get a couple of books Here s another one Also put a kilogram on it Yes you did put a kilogram on it that s true I mean like on there Oh okay So this rail that you have over here that s a truss And as soon as we add this Is that going to be under or above the railway We were deciding to go above Cause it has to have a railing and then below is optional Okay but how is it going to get attached We were trying to figure out that Okay Now we just keep going Okay I will come back and check on you all right Okay give me a couple Popsicle sticks so I can put it underneath Will we put them underneath the thing Oh dang dang dang It s hard because these right here but only two places are touching Oh I see what you mean I don t think it s overlapping because there s the one in between I was just making sure okay Yeah I see what you re saying but I kinda think they work because this is really only touching this and here it touches this one but it s not like it s continuously touching from here to here I was just making sure sheesh you guys Why don t you all tell me more about your bridge Well it s kinda a mix between an arch bridge and just a regular bridge I mean beam bridge Okay can you sit up We re continuing to make our arch but we have run into a problem Okay We decided we re going to put glue on top of here to fill in some of the cracks that we had It would act like cement but we forgot that when glue dries it contracts So the bridge has kind of curled Guys guys Logan we re not in your group we re okay Also I was thinking when we did the arch it might need support under the bottom but the triangle might be a little odd cause it would stand on this end part We could do what we did here Can you get the popsicle stick to be the shape you want it to be Well I was thinking we could just like bend it and put it on that I m going to test this on the weights We need two kilograms if you can get it Now how long is your bridge Have you measured your bridge Our bridge is Are you doing it in metric or in customary We re doing it in customary Customary okay It s 55 cm or 22 inches and 2 cm Okay we re not going to mix measurements It s like 22 and a half inches Okay So if you had 12 is that 12 plus 9 Yeah So 21 and a half maybe Yes Okay You guys I got the two 200 kilogram things so we could Gram I said gram 200 grams It will be heavier than the glue bottle And that way we can use the glue Okay so this is the bridgeway where the cars are going to go The arch is going to be above the roadway No because here you can t fit two cars but it will go smoothly for the rest of it Like we made it so two cars would go right next to each other like we didn t think we could leave the extra space Right but they might take off each other s rear view mirrors Right We ran into that though What could you do about that We don t really know because all of this stuff is dry so far it s holding up quite well Well what if this was only one lane What if you made another one just like it to be the other lane That would be perfect But it would take a good long while No it wouldn t We built this in a couple of days Yeah we could glue it together with like these Yeah okay Perfect Thanks Miss Hoyle All right guys let s start working on that one So are these the same size as these Let s try to make it more even this time Making that is going to take like 50 days We need 50 of these guys right Tell me a little bit about this arch and what it s going to do As you build the arch how is that going to keep your bridge steady Well it s like when the arch gets pulled on it s gonna be secured here so instead of the bridge itself getting the tension it s going to go a little bit like it is now Okay it s going to pull it away A little bit Which means I ve got to get the weight on it So it s going to create the outward thrust Yeah Which with an outward thrust what do you need to have on the sides of the bridge if you have an outward thrust Remember Oh it s uh Abutments do you remember that Yeah You need that something over here to take the force the pressure that s being exerted from the center outward the outward thrust I have a thing with that one it hates me I hate it So have you tried laying your bridge across a 20 inch span Yeah we did it on a desk It caved in a little in the middle but when our arched is finished it ll actually help Tell me why you feel like it caves in in the middle The important thing is what we did was we put glue in between in to act like cement to keep it together Uh huh Well that made it curl a little bit and so it was a little weaker in the middle because that s where it was starting to bend And also partially because it s it s We don t have a lot of support on the bottom which makes the um its tension affected I kind of suggested triangles at the bottom but we haven t really done that yet Yeah that s because we haven t got the arch up yet Oh you mean on the bottom of the bridge Yeah That s a good idea Well we need to start working on it All right well I ll leave you alone and I ll come back and check on you later okay Guys we ve got four of these We need a lot more All right then well let s get going I m going to keep working on the arch okay Wait wait wait that was part of the arch support The first arch needs to get worked on Could you guys make the second road and I ll continue on the arch It needs to get to get built This idea isn t working Maybe we should try to like add this on here so that it doesn t like fall Oh okay And that way the arch will stick to the top and this arch will stick to the bottom Do you girls want to try that Sure sure Also I think it will hold maybe a little better because Nicky it s not all like This is just like that it s still gonna kind of it s still going to kind of stick to this even if we had this idea it d be like that it won t exactly hold that very well Show me how it s going to be touching like this onto there I think yeah well like Like that this way Yeah but like with this on top so like that and then this at the bottom Okay It will hold better now Actually this is the right way here right Yes It s like that okay Yes and then we also figured out um when there s going to be 1000 grams on there it broke in half Oh no This part it kinda snapped It can hold 500 Yeah it can hold 500 It can hold 500 grams Yes and 200 And 200 grams Yes so I don t Oh you tried 700 grams also Yes Okay So that s not bad It kinda snapped here but yeah so um it might be a little more sturdy once we add the like underneath Okay the piers We should add the piers in the middle seriously Well yeah we can add it like side middle and side I feel like we should do it like bang one on that side and one on the other Yeah but it s still with the one on top Yeah Yeah We definitely want it Want it to hold Yeah definitely Yes All right I want to see what s going on over here Right now working on the railing Okay And Molly s doing that by she gluing she s working on the sidewalk right now we re almost done with the railing Okay And what Molly s doing right now is she is we re gluing two popsicle sticks together like this Okay And uh we re going to glue them against here Okay So they can we re probably going to put another popsicle stick like this in the middle so they glue together easily Glue them right here to the side Okay And then we re going to put the railing on the side of this so like on this side like this and then the railing will be on this side so that ll the railing is three inches Brooke said Right So we re almost done with our bridge stuff at this Would it be helpful to work from the bottom to glue the pedestrian bridge would it be helpful to work on it from the bottom Yeah probably would And even though it bends it s bent it s really really strong Uh huh It can hold more than a kilogram Oh that s wonderful Now did you um what kind of force what do we call it when the bridge is bending like that in the middle Um it s compression and tension Tension is pushing it out like this making the sides curl up and then the compression is what makes the bridge Okay so you re going to compensate for that like this So are these your trusses No these are the railings We thought that it would act like a truss Okay Even though we re not going to have one going on the bottom They re going to be on the top It s all going to be on top And you did try laying it across a 20 inch gap We measured it to make sure it s 20 inches Okay good well do want to try measuring a 20 inch gap between a couple of desks and just seeing what it not while it s wet but when it s dry See what it s like What are you doing Molly I m gluing the popsicle sticks together for the start of the sidewalk and then when it s dry I m going to get them to go together like that Okay and then I m going to take my railing How s that going to attach With another popsicle straight up and down attaching the railing to the sidewalk And then just attach the whole thing to the bridge as one piece Okay I was thinking that you guys should take popsicle sticks and put them across the top connecting the two railings together with popsicle sticks at the top Like a covered bridge Yeah So this is for a crab run bridge is that what it s called Yes That s a real bridge that needs to be replaced isn t it Yes And we ve actually figured out what s it s going to be replaced by Oh okay you found it on the internet It s actually it s um a beam bridge But it s not over water it s over rough terrain Okay And it s in Highland County it s way to the It s northwest 
 Can you think of what what images are coming into your head about the Holocaust that relate to this Um people dying in the gas chambers Okay and and how did that happen He convinced other people that they were awful and then that s really the only way you can get people to do something as cruel as that Okay so you re saying Hitler couldn t have carried out all that evil himself so he had to convince other people that basically the Jewish people were what Nothing They were just less than just a lesser race of people You re on a good track I ll check back with you in a second by stepping on another group of people So the other groups would actually help them Like we have to remember that the injustice the injustice is what causes us to want to go and help and restore justice and it s not just injustice anyway you have to want to help and not just sit back and do nothing Well outside people like in Atlanta and Birmingham like in there like in Birmingham were being persecuted while people in Atlanta weren t really doing anything Well I mean look what s happening today I mean we have a volunteer army and people are volunteering and going and trying to stop the injustice in Afghanistan and so that was practically the same thing as what Martin Luther King did for Alabama So you re saying you see a connection in the real world news That sort of our soldiers the fact that they volunteer would be an example for number five Is that what you are saying Yeah Had y all talked about number five yet Uh we were just going in order and seeing which ones that we could And yours is read me your quotation Um Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere Okay good Well you re just being to come up with things Okay go ahead I m just going to Okay so what s the first question Explain the context in which um Martin Luther King said this and how it applies in that situation Okay He doesn t want people to sit back and not do anything about a problem he wants them to go and help and stop It s almost as if their problem is his problem Is his problem Good I like that But even though he wants them to help well he doesn t want them to do it in a violent way Always need to underguard MLK with that don t we And that sort of ties into It s wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends Do you find yourself as you re discussing any one of these the others layer on there Yeah That s why it feels so important to have gotten this whole document as a whole Think you ve gotten enough from them Brianna for that one Yeah I think so Well I guess Clyde s already said that there s already one for the current news Yeah that we could put down So the volunteer soldiers Volunteer army Volunteer army I ll check back with y all good job are they more reluctant to like um listen to the lower class bunnies cause they felt like they had a better rule of it Yeah I think that s it Okay so in Watership Down the higher class rabbits did not want to give up their superior how do you spell that because I think I spelled that before privileges Privileges You know what to be honest with you every time I am typing I let spell check do it because that d and g always messes me up I was spelling superiority Superiority I m sorry Okay so what group have you chosen Colleen and what what Uh privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily and groups tend to be more immoral than individuals And I hear that you re using a Watership Down example which My idea Your idea good for you And what is the um what Warren are we talking about The very first one um Sandleform Sandleform yeah Yeah go ahead and tell me about that Yeah it s like um the higher class rabbits didn t want to give up their privileges of superiority to listen to the lower bunnies Does that make sense to you India That s a good example I really like it Okay have you gotten anything else Um we did the one about the time in history where this quotation applies What was the time in history Bish Um Number two Where this quotation applies is the Holocaust Um during Nazi rule people felt better about discriminating against the Jews because many others were also doing it So what was the privileged group that were reluctant to give up its privileges Um actually I think this one was grouped to be more of an individuals rights Right so the whole group of what The whole group of um Nazis the Nazis and the pretty much anyone that favored Hitler and the Nazis But maybe they wouldn t have carried out those atrocities alone but kind of got into a mob mentality is that kind of where we are with this Yes Good well y all go ahead I m just going to watch a minute So I ll finish writing the Watership Down one the higher class rabbits did not want to give up their superiority to how about admit that some of the lower Number four would be easier to connect to a teenager s life that one actually fits for both of those What does Um for telling a time in a teenager s life um both of these the two parts of the quote would apply because it s like when you re getting like verbally abused it feels much worse coming from a group than it does from an individual So if there s a whole group picking on you then that makes it worse and the privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily So say say someone has a good cafeteria lunch table and someone who s sitting over by the garbage cans wants to move over there so they ask Hey you don t have to sit over at our table but can you move somewhere else so we can sit there just for a day They ll probably say No because they won t think of another place to go besides that table that those other people left And they don t want to go by the garbage cans Nobody wants to I think that s a good connection A good very present day connection Good I ll be back Yes of course Um Allison would you like to I have no clue would it be okay to write about like how people in foreign countries use like the sex trade as an it an I it relationship Certainly Mr Gallant s class We just had to make sure it was all right with you before we started just writing it down That s okay that s okay that seems very real to me Okay fictional things so if it s fictional it doesn t have to be people I didn t say that we could use um what s that Watership Down I said we could use that did I not All right let s see Okay whatever I said we can use Hazel and the Warren for oppressed people that are not But I think we should do Efrafa because the bunnies like revolted and they got free remember Yeah That s what I m thinking I m hearing an argument where both of you think Watership would be a good connection but we re debating which what Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever Which Warren would like be better I think Efrafa Which one did you say Um the first one that came to from what was it called Sandleford Sandleford Okay tell me why you think that Because they were they had freedom but it was like they were just they couldn t do what they wanted all the time They could just do certain things in a certain vicinity They couldn t go out or go anywhere and they were just stuck against their will for that long of a time until they um like revolted against their Warren and left What were you going to add Michael Oh like it was like a routine everyday like it was the same thing they followed like a routine like they went out and then ate and then slept But I think Efrafa is like that except for it s a lot worse like they didn t even get to go out like they got like feeding times and they would have to feed like right here and they d have to go right back into their Warren I think they re both good examples but I think Machi s is more able to be explained by that because they did but in his you know uh uh Hazel and Big Wig and all them broke away and then they went to go search for They eventually got what they wanted In Efrafa they didn t get what they wanted until someone came in to And not everybody in Efrafa got out But not everyone in um Sandleford got out most of them didn t But I mean the group that we re talking about the main But the main characters got out and achieved what they wanted where they wanted Because no one else would listen Let me tell you something the main reason we re doing this is so that these quotations and these philosophies and that kind of thing will inform our later life It doesn t make me sad that you have two examples because when it s a little bit wrong or when it s a lot wrong because when you notice it when it s a little bit wrong sometimes you can keep it from getting a lot wrong so it kind of pleases me that you re seeing it at two different levels so I think use Efrafa and Sandleford and you ll have the best answer Okay Okay what are we working on We are trying to debate whether we should pick Cuba or Egypt as current events for for privileged groups so we can get Well let s hear your arguments Cuba Fidel Castro has been a tyrant for Metaphorically he s about to die He s still in power okay Egypt s been resolved already No Well they re arguing that it s not in the news but it s going on right now Well I think it would be best if we did something that was going on in the news that we ve like talked about in class that s really really really And we all understand it What don t you understand about Cuba though Like there s nothing that s really in the news right now Cuba they still have the same old thing just like every other country that s happened just a little bit worse Here s what I m hearing You have a great example but your group is wanting to go with the Egypt example and it doesn t dis uh disvalue yours because it s important to be able to understand that it can happen over a long time and sometimes when he s talking about apathy when it s happened for a long time people don t less and less and less revolt Okay Could we possibly do Cuba in the history one Oh I think you could Work on that that s a great idea How are we coming Good we re done Good done I think we are finished I want to hear your uh everyday life one All right our for our teenager Yes All right we re saying like if there s a group of popular kids and they re like calling names and putting down a group of the not so popular kids and they re just not treating them like they re normal people too they re just treating them like lesser people Less than human They might they might not pay attention to them also they just In the way you wouldn t necessarily recognize a theme but in a way you would never ignore a human or we would think should never ignore a human being Okay great So I want you as you re looking back over yours make sure that you ve given your reader or your listener enough information My shortest one was like three sentences and there s nothing magic about the number of sentences just check yours because you re a little ahead of everyone else for thoroughness and see if there s any details you could add Okay great How are we coming Um good Pretty much done Awesome awesome You ve got three of the four Which ones did you do Um the tell us a time in history when the quotation applies and the fiction quotation and the teenagers of life And your quotation was Oh we did um it is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends the last temptation is the greatest treason to do the right deed for the wrong reasons Thank y all for choosing that one that s a very hard one And we put And the third one great Now will some body tell me what your fictional one was Um we did why don t you explain this one Isabelle Okay I did Peter Pan Uh huh Cause when Peter Pan he persuades or he offers to take the children to the other place and it sounds wonderful to them but he s doing it for the wrong reasons What reasons do you think he s really doing it To have a mother for the children the lost children And so he s not really thinking of their well being he s thinking of his and the lost boys well being Right What a great connection I m so proud of y all That s awesome And did you do news Uh we did history History what s your historical one Uh we did uh when the Europeans 
 Today is Wednesday Yes I would clone myself Good why Why would you clone yourself Because everybody deserves a second me So you would just And I would clone a woolly mammoth for my clone to ride on Honestly What would some of the negatives to cloning something like that Well it s another me But it s still good because you know I m me and I m good and bad Do you know your clone is not going to be like set right You re gonna have to wait for it to grow up So I have to raise a little baby clone of me Yes And it ll look just like me when I was a baby Pretty much Oh that s wrong Oh my God There are so many possibilities Alright So let s start off with I ll get it a baby Raise your hand if you can remind us like what is cloning There s only one of you Like taking the DNA or like I don t know like whatever out of one person like trying to like duplicate it into another one Okay great We re all well was there only like one type of cloning What were some of the different types Well one type of cloning is only tissues and organs only and another one is let s see animal and livestock cloning Anything else you want to add to that Gady So what s one way they do the cloning So they take the DNA from one animal what do they do Do you remember what parts they used Like what kind of cell they used Nucleus They did take the nucleus And they used The eggs of the other animal Okay it s kind of interesting You can take the egg from one animal and completely change its DNA So now when that turns into a new organism it s an identical copy of the animal that it came from And if you take you can bring back endangered species too Because remember that or whatever then they put in the cow Yeah But they were like related in some kind of way so it wasn t like weird That s true It was probably a decendent Do you guys remember that from the video They had tried to take an animal that was almost extinct in fact they couldn t actually do the tests on the animal Remember they were saying that there were so few of them that they couldn t even do the tests on them Right How long did last Does anyone remember Three days Yeah it was about three days right But it was the first time So when they couldn t open up that cow the cow died right I don t know that for sure but I m guessing that they were not that interested in the cow medically They were Oh no I was just wondering because there s a cow sitting there with a giant gaping hole in its womb That s true That does happen I mean I don t care if the cow died honestly That s another hamburger for me But that Goward That Goward That s swole You can t get any other animal like that Anybody else in here agree that it s okay to do that testing to save endangered species Well yeah because if there s like a hundred million cows and one whatever that thing was called So we should probably try and get more of them Yeah why not Okay We should clone pandas Let s hear somebody else though Is there anybody else that has I said alligator try and bring it back That s true What happens when there s so many I mean how many of you have ever watched the movie Jurassic Park Oh my God I ve seen all of them at least twice So that s a good question So if we can bring back something that looks like a cow fabulous What happens when you want to bring something that looks just as cool but has bigger teeth Well you see it breaks out of the cage like in Jurassic Park the Lost World and it starts attacking all the Great Well yeah it kind of started eating people That was wrong Fabulous but what could be some of the downfalls on that Like any negatives to cloning animals that are endangered or almost extinct Well hardly any of the You need to The DNA might get messed up Yeah but remember that when we re messing around with the DNA yeah maybe there could be a mistake What happens then It could die It could die yes I would say One good thing about bringing dinosaurs back is that you finally get to study them the way we want to That s probably what scientists are thinking Wouldn t that be great if I could study something and actually be able to touch it and see what it does Because a lot of things they tell you about you know dinosaurs is what they think they do Well we think they eat this and We think this is how they lived Wouldn t it be great if we could actually study those What if dinosaurs were never real Well they found skeleton remains so they re pretty much sure they were around They also found Because you can t just stick an animal in an environment and maybe it will survive because it will mess up the chain of life Anthony has a really good point because what s going to happen if we have dinosaurs We can t just stick them somewhere for them to roam around Because they don t have anything they can naturally eat anymore And they don t have any natural predators anymore That s why you just bring back T rexes and velociraptors And what not Then you just feed them cows You don t know if they necessarily eat cows though You don t know that Well it s meat It is meat but that s also your food source Well that s not going to be Maybe eight or nine Maybe 25 for a T Rex You re underestimating the size of some of these animals But the same thing applies to actual animals instead of just dinosaurs What happens if we have animals that are going extinct because we are building new houses and we re expanding our cities So we re moving into some areas where there are some animals and they start to die off because we are taking over their land So yeah we could make a hundred copies of these animals or whether it s plants or birds or certain insects But that is a good question where are they going to live if we just bring them back Wildlife park So that is a good thing And again remember that you all add because if you put them somewhere that a park they won t necessarily survive So you might need to think about all the other stuff that goes with that So yeah the food chain Interesting how everything s connected Raise your hand if you d like to share one of your questions from yesterday We ll start with Anthony Okay so like say me and this lady get married We both can t have kids so they take my DNA and they make a clone of me I m married to this person Would that be only my child or would that be our child And if why Maybe yeah But what if you re married Well does it require two people that has your DNA I m sorry I didn t hear you Maybe it is Maybe it s totally the environment Who s to say Maybe if you raise it and you re like This is our kid Well because of that case then there can t be any more like if we depended on cloning there woudn t be any well there d be less drama in the world because we wouldn t be doing stuff the natural way And like people being knocked up in bars and stuff and random places and stuff and like not knowing their father in life you know But you know what I m saying right Do you think it would be hard Like what if people were 100 dependent on this There would be a lot less problems Eventually if you keep cloning yourself and then your clone cloned itself and your clone clones itself You d have the same group of people You d have the best group ever Yeah but how would you know because you wouldn t be here That s dumb that s what that is That s interesting We can t have just a bunch of the same people That d be one stupid That d be dumb man I don t know Walking around seeing all the same people That s stupid You re not going be like Like the Matrix everything repeating Other questions Let s get one from a female this time We got the guys questions Let s get a girl Don t all shout out all at once Mayra what s one of your questions I said like if they clone a sheep and it s like sick wouldn t it or let s say there s a regular sheep and they clone that wouldn t the clone be sick too What did she say Not necessarily No because it s like you said it s two entire different bodies of life A lot of things can go wrong in one person So how could it just be the same thing two different Unless it s like a problem with an organ that the one had and then Well I want to say that like a disesased kid Maybe What about remember you just did genetics right If it s in your DNA what would happen If it was in your DNA It probably would get it If it was something that it caught it probably wouldn t get it That s true So it depends I guess maybe what it is Right So you have this sheep just cloned it and because it has something very serious with it and if it s genetic then yeah there s probably a chance that that clone would probably have the exact same disorder later on I think they were showing Remember when they were doing Dolly and they showed some of the animals they had cloned I think they were talking about the sheep Dolly and then they had some mice that they had cloned They had said that the animals they had cloned does anyone remember what any of the side effects what they ve noticed Sometimes they can t breathe right What else Sometimes they died really young So just because it s a clone maybe we haven t quite figured it out yet Because it seems like maybe there are some issues with the animals actually coming out healthy or normal if they re dying younger or having problems growing Other questions Hector what is one of your questions Or if you don t have your questions ready or you feel like your questions were answered maybe you just have a comment You have none What do you think about cloning Do you agree with it Or are there are certain places or times you would agree with it Um I agree with it Like the pros I would agree with it like for food For what Like cloning for more food Oh like the chickens Right Cloning to make more chickens Wouldn t it be great if I have a perfect chicken and I could make a hundred copies of the same perfect chicken I ve had all types of chickens They all taste the same That s true Everything tastes like chicken But have you ever gotten like a really tiny drumstick and then you got like the nice meaty drumstick Well like a tiny little drumstick They still taste good True but what one gives you more food You got a point there Okay so maybe right But still you could put them together In the case of KFC the reason why their chicken s so big is because they put hormones in them to make them big Yes That s the way they approach that That s the best way to do that right there Not really People get cancer from that So would this be a good solution So instead of making eating our cows and feeding pigs and feeding chickens these extra vitamins and extra hormones to make them larger and grow faster would it better to just take the large big cows and just clone them Or make chicken and make copies of it Yes No Does anyone see any maybe This sounds really great like we re going to make these big meaty chickens so that everybody has a lot of chicken that they can eat but is there any downside to that No Honestly no I don t think so Not for you Great Is there anybody else Money Money how They could cost more to but they could cost less and be more affordable which is what we want Good Money is a good issue right People won t have to think about money issues I don t think there d be a money issue if you were cloning chickens because you can always just get you know take a syringe and like But that s what he was saying that maybe it d be cheaper if they could make it without using as much stuff Yeah Mm hmm It would take longer What do you guys think about the cloning for body parts Can I go back to the chickens for a second Sure go for it Wouldn t there be a lot less farmers so then there d be a lot less jobs because you know like the whole That is true Like a lot of companies will go out of business because I don t know I feel like there s like a monopoly on it More private industries are going to go out of business and that s going to destroy livelihoods Because all the big livestock companies like KFC and McDonald s well they re not a livestock company they re fast food But they re going to be selling it to those right They re going to let it go off of Just by show of hands who in here might have a problem eating food if they knew that it had been genetically messed around with That s just because you guys are okay with dying Chris not sure or does it just kind of I don t care really What was the question Oh I said would you be bothered if you ate genetically modified food No before that The one before Anthony started talking We were trying to see if there was any downside of cloning chickens We ll get there I know the question We ll get there I want to say something We ll get there Alright Erica Medical the cloning the body parts like if people are sick and they need a new heart or new lungs or a new kidney Ms Scott I wrote the name of it It s called Therapeutic Cloning They refer to it that way So that s what it s called when you do that So when we re using it for cloning for the organs for individuals who have issues whether it s like just a few cells or like nervous cells for people who had spinal cord injuries what do you think about that I think it s a good idea It s a good idea Do you have any reasons to be worried about that It would be better than nothing Any concerns Anybody else Have you heard of of a book called What was it called I don t think I have What s it about That s okay Levon is going to have to read it now because he ll be like What It s about like in the future will people if parents don t want their kids any more they can like they can give them a like they can take their other body parts off and they can take their other body parts off of them and stuff so they like your body parts are still alive so one arm could be like your real arm and your other arm could be like Interesting I ll have to read that book sometime Now when they re doing the therapeutic cloning they re not actually creating like a whole new human and then the body parts up There s a couple of different ways they were doing it Do you remember what they were using to how they were growing the organs That is true But what were they trying to do with the cloning How are they trying to avoid that Do you remember Does anybody remember How is cloning supposed to help your body to keep from rejecting Because Do you guys remember what happened to the woman Close Very close to that So remember when you get a body organ like the lady with the kidney right Who d she get the kidney from Her aunt Yeah so she got it from her aunt Somebody she was not even related to that just happens to be part of the family Like they were a match She had to take remember all of those pills she had to take To make sure her body doesn t like get rid of the kidney And then unfortunately it still did So they re looking at getting making kidneys and I think that they were growing them inside of a cow I think it was a cow Might have been a pig It was a big animal So you re going to grow human kidneys that are functional Mm hmm On a cow They were using another animal and they were actually growing it like not in the animal It wasn t part of the animal They were using the animal as a place to keep it growing and functioning So on the outside of a cow there d be kidneys Underneath the skin Yep And then they would take take them out and transplant them into humans This is like that episode of South Park where it s a little bit inappropriate but not too much Then let s not go there It s a little too inappropriate then let s not Nevermind Nevermind You re going to watch it for yourself Fabulous But they are also trying by cloning because remember a lot of times they re trying to find animal parts that might match Like for example did you know a pig heart is about the same size as a human heart So you could have a pig heart They were thinking about taking pig hearts and transplanting them into people that needed new hearts The problem is of course is it s a pig s heart which means the outside of the heart looks like pig cells So your body would know that it s not a human heart It would know that it s a pig heart And your body probably won t want that in its body So they were trying remember they had trying to grow new pigs I think they had little piglets running around The pigs had human DNA in there to make the outside of their hearts and the outside of their lungs and kidneys all kind of copy what a human cell would look like on the outside So that when they keep those body parts if they put them in a human your body wouldn t recognize it as being something different Did you know they ve actually done that My dad s friend s daughter has pig intestines 
 What are you noticing about it compared to these two This one s light brown These are all dark So I think this one s not getting enough water So we should water it What s happening because it s not getting enough water It s like drying out What s happening to the seed The seed is dying It can t grow And the seed s gonna die Yeah Because what s the first stage of a life cycle And you have water in it It s a seed Yeah And then it sprouts But on this one all stems are dying Oh wow that looks really dry So which one are you measuring We re measuring water Okay let s measure it Let me measure it Okay let s measure it and let s record how tall it is I don t know how you use it Yeah almost four inches Centimeters Here I ll measure it Seven and a half centimeters Can you hold it yeah Maybe if you hold it Oh no it came out It s okay It s alright we ll just Ours came out and then it s still good Just hold him up It s six centimeters Okay let s check Wow it s growing two times enough Keep it there and let s see Let s see if the rest of your group agrees Yeah I agree That leaf is up to six centimeters Okay so what in in a week how much has it grown It s grown three Three centimeters Three centimeters yeah Three centimeters Okay write and record it So that s parsley Write write Why do you think parsley is doing so much better than roma tomato Because the tomato is like a tomato has one thing and parsley has the same thing and they come out What do you mean the same I think maybe because parsley Because parsley has a rose it s easier because because a tomato has more time to grow because it like it s the kind of vegetable that has Which is actually even drier Can you guys help her out Can you help her out I think well I think that s growing better than the roma tomatoes Is tomato a fruit Day one Like it s growing a fruit that s what the tomato is Like a vegetable it s the fruit of the plant Yeah That we eat But I think that what I think it s important is that we grow this Yes Yes they ll grow at different times Once they grow it ll grow fast Yeah we started this one planting faster right We started this one two weeks later Do you think we need to water the tomato more though Yeah When you look at the parsley and feel feel how wet that one is And it s doing so well I know Compared to the tomato maybe we need to water more Yes Is this parse It s the parts No it s the gender I think they need to get more sun and water Okay so Abby s measuring her tomato I did it What do you guys want to do Do you want to do the top of the leaf or should we do the top of the stem Top of the leaf Top of the leaf The leaf is part of the plant Okay so you re putting it down all the way down Down and round It s four Okay It s four Alright Four So every single time when you measure this plant are you gonna measure the top of the leaf not the top of the stem Is that what you re going to do Yeah It started four sessions ago It started four sessions ago This one started two weeks before This one Let s look at the measurements and how much for growing can you compare these two What are some things that you notice I notice that It s grown three and a quarter centimeters Everything else won t be able to have two more centimeters G plant Can you tell me which one s growing quicker This one are pregnant Are you sure about that Yes Actually maybe because This started out and this one not so here before Okay and we started this one when We started this on I mean two weeks ago Two weeks after this one Yeah So even though this one was started later what s happened It s growing More Faster taller yup Okay Why do you think and you guys even noticed that it was dry and it s still growing faster Yeah So should we keep water should we water it more and see what happens Yeah What do you want to do I want to want to since there s no more seeds in there because we took two of them out and then the other one died I think we should grow more seeds in there and then water it and see what happens Okay go ahead you can plant it And there are sometimes seeds they just won t germinate They re sometimes just like a bad seed and they just won t they won t grow Maybe that s what happened to this one too Can I go through and bob it But in the inside of it it looks very dark But the outside of it does So maybe it s not as dry as we thought Yeah Now we have to take measurements again We ll just see if that helps There s only this one left Let s look at this seed What do you notice about it I know for we came from last time when we grow the parsley this seed is way bigger than that parsley seed These are not dead How about compared to the sunflower seed or a pumpkin seed It s really small And things can use the lines smaller maybe because they re smaller things or like a sunflower Oh so you think maybe the seed the size of the seed tells you how big the plant is going to be Yeah Okay On that some of the tomatoes are as big as that or bigger than that Sometimes the seeds are how they start out are smaller but sometimes the shape of it sometimes determines the shape of it sometimes but others not You mean the seed tells you the shape of the plant Sometimes yeah It could What about a flower or something Flowers seeds are different They all look different No So is that always the case No But some of your classmates have plants that are gonna grow bigger And so maybe we should ask them about theirs and find out if their plant is growing faster or slower compared to these two plants than yours And maybe we can see if the seed size makes a difference Alright you guys can get online Yeah you can go ahead and water it One in here and one in here And then I want you to go to that website and start your graphs when you e done You might want to water it a lot more Let me try And then over it We finished watering our plants Do we each get a computer We need help When we type into trying capitals in it it deleted our numbers So Okay We didn t know what was wrong Well you have your title Plant Type Let s be more specific because you re not doing all the plants What plant are you graphing right now Swiss chard And Kale Did you measure them already Yeah And then we drag the numbers but then they don t I think it s because of all that room James where is your measurement for swiss chard for today Right here You want to record that Swiss chard And kale was What was kale again Seven This height look correct No What are we missing Do you guys notice The up need Oh I notice There you go alright Okay so what s going to be your label for your bar graph That s the one going along the bottom The bottom the plant height How high the plant reading Are you gonna what are you gonna graph then for your bars Hmm What do we always look at when we re thinking about our graphs We always go back to our data table right What are we gonna do instead of getting ahead or not Seven centimeters for kale You re gonna have to put kale right there I know It s just that was the big plan I think I m on the tail now because Okay you have what s this one That was eggplant Okay And this is swiss chard Yeah Well here s that why don t you measure that You haven t measured it yet About five centimeters Did you agree Walt Yeah about five centimeters Is that what you got too Yeah So why are we gonna have a graph for just swiss chard and just kale Or are we gonna have a graph for both together What would be easier Both together I think Should we put it together How would we do that How would you merge that I think like both should have their own bar like in the same graph I think so too So which plant do you want to graph today Are you gonna do swiss chard or kale They really needed help Let s do kale Let s look at kale Okay What s kale Here s the kale Which one are we measuring James what did you get for the height for kale Seven centimeters Okay look see if Andrew gets seven Yeah about seven Okay And what was the height of it last week James So Andrew knows It was six centimeters Okay it was six centimeters So just put six centimeters here There you go Okay so lets fix this let s just make it kale height Or grow And then what s this what are you gonna put at the bottom Look at your table The height of kale Is that gonna go along the bottom How tall it was like in day one and day two Let s look What were the labels for our table Date and measurement Okay so that s what we re going with So the measurement will be on the bottom and the date is on the side Do you guys agree James You think that s right Okay we ll try it Go date and then go ahead and type measurement Should we have a unit on it since we re talking about measurement Mhmm Okay So the whole point of And what s in row one One four 13 Okay write that You re gonna put the date there Will would you like a turn Mhm Instead of doing commas if you re gonna write it like that you re gonna put a dash in between I m gonna have Will Will type this time We ll take turns So type in the date Okay and then what would go here under the What are you gonna graph Like what s gonna be the bar graph part Six centimeters No no the height was the another beam So type that in 
 It s probably three Because five to the third is 125 Alright so let s test that out Can I use my calculator You can have your guy test it out here Oh The other thing to work on is the pronunciation of this This is something that is unusual because it s got that subscript Read that first line up at the top where it says pronouncing logarithmic equations Log base b of x equals y Yeah so can you transfer that pronunciation to for example the one in example six How would you say that out loud Log base two of eight equals It s three Equals three So that s how we say these things out loud Log base two of eight The little number this subscript is the base Keep going you guys are doing fantastic Speak up The log of 10 000 is four Forgot I don t have a pencil You re off No pencil In number nine is it one For number nine Yeah When the log when the base is equal to X When B is equal to X it will be one So would 10 be negative one Uh 10 yeah negative one Oh I think I get it now And then 11 would be Negative three Negative three yeah It s like the power stable thing you know Yeah It s like four to the y would be equal to this Yeah So 12 and 13 would be zero Let s see Yeah Yep Okay Pretty easy Yeah and What s 14 14 is one half So again what you re saying is If it s a fraction or if like like for 14 Yeah It d be a fraction So 14 came out a fraction or a decimal of half Yeah So that what about that one made you think it s going to come out a fraction versus the other ones that were all integers The other ones were integers because in the log the little exponent there Mmhm is less than the actual number Okay let s work on the pronunciation because this is something that s brand new as far as how to say this thing out loud Let s go back up to the top where it says read this out loud So Matt I ll have you Are you the what is your role here We re professors here Oh so that s a good role for you So why don t you speak that out loud Log base root of x equals y Yeah now I want you to say the first example out loud Log base of log base five of 25 equals 2 Yeah so it s hard to pronounce it Yeah But the little number that s down is what Uh base Yeah so it s the base So when we say it we re gonna say base little number whatever it is Alright so now say what you were saying before either of you guys You told me why it comes out a fraction How will you recognize it comes out a negative number When the y or when the x is a fraction and the log base is a whole number Okay yeah so like which examples do that Ten and eleven Alright that s good How will you recognize if it comes out as zero See any patterns for the ones that log If the x is a 1 Alright yeah Why does that make sense Have you figured it out Like any number to the power of 1 is itself or no it s zero Or I mean not any number to the power of zero is one Exactly Alright you re very you re getting right to the idea of what a log is How will you recognize the ones that will come out one without calculating X equals the base Okay well said Why does that make sense in terms of exponents Cause if you divide itself it ll equal one Can you give me an example of an exponential equation that might look like this one Because that s the next thing we re going to try to do Seven to the fifth power Seven to the one equals seven Good having done all of this can you say what a log is in one word A single word It s like the power of Mmhm it s the exponent Yeah Good a log is an exponent Now what I d like you to do is try to do the bottom ones based on what your understanding of log is yeah Woah oh oh oh oh It would be Don t stop So it s gotta be two Take the so the first one would be 32 because basically the base is the actual number and the answer to the logarithm is the actual number So right to the there Yeah so 32 Something with Something to the fourth Yeah Maybe five five to the fourth Five to the Execuse you So 59 is One 52 equals one So it d be 59 Yeah 18 would be Just three Is it a thousand Yeah a thousand You put ten thousand I have a question Yeah For this one what s the for this one what s the log No well yeah I don t know The log of what I think I understand your question but you first have to figure out the way to read these things Read that part that first because the pronunciation is challenging at first Log base b of x equals y Alright so now read example Well we know example four is three So the log is three So read example four out loud So log three of 27 equals three Good except I want you to say the word base in there Okay log base three of 27 equals three Perfect so I think your question was about examples seven and eight So what s the base Wouldn t the base be one it s just not there It s not there Here s the question the answers the logs came out two for number seven and four for number eight Go back to what you guys were saying about an exponential equation What s equivalent to that Oh if it s not there the base is ten Alright so can you write the equivalent exponential equation for example seven Ten squared equals 100 Ten squared equals 100 Does it still work for that Is that void Mmhm Because it would be ten to the fourth equals But I thought he just said the base was one Well he said the base was one He thought it might be Oh it s not It turns out it s ten Okay So the base if not written is ten I want you to check this two ways Who s our calculator person here Alright so Brandon I want you just to type in the log but just use this button It s next to the seven Just type in log of 100 So if he doesn t use any base it comes out as two Now try it with the log base on the new operating system log base ten of 100 Log base ten of 100 Mmhm See if that still works Two It turns out it s sort of optional If there s no base what is the base Nothing No it s a certain thing So if there s no base written like all of the other ones had a base written Okay If there s no base written it s saying what s the number to raise a certain base to to get 100 And this one came out two So what s the number that you can use as a base squared to get 100 Ten Yeah so if there s no base the base applied is ten And it turns out you can write it or not So what I d like you guys to do is as you re working through these also consider what would be an equivalent exponential equation for each of the ones that you re taught So just do all of the ones at the bottom and then go back and do it again Yeah sure And the one s at the bottom you can t just type into the calculator So you got to kind of think a little bit about what would be the relationship there Then for like any number in there That s a really good insight How come that s the case Because anything to the zero power is one You got it Yeah Except for one number There s one number you can t put there Zero Yeah good job You got it good job Thank you 20 would be 81 I wasn t even close So ten alright so ten to the third would be 1000 For 18 wouldn t it be a thousand supposed to be base is implied to be ten Ten to the third would be 1000 I m not sure For 18 I don t know Alright Alright say it again except this time include the word base Log base of log base of eight Wait log base of eight equals zero Close Log base eight Log base eight of one equals zero That s it exactly yeah Okay So we say base where s the base always on a log equation Under the exponent Yeah its a subscript it s down A subscript So I d like you to pronounce number 12 Log three of one equals zero Close I want you to get the word base in there Log base three of one equals zero Yeah and that way if you re always saying what the base is when you create an equivalent exponential function it s going to be a lot easier So next to each one of these let s do a few together Let s do the top row going one six 11 I want you to write an exponential equation using 5 25 and 2 So it would just be five squared equals 25 Exactly What s the base in that equation It s five Yeah So you did two cubed equals eight Yeah Yeah so now you recognize you guys correctly identified that a log can be summarized as an exponent Yeah that s good Each of these numbers is an exponent What d you notice about the ones that came up zero Would you be able to recognize those and predict Any number works for it Really What do you mean any number works for it For this one Oh I see for that last one You could put any number here other than zero Yes I thought it was one but they had got it One works but so does two So does two three four and five I m wondering about the ones like 12 and 13 How would you predict or recognize in the future that the log is going to be zero If it has a one for the X For the X yeah Mmhm yep I think there s a fancy mathy word called a characteristic for that But we don t use that word very often But yeah you could say the x cause that s how it showed up in our first equation Sure How will you recognize that it s going to come out a negative number If it has a fraction in it Mmhm As the X Okay well said yeah Why does that make sense in terms of what you know about exponents On the green chart whatever is on the left side and whatever s left Yeah Our powers table You re talking about all of our fractions here Yeah How about the ones that came out with one as the log The log was one They have the same base and the same x value And what about this one This is a fraction so Yeah how come it had a negative log Well I know it s because it s a fraction Can you write an equivalent exponential equation Two to the no two to the negative one Mmhm equals it doesn t equal this right Actually it does Two to the negative one equals half Okay Yep Okay so that s correct 
 And why face changes are different at different pressures And so I think that at a certain pressure they re so close together that they aren t a gas anymore and they become a liquid Cool Because the difference between a liquid and a solid with the atoms is that the solids or the difference between a liquid and a gas with the atoms is that the gases are more spread out And the liquids can still move freely but they re more close together so Okay We thought that in a liquid they can t move as freely as it can in gas Yeah Yeah Well another gas has to expand well it does expand to fill its container Yeah So does that have anything to do with how they move Well you said that some tried to sometimes they don t always expand as much as they can but I think they do My guess is probably the distance between the molecules is based on how big the space is cause you think of pressed gas What are you guys all thinking about of what you re hearing Well Do things sound reasonable Yeah Is this a question that we need to maybe think about a little bit more Just how spread out do things have to be to be a gas At what point does that matter or not matter Uh huh Okay We re gonna keep that one on the books for something we need to check into That s what I want you to do to prove to me that you understand that beyond just telling me what you know maybe the book would say Beyond just a definition right If you re going down the right path here and you know what that is I see you re making a nice Venn diagram here comparing and contrasting that s great What I want you to do is on this sheet here cause this is what you re going to need to present to the class in a couple minutes Put down these thoughts these words that you ve got You can even draw your Venn diagram on here But explain what that means What does that mean bubbles floating inside the lagoon What does that mean It s escaping off the top When we think of matter what do we actually think of in our heads Conceptually we re thinking of a chunk of matter a beaker of liquid so there s some space and what else And what So matter has mass and volume What s matter made up of Okay Atoms molecules If it helps you you can decide okay let s think of this in terms of water Just so it s a known right Okay good Yeah that s a good way to do that So draw some pictures When you say it s escaping off the top what does that look like Okay so try to get it into some visuals Okay I ll come back Matter like I don t really understand The definition of heat Yeah Okay so what is heat It s what Heat is like the transferring of energy from a warmer thing to a colder thing right So you want to separate what something is from how it behaves So you re saying heat is the transfer of energy Transfer is how it behaves right What is it It s just energy It s energy right So heat is a form of energy and you re absolutely right It can move around in the environment between systems in and out of the system So let s say you ve got a beaker of water sitting on the counter and it s hot right It s sitting in a cold room What do you expect to happen What will happen to the temperature of the water for example It will Okay so the water will get colder and the air right around the beaker will get warmer til they level out Yeah Okay equilibrium good So you understand that heat is energy And you understand that it can move around So the question here is how does adding heat energy for example matter cause changes to temperature and changes of state So not that it does but how So what you need to do is think about your ideas about matter What is matter Something with a mass or volume Occupies space has mass or volume You know You just said it Okay Yeah see you know Okay matter has volume it takes up space right And it also has what Mass The property of mass Do you guys have any kind of a conceptual model of matter like if you think of it Obviously this is matter right but if you zoom in on that is there a way that you think about what matter is Do you guys think of matter as being made up of smaller things Yes Okay atoms molecules What would happen if you had one atom and you add some energy to it Remember this isn t rights or wrongs this is what are you thinking right now so that you can make sense of this So what if I have two atoms and I add more energy to them What if I have hundreds of atoms and I make them all move faster Well I mean that s what I m asking you guys to think about as best you can How would that occur We said if the molecules have more energy and they move faster then that leads to And they get warmer Oh that s the same thing as adding more energy right Then they move faster and that leads to changes from liquid I would say add some pictures I think you guys are thinking some good thoughts here about the structure of matter what it s made of So why don t you draw me some pictures of what that would look like in say something that is changing state Maybe take a chunk of something solid and then draw what you guys see as being a series of steps getting it from here to here So start with a lump of solid matter okay something like that Take it all the way to a gas Okay How do you see that matter Okay Okay alright let me give you guys a couple minutes to do that Start with an atom and build like a box So folks I want to take a couple more minutes and then have you guys share your thoughts with each other Theorizing is good Why don t you draw me some pictures of what might be happening here Yep Did I take your pencil I m sorry Okay we have a pencil thief So you re saying there s some specific temperature in which all phases can exist at the same time Water would be evaporating ice would be melting and vapor would be condensing So I just want you to tell me a little bit more about your theory How would that work in the environment in terms of the physical conditions that the ice and the water and the vapor would be under Yesterday we talked about some things that affect phase what were they What was one thing that we said affects what phase of matter something is in Okay temperature Anything else Pressure Pressure maybe so is there a way that you can describe to me in terms of pressure and temperature and the matter itself how that would work Okay you may need to mentally zoom in on matter What is it what is ice what is water what is gas If you zoom in and we look at it beyond just a chunk what do we see on the inside What s it made up of at a very small level Does everybody here see matter as a collection of atoms or molecules Like you can visualize that So bring that in here If you do that then show me how your theory would apply to that Try Okay Okay How s that sound Okay a couple more minutes Seems like you guys have gotten your thoughts wrapped around this and you re working on presenting it Okay How am I supposed to do this Oh god I can t draw cups Remember you have to explain to everyone what you re drawing s showing so it doesn t have to be perfect Oh okay Don t worry about perfection You re gonna get to stand up there and say this is what I drew And they just have to believe you Okay that s how bad it s gonna be Okay so there s like the water I think I have the difference between the molecules Okay so that shows that that s gas and liquid What is the big red arrow It s like going up out of the liquid What s it The molecules Okay molecules Yeah that s what this is supposed to be So the only thing I would like for you guys to add to your explanation here is something about why like why or how What are the factors in the physical environment that are allowing or not allowing the things that you re drawing to happen That s up to you what you think is making I think that s quite good actually That explains it to me really well The things that you think are having an effect on what s actually going to or not going to happen Like this amazing flame Like that amazing flame So you might want to label that or make sure that you explain that Label it F L A M E You ve vibrated those are actually quite good vibrations That s our gas They re awfully close together These are closer together here than they are here Is that something that you intended No There supposed to be really spread out It s up to you what you re going to write I m simply asking you a question because it seems like between liquid and gas they got closer together We didn t mean to do that I can draw more What do you think So we ve shown them closer together Do we want to revise this or do you think it doesn t matter So they could be closer together They could be closer together as long as they re moving more Okay So I think being like spreading out and occupying all space available So if you re thinking that you should include that somehow and it seems like then you and Katelyn and Ignesia s have different ideas about this And that s important to acknowledge because those are two different things so we want to think about What are you doing Oh you re adding to it So I hear Lindsey s saying that you thought they d be more spread out occupying more space and I hear you guys saying the spacing of them doesn t really matter So that s worth thinking about because that s two different ways of looking at this That s two different ways of looking at this Anyway we don t need perfection right now We need your initial thoughts but somewhere I d record that discrepancy I would record here that you re still thinking about that issue You think one thing you guys think another That s important So you guys I think I d like to have groups Don t worry if you re not totally done I would just like groups to kind of explain what they ve got so far And we re going to go in numerical order So I am going to ask everybody to come back to the tables though and give your poster to one group member Let s do that now Don t worry if it s incomplete This is a work in progress Come on back to the tables Don t worry if it s not finished You get to explain it And we re gonna keep these around so you can add to them Come on back to the tables I count two Alright so group one I m gonna have you guys come on up and hang up your poster You guys let s load towards the front of the room so that we re all closer You don t need all your stuff just come on up and sit a little closer Let s squeeze in in all these front tables Yeah you guys are gonna explain a little bit to us of what you re thinking was So everybody come on up as close as you can Let s squeeze in at these tables Let s get a couple people here let s get a couple people here Pull a chair on up Come on up Somebody come sit here somebody sit here So we ve only got a little bit of time left and I want every group to have a chance to tell us a little bit about their thoughts You guys may on your pre think sheets take some notes Remember this isn t about right or wrong This is about how do we think we understand this system right now And this is all leading towards trying to understand it more thoroughly and better and correctly by the end of the unit So their question the first one is how does adding heat energy to a sample of matter cause changes of temperature and changes of state So you guys tell us a little bit about your thinking here Okay so we were thinking that something about adding heat would have to do with the boiling point and the freezing point And we were also just listing facts that we knew that would probably help us determine about our question We were thinking about specific heat The equation for specific heat Also we said based on the specific heat of the substance an amount of energy will raise the temperature by a certain amount and we thought that was important And it varies for the substance because each substance is like a difference between the heat So if you add one it will raise one gram of a different substance by a certain degree and then a different substance by a different amount And we also thought about how solid liquid and gas that it has to do with the change of space And the solid they re like locked in place but they re still vibrating a little bit Then if you add more energy we think it goes to a liquid where there s more freedom of movement but they re still sort of contained and then in a gas And in a gas the molecules will be occupying all space available and moving faster And they re not like moving in a certain direction What questions do you guys have for them or comments about what they re thinking Why would different materials have different specific heats You don t have to know the answer Does anyone have thoughts on that Guesses Maybe they re different what Different types of material I mean substance So I think that maybe they have different specific heats because the atomic structure is different So they can kind of collect heat differently How does that sound to folks reasonable Is it true that atoms bond in different ways for different substances Okay so maybe that s something worth looking into as we study this and see why that why that physical property of specific heat why isn t it the same for everything And so we were actually still thinking in our gas drawing here because you can see that we drew all the molecules really close together compared to the solid and liquid I guess And we weren t sure whether or not in a gas they could move freely And it doesn t matter how spaced out they are as long as they can they re not stuck in one space like solids are They can just move wherever Or whether they have to be more spaced out and so Didn t occupy the whole space Do you guys have thoughts about that What they re saying Do you guys understand the point Katelyn s making How far do they have to be to be a gas Well I think that that s actually a lot like ours because we were thinking about pressure 
 Right here Okay so is that gonna tell us what one of our asymptotes is Yeah Yes because your asymptote is where this would be undefined right So it s gonna be X equals what Positive two Positive but okay if we put positive two there we have two plus two So it d be negative two Negative two that s why we have an asymptote that X equals negative two okay Now is there another number out here No No so what would that other number be See there is one here but there s not one here So it d just be zero So it d just be zero So does that tell you what your other asymptote is Y equals zero cause f of x stands for that s your y isn t it Okay So you can tell by looking at the function itself what your asymptotes are gonna be Okay tell me what this asymptote s gonna be your x your vertical asymptote Zero Zero X equals zero so you re gonna be drawing your asymptote right there What about your y Remember how we covered this up and you would have y equals what Negative one Negative one y plus negative one So the function itself tells you your asymptotes doesn t it Okay does that help Yeah Okay All right so No but it s like that right here though But see she has negative two Right here Then how did she get the did we write the first one wrong then Cause x equals zero No because she got zero and negative two and that s what I got You wrote it down wrong Where Right here cause zero is supposed to be on top Oh so no never mind you got it right It s the same I just switched these around No but you re right because you know how x is vertical okay so for this one it s going to be the x is going to be negative 2 right Mm hmm Okay I got it So wait the asymptote isn t the same thing as the parent function right No Did you have the graph Did it turn out And how do you know up here Check this thing out Huh So what would the parent function be That s what I was trying to work out for you Did you find the parent function For what It s not x squared is it One over x All of them is going to be one over x Cause you can t just put x She said put a one divided by x That d be the parent function All right How do you know which is the parent function It s the one that s consistent That first one that you put It s the one that s exactly in between the first and third quadrant This is your parent function This is your parent function This one and this one right So blue right there and right there But you totally ruined it Yeah Yeah the colors I used are kind of weird Do you have a red Are you using it This is the graph right So if it s the first one and the third one right Hey wait that first thingy comes out at negative three not negative two Hm This first little line right here comes out negative three not negative two Is the parent function still I mean is the asymptote still negative two I think So how is one negative two You gotta switch it because the one x plus two when you use the calculator you go into a negative so the y would be zero because it s not going to negative How would the y be zero the y is a negative You got em switched all you gotta do is switch em I m not understanding She busy Okay Oh I know why It s because we don t have no y in the equation Like this one it d have a y The y would be negative one And on this one we don t have it so automatically the y would be zero and the x would be negative two That makes more sense All right you got it Yeah I had to think about that So that s how you do it So then the asymptote is the right here Uh huh Which one So then the translation is the down one Wait what The translation is the down one So what is this down Let me plug it in Divide by x parentheses One over divided by x minus one Okay so we don t need no parenthesis No I m almost done You re crossing it that s the y yeah But that s the x This is x and this is y Yes Well look on the sheet It will show you that um I basically used this one as an example It s like the same type of format that the problem is Okay Okay yeah that makes sense So the asymptote is zero It says h equals x Yeah Yeah so zero yeah wait Yeah This is the graph you start with Yeah that makes more sense cause that s how the graph is Okay we got the asymptote X equals is it zero Yeah and then y equals negative one And the translation is one unit down Do you have a value Yeah Uh oh So it d be three units down We would put this on negative three cause that s y So since it s y we would have to put it on negative three and zero Right Cause it s the same as this Yeah And then y equals negative three Yeah x equals zero and y equals negative three Translation three units down Wherever the lines like go the furthest but don t touch Okay Oh you re just marking down the asymptotes Yeah She said she forgot yeah so I guess you can just put up there yellow Okay Are you on number four Yes So on number four it would be five units to the left Number four yeah yeah you re good Okay She just told me she just told I just wrote it wrong I guess then How do you know how to graph it with Like in the calculator In here And it s really not good to graph it here Yeah Okay This seems to be not that hard now that I get it Really Like remember how Grayson thought that it was three I knew she was wrong I mean I didn t think it was wrong You just instinctively knew that it was wrong Is it going to have a vertical shift also Yep up down down Okay up or down Down how many Two On number five Oh three It would be three Three Okay so you re going to have two shifts on number five right Okay Uh huh I haven t plugged it in yet We re going to have a shift here right What would make that undefined If x equals How about positive two Because two minus two is zero I mean the zero is where you needed to be So x equals two right Okay now what are we going to do with this thing out here That s a vertical shift of y equals negative three Y equals negative three So we have two translations okay Two units right and 
 What are some other indicators that tell us I m in my target heart rate range Yes By the categories on your RPE chart Okay your RPE Chart you could use that That s exactly right How about within your body What s something that your body can tell you that you re in that target heart rate range Yes young lady Um the way you breath and how you re feeling Okay good your breathing your feeling some of you want to come in here and work out and then talk about how that your legs startin to hurt and your thighs are startin to be sore All those things are physical ways that your body s sayin Hey I m doin a good job in this workout I m within my target heart rate range When we do this today I want you to kind of take a mental picture Let take a mental picture of This is how my body feels when I m in my target heart rate range Whether your lower end or higher end take a mental picture so that when you re out walking or not walking but when you re out running or playing soccer or playing basketball or things like that you can kind of have an idea how you re feelin with those with those things and you can know whether you re close to being in your target heart rate range Now one of the last things is is we filled out that family health history that each of you has there and some of you had some different things on that health history from heart disease to high blood pressure those types of things The cardio workout that we re doin today what areas is that gonna positively impact on that family health history for you Who knows that What are some of those areas Okay Let s get you there Amy It ll help prevent heart disease high blood pressure and diabetes Okay the heart disease that s exactly right Good cardio high blood pressure it s gonna bring the blood pressure down Also diabetes Along with high blood pressure you got high cholesterol All of those areas cardio is going to positively impact those areas Okay The yes What do I need to lose weight Okay to lose weight That s a question I get a lot of time If you want to lose weight ideally you want to be in the upper end of your target heart rate range or about 80 however you do actually at about you do burn more cal fat calories at about 60 but you re gonna burn more calories at 80 because it s a more intense workout okay So really ideally you d want to be within your target heart rate range Typically up towards the higher end will be a little better because if you re gonna be able to burn a few more calories than at the lower end Okay Any other questions on anything All right we re gonna get started here You ve already got your target heart rates there I want you to look here and I want you to send that text to this poll everywhere to where your target heart rate zone is What is your zone And we ll notice this most of you you know we ve all figured it out You ll notice percentage wise where most of you are gonna stand or where most of you are gonna be in the chart We start all the way down at 100 go all the way up to above 176 You ll start to see that that most likely that 151 to 175 that s gonna be our biggest area here that we re gonna fall into You can see right there we re at 75 So most of you in here where s our target heart rate range In between Between 151 and 175 There you go between 151 and 175 That is right on the money for young adults your age If you re at that 176 or higher that s not a problem but that is an area where you know anything over about 185 or so then it just means that you ve got to bring your heart rate up a little bit higher compared to most people So most people though again are gonna be in that 151 to 175 That s a good job Okay go ahead and go to your machines here Lay your clip boards off to the side If you want to listen to your ipod or to your music you can only one ear phone though only one ear piece Make sure you put your cell phones up in the cubby there we ll do something with those a little bit later And where we re gonna start with here is we re gonna start together We re gonna start with a two minute workout On this workout two minute warm up All we re gonna do is get warmed up You need to be out on the bike somewhere around 40 rpms Ellipticals about the same thing 35 to 40 rpms On the treadmills around three speed will be a good good place to start with Is everybody good we ready to go Yes Are we good back there You all set Okay all right here we go Startin on two minutes And start All right so make sure that we got those magnets on there Bump that up to about three or so Just to get warmed up This is just gonna get your heart rate up a little bit Now at the end of this warm up we re gonna check where your heart rate is we re gonna check that and you ll notice it will be a little bit elevated compared to compared to you know what it was for a resting heart rate You most likely will not be though in your target heart rate zone right here after this warm up About halfway through Good job Anytime you work folks you should always do a warm up Now we ve already stretched and done some a little bit of jogging down there in the gym before we came up here So you ve got some warm up but anytime you go to a fitness room you want to make sure that you do a little bit of warm up Don t jump right in to it You re gonna have a tendency to pull some muscles and have a lot more soreness and injury risk for you Good job everybody doin good Yes As we do this I m gonna come along and ask you where you are on your RPE chart periodically Cause I want to know how your body s feeling Just kind of look at that and gauge where ever you are Okay Let s go ahead and get a heart rate check here Real quick put your hands on the sensors let s get that heart rate checked As soon as you get that heart rate check go ahead and stop your machine hop off and we re gonna record that under heart rate one real quick under the warm up Okay stop your machine there Record that heart rate As soon as we get this go ahead lay those back off to the side we re gonna hop back over here and we re gonna start goin through the workout Now the workout s gonna be 10 minutes Again bikes you outta be pumpin out about 80 to 85 of your RPMs there Ellipticals probably somewhere between 70 and 75 We really want to try to push this so at the five minute mark you re within that target heart rate zone Anybody right now in their target heart rate zone No No A little bit elevated from the resting though Yes Okay all right Let s go ahead and start At the five minute mark we will check it again and we will check that heart rate what your heart rate is We won t get off the machines again until the work out s over Caroline Now again on your own once we get into this a couple minutes on your own if you want to kind of gauge where you are and check those sensors you re more than welcome to do that You just don t want to do it the whole time you re working out and that ll kind of give you an idea where you re standing If you need if you re below your lower end of that target heart rate go ahead and bump up the resistance a little bit if that s the case as we continue on through this Are you all doin good Where are we on the chart At 3 That s good You all could do this for an hour huh There you go How you doin over there Where are you on your chart Two That s good Three Three Two I d say around two Two Two Ladies how we doin over here How you feelin on your chart Three Three Yeah You good Russell Yeah Okay Andy how you feelin Where are you on your chart About four How do you feel good Where are you on your chart Doin good Most of you you re all about a two three four range right now Now we re just getting to the start of the work out but here in a few minutes that s probably gonna change Might be changing right now Probably startin to feel a little bit of fatigue breathing s becoming a little bit more difficult We re gonna do a heart rate check in two minutes Again remember I want you mental picture in your mind How is my body feeling when I m in that target heart rate range Doing a good job good job Okay we got one more minute and we re gonna get a heart rate check here If you re feelin like your in that 4 to 6 range you might be able to go ahead and up your up your intensity just a little bit there up your speed maybe up your resistance a little bit Russell did you forget to put your phone on vibrate Yeah That s all right buddy Just don t mess with it while you re on the bike okay I mean while you re on the treadmill Okay Okay hard to do hard to do anything with a phone while you re running All right let s go ahead and get a heart rate check here Get a quick check Remember what this number is This is gonna be heart rate number two on your chart We want to be within that range now If you re not we need to up your resistance If you re at the lower end I want to try to get on up towards the higher end about that 80 mark So if that s the case bump your speed a little bit up your resistance if you need to We re gonna get one more check here in about four and a half minutes About 65 I m in my range Nice nice Where are you on your RPE chart Uh about four About four Four or five Hey anytime you know if you re saying God I just can t get my heart rate up there if you re on the treadmill increase that elevation a little bit Elliptical if you increase the resistance then you ll start to feel it How s Callie back here She s startin to get it right now aren t ya How are you all on your chart Five or six Where are you all on your chart Five Five Six Where are you guys on your chart probably around four Ladies how we doin Where are you on your chart About six Six Yes How are you Russell Six seven How about you Six Six Dale where are you Three four Three four You need to increase your resistance I mean your elevation a little bit How about you Four Four Most of you are comin up on that chart Comin up Okay we re gettin ready to do another check here Good A couple more minutes here Everybody doing okay Yup Are you startin to feel some of the signs we talked about fatigue in the legs Yes I know it s hard to talk right now A little more difficult breathing Startin to feel it a little bit more now aren t you yeah a little bit How s it going back here My legs are like rubber So now you know you just got increase that resistance a little bit and keep it at the same RPMs One mile Kyle Okay in thirty seconds here we re gonna get a heart rate check Then we re going into the cool down You really push it right here You re about to jump off the elliptical aren t you Good Okay let s get a heart rate check here Heart rate check Grab those sensors Remember this number When you get this number when you ve got this go ahead and bring your speed on down We re goin into the cool down phase Make sure you remember what that number was What was your heart rate Uh 170 I m about 169 In your cool down phase now There you go good good Did we get in there in your range in your range Everybody in your range Great good job Did you stay in heart rate range Good Now did anybody on that RPE chart ever feel like you got up to about an eight or a nine Yes You did Yes Up there All right Did ya ll get in your range Yup Did you get within your range Was ya ll on your upper end or towards the lower end Upper end Tried to go up How about you guys Did you get in your range there Yeah Yeah Now here in about 45 more seconds we re gonna get our last check here on the cool down You ll notice how quickly as you do this you ll be able to tell a major difference from the last check that you did during the workout and even after this two minute cool down here the difference between where that heart rate drops to Are ya ll okay Okay let s go ahead and get that last heart rate check 
 We started testing out our theory that it s an exponential Cause we found out that the ratios Does that verify that it s an exponential equation We thought it did but it doesn t So why aren t you sure I don t know So the more disks I add I m eventually gonna have a cap on the minimum number of moves that I can make Isn t that a logistic function So logistic function would say that you re gonna have a cap on the minimum number of moves you make And it would say at some point you re gonna slow down the number of moves you re adding on Does that make sense based on what you ve done so far No not at all What do you think is gonna happen instead That it would increase And what would that be That s the exponential But the numbers are all really long decimals So I heard someone in here earlier say you were gonna scatter plot this So have you looked at your scatter plot Yes Okay What might be other ways to change an exponential function I can get it out of my backpack Based on what you had before what was your gut instinct with your ratio Before you did any of the arithmetic what did you think your ratio might be Small I don t know I didn t really think it was two automatically But two s in your head Why is two in your head Because doubling Because there s doubling Here s what I m gonna suggest to you guys You ve got your scatter plot on Marissa s calculator right You re thinking that two might have been the ratio Why don t you graph two y equals two to the X and compare it to what s happening on your scatter plot and see if there s a different way that you might be able to change the extremum It s increasing by a factor of 2 She s trying it in an actual game Normally I d want you guys to struggle with it right now but it sounds We re at 20 so what s your goal 27 28 29 30 31 Good job Caitlyn Good job Now I m convinced that that works You re seeing that the difference is doubling each time correct What kind of function is that suggesting Exponential And what do you suspect is probably your factor Two Two So that s what I want you to look at How could you verify that it s an exponential function using any of the tools you have here Once you ve found out this was an exponential function what did you do to figure out what the function actually is There is a little bit of a trick to this one It has to do with some of the other types of changes we do to functions Okay Figure out that When you get stuck again let me know and I ll be back So you think that s two to the power of X minus one Why did you get minus one Because with one it worked fine but with two when you try to put in X as the exponent two to the X so two times two is four So far X minus 1 is the exponent What I m hearing is that you re convinced that the factor is two And you re trying to do some transformations on this to make your y values fit with what you got here is that correct Talk me through again why you guys think that the exponent is x minus one and then why you re adding the one at the end Because there has to be at least one move We added the one at the end because we were looking at just the y values first Oh wait that doesn t work though If you have one so two to the zero is 1 And one plus one is two but that s Tell me more about this idea of the plus one at the end You said that had something to do with why you had to have a plus one Is it a piece of the function That would be really mean We were like well it has to double and then we have to add one on the end I think you guys are in a great place I think you ve got a good idea here which is to take y equals two to the x and find the transformation that gives you this table So try more with the transformation I also like this idea you guys have about how you have to have at least one move but I would think a little bit more about how to pattern your moves that s just that you need at least one move Alright I m going to leave you guys to think I ll come back So we found the equation but now we re stuck at number four Okay so talk to me about the equation and tell me how you found it The difference between I was kinda thinking of how this was relating to the difference so how it would relate to the y values We saw the two to the x we figured oh well two to the four to the 16 Well how do we get to 15 minus one This is going back to the algebra from last year So you saw that you had two to the x You noticed here that we have just two to the x and then you go back one using algebra You also talked about how when you graphed two to the x it matched up with your scatter plot Did it lie directly on your scatter plot No So what do you mean by it matched up It was close It was the same curve So how did you know that created a transformation Because whether it depends on the number or which value it is It changed the steepness of it So we just knew it transformed it somehow Like we had to have it It wasn t the parent function So what made you guys think about doing a minus 1 after two to the x instead of saying four times two to the x or three to the x How did you know that Because if you d done four times two to the x you would have stretched it Because it would have moved to the left too on the graph And what did that end up doing to your y intercept Okay so that would be my next question for you I agree with you guys that definitely there s a transformation I agree with your algebra and your understanding of tables you ve done a nice job with that So how does a transformation what you ve done is you ve taken two to the x what does the minus one do Does that move this to the left Move it up or down Well if you graph it It moves it up Okay So Jamie is saying that she thinks that changing the a value changed the slope of the function And you re saying that you don t think the slope changes Okay so you change the y intercept And do you have a change in the y intercept It s still zero comma zero So you just had two to the x Find out just two to the x What s the y intercept of the graph What happened to your function and how did the function get transformed to achieve that The y intercept moved down And does that match what we ve been talking about You take the function and subtract the value and move down one Alright you guys said you were stuck on number four Yeah Okay Why are you stuck So we figured out that you put But the minus one doesn t do anything Yeah the numbers are so big that it doesn t matter It actually does change the actual number a little teeny tiny bit But our calculator can t see that number It looks like the same number on your calculator So we have a number of moves If each move is a second then how long is it gonna take for the world to end Alright now you guys are also at the challenge question down here Which is based on the patterns you were seeing and how the pieces were moved Why is your function which is correct match the way the patterns that were made Okay And I ll be back in a little bit I m going to give you guys about seven more minutes You should answer question four before you try that So I got it kind of close Looking at just I did what you do to find a normal exponential equation I plugged in y two over y one and then to the square root of four And are you getting consistent ratios between those y values of yours No You guys are correct that this is exponential But if we re not getting a consistent ratio between y values then that suggests that your original thought which was to start with two to the x and do a transformation is on the right track So I really think you need to go back to y equals two to the x and find the transformation that gets you to these y values Okay I m gonna make a suggestion to you again stealing from another group Try finding the differences between all these y values and see if you can see a pattern between the differences and the actual y values you have Alright what have you guys got Our answer was 30 Talk me through how you got that function and how you know it works I realized that the table matches the graph of two to the x but minus one So you just have that in your head Did you graph it or did you just know those numbers in you head We didn t graph it We used the tables to confirm that it was y equals two to the x minus one Went to the table and it was the same numbers And I noticed here you ve got 2 to the 64th minus one What s that for That s from another number It s like a really high number One point eight times Two to the 19th While you guys figure out how long it s gonna take for the world to end with that really huge number I d also like you to think about the answer to the challenge You guys spent a lot of time looking at the patterns and how these pieces are moved So I d like you to think about why your function has two to the x Why are you doubling those 
 So here s the first set I thought I d start a little bit easy So go ahead and within your groups now I ll give you like a minute to tell me all the methods that you can of how to separate how to figure out which one it is Okay Go ahead You can uh You can you use Beer s Law for this right You aren t able to taste that You aren t able to that s not big enough Our Okay so Doesn t dissociate How s the temperature Boil it Yeah that s the only way So the one with the highest concentration s going to have the highest boiling point Yeah You could freeze it and weigh it Okay freezing it The point three would have the most weight Weight Yeah But which one would freeze first Point one Point one would freeze first because there s less Okay What else Point three weighs more But we would need to freeze it first no What We wouldn t need to freeze it The first one being would be with the tasting one Or the volume one I don t know the tasting one Okay you say the tasting one you say the volume one Whichever one comes first The one who boils fastest would be the one with the point one right Okay So the one that boils the fastest Point one You could measure the vapor pressure by also just leaving them and adding them and then just coming back after like five minutes or ten minutes Alright So we can have equal volumes of each solution right And then after like a certain time Alright that s it Everybody stop Stop stop stop Okay So who want to go first We ll start with with Miles I think you had your hand up first so go ahead What s one way that you can identify these things Well you could boil all the solutions until all the water vaporizes and the beaker with the most sugar in it would be the 0 3 molar 0 2 would be the middle and 0 1 would be the least Okay If they were all the same volume Ahh Yeah You guys heard that now Good Good listening skills on that If they were the same volume at the beginning alright Does everybody agree So one method is boil away and weigh Did you say weigh How do you know which one has the most I would imagine you could weigh it right You could weight it Start with equal volumes Okay There s several other ways How about Joseph If you take equal volumes of each solution and you taste them whichever one tastes more sugary would have the highest concentration Okay Anybody have comments on that Jimmy I don t think we re able to distinguish the taste that well Because our mouth isn t that sensitive Okay Miles What if someone dropped some lead nitrate in there So there s two concerns Obviously I think Miles is the most important You know you guys can see that I m smart enough to put the right substances I keep forgetting I m getting old And I may go in the back and I reach for the lead nitrate or something right And then the other part what do you guys think of the other part Could you taste the difference between a 0 2 0 3 and a 0 1 And just say Ah that s the sweetest one It s kind of hard Miles You d need some salt The problem I think is this is something we would actually need to try right I don t think this is a theoretical thing that we re trying to we re practicing theory here We would actually have to do this in a lab right I would imagine we would Wouldn t it be different for every person Because we could It could be different for every person right Because I can t see as well as you for example maybe right So there could be variations in tasting of those Ian Given excess humans Oh wait You re on the next one No on this one Alright I didn t get that either Okay so let s look at another method alright We re not going to list that one because we don t want to be tasting things Okay so Paran your group What about at equal volumes you could test the vapor pressure and the 0 1 would have the most and 0 3 would have the least because there s more sugar covering it What do you guys think Okay Juan He didn t say how you could measure it The way you could measure it is that with equal volumes you leave them out and the one that evaporates the fastest is the one with the highest vapor pressure Everybody agree Yeah Okay So that was my concern too right How do you measure the vapor pressure You re not wrong But how do measure it And thank you Juan for bringing that up Could you repeat that Okay so you would take equal volumes and leave them out to evaporate because they d always be evaporating The one with the highest vapor pressure which is 0 1 molar would evaporate the most after a certain amount of time So I m going to write this as evaporation rate Who s got another method Different view Alright Jimmy Okay so you re gonna put the same amount in a sealed container and put it into light Whichever one grows algae first is the 0 3 Then the second one is 0 2 the last one 0 1 What do you guys think Could you repeat that So you re going to take equal amounts take it into the light make sure it s the same conditions for each one and then whichever one grows algae first is the 0 3 Second is 0 2 last is 0 1 What do you guys think I know some of you guys are thinking that s bio but you took it most of you at least right So we could finish this What do you think Wouldn t it take a long time for the algae to start growing It s going to work right Nobody sees Where s the algae You re always asking me Come one folks You think about this I m going to say the problems But I want you to tell me first alright Alright let s go with Ivan I don t think the results would be consistent Because what if some algae cells just go in one solution and start going there for no reason So because you didn t mention how much algae you put in there could be an issue there What else though No Juan you go alright I don t think you can assume that you have all the necessary stuff in the water for the algae to grow in the first place So I think Juan is saying growing conditions require lots of other things Not just amount of sugar and amount of water There could be other nutrients is that what you re saying Yeah Nutrients and other things of that sort Could I just back up for a sec Algae produces sugar right Assuming that you re talking about algae that grows they use carbon dioxide So my hunch is there s several right One I think as Ivan pointed out you ve got to put in a certain amount Why don t you put in something that eats the sugar like yeast and then we could all finish and have a beer at the end You picked algae so yeah Although is that a bad idea It could work but we have to be careful with conditions A lot of conditions need to be met Anything else You boil them Hold on Let these guys go If you have equal volumes and you add heat to them 0 1 should boil first Okay so you could use boiling point Elevation I wrote this down before we even discussed it But everybody agrees that works right So what s another easy one that we boiling point elevation right You need me to repeat that or you got it What immediately follows with that idea Freezing point depression Freezing point depression Okay what else I have a question for you then Could we use Beer s Law for this No Tell me why Could we use Beer s Law for this Ian you have your hand up At first glace I would say no because I do not believe that stuff actually has a coloring solution What do you guys think Yep Don t you need color Unless what Unless Come on keep going with this stuff Not you Ian You spoke I d like to have as many people participate as possible Alright Nick go ahead You could add food coloring possibly Yeah you could add food coloring and maybe the higher concentration would appear darker possibly Nick we re trying to figure out the difference between these right Yeah What do you mean add You mean add a drop to each of these Yeah But then what would you be measuring The food coloring You wouldn t be measuring the sugar You know what I mean Yeah I know what you mean You re still okay with that Uh I don t know Wait Nick If you add food coloring how much One drop Yeah Okay One drop to each of these right Now they all look the same Don t they Yeah And if I stick this in my spectral photometer they should all measure the same Did I succeed in figuring out which one is which You understand that right Yeah yeah Okay Nat Could you somehow measure how fast the food coloring spreads That s interesting Could you measure how fast the food coloring spreads You d have to indicate that high concentration would Teacher Hang on But once again we have to be careful of conditions right All the temperatures have to be the same What do you guys think Sure Why would that work Because the sugar molecules are getting wet and it s not able to spread through the molecules So that would be in the 0 3 Science Glad you like it Alright How about wait Gevorg hasn t spoken So I m thinking Gevorg it s your turn buddy What did you want to add You wanted to add a new technique Okay go ahead If we did a Benedict s Test I don t know if it would just turn the same color because I m not sure how the Benedict s reacts with different concentrations But maybe if you put the same amount of Benedict s and if it gets darker or it gets affected with the molarity then you could use a color emitter or a spectrometer to test What do you guys think Benedict s is a reaction between this Benedict s stuff with sugar to show the presence of sugar What comes out of the reaction I m not sure but it s a color change Oh well the more color change But if the color change is too intense it could just be like it s all going to change that color or not see what I m saying That s what your pointing out right So again that sounds like an experimental one Could I share one more How about this You know when you take your AP test you just don t know what And we started with something that I think is sort of easy Could you use density What do you guys think Someone who hasn t talked yet Could we use density And how do we use density What do you guys think No Alright Ian Since nobody s going for it Do I have to say it Go ahead and say it Tell me how Tell us how Take equal volume of each of the three and weigh it Exactly Which one s going to weigh the most The one that has the most sugar okay If you take equal volumes this one will weigh the most This will be the most dense The more sugar you add the denser it gets You know this right Does anybody have any more Alright let s move on Set number two Now this says solid and I m trying to get you to see a different range on these Go ahead and talk about it I ll give you a minute or so Colors Conductivity We could root the potassium chloride out with conductivity Well they re solid You have to remember So solid has a lot of problems with it That s just solving it It s hard to conduct a current Well you could dissolve it It s doable It s just a little difficult Potassium Then um Wait calcium What about pH sensing So CACL2 Well they re solids Oh if you put them into a solvent Yeah Can we put them into solvents Can we make it into So lead can t dissolve in water right Lead I mean lead chloride No lead chloride will not dissolve in water But then KCL and CACL2 would They would So you can rule that out That s one way But then how do you figure out between the other solution Couldn t there be a bigger concentration of chloride and then you could form a precipitate I wouldn t say form a precipitate I would say Actually I m thinking you can hybridize the fact the lead chloride doesn t dissolve at all with boiling point elevation freezing point depression because you re going to have more little bits in the CACL2 than the KCL As an end result calcium chloride potassium chloride get what PBCL2 does nothing So after that if you boil it right Calcium chloride potassium the higher value Alright you guys That s it Let s gather up Okay Some of you guys just got back so you guys know what we re doing right Yes Okay Let s get it together Alright everybody stop now Christina you had your hand up first Take the easiest one What s the easiest way to distinguish these You could take equal amounts of each of them and weigh them and then PBCL2 would be the heaviest and the KCL would be the lightest Equal volumes I mean equal amounts What s an amount though Like grams But if I take equal grams then I could have ten grams of this ten grams of this ten grams of that No I didn t say that Alright what did you say then I meant like equal Equal what Volume Volume okay Now let s answer that one What do you guys think She s saying take let s say 10 milliliters 10 milliliters 10 milliliters And this one s going to weigh the most This one would weigh which one s second Oh sorry Second would be CACL2 Okay so this one would be second What do you guys think Someone other than Ian Okay Ian go ahead Does atomic weight atomic mass directly influence Listen to this Miles Does atomic mass directly influence density That s the question Does the formula mass have anything to do with the density of these solids They re all ionic compounds And the answer to that is no You cannot assume that because this has the highest formula mass that this is the most dense Okay Where just to follow that up where could you use formula mass in relationship to density in a pattern that works Ivan Oh wait let s give it to him Just he s just walked in Niresh Is it in gases Gases right Does everybody agree Gases you could do that If the formula mass is high on a gas then it s going to have more density Could you do that for liquids now Could you do that for liquids Ivan You could do it if it s all the same subsets for different concentrations 
 You each have your own set And I m going to ask you to put them out in front of you in in so you can see all the words Can we put them in two rows One Two three four five six Let s put them in two rows One two three four five six Now I wanna play Wait a minute show me I m going to ask you to point So get your pointer finger in show me under Yes under good Take a look at the word under good Wait keep it there Show me now be careful We want to get all the letters Show me there Listen to the word good Jessica There That s Okay he s gotta look He s gonna do it Very good Put it down Good Ready Alright Be careful with this one listen to my words Ready Show me Saw Good Excellent alright Show me ready They alright Excellent Alright Show me was Wow That s good Show me want Alright now You did a great job Now we re going to hide your words so turn your cards over all by yourself Now you can t see them right Keep them in the rows Good Alright keep them in a row Alright now oh your going to do it that way Okay wait a minute now Now we re going to take turns Let s see who s sitting nicely Alright You re going to turn over a card Lewis and tell me what the word is Put it down Want I want my toys I want my toys yes good You turn over a card Oh what s your word Under I see the cat under the bed alright Lewis turn over another card under oh you got under as well what s your sentence I am hiding under the bed I am hiding under the bed that s a good one Under the table Let s see Jessica go ahead do another one Now think look at your letters was Yes I was eating I was eating Good Look at your letters let them help you Don t help They There There yes There is my toy in the bed There is my toy in the bed Okay alright how about you Jess Oh what do you have There Good can you use it There is a car in my mail There is a car in your mail Wow That would be interesting Alright Lewis your turn Now look at your letters let them help you They Yes They was a cat in my car Okay this there was a cat in my car They tried to get the cat out of the car Okay They belongs means people They Okay Let s see what you have Oh look at you Today is the day Aaah this word is they The children that would be they Let s take a look at this word this is one we are misunderstanding They Jessica and Lewis they came to the reading group Okay They had turkey for Thanksgiving They have alright They came to my birthday They came to my birthday Can you think of a sentence for they They What did your brothers do They play basketball There you go they play basketball there you go that s better Okay You have another card to turn over But it s my turn I got mixed up I got Lakers socks You got what Nothing Say that again What did you say about the I got socks No this is saw This is I saw you when I I saw a movie I saw a big alligator I saw a big alligator I saw a dinosaur I saw a dinosaur Last one was was Okay Where was my friend Where was my friend good I want candy I want candy Okay Now watch what I m going to do I m going to put the cards together I m going to mix them up and I m going to turn them over We re going to play our matching game okay Alright What happened My brother put gum in there and when I point I can t get out of there Oh boy alright now Jessica you went first before right So we have Lewis go first this time Would that be fair Yes Alright Lewis you re going to turn over a card you re going now listen to me Listen to me This is how we re going to play You re going to turn over a card and you re going to read it Then you re going to turn over another card then you re going to read it Wait a minute wait a minute If look at me sweetie If you get a match you want to keep the pair You have to put the word in a sentence Can you do that Let s see Go ahead Okay take a look Take a look take a look Shh don t tell him don t tell him Was This word is was Let s see okay now pay attention Jessica so you can remember where they are Your turn Pick another card Lewis Oh it s so close What word is this Saw saw Okay Here is was Turn it over turn it over And here s saw Good Okay Jessica s turn Want Good want She read it They Not a match Good wait a minute wait a minute wait before you do that Wait before you do that They want They want candy Okay watch Lewis Who remembers what was this one What was this one No peeking Do you remember what it was Jessica Was Was good What was this one Saw What was this one They and what was this one Want Good alright They No its not they Careful take another close look Look at the whole word There Now sorry about that Good good They Is it a match is that a match No but we ve seen that word What s this word They Go to your chair now and sit Okay There and they I m going to hide them again Now let s see if Jessica remembers They and they Okay now stop You want to use it in a sentence Let s see how we do They have a dog They have a dog Good job Alright you get that one Okay Lewis let s see how you do Go ahead You can do it Oh What s that word Under Under Pick another one under No way Alright Under Okay let s see a nice sentence I m going to listen for a good one I am under my brother can t find me because I m under the table Your brother can t find you because you re under the table Can you give me a sentence for under Um I hide under the bed I hide under the bed excellent okay Now it s Jessi Oh Want Do you remember where it was Jessica Wow Now wait a minute let s see if you can think of a sentence Jessica first I want a cake I want a cake What would you want I want a brownie I want a ice cream Okay Okay alright try another one Oh Is that match No No what s this word Lewis They Come back over here and take a good look at it This word is saw Jessica s going to get it Now wait a minute maybe not maybe not saw uh eh eh ah uh was Was okay Yeah but that s okay those two we mixed up Let s take a good close look at them Which one is was Which one is saw Okay alright now listen to your first sound I m going to hide them again Let s see if we can remember Go ahead Lewis Your turn Was and which one Was There you go was Give me a sentence for was I was in my bed I was in my bed Let s hear Jessica s sentence for was I was I was in the bus I was in the bus alright Let s see pick another one Take a look at the first letter Saw Okay and what s that one saw Okay now a sentence for saw Wait a minute before you count your card A sentence for saw I saw something you see oh I saw a saw a candy You saw a candy where was the candy On the floor I saw candy on the floor Did your little brother dump it on the floor Okay I would eat it You have the last one They It s not they I want you to think again Look at all the letters Don t tell him don t tell him There Okay give me a sentence wait a minute give me a sentence with it There was a huge table There was a huge table where In my kitchen There was a huge table in my kitchen before you count your cards can you give me a sentence with the word there There is a snowman at the window There is a snowman on the window what a great sentence How many cards do you have one two three four five six seven I got six Alright we re going to do one more thing with these words to practice We have a word that we are having trouble with We re going to come over here Over to the board We re going to take a look at this word that we re having trouble with Thank you for getting her a marker I m going to ask you to write this word on the board Oh a line you know what she s telling you right Okay let s take a look at this word Are you ready This word is Jess that s good Alright This word is saw Let s see if we can write it Saw Jessica I want you to write saw Look at the word There it is Saw Okay 
 Everybody s using their directions they have their tools and their charts out We ve found today s date so we know where we re going to record today It s Wednesday March Ninth I know what numbers down of zero mean They are negative numbers That s what are numbers that are down from zero OK I have most friends with their hands on their heads I want to make sure everybody s listening and ready to move on We can keep all of our materials out so we can actually use them Excellent I m waiting on a few more people to have their hands off of their materials and on their heads so we can concentrate on the teacher In each group I have one team member that will be measuring temperature If you are measuring the temperature please hold up your tool that you ll be using Those of you measuring the temperature what tool are you using Everybody Thermometer Very good The people that are measuring the temperature with the thermometers please line up at the back door of the classroom When you get out there boys and girls are you going to be able to see the temperature as soon as you get out there What are you going to have to do Look at the thermometer And you can also compare it to the thermometer that s been outside so go out there and you can let your thermometers adjust to the temperature of outside If you have a windsock and you are going to measure the direction of the wind I would like you to line up quietly at the back door of the classroom You guys can use the compass and work together go ahead out and see what you observe If you have an anemometer to measure wind speed you may line up If you have a ruler to measure precipitation in our rain gauges you may line up You may all go And last but definitely not least if you are measuring the When we look at this our thingy goes away No yours is 61 No it s the Fahrenheit not the Celsius There s something in there What team are you 66 You guys we need to wait for how many seconds It s not ready yet You ve been doing it at home What is it that you ve been waiting How can it be 110 How can it be Now we are going to set the timer for 10 seconds and we are going to count how many times it went around OK So see where your is and get ready to start counting Look at the bee I ve heard both of these ladies say two What you need to do is you need to use that chart in there and see what it means What is the wind speed if the anemometer goes around two times in 10 seconds Look with your eye with one eye look at this one I can t see I think it s going West When you have completed measuring you may walk back to your group to record your data Quietly I got 66 Can we compare it to what s on the wall there and see what we have It got 66 then it got 65 and then it got 64 Victor could you explain it all to me why you think you thermometer keeps going down Because it gets colder And where has the thermometer been sitting all day In there And do you think it s cooler out here or is it warmer out here Cooler Exactly So our temperature is going Down Good So let s go ahead and look right here to make sure we can tell the temperature from our thermometer that s been staying outside It s getting brown What do we think the temperature is there It says the temperature is 46 degrees That s probably our most accurate reading since it has been staying outside all day long All right You can head back in and record I don t know which number to choose The one on the outside the whole time What s your Gym It s on Wednesday March Ninth It was West The wind direction was West The wind direction was West Very good I think that you have an accurate reading What s the wind speed It s cloudy Wind direction temperature Team Three is working together and Team Two and Team One Nice job working together I think you have to change it Temperature Victor What was the temperature 40 degrees 46 degrees Fahrenheit It was 50 What was the wind speed It s not raining So what did you guys think the was I agree with you Why would we forecast that it might rain What s the weather The weather is rainy West Put West It was West It was West We found out that the wind speed we said it went around about that many times so how fast is the wind actually going Minutes Miles per hour We don t go anywhere in a minute We travel like we said in cars in miles Right Go back to your group they ll tell you on the chart My thermometer s higher than the one outside We discussed that while we were standing out there Why do you think that that may not have dropped as far down or might even be going back up as you re holding it inside right now Because inside of you it s warm Because you told us that it was when you re holding the thermometer the thermometer only feels what s around it And if we re covering the thermometer it can t measure any more temperature only how our temperature is Very good So Linda if that answered your question that s why we compared it to the thermometer that s been staying outside that we check each day What are we going to say that the temperature was from that thermometer reading out there 46 degrees Fahrenheit Excellent so make sure you re sharing that and each person in your group use your data Linda I think you ve done an excellent job OK We have a few minutes left and some groups are getting to the point where they have finished recording their data after working with their team members on each type of weather and using the different weather instruments I am going to pass out your follow up questions and you re going to use data from last week and compare it to today s data to do some equations on here and you do not have to finish today We will do this in our follow up lesson in our next science lesson OK You may continue working Thank you Write your name and date and you can put it back in your packet when you clean up OK the wind direction Who should you be asking that to Today s Last Wednesday the temperature was What is the degrees between today s temperature and the temperature last Wednesday Write an equation Show your work Last Wednesday the wind speed was eight miles per hour What is the difference between You already have your paper I know We can do it by ourselves But it says to work as a team I like it Good job Keep working with your team I hear her saying Excellent I like how I see Brianna using her data And Grace starting to write an equation and Abby and Samaya have the date on their paper You guys are all doing an excellent job Who is the person on your team whose job was to measure what direction it went You should ask that person as soon as he comes back he should have his data on his chart What number did you put there We worked together and we figured it out I know this one I know this one I know that one One second 
 Stationary point Did he move Okay some of the other groups are moving their fingers around sometimes they were releasing from up here and up here so do you think your data might be a little more realistic Yeah Yeah okay so now one thing what type of formation do you guys have Good Put an adjective in front of it Extremely strong Strong A strong positive Do you think every correlation around here is gonna be the same No No Okay so yours is probably going to be one of the strongest ones Remember that correlation coefficient R it went from positive one to negative one or zero Oh yeah What do you think yours would be close to One It d be really close to Then we ll get to that shortly guys later on Okay So you probably would have one that s a decimal 999 or really close Okay so you re trying to find your slope Yeah So what is your slope Two Two okay so over here we re gonna put And now does everyone have the exact same You do Pretty much Oh most groups who are four people are slightly off depending on where you put the line Okay here s the slope So you just told me your slope is two now what am I asking you to do What is your No we re not done yet What is your It s 2 0 Read the question Okay what s the slope of the equation The slope is What did you just tell me Oh two Two Okay now what s the real world meaning of that What does that mean when you say yes those are two Okay now we can go back to that I just want to talk to you about the solution Just on your slope you said it was two That was perfect But now what s the real world meaning So the slope is the more rubber band What are you looking at So it s one and two One Why can t it So you want to put five Okay Ten over Okay so now you re telling me your slope is ten over one Okay well I m asking you what s your slope Now you re saying your slope is 10 That s what the slope is but I want the real world meaning So what were you saying For every one rubber band that drops How do you know How do you know But where are you getting I need a little more detail though It s dropping what So 10 centimeters for every One One rubber band Okay Now what s your y intercept Seven Seven Now is your y intercept directions to get somewhere else or is it telling the exact location What s the y intercept Because a slope isn t that directions to get somewhere else What s the y intercept I want the entire It s zero seven So can you write zero seven down please Write zero seven down And now tell me what the real When I ask you what the y intercept is yes zero seven Now what s the real world meaning subtract out of seven So what s this saying Translate that for me You re saying there s no real world meaning what s that saying So before we put any rubber bands on this already moves seven centimeters What does that mean Going into this lab did I know if the real world meaning was gonna make sense or not There s been a few groups today their y intercept has a real world meaning zero zero But did I know where your line was gonna go No But if it went straight through zero would that make sense Zero rubber band So So what s the real world meaning Well what do you think This y intercept that you had does it have a real world meaning No So yeah it doesn t have a real world meaning What slope did it Okay Once again did I know that coming in Depended on your data Good job Guys you re asking If you plug into this four times three that s 12 But yeah Three two and four I think it says three Okay So what s your equation Y equals 3x plus 12 Okay so let s talk about that No no it s one intercept the y It really doesn t play out with that algorithm It makes no absolute sense whatsoever Yeah but you find air Oh that makes sense But this What are we talking about We got one anyway but really that s it Wait one second backtrack for one second So what did you say here Five thirds What is a five thirds 5 3 Okay so what s the real world meaning Every five inches there is three rubber band Okay So now does the ball go on a rubber band So flip that around so you re saying two rubber bands the figure is going Yes Okay does that have real world meaning Does that have real world meaning Yeah Yeah Okay Now you re saying what your y intercept is can I see your graph paper for a second Yeah Okay So yeah it looks like it s around Does everybody have the same No Do you think everyone s gonna get the exact same line We didn t really have an intercept slope we just looked at We just Yeah which sounds great because you re all gonna draw that line slightly different so go with one then What does that y intercept Is that directions or is that a location It s a location isn t it So can you write the exact location Because you re only counting one What s the order of pairs here You have a pair of zero one so write that down Pair of zero ones You have a pair of zero ones Yeah What s zero represent Zero rubber bands Zero rubber bands So when zero rubber bands were attached how far did that One One inch Does that make sense to you So when there s zero rubber bands attached you figure out one inch Alright let s demonstrate that Let s see Can I see that for one sec please Okay let s go back to before we started Zero rubber bands attached what s happening Okay what s happening right now Zero rubber bands Did he already move one inch No So Does the y intercept come in No No You said Because you just told me it was five inches of three Yeah What are we discussing now The data or the equation for the Okay Now so does this y intercept make sense No Zero rubber bands are removed So does the y intercept have real world meaning No Does the slope have real world meaning Yeah Did I know your y intercept wasn t gonna have real world meaning Yes No because there s some people today that actually have real world meaning What would be a y intercept if it made sense Zero zero Zero zero Zero rubber bands equals Zero inches Zero inches What were you saying your slope was So let s discuss three The slope is three what s the real world meaning How many rubber bands would you need in your description Grabbing one rubber band does that make sense Okay now so now what anout your y intercept would be at 12 Now you gotta figure Let s discuss this right here Now I think you re thinking ahead But this line looks like it s crossing up here to Where is it crossing It s crossing at We re going up three look three six seven Yeah I was looking like around four So let s discuss this You have six That could be perfect but we know the exact way a line likes to go Let s go with Monique six What s that saying Let s go to a pair to the y intercept Zero pair zero six So what does that mean So write that down zero pair zero six for the y intercept And what s that actually mean Zero rubber bands in front of the six equals how many inches So this was the figure Zero rubber bands attached does that make it already move six inches Does that make any sense at all So does the y intercept have real world meaning Could it still have real world meaning You were thinking ahead I think when you drew your line Because what s the only y intercept that makes sense here Zero rubber bands 81 inches But you didn t move But does that mean you can decide I want to make real world meaning and just draw my line down the zero Because what am I looking for The equation for the line of Is yours the equation for the line now Your y intercept makes sense If you knew the equation for the y intercept You plug in 81 inches for X right Did you end up with a negative You re fine You what Minus what Oh minus one I wanna discuss it If you re y intercept is What s the order of pairs Zero negative one so what s the real world meaning What s that mean What s the zero represent Okay so zero rubber bands what s your y interception At zero rubber bands how far does it go now Negative one Did he already go one or did he reach it So does that make sense Zero rubber bands and he s already traveled one Does that make any sense So does the y intercept Does that mean your y intercept just didn t end up happening Yeah When you know how to use this it works With zero rubber bands how fast are you going Zero Zero Okay does that mean your data s all wrong No that s the way your numbers work Could you slope this out instead three What s that mean Three three what Four is still Five is So three Three what Let s go and do number five Distance so what would your distance be Inches So it s like three inches is over one So that makes sense So does your slope have real world meaning Yeah Okay 
 About 33 33 so 150 plus 33 180 What d you get 180 180 so is that Did we double Went a little higher Went a little higher So you guys made a good prediction didn t you All right keep doing your trials nice work Heads up Madison Heads up Ah Can you stop it No you re good All right so what have you guys found out so far We ve been increasing but then we just It increased a little but I think we re gonna increase a little more Okay so you re measuring You ve all you ve raised your ramp to 10 Yes All right All right Now what was your prediction It would go farther based on height Because like from all the other experiments that we ve done Uh huh It s gone farther so And it has more force if the ramp is higher Okay Man that ambulance that thing moves All right what did you guys get Mary Robin when you measured We got 179 179 okay What was weird is that Like what s weird is that on the first trial we got 130 and then we went to like the like 50s and things Okay And then we went back to like the 80s and 90s Yeah All right so now we need to go ahead and do what You ve done your three trials what s the next Average Average All right let s see We got 182 172 and 179 533 533 and then what are you going to do Divide it by three Okay divide by three 177 666667 So we can round that up to To 178 178 Is that pretty close So you got Your trials are pretty close together 182 172 and 179 So you predicted that it would increase by raising the ramp Was that true Yes So your prediction came true Let s turn over the back side and let s finish the rest of that lab part So were there any trials that your team did not record We only did it We didn t do that one because it flipped off It like hit this chip card and it just like went whoo It went like All right that s a good one not to include Let s write that down We didn t include one because it hit a chip hard Yeah Yeah that s good It just like flew off to the side and it went all the way like Did it really Yeah it just That s crazy It was funny because It was also funny because it was going straight but then it just That s weird Turned That s weird that it hit that That that caused it to you know make such a turn But then like The whole time it s been going to the the right side Oh okay So it s been curving Yeah it kind of like tilted and That s a good idea Yeah that s a real good idea Okay so question two What was the average distance the Jeep rolled with the five centimeter height So the five centimeter height On the back side of that We got an average of 30 93 93 all right so write that one down 93 Did that surprise you it would go 93 Yeah Yeah Is that farther that s what you thought I never thought we d actually get to the end of it Yeah that s a But then we actually did with those little toy cars Yeah And this is actually an older looking toy car Yeah Because whenever I roll one wheel the other wheel rolls just a little Oh yeah Okay So you thought maybe the wheels would have something to do with it Yeah Okay But I never thought it would actually go that far Okay So you re now on number three right What was the average distance the Jeep rolled 10 centimeter height That was 178 Okay So 178 It looks like the next question is did the Jeep roll shorter or longer distance Longer Longer Can we figure out how much farther Yes What would we have to do The 10 centimeter average minus the 5 centimeter average and then your answer would be how Like the distance between Well why don t you do that Why don t you pull that up The 178 You know it s always better when you can incorporate those into your answers You know it increased by one Or it was 85 higher It s always better when you can show your answer with data When you can increase that it makes your answer seem more valid right All right so maybe can include that and then move on to that number five there Okay All right You guys are doing a great job Hey have you guys gone through everything you needed to do on the front side Did you read all these first You gotta read this whole section of your lab first okay Yeah so I would read this part first and then move on okay All right All right how you guys doing Good All right so you guys have done your first trial on this one Now did you do this one here I don t Let s look at our directions It says change the ramp back to five centimeters high Did you do that No sir Okay let s do that All right Sandpaper And then I think it Doesn t it say It says tile floor It says tile floor so we re going to measure on the tile I get to race it All right are we ready Now I m going to move over here Now what vehicle we got here You should move over there because it always goes over here Oh it always moves over here Yeah It has a curve Yeah How about if I move back over here Will that work All right you ready Right here Yeah that s good Oh you re right Good thing I moved I ll hold it down Hold that down Now in your first experiment Annie while they re doing this what did it When you increased the height of the ramp did it increase Yeah it went faster It went what It went faster because it had more force Okay so it had more force So why do you guys think by increasing the height of the ramp on the first lab it had more force All right It s more steeper Okay And the more steeper it is the more less friction it would cause so it could go faster Okay What was the force that was bringing it down the ramp Gravity Gravity So you can you conclude from your model experiment that when you increase the steepness of the ramp the pull of gravity is greater Yeah because it s going more Okay all right It s going down going faster Okay And then when it gets if it gets down safely it ll just go farther because it has more speed Okay Great All right so we re on trial two aren t we Yes Let s do it Go You do have that it does have that curved roll Oh it landed on the On the back of it There s like a cargo of some sort in the back of it Is it is there a There s cargo in the 113 Wait wait hold on Let s double check What I would do maybe is bring your Jeep over Yeah but then it s 106 No but then it s Oh you re on the Are you going to the front Yeah Okay 113 yeah you re right No but then you re going at an angle And you don t let it go Yeah I mean either way I think you re going to get a As long as you That s the way we re doing it from here Well you know as long as you do the same thing every time then you should be consistent right Yeah All right one more roll right One more And then we have it yeah One more roll Jordan Here we go Then we have to add them all up Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun Dun dun dun dun dun The only thing is that Is that farther Don t you think it s farther Are we ready Maybe it s because of me Do you think you have anything to do with it Yeah You do huh Go Fire 117 How far 117 117 all right 117 So now wait Now Thiago the math whiz has to do his math All right so how do you find the average again We do We do We add them all up and then we divide it by the number of times you rolled it Okay let s do it So we rolled it three times You ready Let s find our average Pencil please Oh you guys aren t even using a calculator No we haven t been We only use it for the division Oh you only use it for the division Hey I like that Sometimes sometimes Sometimes we still need it What do you guys got 10 That s zero 10 To zero add up the Four and three So 340 So you re going to take 340 and then you re going to divide it Divided by three And Thiago can usually do that You get 113 3333333 All right well check it out on a calculator just to make sure Okay How can you do that in your head without a calculator I don t know Yeah but how do you do that What did you say the number was Thiago It was 113 33333 All right here we go It s 113 come on Thiago 113 333333333 He got it All right nice job man All right so 113 Is that pretty consistent though Yeah Yeah because we had a 113 Yeah you did And that was your middle score wasn t it Yeah And really if you take the thing And then we gotta do this one No never mind I think if you take four here and you put it here Yeah if you take three here put it here then you have one more here Yep All right So now what we re going to do it says to add sandpaper to the bottom of the ramp Which we did And predict whether it s going to go We ll have to redo those won t we Yeah So let s erase those because you had the ramp at how high 10 centimeters 10 and we needed to We need to have an equal trial We need to have it at the same distance right Yeah So the question is Sit up for me Jordan I know we got a lot of space here What are we going to Do you think it s gonna go shorter or a farther distance It s gonna go shorter Why Because there s more friction Sandpaper s rough so it creates more friction Okay Slow down the thing Okay what do you think When it slows it down it may slow it down and then it says the car starts to turn just because Just because it s our car goes out to the side so it goes more to the side All right Than it usually does What do you guys think Farther or shorter I think it ll go shorter because The gravity may be pulling it down but the sandpaper is really rough like Thiago said and it would like stop it to make it not move anymore It would like barely get off the paper Okay can you guys like Say you re riding your bike And you ride your bike on smooth pavement and then you ride it on a rough surface Is it easier to ride on the smooth or the rough Smooth The smooth right So can we use that to help us make our prediction It actually could be faster on the bumps more because if you hit a bump If you re going fast enough and you hit a big enough bump you could actually go in the air Okay maybe All right let s go and test this thing out and see if you guys are right Annie while we re setting up this lab can you go ahead and write your prediction And it looks like you need to grab your sandpaper there Now I can t sit here can I This is the bad seat I gotta move Well I say you sit It doesn t go very far anymore on the sandpaper All right well let s set it up there That one there right And that one there Four centimeters more All right let s look We went 113 With the sandpaper how far do you think it s gonna go Let s make a prediction I think it ll go maybe half that or even less than half that Okay so what would half of 113 be What s that close to I don t know I think that would be maybe 500 500 and No you want half of it Oh five okay Half of it 50 I think there you go 50 yeah 50 All right 52 51 point 50 point like Okay All right are we ready for the first roll Let s do it Let s get our first trial Here we go We re ready Wait who hasn t rolled Has Emma not rolled Okay all right good I like the way your group s working together there All right Here we go Oh Should we use that trial or should we try a different one Try again Let s try one more Maybe we can get that Well scoot it right over here And we could even scoot the sandpaper like there Yeah All right you ready All right there it is It didn t even move off the sandpaper Let s give it Can someone hold that down Can someone hold that down please Here we go This is our test Is the prediction right The sandpaper s hard It is it s rough isn t it Yeah 49 Now aren t you on the front Yeah which would be a 49 Yeah but you mean Or maybe you re about 50 Yeah about 50 You guys were pretty close in your prediction weren t you Half It was like 50 Yeah Jordan said 50 1 2 All right you guys got two more trials right I said 51 1 2 You said 51 1 2 All right ready Yeah Oh man Really Let s like keep it down Or maybe we ll hold it down next time yeah Yeah I think that s the problem It s scooting back That was 50 47 Yeah 47 Okay Almost in half All right I ll hold it on this side Are we ready Here we go

 Okay would the person who is currently writing please stand up Alright nice and loud What did you guys put And why Nicholas Carnatkey created the perfect tangent of calculating all the key transient effects on the core to predict to create the perfect amount of work Okay very good John nice and loud Marie Curie Okay Discovered that radiation Okay What about you guys Alright Two claps for these neighbors Sit down Pass the board one person What would be this is an opinion question what do you think would be the result if scientists didn t communicate their findings to the community at large Go Do we need to write this down on the board Just give a bullet sentence Do we have to pick a scientist for this one To prove it Nope This is just an opinion Just give me like a one word bullet would be fine Okay Pass the board one person And would that person please stand up Troy what did you guys have There would be multiple theories on how things worked Society would be stagnant and Newton s hypothesis Newton was actually asked by a college of scientists about the thoughts of gravity and stuff and he didn t think it was important So when he found out a few months before that he didn t publish it until they asked him about it and then he republished to them so they could hang out with everybody else Okay Excellent What do you guys have There would be no uniform units therefore there would be no real way to judge one s discovery and you couldn t really bounce one idea off another Okay What d you guys have We said that we wouldn t have the technology that we have today because scientists tend to go off of what other scientists have done Because I know that Celsius went off of Newton s ideas of how the poles were flat and so he went on an expedition and found out that they were Okay Very good Alright Two claps for all our neighbors Pass the board one person Okay I like this one If you could interview any of the scientists that we ve looked at today who would it be and what one question would you be sure to ask Okay Go Okay Stop right there Pass the board one person Please stand up Please stand up Who s going from this group Andy Super Okay Nice and loud Let s use active listening John who would you guys pick and what question would you ask Marie Curie I said it right And what question would you ask dear If she got any oppression from the male scientists Okay The oppression from the male scientists I like it What about you guys We would ask Thomas Edison What inspired you to create the phonograph Excellent Okay Back there Who would you pick and what We were also going to ask Thomas Edison to see how other people felt about his invention of light bulbs Of the light bulb specifically Okay Brandon We had Albert Einstein and our question would be how did he come up with all his theories if he couldn t pass high school math Okay What d you guys put We picked Oppenheimer and we would ask why he went into this If he realized what he actually made You probably can t see it but they have written on the board The Manhattan Project Okay Very good And you guys Oppenheimer What his thoughts were of the morality of the atomic bomb Okay This is a really great segway to what we re going to do next Big claps for all these guys Please move into your catwalk formation Find a partner Go In ten Without the boards Just yourself Just your bodies Nine Eight

Since this one is kind of a shifting gears one I want to let you volunteer Did anybody have a really good answer that their partner gave Yeah Interference from the church Okay Definitely a social issue If they don t have their research believed they could not receive funding or just get shunned basically If it disagrees with what the society basically believes in Okay So you could be shunned

the question What evidence can you cite from today s scientists that we ve discussed where something microscopic something you can t see was being sensed or manipulated What is an example of the scientists we learned today hold on just one sec What is an example of something the scientists we learned about today hold on hold on hold on I had a request to restate the question What is an example from the scientists we learned about today using sensing or manipulating something that is microscopic or can t be seen Okay Now go We certainly cannot see that Except on the macroscopic level we can see the results of it Brandon decided to use a lifeline called phone a poster So Brandon what was your answer I found on Thomas Edison found radio waves Okay Very good Face me please Emily what

manipulate our natural world What is your opinion of scientists manipulating using for our benefit our natural world Okay Go Okay Face me Nice and loud so everyone can hear Brian what did your group discuss We thought it all depended on humanism How they thought the humanism in relation to all the other creatures of the world that they feel like they re higher than all the other creatures then they can do what they want to the natural world Okay So as long as it s being used for good I guess Okay With the benefit of humans or the world in general Kind of a socialist view The world In general Okay John what did you guys say Yeah what did we say Pretty much the same thing The same thing pretty much Okay So are you specifically looking at human needs or more global Human Okay What about you guys What did you partnership talk about That it was okay to a point There was a point when you should not manipulate the natural world Like taking a dolphin from one ocean and moving it to another Okay So who should decide what those points are I don t know Okay Alright That segways us to the next question If you were Let s see let s do this The person with the most buttons on is going to answer this question Okay If you were the scientific consultant to President Barack Obama what percentage of our National Budget should be spent on science and why Justify that amount Go It s a percentage So we re not talking a dollar amount What percentage Well it doesn t really matter Do you think half of our budget Do you think a third of our budget You think a quarter of our budget I don t know You could delineate that Okay I could tell by looking at you guys that we ve got a couple of folks that feel kind of passionately about this so spread back apart and face me What did you guys say Well I said that 15 is a good amount because then it puts enough money forward to get going and leaves money for other things that we need Okay Now you guys had a very specific take on it What did you guys talk about We talked about if medical if the percentage was accounting for medical sciences as well as it should and if it is then the percentage should be increased to help Like 50 to 60 if medical is included Okay So we have to look at the different kinds of research Are we just studying stuff to study stuff Are we developing a technology that will help human need Are we looking at medical Alright Very good Take the catwalk Take the catwalk On the catwalk They do their little turns on the catwalk On the catwalk Okay Of the science of the person We haven t scooted Oh scoot down I

 Okay so for social needs we said that their social needs are being met because they They look like the slave traders can talk to each other because they speak the same language but the slaves don t so their social needs with each other aren t So you feel your social needs are being met Yeah And how so Because our person can talk to Cause you have people to talk to don t you Yeah Anybody agree with that I agree because our person You I am You re that person Don t say my person cause that s you I can talk to other people So you do have some social interaction So there s some disagreement there as social needs are being met or not No hands Nita jump in We cannot So your social needs are not being met Yes our social needs are not being met because we They do not understand each other meaning like deaf Or they cannot talk So how does that make you feel Go ahead and talk about your emotional needs now being met or not being met Our emotional needs are not being met right now I think I disagree I think ours are kind of being met I agree with Lauren s Ours are being met because they re more happy that they re gonna get a lot of money You re the person But our person is kinda serious like he doesn t really want So as far as what Nita s already talked about Emotionally So are your emotional needs being met He looks angry You feel safe you re good to go Yeah cause we know we re She s like I don t really want to go but They want the money But we want money We want all the money Well it s the physical needs anyway Ours Ours are not being met Ours are being met cause we get weapons and everything all good food I agree And ours are also being met You don t want to mess with them Yeah I disagree with both of you guys because ours are not being met at all Definitely not We are like We re starving Starving My needs are not being met if I m Ashley because I m scrunched together I m uncomfortable My physical needs aren t being met because it s crowded and my muscles ache Does anyone agree with that That their physical needs are not being met I agree that Ashley s physical needs aren t being met because they are scrunched together and it looks like they re in chains and they don t have much Are your physical needs being met Yes Our physical needs are being met because I disagree with you because I think you have space Our physical needs are being met We re not like You re in good shape With your physical needs being met how does that link to emotional and social needs How do those kind of all go together Talk about how those all go together overall and how does that make you feel based on this picture You re that person so use first person point of view and discuss how those are all intertwined And then add to your conversation as far as I know some of you did the bottom two as far as not These are what are being met and these are not being met So make sure you cover those two okay How they all intertwine or if they do And then you can discuss these bottom questions too Even if you didn t get to them with your partner jump in now with each other I ll be right back Alright so My emotional needs are being met I m earning the money that I should be and I feel confident All of our emotional needs all of our needs are being met Why are the clothes taken off and why are the Just in case Emotional needs are not they do jump overboard being met It looks like they re sad because because we look depressed And you can just tell it by the faces and what they look like Our faces and their and our body language And there was and we re scared because we see the weapons and we don t know what they re gonna do with it to us So think about the cause and effect of that Our emotional kinda was being met Are the people standing up No But how are they not chained Still all of our emotional needs are being met They re running away They don t look worried they look kind of like they re looking at the scenery kind of They look calm In their expression they look calm yeah They don t look worried or anything These people but the people that are sitting down I disagree with Alan cause they look calm and confident I kinda disagree with that because they look like That s why they re all facing different directions They re watching for anything suspicious They re all looking in different directions They aren t smiling like they re looking at beautiful scenery There s like little sections in between so like Grayson said if they do jump overboard they don t all fall over and tip the boat Do you think these people are all in one group No let me rewind and say my question again Do you feel that these people all everybody in this boat was represented by a perspective from your discussion you just had Do you understand my question I m not saying it very well Were roles of all these people in the boat given to at least somebody in this group Yeah You think so How were the roles different I think there s bosses and then there was slaves Like slave traders and them Kind of serious like they just got their reward and these people they look kind of like chained I don t think they re running away I think they re running away I think they re going to a bigger boat cause these people look like I think they re like That s not the full canoe And they re just taking the slaves to the big boat So let me say my question again Let me say my question again Why would slaves take slaves They re slave traders They re not slaves How do you know they could be slaves or they could be slave traders Let me say my question again I want you to think about your role and what was just said Do you think that all roles that I gave this group were I m sorry are on this picture No Oh you re changing your mind Discuss that At first you said yes Discuss that why maybe not all the roles that I gave you were on this picture No do not say your role yet Ladies and gentlemen we have about one minute I think that they are people in the tribe and they re giving their slaves as slaves You know how we were doing that worksheet the graphic organizer It said that most of the time they would just trade other villages for their slaves and take those ones Well I think Cause they could still have their own slaves I think this is a slave trader well not really like a slave trader but like Cause the slave traders a slave boss kind of were from England so I think they d have white skin I think they re with the other people But remember African Americans were also slave traders Because they re not chained and they re standing and the other people like slaves are all tucked together and depressed I think that some European traders tried to persuade other slave people to say like go get your crime people go get your crime people Slaves Yeah your slaves in your own tribe and then we ll trade you Gold A bag of tobacco And those helped capture So even though they don t have white skin they might be slave traders and they give like So we have two different maybe perspectives of slave traders is that what I m hearing you say One being They could have also been threatened to work Europeans Hold that thought David One being Europeans and one being African Well not really African American Cause in the book it said that the African slaves not the European slaves but the African slaves their slaves were kinda like maids So I want you to think about the role that you were given And I asked you to look at that picture from that perspective Is it possible that that specific role I gave you has many different perspectives itself Yes Alright I want you to wrap up your conversation if you have anything else to add and then we re gonna continue tomorrow You re not gonna tell Not yet no I changed my mind You think you know You think you know We still have the cards Aw rats They did it

 Take a look at that goal just to remind yourself whatever it is you re going to be working on And this we want to remind you that it s kind of dinner party conversation ish You agree with people at dinner parties You disagree with people at dinner parties but it s civil because it s friends that you invited over to your house You don t raise your you don t raise your hand at dinner parties You wait until you wait until You wait until someone else is finished speaking before you start speaking of course because that s polite dinner conversation You add on to what one another says But like I said we don t necessarily have to agree And then when the topic starts to die down at a dinner party somebody else brings something else up So you can raise your own questions as well So the seminar is open and my question to you guys is who you think is most to blame for the deaths that occurred at the end of The Veldt What did it mean like George having like I think that I know a lot of times where he especially in the towards the back he it goes back a little ways He s like talking a lot of things like comments turning comment commen I can t say that word He says they re going to turn the house down possibly for a month and how he pick out the picture painter And he was telling his he was like talking to his son a lot and like about not about doing what his son would not want to have happen and how he spoiled his children so much So he takes out there s a lot of things that his son his son and daughter it just doesn t say as much wouldn t like because yeah But he wasn t like he wasn t like I agree that Oh yeah I m gonna go die today I agree that it was He didn t want to die I agree that it was Of course he didn t want to die Who wants to die Except for if you re suici you know suicidal I agree that and on Page 15 where it says um it s mostly on 16 but starts on Page 15 Won t this house and this room replace you and your wife and your children s affections It assumes their mother and father grow more important in their lives than their real parents and now you want to come along and shut it off Kind of shows why that they hate them And because it because it s since the nursery is their parents it s like some guy who thinks he can tell you coming along and can tell you to kill your parents you know It s the same thing as they re doing though They re killing their parents Well But they think the nursery is their parents they don t think their parents are their parents They don t matter as much as parents If they d been nice to them and now they re going to turn everything off then isn t it imbalanced So now they re relying on the house because that s what they ve learned to do as Yeah It d be like take an example people are killing their parents And on Page 15 it says like I also think that it s the dad says I sen The psychologist says I sensed only that you had spoiled your children more than most and now you re letting them die in some way So if they like they don t really know like when someone says no to them they ve been spoiled so much they don t even like well they just can t take it It makes them go all crazy and stuff So they wanted to kill them because they like couldn t fly to New York so Yeah Because I think And if their parents and if their parents and if they felt that their parents were actually their parents then maybe not But since their parents don t really take care of them it s the house that takes care of them Yeah And then the The house and the room replaced their parents Yeah Their parents and friends It s not like the parents could They don t have friends because they re the room they get all these adventures because of the room Yeah They don t have friends And they kind of like rely on the house to give them stuff all the time If the house refused them if it could then I don t think that they would want to kill it I think that it s just because they don t feel like their parents are actually their they don t they feel their parents aren t important to them So when they say no On page on page 13 the mom s saying That sounds stressful Would I have to tie my own shoes instead of letting the shoe tier do it And brush my own teeth and comb my hair and give myself a bath The kid s like now relying on everything He s never had to do something for himself So he doesn t really like know Yeah He s gotten so like stuck on having everyone do things for him he thinks like doing your own thing would be like A challenge Yeah Like and I guess you can use an example as Wall E a show People get like so fat and they rely on everything so much that like they have to move in chairs and they when you golf it s virtual golf there s a robot for you So they just they take robotics and machines to the next level and they it s all they rely on And so many people don t have to work Yeah and weren t the ones that like bought the house that they were actually the cause because they were the ones like on Page 5 and 11 they even said that We were the ones who bought the house We were the ones who got us into this mess So but then all of a sudden they just took it away from their children which made them mad So again they were the one who was causing all this madness in the house I think it Like don t you think that people would be sort of obese like Elliot said Yeah They would be They would be Yeah but then they d be like everyone else in the world But then they also Yeah and Getting exercise But they re obese And also I think that it s George Hadley s fault not necessarily both the parents because the mom didn t really do as much Because like well the quote over there it said that like she s the one who let them in for a minute But She just wanted to be nice She just wanted to be nice But I think like on Page two it says But nothing s too good for our children George said So I don t think it s as much Lydia s fault because she also tries to get them out of the house instead of just staying there She just wanted to be nice to the kids because George had shut it off so abruptly But I think it s more George s fault that they spoiled them and that therefore gets himself killed Does anyone know when this story was written Because I m guessing it was 1950 All right Because I was I m guessing it was wri I was guessing it was written when women weren t like thought of that highly Because Wendy only actually speaks once and is a sniveling idiot most of the time And Lydia s and Lydia Hadley is pretty passive And it s the guys that are have all the action and have anything really going on Except in the final scene Well yeah But that she on She says one line One line in the whole book basically I know but Lydia sort of has a bit of action Yeah but She doesn t do much She doesn t like She s pretty passive She doesn t like um disagree with her husband or her kids She doesn t do anything like that She just follows whatever her husband says Maybe she has a few opinions but not really And Wendy says four words alone in the whole thing so Well I mean you hear her screaming but other than that Is that a word Well that was Unless she s saying it Close enough at the same time as Peter like when they both come in and say Hello mom and dad Doesn t really count or when they both say Mommy daddy come quick But she s saying it at the same time She only says four words by herself in the entire story The screams are actually their parents when the kids were pretending in the nursery that their parents were being Yeah they realized that at the end but they didn t really make that very clear They re like suddenly they realized why those screams sounded familiar I thought the whole book or the whole story that it was like the kids screams But it s actually the parents What are Yeah because it s really not clear on that I figured that it s actually so they all Well I m it s more it s nicer to have like a mystery kind of Mm hmm Yeah I figured that it s the author s fault The what The author s But How is it the author s fault Because it s his story Well the author wrote it That doesn t make any sense But Carl the author Yeah that doesn t make much sense It s not his fault It s the it s totally off topic Yeah I agree with Elise When I didn t really get who the screams were until the very end where they said yeah that I think it s on Page um 19 But yeah that they were it says on Page screamed and suddenly they realized why those screams had sounded so familiar So I thought it was the kids the whole time I thought Aaron was saying something before but then everyone What I was going to say is the a little while ago when I was going to ask you why do people think it s like Peter Hadley or other because I mean The other is both of them Because more or less the majority did George Hadley So why just those people who did that why did they do that I understand with Peter Hadley because it is his he seems to have the main role of actually murdering the parents But it s not his fault he got spoiled He can t help it if his parents spoiled him Yeah because Actually even if the parents had been played more of a parent role they would still probably have preferred the nursery because You don t need to the parents could still say no and the nursery does they can like do whatever they want with it I agree with the both parents part of it even though the mom wasn t as involved as George was the mother was not do posing a part in the kids life as being the mom and the house was So that caused them to think the house was their parents and the house was their family This is Indirectly directly I think You can go Directly the Peter was probably most responsible for the parents dying Directly Directly But indirect well directly the lions were Oh my God Indirectly but directly it was mostly Peter but indirectly it was it was kind of everybody s fault I kind of agree with like both the parents and then the dad Because in the beginning the parents are like slowly taking away some things like the painter and not letting them go to New York And that kind of builds up their anger But in the end the dad just wants to shut it all off And then the son starts getting really mad and like threatening them finally they like get really mad and then they start imagining the parents dying and then They ve been imagining the parents dying through the whole thing I think it was the parents fault and the inventor Because I mean none of it would have happened if they wouldn t have had the just like the super technology house and the nursery So it s technology s fault It s not the inventor s fault because he didn t know But it s not the it s not the inventor s fault that they thought though If he wouldn t have made it it would have never happened And also if the dad wouldn t have bought it it would never happened too So that s my two opinions They couldn t But they bought it but they made it and bought it to be a good thing not a bad one No one invented it so that you would so that it d be used as a murder machine They didn t just make it like on the advertisement Greatest Murder Machine Ever Perfect for murdering your parents We don t know like why he built it Maybe it was because of that but you don t know like exactly what his point of the invention was It was to like study the children s thoughts It was to study their minds Because the children He said that but what if it s not He s a liar The children were mentally impaired and they needed to be looked up on and they wanted to know what they were thinking so So a psychologist Another good quote to show that it was to show that it might have that it could have been the parents fault was that on Page 11 it said yeah George said Who was it that who was it said Children are carpets They should be stepped on occasionally Because the parents didn t they didn t do anything to the kids They They didn t really step on them that much until the end They just did what they want They just all of a sudden just like flattened them Yeah they just did it so abruptly Yeah they just started and let it go It was just like bam you re dead No wonder they wanted them dead Guys let s try and talk one person at a time or else we can t hear My turn Okay On Page 15 it says that the dad went from Santa Santa to Scrooge And like if he would have taken away like one thing at a time over a period of time I don t think the kids would be like like killing them But it says he just took all the good stuff away at once and they got like really mad That s also kind of dangerous though Because they started getting mad at him as soon as they took away the picture painter So it was they still could ve gotten mad It s also more dangerous for the parents to actually slowly take them away because they get more and more mad All the anger I have another opinion that I was trying to say but then I let Fiona go first That s not fair No that s not it s my fault All the anger built up because Anyway um

 Has more light around him and it goes off into this huge dark hole through the trees Why do you think it s more light around him I don t know Just to show that to bring him more into the main point that you should see when you look at the picture What is the dark force symbolizing Why is it a dark force Why isn t it like a bright light Yeah I don t know It kind of reminds me of what Jack said Dante started going through the forest It kind of reminds me of his travel of starting to go to the layers of hell and stuff Hell s not a very bright place so it reminds me of that One thing the light and religious paintings Jesus has a light around his head so it might symbolize how he s pure or more religious But What d you say I said but Dante isn t pure so why would they highlight someone who wasn t as pure as like Jesus Okay so I want to come your statement in a moment because Kailyn had something to offer Why do you say he s not pure Is there any indication that he s not pure Well it s kind of an inference because he s man We all assume that the purity is in God or Jesus or Buddha or whatever He s not because he s man and men have faults Women have faults A human being is just not divine I guess But it says in the text that he gets angry with people who are not true to their religion and their beliefs politically and religiously So he kind of is the most pure one Not like Godlike but he is more pure than the rest I believe So do you think that s why Dante went to hell in the first place To go see all the bad people Do you think he was going there to learn a lesson Or going there to prove that he was right Because remember this is a fictional This is fictional So can a character cause you re right we infer that man is sinful But can a fictional character be perfect Can be flawless Can be sinless And if so is Dante trying to go a different way of inference Is he trying to infer that he is from what you ve said that he wants to find out more of what sins are so he can make himself pure if he s not already So can a fictional character be pure One of the questions I think was the three beasts he encounters and what do they represent I kind of thought that they represented what he does or what he did and everything Like a wake up call You re going to go see all of these people who have done things similar to that so you kind of want to change your ways They were reminding him what he has done and what he did because he was violent because he was in that guild kind of thing He was considered a fraud by the other team I guess side So I think it s more of a like he s going to there to see what happens when you don t be the best you could be I guess Who judges where you go Is it the devil or is it a higher power I thought it was the gods that judged that Are there gods in this story Do we ever hear much about the gods We aren t sure about the gods Yeah really Who judges where all these people go Cause they re talking about all the famous people and the places they are but who decides that We didn t really read the hell part as opposed to the Yeah yeah So maybe in the other books it would explain Where the gods are And you said who judges where they go and everything Technically we don t know what supreme being judges that because all we know is the devil is on the bottom eating Brutus Cassius and Judas But in the book on page 41 lines 8 9 Minos is the one who discover the crimes and dictates where they go So he s kind of like boss of hell sort of Forty one lines eight and nine I have a question Are their crimes so bad to the point that they go to hell or is it just because they made like sins or something Because everybody makes them so would that make everybody go to hell That s what I find too Meaningful But in their own perspective they are different Individual yeah So do you think that the layers of hell are how bad of the thing that the person did like how far What do you think depends on how far you go down Like the pain increases One of my questions are are the punishments of different people different based on who they are or what they do I think it s what they do but through their actions they can kind of be defined as who they are I think the layers of hell go down as the pain and suffering increases related to their crimes Couldn t it be like their pain and suffering for all of eternity is based off of all the pain and suffering that they had caused others in life For instance in Limbo All these babies that had died and weren t baptized are now there but they hadn t really hurt anybody so they re not being quite as punished as let s say Judas who s in the center of hell having his head gnawed on He caused a lot of pain and suffering therefore we was given a greater punishment for what he had done So it depends on who they put it on Yeah So if they just keep it to themselves Like gouging out the eyes That s not really hurting anyone else Right Where s the gouging of the eyes Where did you just pull that from What piece did we read where the eyes were gouged out Oh I m sorry I got confused Oedipus Oedipus He punished himself for it in a weird way But do you think that his punishment would not go as far because he didn t torture other people Think before you respond Think about it because I want you to respond to this This is huge I want you to write your question down on a piece of paper and then their responses to it because you have probably just now created a thesis for an essay we re going to do for the end of the year Okay So write down your question Mainly she has brought up just like I heard you guys doing with these pictures a different text Didn t you bring up the Odyssey with this Yeah Do you want me to write Oedipus specifically Yep write down the gouging of Oedipus eyes Where would Oedipus have ended up in Dante s Inferno Okay so pretty much Yep And I want you guys to answer and then I ll move on and come back I love how you bring in another text That s one reason I brought this picture in so you guys hit on that I love that you brought this up This is real higher order thinking because at the end of this year our essay for you guys for the final is to bring in the texts that we ve read and you have to develop a theme so right there s a good start Okay you ready for them to answer it Yeah Okay The pain that Oedipus caused wasn t intentional So I don t really think he d be punished as harshly I do believe that he d be punished due to the fact that he did kill his father and I believe a couple other people during that fight So he would be punished but I don t believe that the gouging of his eyes would lessen any of the punishment Cause really he didn t knowingly go into the incest and do that intentionally So really he shouldn t be punished for something that he didn t know he was doing But he still killed somebody He did kill somebody And the gouging of his eyes I don t think would lessen that I think it was more of a pain in life lesson for him Although It did cause him a lot of pain I believe the guilt that he faced caused him greater pain than his actual gouging of his eyes May I clarify something really quick here So you re saying basically because she asked where in hell would he be So f irst of all what level do you think he d be Gouging eyes or not where would he be in hell Where would Dante run into him He would be with the murderers With the murderers okay So you re saying that he wouldn t be any more in depth than that simply because of his gouging No That is just his own Retribution Yeah He did that to lessen the guilt in his life In himself Cause the guilt was much more painful than him gouging out his eyes And also even delivering pain to yourself can get you in hell with like suicides Right Cause there s the whole ring where like people kill themselves and they go to hell Or they destroy their possessions I didn t quite understand it completely but it seemed to say destroying items that they had I don t know maybe a couch or something If you destroyed that you d go to hell because they destroyed their own items Right right In Circle Nine and that s what important about this in Circle Nine those people that destroyed or take from You know you have Canna after Cain Everything is allegorical Every part of Circle Nine there s an allegory There s Ptolemy there s Cain Everybody is compared or made allegorical in there for their sins Because of what they did to humanity Like Ptolemy murdered people in his In his He was a ruler He just murdered people Mass murders So he was put in there as a comparison to that kind of sin That Hitler type of sin So everybody in that level too Which would be interesting to see Talk about some of our other literature Talk about The Odyssey a little more I have one more question about sin Do you think is everyone s definition of sinning the same Actually I don t believe so We were just talking how everybody lies but how are some still in Limbo Goes along with what he said was no I didn t steal so you stole and then you lied Yeah So you double dipped So you half and did different things Oh interesting so what d you come to We came to they d go to the serious one Yeah Whichever one s more serious Why Basically the one thing that impacted the world more like in a bad way is going to take the worse punishment So if I stole a penny or I lied to the king I d probably get punished for lying to the king That s what we kind of came up with Yeah So I want to ask you a question If you re saying you lied and then you lie about lying or you steal and you lie about lying I don t steal sorry Yeah they re two crimes and this person has chosen to commit two crimes Okay so does that play into that Would you suffer twice the punishment then No it doesn t bring up any of that in Dante s Basically everybody s got the same punishment But still wouldn t you get like harsher Well depending on the circle Yeah but some people in the circles do have worse punishments than other people Will you give me an example Well let s see Ulysses and I forget the other guy s name they are in the same flame and I think he said the flame was burning brighter I would assume that d be a worse punishment than other people if they re burning If they re burning yeah Some of the less worse um lesser punishments It s like magicians get their heads turned backwards You could see where you ve been but you wouldn t cry over it Unless getting stabbed to death and then healing and then getting stabbed to death again Yeah Then your flesh getting eaten off over and over and over again Yeah Yeah I want to ask you guys a question because we ve studied pictures all year long and there was one when we were studying Oedipus And I don t know who in this group had this one when you were doing those folders together but there is what is her name Antigone s brother s name that was dead Polynices Yeah Polynices Was it the one where she was like leaning over his body Yeah by the rock Yeah Okay now that you ve read The Inferno do some of those photos from some of these other stories and poems tie together or relate or reoccur I can relate Okay talk to me about that Because it reminds me of Dante being lost in the forest in the beginning and then it reminds me of how Oedipus gouged his eyes out and couldn t see anything and so he didn t know which path to take He had to rely on somebody else He had to rely on Virgil to get him through what was to come Then Oedipus he had to rely on Antigone to tell him where to go and trust her with his life basically Nice Nice That s what I got Well as I walk away I want you guys cause I m going to leave this here I want you guys to talk about other literature Cause you said yes I can relate some You just did I would like for you to relate All right Okay Okay

with one book you re going to write the distance that your car moved Now don t write 20 inches cause yours is going to be different okay You write how far your car went for ramp number one Okay Hold on just a second Isabelle Now I gave you guys numbers And the numbers are so that we all get a chance to do every part of this experiment The number one person is going to set up the ramp So they re going to put the dictionary and the ramp get it all set up for the group The number two person is going to get to hold the car and let it go okay And then the number three person is going to measure the distance that it went okay Close attention Okay so you re going to all have a job to do Now this is with the one dictionary When we do the experiment next we re going to try it with two dictionaries and see how it changes okay But for right now we re going to try just one dictionary Are there any questions before we get started Miguel Like the first one goes first and then on the second thing like you try to set the number one does the second job and the second person does the number three and the number three does the number one job Yes so everyone is going to get a chance to do every single part of the experiment okay So we don t need to fight over who gets to do the car and who can get that okay Isabelle question But what if we do the same each of us what we do Oh if that s what you get if you get 20 inches on yours then you write that down okay Yes Angie When you took No we re all going to talk to each other in nice friendly voices that s right Okay Max last question and then we need to get started Are we going to use the rulers Yes you re going to use the rulers And I know I didn t give those to the groups but I m going to pass those out right now okay Can I have you guys please quietly walk with your papers and your pencil to your group Who s going to set up the ramp Me Okay you re number two Start it in the corner It s a meter Come on over here Okay get your paper No but watch out Don t do it Awesome Okay boys and girls once you get to your group you can go ahead and get started It looks farther And this group you may use this ruler Okay measure it One right here and then here Are you okay No from here From there there No Ms Sprano said from here Nine inches No 11 11 11 inches It looks like eight Wait is oh no it s eight Remember what Ms Sprano said No she said from the front Actually I said from the back Good listening Miguel So how far did the car go Eight inches Eight inches okay excellent So write down your information You ve got a pencil right here Okay so the next step Isabelle Miguel and Angie Is you re going to try it with two dictionaries Okay But number three is going to set it up Look up at the chart to see who s going to set it up So who s setting it up Um number two Okay let s figure it out Okay now go to your group for a second Okay now is this how far going to Yea till we go Well wait a second are we measuring from the top of the ramp or are we measuring from the bottom So you re going to put the ruler right up next to the edge of the ramp and then measure to the end of the car So how far did that car go Five No it s to the end of the car So how far did the car go Two Two inches Now do you guys think that because you re on a thicker carpet that s going to change your results It should go up like that Do you think that the thicker carpet is going to slow the car down and make it not go so far Yes Yeah Would you guys like to move to that part of the carpet Yeah Okay you can move to that carpet and see what the difference is And you guys will have to share that with the class okay So try it again with just one dictionary okay So then one Have to let the car go guys We re going to try it with two dictionaries Okay so look at the chart to see who s going to set it up next Oh my God this is going to be loud We re good Ms Sprano She said from the very back You set it up No I mean you let go Who s turn is it You re doing the first one Who s number three We all have jobs to do Who s number one Okay so your job is to set up the ramp which you did a good job on Number two person who s the number two person So Giselle I m number three No she was two It s fine she s number three So Giselle you re going to let the car go and look Esmeralda is going to measure Okay so Excellent Okay now put that down Now which side do we need to start with Very good And then we can spin it around there So now you want to move it over so that you can measure at the end of the carpet Can you scoot it over some Very good so how far did the car go Seven inches good Okay so let s write that down on our chart Finish yours Change this so it s seven inches Okay now what s our next step what are we going to do next I don t know Are we going to try it with two dictionaries Okay so now who s going to set that up Looks like the number two person so Giselle is going to go ahead and set up the dictionary so put one more dictionary on top Okay good Well number three is going to let the car go So now it s Esmeralda s turn So you guys what do you think is going to happen Do you think it s going to go farther or do you think it s going to be closer When you let go of the car right now what do you think is going to happen You think it ll fall down Okay well let s see what happens Woah did you see how far that went Okay don t pick it Now wait a second it s Edgar s turn to measure So let s see how far did it go Edgar So we measure to the 14 Wow that went farther didn t it So your next step is going to be to do it with three dictionaries Please go sit down in your group and raise your hand Let s go sit down at our group The car s there 15 and a half 15 and a half 15 and a half Who knows how to write 15 and a half So number two would get to measure the distance on this one okay Okay so let me see how you re doing here Okay well can we try it again Can we try it again So you re on the second experiment So number three who s the number three person He is Jose s the number three person Okay so Jose get s to let it go Should we move this out of the way or should we keep it here So are you number three No I m number one but number one set it up But then see Oh Okay so it looks like it s Jose s turn to let the car go So hand the car No he sets up ramp Can you go sit down please and I ll be right with you Got it Okay Jose try it It s my car put it right here and let s see what happens Okay let go Excellent okay who s measuring Me Okay so let s measure Now do we want it are we measuring with inches or centimeters No it s right we re doing it the right way Don t worry Did it go farther or was it closer Okay so then I have a question for you guys listen If we put three dictionaries here do you think it s going to go farther or it s going to go closer Farther You think it s going to be farther What do you think Jose Farther What do you think Farther Well okay we better check it out Did you write down your numbers So for the second one it was 15 inches Okay Now we re on the last part that means the number three person sets up the ramp Are you the number three person So set up the ramp where s your other dictionary Okay so then we have to use the dictionary okay Can you let go Okay it s oh wow that might be pretty cool huh Okay so Devon it s your turn to let the car go And I like how you re moving all the stuff out of the way Selena you want to stay there or do you want to move Oh okay So who s turn is it to measure Again No number one gets to You know what I think we mixed it up Now Selena lets go of the car And Devon measures this time okay Did you okay so maybe it s Jose s turn Okay go ahead Ooh look how much it turned Okay so measure how far it went Okay so measure how far it went let s see what happened Do we move the 17 Try it again let s try it again Okay let s see how are you guys doing You got all yours finished Okay good Okay well I haven t gone over that Okay boys and girls raise your hand if your group had a chance to do all three experiments All three Okay 
 Isn t it nuclear fission when like fusion No fusion is when they combine Nuclear fission is like when they split apart right Yes so it s a fission process See Ah So that s a I see that that efficient Efficient It increases the safety though right It s impossible to explain No I m just saying does it No I don t understand Am I the only one here Apparently to you though So why is it that when the atom is unstable it s radioactive It could be it s removing protons and neutrons I think you guys can discuss this Isn t it when like it starts releasing the neutrons to a different atom or something and then it gains the neutron and that s when it starts becoming like More vulnerable More vulnerable and it starts like a chain reaction You guys agree I agree I agree I agree with everybody That s right So how can radiation help them Like Amy said It could also help in the electricity and helps us get our resources Like you said What else though Like cancer Cancer Cancer I mean I had an aunt that suffered from cancer and it kind of helped her even though she passed away It kept her longer than it would have been without her having medication Any last thoughts Okay that s fine thank you I have only one major I guess comment about that one I noticed Steve used a lot of vocabulary words He did remember a lot of the words and I think he planned for that And then I liked the way that David actually redirected the group He asked the group How can radiation help us right at the end and then people responded to that So he kind of helped redirect the questions for the discussion group So and then people were able to respond So that was a nice way to create a discussion Okay question number two Three Three I m sorry Okay I mean How about number four next Okay I m going to do number four next No Do number three The one with three No I m going to do four No I want to do three Okay number four is going to go next You have two minutes to prepare Number four Just ignore it What is that A microphone Oh it works So they can hear me right now Oh It s recording Well why do you think President Obama might support building nuclear power plants in the USA and what are some arguments for nuclear energy David put that away Okay Jane who s going to go next Me Jane Okay so which vocabulary and evidence are you going to focus on Nuclear power plant nuclear power plant Well pick several The nuclear yeah The nuclear power plant can help us create more energy I mean well it s Nuclear radiation for my argument You know what Dano was saying No He was just going to put power plants Do you know what it is Yeah it s where they Yeah Okay what does it do Creates energy Okay Okay what other evidence are you going to use though The fact that we are running out of well we re not running out of but in the future we might not be able to find enough energy So we need to start We need to start thinking about the future like Jobs and stuff No future things that are like the future and what s going to happen and energy and how are we going to have a good supply Like what if we were running out and start thinking about that Okay so the next person Okay so the people on the outside if you were recording the vocabulary last time I want the people on the outside to switch so that you re recording something different So if you did evidence first switch to vocabulary If you did vocabulary switch to evidence Oh Sindi sit like right here Okay this question is why do you think President Obama might support building nuclear power plants in the U S and based on the video we watched what are some arguments to be made for nuclear energy I think President Obama might support building nuclear power plants in the U S because it doesn t release chemicals therefore it s eco friendly making the U S more green Environmentally green I agree with her because another reason I think the president might support it is because like like right now we re in an economic crisis what you call the thing And then like making new plants may create more jobs for people It ll create jobs for building them and then it ll also benefit everybody for clean power I agree I agree because it builds economic stabilization and it ll create jobs for the future like for more years because in order to run a nuclear power plant you need you know like to build it And once it s built you still need to work with it so I think the job s going to last for a while I agree But if we re in an economic crisis like if we re in an economic crisis how are you going to pay for it Like where s the money going to come from Well we re already in debt so we ll get even more debt Yeah it costs a lot to build a nuclear reactor We d get funding Yeah And we have to like think about the future and how it s going to benefit you know for the economy and making more power plants would just provide like a stable future for the upcoming people and the jobs because it supplies more jobs and stuff And more you know we ll get more electricity You know if we build more nuclear power plants Yeah and not just 20 but more like the other countries who have 30 and stuff like that needs luxuries rising electricity demands It won t leave the U S behind and all the new tech stuff And the more factories and the more power plants we produce we make the more electricity and the more factories it will get more stuff It will build the more jobs and that will raise up the economic problems Yeah because more stuff will be done that way So now you guys have given a lot of arguments supporting nuclear energy What do you think is the biggest problem with nuclear energy that we should be aware of The thing that causes cancer Probably be the radioactive waste that the nuclear power plants give off Well they don t give it off the water the coolant or whatever And then like they don t have nowhere to store it I think it was some cave thingy that they were trying to build but they didn t build They re going to run out of space to put the waste in Also it s going to cause cancer to everyone But doesn t it cure cancer and stuff It has benefits but more like some freak accident can happen like what happened in Fukushima Or the third mile At the Three Mile Yeah So say you never know what can happen that s the downside Because if it does happen then it s like downhill from there because people start getting sick then their kids start dying and I don t know Yeah and like Giovanni said if we are in an economic crisis like where are we going to get the rest of the money We re just going to get it from debt and stuff like that We re going to help raise it up but we ll also fall more in debt Yeah Going back to the nuclear waste can someone elaborate on why is the nuclear waste such a problem Because it s just there Kevin I think nuclear waste will cause more wars and pollution That s what I think Cause more what It causes more war and pollution War Well I mean This isn t on camera right Okay someone else Wait what was the question again Elaborate on what is nuclear waste Nuclear waste Why is that such a problem for us Well it s a problem because there s nowhere where you could actually safely put it Other than like I think they have this I read something about they have an island where all the waste of nuclear waste goes That s the only place that you can like get rid of it Don t throw it in the ocean because it ll contaminate everything You can t just like leave it in the ground because then it ll probably like leak And also doesn t it if it rains if water gets in it it s dangerous So that s why they have to find a place where it s not like Why is it dangerous if water gets into it Soil I guess The waste and the water mix and then like it runs down into the soil and it might go into the ocean or the sewers and it ll mess up the ocean or like water And we end up drinking it And scientists are trying to find ways to get rid of the waste like they re thinking of shooting it out into space or anything One thing nobody talked about was half life What does the half life have to do with nuclear waste I think a bunch of years What does it have to do with Obama Say it louder What Say it louder We re talking about that noise Wait what was your question What does half life have to do with nuclear waste Half life nuclear waste So energy So why is nuclear waste bad exactly Oh because they haven t determined the amount of years of when the half life is I think they determined like So they so it was an estimate It wasn t actually a fact they just estimated that so it could be before so they wouldn t be able to prevent to prevent it from affecting society Oh good So let s just get this done Let s try the next group okay Thank you I know Bryan I don t need to look it up I know this already Okay Do you guys want to break before you go up Okay you guys get one or two minutes to prep yourself So it s not a shock Okay question number three let s come up People seem anxious let s do this Okay no phone Diana We re missing people Yeah we are Okay so people on the outside you guys should switch So if you did evidence you know So what you did one time evidence looking for evidence and one time you re looking for vocabulary Okay So people on the outside make sure you re checking different parts Okay so what I might change the question you guys What It happens Okay number three What recommendations would you make to President Obama regarding clean energy and climate change So for example they re trying to build two nuclear power plants in Georgia So what recommendations will you make to him about building in Georgia Building in jorj ee uh Georgia the state Um I think he should make sure that employees aren t making careless mistakes such as the human error in the Three Mile Island I think that he should promote programs on alternative energy but not just nuclear energy But he could also use nuclear energy because it could because the field cost and operating cost is low and 20 of our energy already comes from nuclear energy So we could just get more energy through nuclear power I think we shouldn t use it because of it causes harm to people and you never know when an accident happens and it might hurt the environment and it leads to cancer Okay nuclear energy affects public safety and it creates nuclear power plants create toxic waste I would still try to build a nuclear power plant because it could also boost our economy when it s most struggling Recommendations I would make to Obama regarding nuclear energy is that to stop because it s too dangerous to handle and that if it gets in the hands of terrorists they can use it to murder to murder me or destroy countries We can t prevent natural disasters from destroying nuclear power plants then the nuclear radiation which is unstable can harm by radioactivity and a nuclear spill has happened in the past with human error that hit Fukushima And this means that it can happen to anyone even us That s what I wrote I think it could be a good idea but I think they should focus more on how it could harm people to try and control the harmfulness so it won t harm people Yeah I think it s a good idea I think my recommendation for Obama is that it is not good to nuclear because it s going to affect us it s going to affect our pollution And he s going to spend like more energy on that and he can save more money if he didn t do that Yeah I agree with Charlie too We don t know what nuclear energy could also like harm us which ways Or I mean we do but I mean it s better Like we could just focus on studying more like having more thoughts Like ask him what s better It s like to choose nuclear plants or to keep using what we re using now So I have to change one question Based on all the videos and the articles you guys saw and read what argument has influenced you the most The Fukushima argument So go ahead and explain it to the group though Because um things happen and they just prove to us that they can also happen to us like human error And I think they made people evacuate the cities and the damage the area which is nobody can go because it s radioactive and they have to wait for the atoms to decay which is like I don t know thousands of years just for the half life and we won t be able to use that space anymore It kills everything People got cancer 
 We haven t talked about some things that we do when we are what Sad Sad Not sad He s ma Mad Mad He is really really mad He s got that mad face going Rrrr He is so ugly He is so ugly He is mad And it says sometimes I get mad Is it okay if we re mad Yeah Yeah What is No If somebody eat people I bet that way too That must have been Ow Ow Ow If someone s biting they probably would get in trouble

good things to do No Why not Someone might cry In trouble because Nick said some might cry maybe it would hurt them And get in trouble They would but we don t want to hurt our friends do we And pull our hair or if someone yeah we don t want to pull our friends hair either cause the would hurt our friends Or pull somebody s braids Or pull somebodies braids that would hurt and that is not a good not a is it My uncle had braids Did he I do This said this is not a good idea that is a those are what those green choices or red choices Red choices Those are red choices Things we do not want to do Alright let s see what our next page says It says When I am mad it is a good idea too who remembers something that we can do who remembers something we can do when we re mad that s okay to do I know I know What If somebody get mad Then what can you do Kick somebody and punch somebody in the face Is that a green choice or a red choice Red choice Punching someone would be a red choice What s a green choice we could make Do you remember one Yeah that be good What is a good choice That maybe share with toys Maybe we could share our toys that would be a good choice here Criss cross please I m by myself criss cross please Kendrel said maybe we can share our toys Yeah Alright last time we talked about some other things We can do what Talk to some buddies Talk to our friends good Nick and what

do We need to be good So Jakiah does that go on our red choice plate or is that a green choice that goes in our book It s the red choice It is a red choice plate you are right All of our red choices go on our plate You were right that was a red choice Put is right on top Nice thank you high five Good job Scoot back sit down Alright Nicholas are you ready Flip that thing I caught it What are they doing on there They are smelling that flower and blowing out the candle Can you show me how to do that Smell your flowers Now put the hand on top Do it one more time for me Sometimes we need to stop and take a deep breath to calm ourselves down Nick is that a red choice or a green choice Green choice It absolutely is a green choice Here s your sticky stuff I m gonna put it right there Can you stick that picture right on top please Our sticky tack Sticky tack Put it on top please Sticky tack Sticky tack Good job Sticky tack Nice thinking Okay High five Okay High five Nice work Have a seat Alright Kendrel Lowel are you ready Yeah What about this one Woah Woah Somebody push somebody off the chair Somebody pushed someone else off that chair Somebody broke that head off Right there It

a red choice Red choice Absolutely why is that a red choice because that is very bad Don t know when to snack or probably our friends at the playground Why is that a red choice Because they gonna get left Because it hurts their friends Friends It hurts their friends that pushed somebody off the chair Yep Alright Jakiah Jakiah Kendrel where does that one go On the red On the red choice plate You re absolutely right Alright miss Jakiah flip that pancake Boom What is he doing Numbers Numbers They are One two three And what are they doing they re Counting Can you help me count to ten One two three four five six seven eight nine ten If we get really mad at our friends can we stop what we re doing take a deep breath and count to ten to help calm ourselves down Yes Would that be a green choice or a red choice Green choice Absolutely it is a green choice Jakiah is that a green choice or a red choice Red choice A red choice Is it a red choice to count No Does that hurt our friends if we stop and count No Teacher So that s a green choice Something we can add to our book Though it s the red choice That s a green choice We can stop and count Our red choices are That s a green things that may hurt ourselves choice and a green or our friends choice It is a green choice Can you put it right there on our sticky tack in our book Sticky tack Put the picture on top please I know sticky s cake Alright you ready Mr Nick Yeah Sticky Okay let s do one more Lets see what else You re sticky we can do We could can we do this one Oh What are they doing Walking Walking They re taking a walk If we get really mad and we just need to get away from our friends for a minute is it okay if you come ask me to take a walk Yeah Yep We could walk around the hallways So is that a green choice or a red

idea to Talk to people Talk to our friends We can tell our friends to Give it back to give it back or to Give us back the toys or to Stop Stop We can talk to who Jakiah who else can we talk to Our teacher Our teacher and what can we tell our teachers To give us back our toys We could say someone took my toy and they will not give it back or someone hit me Give it back Teachers Alright we could stop and do what That guy What can we do Good Kendrel This one This guy What could we do Nick Smell that flower and then blow that candle away We can stop and take a deep breath Smell that flower blow out that candle Deep breath Smell that flower We could Push the hands Push those hands how hard can you squeeze them Jakiah can you show me Nick s squeezing Kendrel s squeezing Alright we could ask our teachers to what They get a walk To take a walk Sometimes we may just need to to get out of our classroom and that is okay You re loud That was loud You re right You screamed But you know what I like how you used your words and told him You told him that you were screaming and that hurt my ears Alright using your words I did You did too Alright what s our last one we can One two Numbers We can stop and Count Count We count to ten One two three four five six seven eight nine ten It makes my teachers happy when I am calm and not mad 
 Okay let s get busy So before we change the car we have two more times Okay let s look Jacob let s help It s 9 3 What is 9 three 93 93 Is there a way that we can maybe change to other things here to make it go further Like the car Yeah How Maybe the height How about you guys discuss Oh try it Put that way back like that It might need help for you holding the ramp how bout you do you think that s a good idea I m gonna roll it back Alright Oh Is it gonna stay you think Yeah I bet Awesome Let s see how far it went Watch your foot 105 What is 105 105 I love the way that you re making sure that that goes nice and smooth on the way in So let s take a look Jacob let s look over here Let s look at our data we have the roll one with just the normal way we had 101 inches And then the roll two which was again the same way at 93 inches And roll three at 105 inches Which way went the furthest 103 roll three Roll three Why do you think that is Because it s 101 that one is 101 and that ones 105 Well why do you think roll one is different from roll three Because ones higher then the other higher then the other Because ones higher then the other Okay so do you want to try to add in or take away something from this vehicle I think we should What do you think we should pick Take away the girl Take away the girl Nothing What do you guys think about Hailey s idea What did she say Jacob S Hold on what did Hailey say Say it again We shouldn t even try Okay Okay so how about Jacob since Jacob was trying to make the other car how bout Jacob tries to put on bigger wheels We should see what happens then Here Jacob Well look at this look at which one would we need bigger wheels on That one That one Okay So that car Go farther that one will go farther Probably will go farther you think with bigger wheels Yeah Cause the bigger the wheel the easier it has balance Did you hear what he said Bigger wheels have balance The bigger the wheels the more balanced it is I m saying like let s say you re Is that gonna work Is there anything else you guys want to do to this car Or do you just want to change one thing I just change one thing Okay it s your car So what about your ramp Ashley what about your ramp how do you want your ramp to be Maybe we can take this off and do it in the normal way Okay 76 You want to try that way Alright That s true Whoa That wasn t go far Alright let s measure It goes a little bit She needs a little bit of help 72 72 We re gonna put this vehicle Alright so we re not going to change the car but what could we do 32 Whoa look Student Guys this is going to be affecting weight okay That box could stay here instead of Alright you guys try it You guys got it now 91 times 2 Well that s up to your group Can I make my car now No not yet That s not weight three yet Split weight right now so How you guys doing Did you guys try to move the weight in different ways Ok Alright back Let s do it together 56 Look at that let s see what happened No it s 67 Where s your data at Put the data over here so we re all in the same place 83 Okay let s take a look What do you have here 67 This will be so much fun Okay you roll it Ashley can I work on it can I have it Should we take something away first No No 42 I think we should put a little one Gimme that You think we should I m not sure Cause the blue one Wow Cool Oh Oh my gosh Here I ll Yeah And without these wheels Now Are you ready Go Here here we go Ouchie hold the end I ll hold it 77 No it s 67 Jacob 67 Might be 77 What is 77 We did it for two ways so they can do it last way That was way more Yeah but How many inches was that second roll Look Three feet so 3 F So what three feet equals 36 inches We re going to be focused on the inches so we don t get confused So hold on wait a second When we had that ramp the first way what did you do with it the same way as the first way No we did this way Just that Yeah We haven t done it like that I know just re adjust this Yeah So when did it go when you did just that 30 seconds no it went that What is that 73 73 So then we moved it to make it which way did we do it the second way Higher We did it this way what happened to the numbers It went lower It went lower So if we go it lower it goes higher I don t know let s try So what s another ramp that we can make Have you tried that way before Nope Alright let s see Hold on a second David we have to measure Nope your group can help you measure Let s see 35 Ooh that s seven Okay let s take a look again let s make sure What s that There we go So roll three let s try Now let s take a look at our data hold on That s not gonna work You don t think so Well let s first take a look here and then we can see if that will work It s probably gonna fall What happened with roll three where s the data Look at roll three what is it 35 And what s roll two I don t know 36 So what do you think happened whenever we made the ramp a little bit higher I mean a little bit lower I m sorry It changed It changed What happened when it changed The number I see let s focus It goes more faster It might go more faster There s not another roll four but you made a very interesting ramp and you guys wanna try that Yeah Okay let s see let s see what happens Taylor What happened It fell I knew it would my box Well how about you hold that so we can try it again Try it again Oh no Fix em and let s see if it does that every time do you think it ll do it every time Yes Yes Let s try again I ll measure this time You ll measure Yeah Oh Oh We have to do it again Taylor you can go on the carpet This time I made it lower Oh So he just said something what did he say He made it lower He made it lower So what s happening every time he makes it a little bit lower It falls off When it falls off it still can roll I mean just keep it rolling when it falls off Uh oh I ll measure it Okay We don t have enough space to measure that one how about we change the car and try again But what did you guys notice every time the ramp changed What happened when it was super high It fell apart It didn t work so well can you imagine if you were in a real car and you were going down something that steep Yeah No That would be kinda scary wouldn t it But as it kept going down what happened It didn t go off It didn t fall apart you re right Alright go back and try to make a different car Okay go back and try to make it be careful your gonna make me nervous Alright let s see Jacob what do you have Come on over Nope Jacob come on over What in the world did you make That looks like a Mack Truck Girls do you see this Yeah Tractors throwing in something Now take a look roll it and see if that one feels good to you Big Girls are you watching Look at how that rolled Girls you next Okay This was all my idea That was your idea I love it Could we try it this way We could keep a hold of that you might want to try it Let s see Well we should be working on Correctamundo See I got a good review What do we got Jacob 93 93 So what can we do to change it I guess we could maybe We re learning something We are learning something what did we learning We learned the car the littler it is the harder for it to fall That is true It s your turn Is that what you re finding out the smaller the car Yeah The smaller the car the more it picks up Picks up Cars go over Oh were we going over No I It s your turn Preston Oh did you guys hear him Let s take a second and listen He was talking about yesterday s experiment what did we do yesterday We tried rolling little cars on the carpet Why didn t it work out so well Jacob Little cars on the carpet Because the wheels stopped them Why did they stop you think Because the carpets too rough Because the carpet s too rough Did you guys find that too So what are you finding about today That the bigger the wheels the on hard surfaces It s faster on smoother and hard surfaces it goes further So what are you finding out about the ramp That You guys are finding that How about you decide that for this last one you tried one way with the ramp And now we re going to try two more ways with this ramp and I want to see if guys can figure out how this works better with a ramp 
 Like a long A Not long A Long O No I ll give you a hint There s some letters up on the front What is the sound Er It s er Er Everybody say er Er Okay What we re going to do If you remember last week we looked at some pictures And when you heard the er sound what sound did you make Er No E R What did you make Tweet tweet Tweet tweet because a bird says tweet tweet and a bird has er So my first picture is a train Do you hear it Yes ma am No Do you hear an er Oh no No So are you going to say tweet tweet No No Shirt Tweet tweet Girl Tweet tweet Bird Tweet tweet Rope No Skirt Tweet tweet Purse Tweet tweet Shark Tweet tweet Do you hear er in shark No Do you hear the difference What do you hear Ar That s different Okay Let s look really quick eyes up here When I have the word skirt what two letters make er I R Very good This is a nurse What two letters make er U R Good Tweet This is a fern What two letters say er E R Very good We re going to read some words okay I want you to look at this word first Connor look at the word Everybody what word is that Sir Look at it Think about it first What word Fur Four Fur What s this word Fur Very good Think about it first What word Spur Think about it first What word Hurt Think about it Don t say it And what word is it Spurt Spurt Very good Think about it first What word Nerve Think about it What word Serve Think about it Nurse What word Nurse Think about it Purse What You re thinking I can t hear you think All right Ready What word Purse Good Think about it What word Germ Think about it Don t say it yet What word Term Term Eyes up here Okay Good Now we re going to go to our work mats and we re going to build some words okay Okay You can give the students a point because you all did a very good job Everybody was paying attention and participating All right watch how Miss Dodd is doing this because you re going to do the same thing Get your word mat out in front of you and put your letters out so you can see them We have to go kind of quick I m going to put this on top of this just for now okay Thanks You re welcome All right Let s see Let s see how fast we can get those out Let s see I m going to say we can do it in 40 seconds Let me help you out Let s put all these out so you can see them You have a lot of words Shh Okay We re not putting them down on the mat We re going to put them up here and then we re going to pull them down to the mat There we go Economics Shh All right Let s see if we made it Are we all done Yes ma am All right Give the students another point because you did it in enough time Okay Miss Dodd has the words up here also the word parts So first let s look at the ending parts okay What do you think this says Er Er Very good Look at this next one What does this say Urt Urt Eyes up here Eyes up here Good What does this say Er Good What does this say Urse And what does this say Erve Okay These are the same cards that you have so we re going to make some words okay Okay First we re going to start with urt U R T So let s pull that down to where it says rhyme U R T Okay And I want you to make the word hurt Hurt Good job All right Let s spell hurt together H U R T Hurt Very good All right So Miss Dodd will pull down my H and it looks like everybody got that Okay Now I want you to take your U R Pull down your U R Okay And this time I m going to give you a clue I want you to make the word that is something that is on an animal Covers an animal Keeps him warm His what We don t want our H right now Let s see if you can figure it out You should have U R right here okay And now we re going to So what was the answer to my clue Fur Fur Spell it F U R Fur Keep your U R and I want you to make the word spur Spur We talked about this word last week A spur Okay Yes Who put the things out I did Okay Who remembers what a spur is Something that you kick Very good Here s a picture of a spur Remember there was a thing that the cowboy has on his boots that he kicks the horse and it makes the horse go fast Okay So I should pull down my S P and this word is Spur Very good All right I want you to pull down your U R S E U R S E And you shouldn t have anything in front of the U R S E You should just have it just like Madison has it here She doesn t have anything for onset She only has her rhyme Okay All right What does that part say Urse Urse Okay I want you to add a P and see what word you get and if you have a D you might want to flip it over It s also a P Okay All right What word is that Purse Purse Very good Okay I want you to take your I R and pull it down And this time I want you to make your own word with I R It might not be the same word your neighbor makes I want you to make your own word with I R Look at all the onset parts that you have and see what you can add to ir Good job All right Let s look at what we came up with What did you come up with Sir Sir Okay So I ll pull down my S here This word is sir That is correct and I see a few people have sir Let s see Let s look at this one What did you make Spir But what two letters actually say ur in spur I R Not I R Remember U R Yep Let s put it up here so we remember it Spur is S P U R I ve got another one All right Dirt Okay Oh yeah How do you spell dirt Oh yeah Wait Oh yeah We might not have that ending but do you know how to spell dirt D I R T Very good All right Let s move on to another one Oh I see that you have G I R Gir What were you thinking when you wrote that Can you use that in a sentence No Okay This one is not a word okay Now we re going to pull out our E R V E E R V E Let s see how quickly we can get it up You all are doing a good job You re all probably going to get another point E R V E Okay And I want you to fill in the blank The ladies in the cafeteria blank us our food The ladies in the cafeteria blank us our food What can we put in front of the E R V E that would complete that sentence It s got to make sense All right What is this word Erve Let s see What if I were to put an S What word would I have Serve Serve Does that make sense in my sentence Do the ladies in the cafeteria serve us our food Yeah So what word did we come up with Serve Serve Very good Okay So this is what I want you to do I want you to take all your cards just like Miss Dodd s doing here and I m just going to put them together pretty quick I don t have to really take my time here and then I m going to stick them on my page We re going to make a pile in the middle Good job All right Good And remember it doesn t have to be perfect Good job And let s take it all Is this yours Good job No All right I m going to go ahead and hand you our story We re going to take what we ve learned and take it to text We re going to read a story that has lots of words that have the er sound This looks like I have one Yeah That one s his Curls that swirl All right I can t put it Whoa It s got 12 pages Okay All right Let me go ahead and take those so we can go ahead and start reading okay Okay You can give the students a point because you did a good job last time Okay I m going to give everybody a highlighter because as we re reading I want you highlighting words that have the er sound Okay So what s my title Curls that swirl Very good Do you see some words that have the er sound Yes ma am Let s highlight them What s my first word Curls U R Curls What s my next word that has er Swirl Swirl Very good All right Curls that swirl What are they talking about about curls What kind of curls are they talking about Like curls in your hair Curls in your hair Very good Okay As we re going I m going to be putting the words up here okay So we have curls and we have swirl and we will use these words again tomorrow Okay so let s open up to the first page Miss Dodd Miss Dodd Highlight it again No highlighting yet okay Cheryl Oh okay Well come up No no We re on this page here Page three at the bottom okay Okay Okay So let s see how quickly we can get to page three All right What we re going to do is I want you following along Miss Dodd s going to model how we re going to read this page As I m reading you can highlight when I say an er word Does everybody understand the directions Yes ma am Okay but you need to be listening because after this we re going to read it all together okay Here we go Once there was a small girl who had hair that curled and swirled and twirled Drop where you hand is I messed up That s okay We ll go back and look at it This one We ll talk about it It swirled over her shirt and way past her skirt Okay Now Stop No no We re going to just look at that one page because I see some things that make me ask some questions What word did you ask me about That wasn t me Did you ask me about a word What word There There Okay Let s look at the word there Okay Now should we highlight there Yes ma am Raise your hand if you say yes we should Raise your hand if you say no we shouldn t Okay Well let s look at it Does it have E R like we re looking for Yes It does but does it say er No No It has a different sound Every E R isn t going to say er It s just going to be special times so in this case should we highlight it No No okay And it s okay if you did okay All right Let s go ahead and read it together now Everybody follow along Let s put our finger under the first word or your highlighter is fine 
 Negative x minus it It s one over oh wait oh wait wait wait wait How do we solve for X X is the value of R anyway X is the value of R What would you do for the one over X Wouldn t that be the first term X is the value of R What I would suggest you do is is that you could rewrite this as an expression Oh as the power Oh Oh okay okay I used Oh yeah yeah All right yeah I got it So it s gonna be negative X minus one okay Okay no I got it So the first it s gonna be so what Whatever Oh come on I just wanted to find where it talks about It would be one minus one Oh we have one Is one over x the sum Do you see see what I m saying Yeah I m gonna put it in there so negative X minus one cause later it s gonna change Wait you don t really have to do it out since it s gonna change the so it s higher You ll have to you gotta Yeah No no no no no don t don t don t don t Don t even do that Do you know why Because it s part of a Well Yeah yeah yeah Cause the whole thing is negative and then that s the Remember the He s a natural But now here s the question You guys kind of already answered this question Could you have found it They give you basically R is two X Uh huh And since it converges it has to be less than the absolute value of You got it Okay That makes sense Go back for a second Yeah you multiply both sides by a third So it d be one third times every single one of em And the interval Um Oh Maybe someone s It means it s gonna get shifted and then You were just scaling the Because it s like I d never I never considered Oh okay Yeah It s not gonna change the domain of the Oh no no I m putting plus negative The answer Yeah So the only thing I m thinking is it might be easier for you to just It might make sense somehow Oh how do you read Yeah how do you No no no no no no no no It doesn t reduce the time it takes for it to No man right Oh okay yeah One third Oh I get it I get it It only converges as you No matter what well no matter what One over X Three X five X two in two over X I think it does Thank you You re welcome That s what I m yeah that s what I m saying One over X Because what they want you to do now So you d say power series is gonna be written as a form of say geometric series Because now you ve got what What s the first term Yeah Right Okay what s the ratio Negative And when you write that out put around it Let him once show him Okay Is it saying three X I would be I would take the Are you sure you re working together Yes And I ll turn it one We got one minus X squared One over one plus X squared That s X to the fourth right Minus X to the sixth plus X to the eighth This is if you are indexing this This is your first term this is your second term this is your third term right Think about the first one okay We have left that in order to get that a two X Like the first R okay the first side of it And say it s the second term that the first time So it s probably gonna probably gonna be it Probably Okay At least on these simple ones Okay Okay leave that for Okay N minus one over one minus one x minus one would be zero which would be Originally we have negative one X minus one The right one so it s either gonna be Now you re expanding by three instead of zero six So it s like negative X squared switched So the negative that goes over here is negative X squared too So the negative is which Y I don t uh I don t know what I m doing All right look hold on Isn t it the same as the third one That means that the Y like the same one Y is the common one Right To the one so this would be X minus one And negative Just put in one here four all right What s the ratio here One you re multiplying the outside of two X Another one you re doing it as the two X That means you re moving the X to the inside If you take a function and you just scale it by a multiple if you take arcsine of x any function you want and you multiply it by scale like one third one fourth Ah but then there we said No Oh my God what arc what are you wait wait hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on There s gonna be another one I haven t there and one third after that is what we re doing here Our R remains the same It s the whole series multiplied by the factor of one third Okay yeah I m agreeing to that I m pretty sure that s right You multiply this out it s gonna be one over three plus three x minus one Why are you multiplying it out Just think of it as a scale It s not anything to do it s not gonna affect our domain outside the function It s only gonna affect the range And therefore you re not gonna have any remains cause the remains only matter if you didn t have but like one third of it so we re not doing it like that One third after it we re doing like a stretched version So it s not gonna affect the equation so it s negative X What No no no no no no That s the series for Uh all right I m just negative X squared Right No no no I m putting negative x squared It s easier cause then later on when you do plus No no no no no I The sine s been switching No no Yeah but you can represent that by saying Yeah it s gonna be smaller Well it ll be switching but like would you represent how would you represent X in the whole thing To the negative see the n minus one is put that s how I m doing it Wait how would you find the If it s the absolute value of x minus one it would be less than one Mrs Dockin Yes Is this is this is this X We re not sure where we are because of these coefficients that change What is X over R Take this series right here which is that So then integrate it We just though you integrate every term to get it Now you re looking for a general expression Right You have a general expression It didn t tell you to come up with no they didn t tell you to do that Oh okay okay Okay because in fact that s not a power series That s not a power series It is okay but it s a different form of a power series So you don t have to write em like this because you would also need to have what You also have to have Right yeah okay Got it Okay You flip it around One good yeah good what s R The negative of yeah you re the negative x plus one but it needs to be in parentheses So now you need your R okay Now you re gonna do them when you get to It needs to be a form of K over R Oh I thought we just solve for R You said the third nominated was R All right guys she said 1 3 times one whatever that is How do you multiply these Does it need to be on the Yeah so you do it again Yeah multiply the whole interval yeah Multiply the interval And this is not in the form of a series That one third does that impact the greatness of one That s the question you want to answer I m not answering it for you right now you need to figure it out So when it s asking for does the function of the This it s like that You didn t divide it by seven 
 You re totally fine So you guys will be using I m assuming a meter tape Yeah For measurements And then can you take a minute to explain the balance thing again so we re good Strength versus strength qualifies ten times Ok so I like that you re making everyone go clockwise everyone s doing ten alright And then see how long they can balance on their most dominant foot Ok There s a max of 60 seconds and no shoes on No shoes on ok perfect You guys are good Ok so wingspan what are your units you guys are measuring in Centimeters and you re going tip to tip right And then what was the ability again They ll take their shoes off try to touch their toes And then we ll measure the distance from their finger tip to the top of their foot Ok good In what units Centimeters Centimeters Did you say take shoes off or no Yeah Ok cool You guys can start collecting data I ll come back to you Ok what do you guys got Same thing we got yesterday Recap me Hair color You were hair color Why the hell don t you have something else I don t know Ok so here s my question Cause I was thinking about this last night You re gonna be asked to make a scatter plot graph of this data How would one go about making a scatter plot with hair color Ok so you re gonna assign numbers numeric data to shades Zero to ten Or one to ten One to ten Yeah One being the lightest The lightest lightest We should probably get this straightened out before we do it right And then ten being the darkest Ok before you start collecting it can you just give me a really quick specturm Draw a line out so I could see where you re getting your number data And then what is your characteristic That was your characteristic What is your ability How many steps does it take you to walk backwards seven feet Ok so we ll probably do that in the hallway Does that sound fine Meter tapes are up there That s a lot of guys So give me a real quick scale then you guys can start Ok One and ten So that s blonde and really blonde And like really dark brown So where would red fall in Like me Like right there So you re gonna make blonde one end The low end are we all in agreeance on that Yeah and mine is like in the middle Ok and then the other far end s gonna be the darkest brown Yeah Or black Or black Are you gonna have everyone taking data on that Or maybe one or two people just consistently doing the hair color You know what I mean so there s not a ton of variation Measure their hand from first crease to their middle finger And then hopping on one foot right On your tiptoe Or no balance balance And then once your heel touch into the ground it s done And your hands can do whatever you want Ok are we shoe on shoe off Shoe off Shoe off and is it right or left foot Right foot for everybody Ok Right foot shoe off on tiptoe Max two minutes Max two minutes so the deciding factor when to stop the stopwatch is when their heel hits the ground Or their other foot Or their other foot So it could be either or Okeydoke So just a kind of a flashback to remind us This has been a couple daytime span here Our goal behind this is try to determine what we can learn from a fossil So as we work through this unit we re gonna start building together pieces of information that help us come up with ideas about the past We ve been specifically as I ve said before looking at one specific fossil foot fossil length right The idea behind this is that scientists put the pieces of the puzzle together we start to get a clear image of what s going on Again our goal was to determine if there s a relationship between the characteristic you chose the ability you chose and a person s foot fossil I asked you last night to plot up your data for both characteristic and ability and then if possible draw a line of best fit That could be an indirect relationship a direct one a trend or no relationship What I m gonna ask you to do for a minute talk to your neighbors Compare your data Make sure we re on the same page in determining a relationship And then I d like you to come up and post your data It s gonna be a pretty simple process to post your data So for example if group one what was your characteristic For fossil length Hand spans We re gonna put characteristic on the left side so they re gonna right hand span for us And then what type of relationship did you guys see for that Direct Direct so all you re gonna do is do this That s all we need to report Ok in your lab packet you are going to find some little graphs You re gonna be asked to record everyone s data I ve also given you a supplementary sheet cause you re gonna need more graphs I messed up and didn t tell you So what s gonna wind up happening is all the graphs would appear on here You will also copy down into your packet because as a whole you ll be looking at everyone s data and drawing conclusions ok So take a minute to talk to your groups I ll come around and give you some markers Determine what your characteristic and ability relationships are Post them on the board and then we ll talk No Can you determine it No Cause they re not They re just kind of clustered It was like more not clustered Ok so we re gonna have a trend fall in between where I guess the trend really is between 15 and What are we lacking You know what it was 12 30 last night Fossil foot length stride length Ok so we re having a trend falling between what s our lowest Our lowest is 12 and our highest is 23 but like the trend is between these ones Ok I think that works So you re gonna give a horizontal line on your graph up there Need help Ok whatcha got Would you draw a line for a trend Yeah it would either be vertical or horizontal just like we did in the beginning So this person s kinda like an outlier right so let s just for argument s sake take them out Does that help clear the data up at all You could say no it s ok They re all kind of in the same foot length but they all have different times Ok so we ve got a pretty wide range here right For trend we tend to see more of a skinnier range So if you look at our options it s definitely not a direct or indirect I would say based on what you showed me right Trend wise it s kind of a wide range So what would we determine what s our other option No relationship Yeah I would probably go So up there instead of drawing a line just write no relation ok Here s your marker With this one cause it s kind of like a trend or kind of just focused in this area But then there s also the increase Ok so here s my question That s a good question When I look at this data right If I had a pick excluding this line if I had to pick where someone with a foot fossil over here would fall where would you pick Up here Why Yeah it appears to be going this way So that would indicate that you have a direct relationship It s kind of the easiest way to look at it Ok group number one Hand span versus foot fossil length and then jump height What kind of relationship are we seeing here Direct so the bigger the foot fossil the bigger the hand span So just to clarify hand span we re talking tip of thumb to tip of finger Correct Why do we see that So I asked you guys last night to jot down some ideas in the conclusion section so you might want to turn to that page everyone cause you wanna gather some ideas here Why are we seeing this Why do you think we re seeing that relationship What did you guys say Because your hands and feet are usually proportional in size You re not gonna have a very large foot and have very small hands Usually Ok So I have a question for everyone in class I bought some new shoes and I like them Do you like them They re so big on you They re a little loud Don t worry I won t wear them on testing days They look good What s the problem here They re like way too big like twenty sizes too big How do you know Why do you know that my foot s not this big Yeah it doesn t look proportional to my body And exactly what Megan said bodies in general are proportional Now we go through some stages in our lives where we have long really lanky arms Or you might know someone that has extremely long legs They re kind of fitting outside that pattern But in general bodies are proportionate right And so we can probably makes some connections to certain body characteristics based on other body characteristics right Because of this idea that we are proportioned You re not gonna see Shaquille O Neal wearing a size three shoe He ll fall over He wouldn t be able to support his own body Common sense applies here That s a good one Jump height So you said pretty much everyone kind of fell into one kind of area but there s no indirect or direct relationship Why do you think we saw that Jump height is an ability versus Ok jump height is an ability you are correct It depends on muscles versus structure Ok so it s depending more on muscle as opposed to structure of your foot I remember the class like could already reach so that played to our height and the proportions of our body and then in turn determined how high I could jump in itself so I guess with your foot depending on what size shoe you have that in turn kinda determines your height because of the proportions of your body By having them reach guys What was your point When you set up your lab Cause I remember distinctly talking to you guys you said you re gonna have them make a mark and then they re gonna jump Well it s so that the taller people didn t just automatically jump higher than everybody who was shorter than them Cause then it s already the distance like how high they can actuall jump as part of how tall they are Ok So you re saying that by measuring the height you factored that idea in So Mr Bieber isn t totally outjumping say Adrian who s a little bit shorter So you already kind of factored that in Why did we not see a connection though Megan said jump height deals with more muscle mass maybe opposed to foot Cause everybody kind of jumped the same There wasn t any variation So it didn t really matter what foot size you have Ok So when you say jump the same you mean achieve the same scores roughly They found the same general area in that same general pattern That s why theres a trend It was all in just one spot So in general when we re looking at fossils would jump height be one that we could solely predict then based on the length of the foot fossil No Probably not Which kind of makes sense anyway Group two Group two didn t get their data plotted but let s take a peek They did foot fossil length and height If you were to make an assumption if there was a relationship what would you all assume would be the relationship Direct why direct Cause it s proportional Bingo bodies are proportional You re gonna see that pattern as we work through this Proportional ok Average stride We didn t really get a graph but it didn t look very direct It was a little more indirect More indirect I think so Like this So you re saying longer No no Like there wasn t really a pattern Oh so your e saying no relationship Yeah Does that make sense Alana says no I saw this Why Well just based on the proportional idea if your height and hand span is proportional to your foot length then your legs then the length of your legs are also proportional to your foot lenghts and the length of your stride based on the length of your legs So you re arguing that you think we should see what kind of relationship I think a direct You would say direct Claire and then Barrett Well cause we had the same thing but a little bit different And well backwards It couldn t really be that accurate because it wasn t a very long distance and people had different ideas of walking Some people were trying to take larger steps or being more careful or walking slower It wasn t just like an average So you are saying based on the idea of body proportions that we should see a direct But you re saying you agree that we should see direct No we should see an indirect An indirect Longer leg shorter strides Direct Longer legs longer strides But you re arguing that the way maybe that the experiment was set up didn t lend itself to collect proper data Yeah Ok good point I think it was also just I was asked just to walk like I normally do and I don t take very long strides I kind of walk really slow so my strides are very small when I just normally walk Ok so you almost felt it was kinda awkward like how am I supposed to walk So maybe we could have captured it in a different manner We could have designed the experiment if you re already walking and then you walk past the line and maybe keep carrying through that stride I think no relationship is accurate because my stride length I would assume is based on how long my legs are I have very long legs but everybody knows I have a small foot I mean I m still proportional like I m normal sized but my legs are just a lot longer than anything else Ok so you re kinda arguing that maybe you re not always going to fall into every part of your body being specifically proportional There was a lot where some people with kinda smaller feet had relatively longer strides and some people with big feet had smaller strides It was kind of just all over the place Ok So what are we labeling this Direct question mark no relationship question mark If we re basing it on the data that they had I d say no relationship Ok if we re basing it on the data even though we didn t plot it Looking at their actual data we would say no relationship Could there be a point where we could argue that we might potentially see a direct relationship Yes So for our data collection we ll leave no relationship But keeping in mind that very valid point that if you re gonna have longer feet more than likely you have longer legs More than likely you re gonna take longer strides But inherent as Claire said in the kind of setup of the experiment that maybe that didn t shine through Group three Hair color versus foot fossil length No relationship Is this shocking to anyone Yes Even though they had a great numeric scale Why Why no relationship Bubs I didn t have anything to do with it It s like a gene base Hair color is determined by Your DNA Does your DNA determine your foot length Yes it does But not the same gene Ok but not the same gene Ok now you re getting very technical I appreciate that Yes sir I think its partially because Would you think that there would be a connection Like smaller foot lighter hair Well go on for like racial background like your ethnicity Some ethnic groups are generally taller and have bigger feet than the others Ok so maybe you re arguing the sample size The idea that we were to survey globally maybe we could see certain ethnic backgrounds that tend to be taller would have different I could see that Yeah Well I think it has nothing to do with it because I m six feet tall and Franco s under five feet and we both have dark hair So obviously Yeah it s got nothing to do with it Ok so on face value looking at hair color Would we say that foot fossil length would be a good indicator of hair color No Ok I would agree There s no connection there No connection My question though is There are organisms that lived in the past And we have very I would say We have certain ideas about what their coloring was like How would we come up with that then How would scientists come up with that idea Of the coloring of certain organisms Caroline Well if you say that lizards would be or dinosaurs would be green it would help them blend into their environment so you would assume it would be good then to be green but you don t know for sure So you re thinking evolutionary connection It ll be beneficial for them to be able to blend in their environment Yeah Yes Claire I think you also said a few days ago About how you re supposed to assume everything in the past works how it does now So if you see some type of reptile in the past it probably looks something like a reptile now Ok so again you re doing that evolutionary connection to modern day relatives saying well if they appear to be this color possibly due to some benefit we can assume in the past Good nice job 
 What part of soccer you really want to know What about the measuring or even the measure That s what you ve got to figure out Or how long you can Okay I mean how many like times you can do it Okay so you could sit there and count how many bounces kicks or you could sit here with the timing How much you can do it and how much time you need Okay how many per minute So you ve got lots of ideas You re going to have to choose that Do you need a little more time to bounce it off each other Yeah Okay so I think you have both come up with all four of you You guys come up with an experiment to support each other and you two come up with one And you ll collect your data and you ll collect your data and then present it as a company How about that soccer team or company Alright Alright you ve got a good name Alright that s part of it It works Catch your attention I know Stephanie We re having trouble Because we barely decided on it We didn t do the friction one but the one where you drop the marble in the the shampoo bottle The little car that you pull back and see how far it goes Okay And the parachute one so I thought of the parachute one What do you think Yeah You re a team on it okay So what are you going to measure with a parachute Pardon Yeah you re going to use metric which is centimeters Stephanie s got control of the metrics So can you tell me what your experiment is going to look like with these parachutes Well we don t know how far Because we know we can t throw it out the window Oh no It s too far Okay but you know what Maybe on the counter You guys are coordinated I would let you stand on this counter and you could kind of measure different heights How high you could You could do some test runs right Yeah Don t you think scientists would do test trials before they make a real decision Okay Yeah And you know what If you d like if we have time I want you to do test runs in here but we could do a final drop off the balcony and get it clear That s what I was thinking Okay but I do want you to do test runs in here first and then we could do a final But make your hypothesis what you re thinking because I think you re on a roll here It s going to be good I don t like his interview So how far In this experiment can we put like some sort of weight on the parachute to see how fast or something Okay I think you re making another experiment right So what s your first experiment Just how fast it would drop by itself How fast from one distance Yeah Okay so one distance you re going to see how fast it ll drop And then you re going to compare that to from that distance Adding weights to it Okay alright Well I wondered how far will the parachute go from different heights Okay so she s got one experiment and you ve got another one Do you want to do two in one and kind of combine it together You do yours and you do yours Because you only can change one variable at a time right Yeah So what s your variable you re going to measure I m going to measure the distance how far How high different distances And what are you going to do And you re going to time it right Yeah Okay and you re going to do what s your variable that you re going to change The weight Okay But you re going to see how fast it drops Yeah Alright so I think you re going to need another paper Okay Because you ve got two experiments going Are you going to support each other in each one Yeah That s pretty cool double points How are you guys doing Oh I like it Okay tell me about this one Okay so we re going to get two or three different size basketballs like a really small one and maybe a medium one and then Yeah And then we re going to like have two meters or a meter and like drop it from there So like how high it bounces depending on its size Oh so the size of the balls to see how High it bounces Okay If it bounces higher What do you think I think the small one will bounce higher Because there s less material to like have to drop from there Like when in gym class when they have the huge balls for exercising if you drop a bigger one usually it doesn t go up as high and the smaller ones do bounce higher So based on your observations You re a good observer So your large ball went the highest and you thought the small one would Whoa are these your averages Yeah they re my averages Wow okay Good So how are you guys going to present it as a team She s probably going to do like what we thought would happen And I m probably going to do the results of what actually happens Are you comfortable with that Uh huh Okay to make it really clear what you did Yeah yeah Okay I think that ll be really good because this is great this is great to show and then you re writing your conclusion with numbers in it I like that And then you told yours was rejected right Yeah Okay now does that mean you re a failure No Do you guys mind going first Sure Because if they see that yours is rejected and yet you still could write up a scientific experiment I think that might give them some confidence and it ll take the pressure off them because they don t really want to go first Okay so let s go Aqui tenemos que cambiar la friccion sobre dos Tenemos que cambiar Oh wow the graph looks good And your data chart looks good So Jenni will you shows yours On the first dictation thing when we have to go up there do we have to go up by step like show everything What do you think Or just show our graph What do you think would be the best I say showing the graph Should we show like our question and then should we show the whole thing What do you think I don t know I think so Showing both Okay But it s probably the most important thing to convince them I d definitely show your data Okay we ll show his because it s better than mine Okay very good And let s see yes it looks professional So these numbers How many times did you do this experiment Three times wait four three twelve 100 I don t know Because there s five and there s three Okay We ve got one two three four five trials here Is that correct No we went up three but he wrote trials for these Oh okay So we can fix that Que dibujaste No tienes que poner esto Tienes que poner esto It s very neat So you added one two three and divided by By three Okay alright that s how you got the average Yeah Okay and who figured out the answer Me Jenni Wow Jenni We did was it highest to lowest Yeah Highest minus lowest divided by two Awesome You definitely should show this And then this would be uncertainty Yeah And these are the mounted distance with different kinds of What are these five things The shoes Okay The shoes It gets tiring when you have to do it three times Right Now my question is if you didn t have the shoes how did you get the data for it I did it at my house You did them at your house Okay And then what s this one right over here The socks Okay and that s one you definitely did at school Yeah we did it here and we also did the Vans here And the Vans Alright so that s good Would you explain that to the class Yeah That these you did at home and these you did here and so would you have any sources of error Yeah because of the surface Like at his house it would have been not like floor it would be carpet or something like that Yeah what s your floor like where you did it Well I had to do it like outside during the rain Oh my goodness Okay so you ve got to explain that and then do you think that would affect your experiment any Yeah Okay maybe it would And so what would a scientist do in the next time Would have done it in a dry place Yeah do it in a dry place Yeah I like that Okay so you ll tell that for the next time Yeah But I really liked how you guys didn t give up How you actually did the socks compared to your Vans And you know how you pull those out what are research we could have done your boot Oh yeah my boot Yeah I could have Want to do my boot No I m good No My legs are tired Okay I m sure they are Well did you accept or reject your hypothesis Accept We accepted it And tell us why Because You ve got the evidence right there don t you The experiment like that one question we had it goes with the real world or something like that Could you repeat this experiment The whole thing Yeah or could anybody do this experiment Yeah it s easy It is Did you write your procedure so it s easy It s hard to write a procedure because it Okay and if you had to do this experiment over again would you do it any differently or not No Would you test for anything else Good point How much pressure right Okay alright any other questions Nice job Thanks Jenni s team Sorry to rush you guys but we got the idea What was your experiment Our experiment was to find out what types of shoes would work to do the moon walk uses four different pairs of shoes like Adidas Converse or Vans The Adidas would go the farthest The Vans No just show the data You were correct And you were correct because the Adidas were here and the first time it went like 112 centimeters and the second trial it went 118 centimeters and the final was like 12 and then it was like 116 6 centimeters We accepted our hypothesis Jenni continue this Why me Because you re professional Well we were going to do an interview but we forgot to So what do we do It s really bad Why do you think it s bad Jenni I don t know Esta bien esta bien Well here s the amount of distance and here s the kind of and I marked them as the average they all went So we can see that the Adidas went more than the Vans did because the Vans were like the lowest Will you tell us about your source of error because that was interesting Because you had a good way to solve it if you did your project over again Oh yeah Well it s because Jose did half of the experiment he did it at home and the other part of it we did here and I think it did it different because he did it in the rain and we did it like on dry So I think that affected the experiment There s probably different traction on shoes Si Simon What kind of shoe would you try next time A boot Oh like my major walking boot Si Alright What would you hypothesize would happen if you tried my boot If you look at the Well because it s soft so I think it ll go farther Possibly go farther Okay alright That would be interesting to try out Does everybody see how this can apply to real life Tienen preguntas Hablan en ingles no espanol Can you explain how this would apply to real life if you aren t just moon walking Jose Jenni Don t look at me I don t know Go on the actual moon Gym class Yeah gym class Does anybody change out of their shoes for gym class Sometimes Okay some people do I don t You don t Yeah like these shoes they slide a lot like in the gym Okay so it might be different shoes for different jobs Yeah Okay well thank you Nice job Good we have time for our last presentation Thank you Alright sorry to rush everybody I know you could talk more about it Thanks for being a good audience Hello class how are we doing today Good So our title was dirty water versus clean water Thank you Our experiment had to do with a sailboat in four different types of water 
 So how is that energy Different things like jules Which are increments which are similar kilowatts hours and BCU Okay You could also measure it with a thermometer if it s kinetic energy sometimes Okay I have an cubic feet tons and gallons too That s mass And volume Oh cause it was like Hold on Totally different thing I don t remember While she s looking at that what are some cons of nuclear energy that most people are concerned about Well there are no no explosions That s a totally different process with nuclear bombs and nuclear power Oh I have And it states in lots of articles about nuclear waste that it produces very little waste At all Well I have a cubic feet it s for like natural gas Tons is measured for coal Kilowatts hours is for electricity It doesn t pollute the air You could inject the water back into the earth to reuse it Like you could put the water back in and keep reusing it And then the disadvantages for geothermal energy is the gasses that are released smell bad and efficiency is only 15 which isn t it s not that great And there s a limitation of it You can t just like keep reusing it and reusing it I think that would be like a possibility for a scenario but like we don t know if it s warm enough to be able to do that Yeah if there was a good spot around our area it might be good but How would you know if your area was a good spot I don t know They would have to do tests and stuff Plus I don t know that people would want it in their backyard It s hard because Cranberry if we re thinking of where those people well like a civilized area People really don t want something That smells bad Yeah that They don t want any disruption And where are you most likely going to see geothermal energy come from There are Inside of the earth Right but it s inside of the earth but it comes out in what ways In geysers In geysers or what else I m not sure Volcanoes Oh Yeah so who that s definitely something You don t have volcanoes everywhere either Yeah Right And you definitely wouldn t want that in your backyard And sometimes if there would be a good area maybe the state or the country would buy the property to like put it there because it s a good spot Sometimes they do that for like mining and stuff They like buy the property Okay Okay I had hydro electric And some of the pros that is it doesn t pollute at all And the actual running of the power plant is really cheap And then it s really reliable So say there was a big power outage in the area the hydro electric power plant could get that running again But it s run by building dams in rivers and they re extremely expensive to build which can be fixed by partnering up with someone else who needs that A different a business or something But it can also cause flooding upstream for the animals and people and houses I have a question for you Do you have to have like a big river or could you use like a little creek like we have around here I don t think you could necessarily use the creek The Connoquenessing Yeah but yeah you have to have like a big river and it has to be fairly out of the way Would it like cause flooding Yeah you couldn t have any houses really upstream because could they d flood And for example your science book says that the Hoover Dam which is on the Colorado River it created a waterfall of 400 feet which is more than twice as high as the Niagara Falls So you re talking about a river that you would have to be able to create that drop because the water creates the kinetic energy Am I saying that right Yeah And that s what causes the electricity Correct So if you could create something like that with the three rivers we have here that might that might work And again the whole Yeah the three rivers that could do it because there s a bunch of big rivers in Pittsburgh Yeah Yeah but if you build that up wouldn t that flood Well not in the middle of the city you could maybe do it like out of the city cause the rivers aren t just like in the city they go out And also if you have a good area flooding wouldn t matter so much if you pick the right area Which I mean I guess the whole thing So definitely not in Cranberry here Where we live Well we get a lot of rain around here so I m just like flooding would be like a problem Yeah We re sort of in a drought right now there s not been a big rain for a long time Does it harm the animals that are in the river It s better for farmers because down the streams the water is deeper and there s more fish and stuff but there s less plants and stuff Like upstream it floods the animals and homes and so it doesn t really hurt too much down stream I guess it depends because the farmers need deeper waters but not if there s less life in it Because that s what they re trying to achieve Rachel tell us about yours My energy is fossil fuels The pros were that it s the most effiecent of most of the energy sources we can use It s easy to find if you know in the general area of where it s at It makes up half or more of our energy in the United States The cons are that it s non renewable There s a limited supply It makes a lot of pollution when it s mined It s expensive to transport It harms aquatic life with pollution It takes millions of years to form That s something I didn t know about fossil fuels that it takes a very long time to develop It has to be like compacted Uh huh So maybe the big plant it might be able to not might be able it would probably run out fast if we started using it a lot so there wouldn t be a point in making this huge plant and then it just run out Yeah So it might be something people would use more often in the future Just little by little like just for little things What do you mainly use it for Like energy but like What falls under the umbrella of fossil fuels Coals and oils And natural gas Yeah Yeah And you said it when you mine it so we would have to transport it here There s so many people that live here that wouldn t want that Isn t that what happened in Mexico What s that called The Gulf of Mexico yeah Weren t they mining for fossil fuels like oil Oil yeah And that happens so that s like a natural disaster And that s happened a bunch of times so it s not that safe So for our scenario what do you think would be the best two Maybe nuclear around here out of the way a little so it wouldn t create any huge explosions So thermal energy transfers into electrical energy So it s kind of like biomass cause they both you burn both of them except yours you use Mine s not renewable Yeah yours you use like uhm What s it called Like plants Fossilized plants and stuff And for biomass you just use waste or woods scraps and stuff like that Actually isn t the isn t the fossilized or fossil fuels or whatever don t they keep on making them Yeah fossilized yeah but it can t it takes so long to make them because you need all the pressure and the decomposing like plants and animals that once it runs out it s going to take a while for us to get more Like thousands of years it takes to replenish Yeah It takes a long time Yeah it takes a very long time for sure So I think Keeton I don t think yours would be the best for our community to use It s running out anyway yeah so How much pollution does it cause A lot Why does the world just use it if it s running out Why waste it We talked about the efficiency What s the efficiency cost of fossil fuels I wasn t sure I couldn t find the exact Uh 38 to 47 That s actually really good cause like biomass was only 22 to 30 or something So that may have something to do with what your decision is right The efficiency of the energy I think so I just You should save some of it You don t need to save it but it s not that good of an idea to rely on this energy source that s not going to last forever That s why I say you could also use that as a backup plan because if we use something that s renewable like Katelyn s or something but something like a disaster happens that could always be our just our fall back That we know we could use that if we have to Just like an emergency generator It s like you know it s there if you need it you can use it and it can last for a little bit Since it is running out would you guys say that it would be better for us to use it now or save it in case Oh definitely save it Save it I say save it too Now I actually think save it because I think probably save it I would say to save it because if something would happen and then you would need to use that specific type then you ll be able to go back to it but if you use it all then you couldn t go back to it So what are you all proposing as your primary energy source Biomass Okay Cause it doesn t cause that much pollution And then they harness that pollution like Katelyn said They capture it and then they use it for different things like growing trees or Cause the only thing that the only pollution that really comes from it is carbon dioxide And they have a way of capturing the carbon dioxide and using it to fabricate metal and create paper and use it in greenhouses and stuff Wow interesting Yeah I thought that was pretty good So I think Katelyn s definitely provides the most for the community definitely out of all Yeah I have high effiecency rates so you ll be able to get like a lot of usable energy out of it Yeah the Colorado River isn t actually renewable energy s that good of an efficiency rating Actually actually the the hydro electric energy is nearly 95 efficient Wow Once you build it since tidal doesn t use any fuel either It s just once you built it but the down side on building is it costs so much So I don t understand why people would want to use that amount of money whenever because you could use that on different things You could do it to create more biomass Like if you wanna try to look up ways to make that fossil plant roots or plants just try to find research to make that happen more quickly speed up the process so it wouldn t be a non renewable resource like fossil fuels or anything There s no they said the small streams and like rivers and stuff like that they only create like a small amount of energy and so we can t really do that in Silicone Valley What about the three rivers in Pittsburgh Could we not somehow harness that We were talking about that I was like talking about redirecting the river Redirecting the river Just making one big one Yeah I think that we would be able to use the three rivers in Pittsburgh because they re all pretty big rivers so if we just put like one dam in there and then we harness the energy from all three I think that we could get a lot of energy from it I don t think it d be enough energy like to completely rely on it I think that we d still have to use other resources to still create energy because I know the title it only creates 10 hours of energy a day but I don t know if that means like an hour of that energy runs like a power plant It didn t exactly say how much energy is used to do one thing So I don t I don t think that d be a good idea to completely rely on that and put it in the three rivers And doesn t then the with the title energy too there has to be a difference in the The low and high Difference in the low and the high Yeah three meters of low and high Yeah so where did you find out where in the world there is that difference Yeah They said the biggest title it was in France or something But we don t have any in the United States because we don t have an area that we can put it in that has that big of a difference Oh wow So there s none used in the United States and I don t think we could use that then Well what you were saying before about how like each energy source we basically have to fall back on another one Yeah Because none of them we could completely rely on to supply all of our energy I think that we would definitely need at least two choices At least two And if we had to pick two I would pick biomass and then your nuclear because you said a little amount takes it a long way Yeah like you only need a little bit and it can produce a lot of energy And the efficiency rating s pretty high It s like 35 so yeah Wow that is pretty high Remember you said it was like really hazardous Yeah it doesn t produce a lot of air pollution or greenhouse gases but if like one small accident is made then it can cause like a really big disaster which would be bad for a community of people since there are so many people in it I think that Katelyn and Kelsey were talking about like different kinds of energy sources and according to issels uh issues 
 We gotta work quiet It s three and a half inches long and is it Seven centimeters Keep going gotta keep going Wait wait wait wait wait It s probably about one pound Okay yeah let s go I don t know how You measure it with this inches then centimeters One inch That s one inch One inch Yeah then do it across We need one inch one and a half One and a half Three and a half You got it It s a bone got a bone Pick it up It d be easier if we could pick it up Here s a bone There s one yeah You all let s put it in the middle We gotta tear it apart now We don t have to tear it apart even more It s a bone It s part of that Wait hold on hold on and feathers You all start pulling those ones It s on my finger There s a ball It s a bird it s a bird No look at this claw It s a bird it s a bird It s a birdy bird Look there s its wait where s its There s its teeth and there s its It s a skull You all be careful with those little ones Just broke it Oh my god I found something You guys are being mean A skull I found a skull right there How many skulls did you all predict would be in your owl pellet I put one One How many have you found so far Was it right We found a couple bones What about skulls how many skulls It s tiny Alright how can you determine what kind of animal it is How much did it weigh Ten grams Ten grams Do you think do you think its weight has anything to do with how many skulls inside Why would that have anything to do with Because the skull might weigh about two grams maybe I think here s another skull It s got a lot of bones in it Okay see if you can determine what animal it is Looks kind of like a teacup This is a rat skull because I can see its teeth right here I know Jake found another skull I think This is a skull This is so cool Let s get playing boys and girls You all I think this is what we got No that is a bone No look look Where s the claw And look at this claw I think it s the same And then look Look let s see Oh that s a skeleton Oh that is a skeleton Ooh my touching it A whale Ooh yay we found a skeleton Look at the skeleton Chloe It s a skull It s a skull Ew ew ew ew ew Put the feathers and stuff over here Or whatever it is Yeah we need to the feathers Look this is soft It s not soft it has something There s a little baby bone It looks like a squirrel Look I got a baby bone No seriously What animal did you predict you would find in your owl pellet A bird A bird a gopher and a rat So what have you have you decided what it is A bird How did you determine it was a bird We found like big claws like this How can you be sure that it s a bird claw Because these are usually as hard and like sharper We put this Oh we got the skull and we got a skull How many animals how many skulls have you found We only found like two This is what I was thinking You know how it has sharp stuff up there What s a way that you can determine what it is I think we got a bird we got some more claws However much bones you find Compare the bones that you found to the bones on the chart I found another skeleton Keep working It has to be a bone this might be something right there Let me get that out because I haven t got anything out yet We got two skulls I found something I found this Another skull Yeah I think Found another bone You did Yep We found all sorts of here s another this is a claw It s a bird Is this a bird claw or I don t know I think that s a Where s the bird skull Found something What is it Wait hold on wait I think we ll find another skull What do you think this is Daniel What do you think this is I don t know Know what that is I bet that s probably something I think this bone might be something found in its arm You all look what I found I think this is a skull right here because We got them two don t worry We got a bone we got a bone We got the same skeleton Have you determined what your animal is No we don t know I think this is an eyeball We got a bunch of eyeballs Here let me see that Look look look It s a tooth Eyeball Let me see Look I found this This is the part of the eyeball Look look I found the Ew I found the pelvis I found the pelvis The owls are on this chart I think that might be something wait With the tweezers Here s an eye socket Over there somewhere This is this I think We need to get the hair out of it Oh my word I think we got Look I got the head See how sharp these are 
 Dakota didn t want to bring his because it s all broken Well we can still look at it Go get it honey Actually Hannah bring Dakota s petroglyph over please Yeah that s the thing with clay It breaks very easily Okay All right Will you still be able to tell us about it He said that it exploded Please don t break it any more Are you going to be able to talk about it still You can tell us what was on it Okay put it down Addy or it s going to break Okay So you guys you did Your small group was Washoe and you re going to present to the whole group next week or the next week after The whole group The whole classroom Okay Okay So what I need you to do for a little bit is talk between yourselves about what you found And the four things that I want you to make sure somebody knows something about food shelter clothing and location But if you found something else you want to talk about go ahead So anybody chime in Okay I think I know where they re located Can you tell us South Lake Tahoe I know what they ate In your strong voice though They ate onions They ate wild potatoes wild carrots I think a little bit Wild mustard sunflower seeds wild carrots wild potatoes wild strawberries raspberries wild gooseberries wild rosehips wild rhubarb pine nuts and they used Sweet potatoes wild turnips wild spinach seeds Okay Do you think we re good on food Yeah Okay I think Olivia got the part Well we ll talk about that after So we have location Shelter Go ahead Okay Who s going to go next I have they used sticks and leaves to build their homes Okay What do you have your information on I have clothing They used rabbit skins buckskins and plants Okay And I m sorry Coleman What did you say They used sticks and leaves to build their homes Okay So you got those four covered Any fun facts you guys found Dakota what did you find out Give us one fun fact In 1859 the Washoe Wait Let Dakota guys Remember we re trying to be good listeners In 18 Go ahead sweetie In 1859 the Washoe had about 90 people times Aw No no not 90 900 Can I see what you wrote They had 90 000 or Nine hundred Nine hundred and now they only have 300 No let s see The population Well I got it off the computer Yeah I got 1500 In 1855 the Washoe numbered about 900 But are now reduced to about a third of that number What that the same fact you had Dakota Yeah Yeah very good Thank you Dakota I got in 2007 there was 1500 But I got it off the computer too and it said that Well you know the computer is not always I got the latest What kind of data did you get Like demographic Or where did you get yours from I got it from Google Well guys 300 was what yours said Dakota And yours said 1500 Yeah Are you sure yours wasn t 1500 from before And now it s 300 Well it said in 2007 Okay On here on my brain copy Okay We might need to look at that some more you guys We ll look into that before we report on that But that would be a fun fact anyway Joe did you tell us anything Yeah I have another fun fact Okay A fun fact Their houses are called Gadus Gadus okay Okay Now who hasn t had a turn guys All of you got your hands up Let s include our little friend Addy Okay They made baskets Any good baskets Mostly Dot So La Lee Most famous one She was famous for making baskets What was she famous for Olivia She was the She made the most baskets than other Washoe people the other Indians And why was she more famous than all the other Indians I don t know that but I think she was like a really good basket maker You think she was a good Can you scoot over I can yeah Okay Did you guys get to see any of the samples of the baskets Yes Did you know that they re in very Oh you have a picture Awesome These are actually Dot So La Lee s baskets Mm hmm Okay So the thing if you every get to see one of Dot So La Lee s baskets they re woven so tight you could carry water in them And we talked about symmetry today in math They re perfectly symmetrical Yes they re woven so tight that you can put water in them And even Dot So La Lee had like 2000 You what She had made that many baskets She made how many A lot Two thousand Two hundred and something Wow It would be nice to have one of those now huh Yeah But they re like You can t even buy them You cannot buy them huh They re like in a museum They re in museums but I think some people do have a private collection of them Really Maybe one or two yeah They re not like our petroglyphs that we re going to talk about Can you have a petroglyph in your private collection No Those you can t have Okay So you guys let s see who wants to be the writer Do you have a pencil Grab that pencil Would you write your tribal name up here You guys are Washoe And then go around Addy and find out Write the name of the person next to the food the shelter and that s what you re going to kind of be responsible for Let s get Addy And you can go around and ask each person or you can say Who wants to do food W A S H O E I ll do fun facts I ll do shelter I ll do fun facts No I ll do shelter Okay How are we going to decide Joe should do the clothing Joe should do clothing Is that okay with you Do you think I should tell you the name of the Hold on We re not doing these We ll do that later Thank you Olivia Olivia volunteered for food Joe do you really want to do clothing I was either going to do clothing or language because I found a whole thing for Everybody can do a fun fact too But I was going to do a fun facts We need somebody to do food and location Okay I ll do location Shelter Shelter and location I got I ll get shelter Good Thank you Coleman And then I know you guys want to do fun facts too so everybody can do a fun fact L E and then M A N C O L E M A N L E L E M A N Okay Now we just have location left But what s Dakota doing What do you want to do How about me and Dakota will do location together Does that work Okay That s who s going to do the fun fact Everyone can do a fun fact So write Thomas Dakota for location No don t worry about fun facts Everybody has got a fun fact right there So if both of you are doing it it s got to be super duper Okay so we re going to look up if they lived in Washoe They probably did Did you have their names down Addy It s like Washoe people Where are you guys going to find the information Dakota And Dakota D A K O T A Better You guys what did we find out about Google Maybe you want to find two If you have two things and they don t say the same thing you might want to check another one There s a lot of maps on Google There s a lot of maps on Google Yeah We re going to go We re going to go on maps and look where Okay Thanks I m going to take that so when you Okay So next week or the week after you guys are going to do a whole group class presentation on your tribe And you re welcome to bring pictures or artifacts or like pieces of whatever if you want to do that You can bring a basket Obviously it s not going to be a Dot So La Lee Can I bring a arrowhead Did your tribe have arrowheads Yeah Okay Now looking in front of you you guys for our art project we did something What is this called Who knows Olivia I like how you raised your hand The petrograph Louder Petro The petrograph Petroglyphs And what is a petroglyph You re going to break yours Thomas Addy what s a petroglyph It s a carving in a rock A carving in a rock Did your tribe make petroglyphs We don t know Why don t you know Cuz they put things like right down They made it They just moved They just carved it in and nobody really knows unless there s someone from that tribe who made it and passed it down generation to generation Yes Very good What were you going to say You know when we were looking on that website We were looking on that website and one said Washoe Okay Yes So some of them they attri They say that they did it but we don t know who did what petroglyphs But in our state can we narrow it down to one of four tribes probably And maybe if they found petroglyphs where your location was you could say those were Shoshone petroglyphs Would that work We re Washoe Washoe I m sorry All right So who wants to share theirs first So what you re going to do is you re going to share it and show the whole group and tell us what yours meant to you Okay Okay Addy you want to call on somebody Since everybody is dying to talk Who s going first Coleman Coleman can we see yours Okay I want to zoom in on it Hold it up a little bit because I got it up Okay What does yours mean to you It means that it s night and there s some stars and there s a duck And then there s a canoe on the water And there is a lot of meat and camping Camping Okay Anybody else want to go Pass it around Joseph Oh don t pass it around We don t want to break it We re going to stick them on wood or something Oh let me get a picture Oh I m zooming in Up higher Joe because I ve got this on a tripod Okay All right Mine is we re going to drink some water from a river with fish in it and a duck on top And there s a snake trying to eat the duck There s an eagle It s daytime and the skies are clear Oh Addy you re calling on people Thank you Okay Addy sit back a little bit so we can see Miss Olivia random things but I think I know what it is It means they re hunting buffalo at night And then the daytime came and it s all rainbow And we caught some fish That s it Okay Good Who wants to go now Thomas Nice So there s a camp and there s a little hill behind the camp And there s people in war and there s a snake And then one person is not in war He s just trying to shoot a duck But then the other guy shot him and then there s And this has been happening for three days Okay Dakota Mine kind of blew up here Mine kind of blew What happened to yours honey It like kind of didn t turn out so well It like blew up in pieces Can you tell us what it was before it blew up in pieces Well it was like I don t know Did you have like hunting symbols or anything No He just did like squares I drew lines because I I remember I didn t really know what to write You didn t know what to write Okay That s all right But if you could do it again what would you do What would it mean to you I d probably make up a war thing A war thing Okay It s more war except hunt Hunting Oh okay Did you go Miss Addy Okay Humans were hunting for humans That s what s on mine Okay Addy I would wait until everybody was listening Thank you I can t show your Okay Just show the other children It s a sunny day A snake is trying to eat the fish The fish are in the river Cool What s the little zigzag Mountains Oh those are mountains Oh cool Sun Snake River Just fishing Just fishing So what other kind of art things could we have done to show your tribe What would have been your tribe only Baskets We could have maybe tried to weave something What else Basket but That wouldn t be too fun In our project like we could pretend that we were real 
 So our question was What are the reasons why Holden has a sudden acceptance of letting Phoebe grow up And I got this question because I feel like the carousel represents growing up because you have to let people grab towards something they want or else if you re not letting them experience the world to its full extent then you re just sheltering them and they re just going to live a sheltered life So they can t really do all the things that they have the possibility of experiencing Yeah I agree with him with Damon because I think the carousel symbolizes the ride through life Because it never really stops just continuously goes around and around And the goal is to grab the golden hoop And I think that symbolizes I don t know happiness because everybody tries for it and they keep trying even though they fall they keep getting back up on that carousel and trying to grab it And if you hold a kid back from trying to grab what he wants it s just like no I m not going to let you go out there and try to get what you want They re sheltering them from their own happiness kind of Because I also agree with Brandon but I also think that let s just say Phoebe was on the carousel and she fell off I don t know if Holden would go to her but I think based on his character he would But then I think that would be bad just because like Brandon was saying if you don t let them fall if you don t let them make their own mistakes then they re not gonna learn from life So like my dad he s so overprotective I think pretty much all parents are really overprotective of their kids but you should just let them go out there and experience the world and learn from themselves Not necessarily because I think that s their fear learning from their mistakes So I just think it s better if you just let them go like a little bit at a time just so they can just figure out things in life I think people have a hard time letting go of any child whether it s their brother their sister their actual child because it means that they re leaving soon and they re actually going to experience their own lives and then when it comes to a parent or an older brother or sister they don t want you to experience the same thing that they did too so they re like telling you what to do and it seems like they re telling you how to live your life but they re giving you advice I think parents the reason that they re so protective is because they know that saying ignorance is bliss because it really is and innocence is in a way you know because you don t know And so they just want their child to be happy but inadvertently they re actually making them sad if they just won t relax so they can And also I think a lot of kids don t understand this but part of the reason why our parents have such a hard time letting go is because you were part of their lives for as many years as you ve been born They preciously try to take care of you and they may seem like they re trying to shield you from everything but they re just trying to look out for what s best for you But you can t think of it like oh once this one chance goes by I ll never have it again Because it really is like a carousel You re gonna keep going on and you will have another chance Going back to the carousel I also thought that the carousel it may just seem that there are a bunch of different people on it So I think Holden kind of realized that even though the carousel he knows have different people on it you kind of have to allow the kids to grow up because you can t always keep them the same like the carousel it s not a real machine or something We all have to grow up eventually Just listening to you guys what do you think about when I was home in Los Angeles my nephew at that time was about six months old And at that point in time he was just crawling and putting everything in his mouth and stuff like that like leaves You d show him an apple and he s like Ahh And then he puts a leaf in his mouth And you re just like Holy You have to dig it out kind of a thing So in one respect I mean it s just like there s this idea of let people figure out things on their own but in that respect he ll die if you let him figure out oh you can t eat that So I m just trying to think as far as a parent goes how does a parent know when to let them figure it out versus how does a parent when to protect them And I think that s part of the conflict Holden is having he s trying to figure out how he can protect people and what he should protect them against Me and my grandpa talk to me and he was like I know that I have to let you go And I think that they know when to let you go by how responsible you are Like if you do what you re supposed to do and you show them that you re working or doing what you said then they want to let you go because they know that you That s true and I also think that it s not really based on yourself mostly It s based on your parents and how they ve grown and how with having kids you grow up as a parent and you know and it s just nature you just know when they re ready That s what I think I don t think really it s just based on all of their mistakes I just think it s pretty much based on Interesting I think when people start changing and stuff like their attitude because I ve noticed my little brother he s starting to change and he has an attitude now He s starting to get a little rebellious and stuff and I think that s when parents have to start letting loose on their kids cause we have to experience things on our own and it s not just being told what to do and stuff You have to have that experience to learn from Every person has their own free will Like the saying you can take a horse to the water but you can t make it drink You can enforce your rules on your child as much as you want but you can t force them to do anything you can just have an influence on them And that s something that parents have to understand You can t force your kids to do their homework but you can ground them if they don t All right guys I want you guys to keep going You guys are doing a great job I can see your notes are also looking pretty good I m gonna move on to another group okay But keep this going because I think you guys can come up with a lot more okay Thank you guys You guys are doing an awesome job with your volume we re gonna come over to this group over here All right can you fill me in on what you guys talked about making sure we have the volume up We have a couple of questions we have like Oh okay Let s just come up with tell me about the one that you guys are the most excited about The first question is my question which was what are the reasons why people live their lives through other people And I kind of came up with that question because Holden he kind of was denied of his childhood because Allie died and so that really impacted him And since that he s kind of been trying to preserve the innocence of Phoebe Like making her go back to the carousel even though she says she s too big for it He s like No you re not He s trying to help to her keep that innocence or just children in general keep that innocence that he was denied It kind of was a parent versus child kind of thing It goes against like parent versus child So a parent when they have a child they kind of want to live their life through their child And they make them do all these chores to get into because they never got to do it when they were little because they were deprived and their parents probably didn t want them to do it So they kind of Interesting I said that I just think this whole concept of the identity is not yet established and you have the father and have somebody else create their footsteps I had these two other questions because I was reading the book where I was wondering why I was trying to get more in depth with why Holden wanted his job to be catching children in the rye Okay so I kind of answered it and I said it s very in tune because when you fall off the cliff you can t get back up Just like when you lose your innocence you can t get it back because this experience happened If you get exposed to it you can t magically forget it It just stays with you and that s a part of you that s just lost Interesting That kind of relates back to the question about It seems like Holden is kind of holding onto his past and so he s still living in that innocent stage and when he s living an innocent stage he can t make a wrong decision which is very hard from his now because he s 16 he keeps transferring to all these schools and he can t really grow up because he still has that memory and so that s why he s confused about his identity Good point Going back to the first question about why people live their lives through other people it kind of goes through influences too Like he was talking about James Castle and when he died he said that James liked to digress on a topic and have speeches and it kind of made him think about oh yeah that s a pretty great idea It s not bad but why would people be waiting for that It was actually like a digression off topic makes you think of new ideas And I think going back to that question again that sometimes parents want the best for their child so they convince their what they want their child to be If that makes sense And at the end sometimes you can t force the child to do what they don t want to do So in a way it s kind of like you guys said the parent versus the child They wanna form their own identity as a teen but at the same time the parents are so busy trying to protect them Is that what we re kind of getting at through everything They re so busy trying to protect them that they just gotta learn to let go Is that what we re saying Yeah kind of Like Holden says he s trying to protect that innocence because he s always referring to There s a part where he s walking down the sidewalk and he called Allie to help him cross to the other side And that s kind of interesting because usually you don t think an adult would say that A child would say that And it s because he s mad at his parents because they won t talk about it so he s kind of just living with this Interesting So he s just trying to find a way of coping Is that possible Yes And then there was another kind of question about where Holden comes to Kiana said Why do people feel the need to forget the deaths and move on And I thought of this question because when Holden was inside just his room Phoebe was getting all frustrated with him because she was like You don t like anything You don t like anything And he was trying to make up stuff that he did like Like he did say he liked Allie and she ll say he s dead so pick something else And he was arguing with her saying that just because he s dead you don t forget him and you can still like someone who s dead And he thinks that Allie is thousand times better than nicer than people who are alive today now So that just proves how he s holding on to that and he s not planning on forgetting that and he holds that near and dear to his heart And so that s probably why he doesn t like a lot of people because he compares them to how Allie was and his innocence his maturity level how it was then and how he sees how people today because kids don t understand he s holding on so he doesn t really understand what s going on Anything else to add on to this No I like what you guys are doing I like how you re tying in the death of Allie with the catcher in the rye type of a thing What about the carousel first of all I don t know it sounds like it goes with the whole keeping the innocence going and all Cause I know he would probably ride it too Did he ride it I was thinking of repetition because how the parents feel it rotates around and round And whenever Phoebe passed by he would tell her how pretty she looked She was never changing That s kind of what he wanted he wanted her to stay in that stage and nothing to change Nice All right guys I m gonna check on another group I want you guys to keep going with this you guys are tearing it apart Good job looking at the symbolism and tying everything together All right and your notes look good as well too I like it I think you guys could explore the carousel and tie that in a little more Okay hi guys You guys the volume is doing really well So you guys fill me in Okay Tell me what you guys talked about Just mostly like and symbolism in the book Start getting louder 
 I m not gonna have no peace with that If you feel something I don t know something like done bothered me that done made me like brought me down to the point where I was crying about it The first thing he say I ain t gonna tell nobody but I feel where you coming from He tell me it shouldn t get to that point where you mad over something that doesn t matter If it s good or not that seriously don t matter That s in the past the past ain t gonna do nothing The past can t hurt you Okay Alright That s what I d tell him So really this kind of conversation should ve been held with what kind of friend A pretty good friend A pretty good friend or maybe even your best friend Nope Not your best friend Oh yes my best friend You already know who I m talking about He s my best friend Now he one of them people that he done did some stuff to me that made me mad I ask him Man why you doing this I thought you was different from everybody else But not once have I actually went out there and played the cards while I m at home How I m not gonna tell nobody and then come two days later everybody and their momma walking up to him and asking him questions Uh why you did this to her So let me ask you this So your saying you ve had conversations with your best friend before and then he s divulged information that you ve said to him No from time to time he might get mad and he ll say something then we have to have that one on one talk OK this was between me and you I don t want to hear this coming out nobody else s mouth Cause then I know point blank that you done said something Let me ask you this if you would have that conversation with someone is he truly your best friend Is that a conversation that Jay chime in any time If you got to keep reminding him that hey man if you tell somebody something and you gotta be worried about whether their gonna tell it to someone else Honestly are they really your best friend No Like I said before that s another acquaintance because you can t trust him like that man He telling you he ain t gonna tell nobody but he going back on his word He going to get a friend to turn on you in a heartbeat that s why I said it s about you Johnny No Between what you say I don t blame Johnny If he s truly your best friend He won t tell nobody He won t tell anybody But then you got like it s a boundary between stuff you tell You can tell your best best friend something deep but it s a certain boundary between that which you wouldn t tell him certain stuff I tell my best friend almost everything but certain stuff he don t need to know Right cause certain things we My business don t need to be his He have one of those days when he feeling down then I come over there Blah blah blah don t say nothing to me Then he flips out on me and he wanna tell something that s so deep to me that I m sitting there looking like did he really just say this Cause your shocked You re in shock and You don t never expect well anybody wouldn t expect their best friend to spill the beans or say something that s not meant to be told Me I would never expect Chris to say anything I tell him So far he has been a best friend He don t tell nothing I say I don t want to have to tell what he tells me because we got that best friend relationship Cause a best friend should be loyal all the way to the end Not when it s necessary or needed That s right Not when it s necessary but at all times right Yes ma am Okay Alright Let me go to the next scenario You decide you would like to take in a movie but you choose not to go alone You finally reach someone by phone who is just as bored as you and is dying to be in the company of someone pleasant You both enjoy yourselves so much you plan to do this again Where is that person at on the grading scale I d say that s a group thing because they interested in the same thing that you re interested in Group friend Okay Alright group friend Group friend Someone that you know through association Now in this scenario it s just you and that person And it could be someone that you met through the group Or it could be It s not necessarily your best friend You just started hanging out out of the blue You met them and when your friends not around y all started to talk a little and get to know more about each other then I d say that s a pretty good friend Pretty good friend I could say a pretty good friend cause I would hang out with a pretty good friend A pretty good friend you can take on the outside of school and you can go do activities that both of y all enjoy Yeah because a group friend is normally someone you hang out with in a group Kind of like we re together Because once again you know that person through association of someone else But a good friend is someone that you actually can call up and say Okay you want to go out Yeah You wanna go out Let s go It s nothing between you guys If its a girl you understand that she just want to see the movie and I want to see the movie We laugh we joke we go out eat pizza together but it s nothing else there We ain t trying to be boyfriend girlfriend You can t try to make it more then what it is Right Then if it s just a friend one of your dudes that you hang out with y all like the same movie Like I You know You can t call me cause we re not on the same level I m your teacher at all times Even though you know I like the same type movies you like and we always discuss the same type of movie we re not going to go to the movies together Cause you on the adult level we on the young people level Right and we re different types of Our friendship scale is different Is not even up here it s Right Okay Now Someone approaches you about going to see an exhibit at the museum You were glad to hear it because it just happens to be an exhibit that you wanted to see anyway So your parents tell you both that you can go and you can The exhibit is in a different city Your parents tell you both that you can go and you can spend the night over out of town What kind of friend is that Is that just an acquaintance That would probably be with like with my best friend I wouldn t go out of town with somebody that s not by best friend I ain t going to go out of town I got to go with somebody that I know is going to speak to me You know what I m saying mm hmm Got to be somebody I can trust I don t have to many friends I can trust I don t know why but all my friends is just the reason why I don t get too close to them I can t exactly tell you why I just don t Because I can t trust everybody Okay Alright Because you ll never know who will be your best friend today and they might turn on you tomorrow so you ll never know Okay So that s why this is a good piece to do Because we got to figure out who is just an acquaintance who is someone we that we will just see on the hall hi how you doing bye Got to figure out who is the acquaintance and then we got to figure out who is the group friend who is a good friend who is the best friend Because there s somewhere There s a fine line like you guys said there s a fine line between all five of them but you got to know the line You got to know where the line is drawn You got to know the conversations to have with all of them because there are certain conversations that you would have with that best friend That you want to tell somebody that you just met in the hall Right Right Cause there like you just telling me your whole business but you don t really know my name or nothing about me That s something The stuff you telling me I wouldn t tell you I would tell it to my best friend but as far as what s going on in my house I ll probably let you know I got sisters and brothers the basic stuff but not oh my momma s strung out or doing this and that Cause everybody s business is not your business Your business is not are you That s right We always got to keep that in mind because so many times I ll get calls from parents and they ll say So and so Just talking too much Especially when people are getting into a lot of issues or getting into confusion at school or what have you And a lot of that comes from the fact that they don t know when to be quiet or they don t know what to say or how to say it or who to approach Because if someone says to you stand up for a minute In the morning when you first come in and the first thing I say to you is what Good morning Good morning Good morning Vincent How you doing Good morning Ms Jenson How was your weekend I went to my cousin house I got to spend time with my Godmother and I went grocery shopping Okay so that Now you told me I didn t say what did you do Oh I said how was your weekend It was good It was good And that s basics of that conversation It should not be oh guess what My momma My momma and her boyfriend was fighting and they threw the cat out the window and then the police came over Because at that moment you have just did what Stepped out of bounds You ve stepped out of bounds You ve divulged way Too much Too much You done opened the book before it could be read Or you done read the book before it could be bought Because really I didn t buy into all of that I didn t want all of that You just wanted to know your name and how was your weekend I just wanted the generalities of it was a good weekend And then there are times that we could probably get a little deeper But you not asking for that You just asking for the simple That s right That s right Jeremy I m going to ask you Stand up for a minute Jay cause you re a pretty secretive guy Mmhm So normally we got to pull stuff out of you Cause I said to you earlier I said Your Dad called And what was that about I was stuck on the river And he said I was stuck on the river My first thought was Jeremy got a boat So I said You got a boat That s what I said right Yeah I was over there at the Wafflehouse over there by Brian Gates behind over there at the apartments I went to see someone And so he went to see someone but again sometimes you got to know when to hold your conversation and when to divulge it and when to divulge it Because even though he went to see someone he didn t give me no elaborate details yeah this honey she was Because a lot of times You don t need that I don t need that You just wanted to know where I was at Just wanted to know where you was at I want to make sure you was okay Make sure that your Dad got in touch with someone to be able to say Jeremy s okay Okay Alright Alright Yeah You can have a seat That was a good conversation Huh This was a good conversation This was a good conversation You thought this was a good lesson Today was a good day It was a good day Because some people don t know their boundaries of talking and telling it all Some people just give up too much information Some people around here got to even say what did to you and everything From here we re going actually the next thing we re going to discuss is conversations That s where we re going to go from here I wanted us to because the other day we kind of looked at friendship but I wanted to go a little deeper because I know I want us to realize that friendships they should be reciprocal Not always And when I say reciprocal everybody understands what I m saying The same No Should be the same like how I feel about you you should feel that same way about me I feel like you trustworthy but you feel like I m going to tell on you any chance I get Right Exactly But they re not always reciprocal but keep in mind that friendships are always changing Because who you put down on your friendship scale on Thursday It change It changed You gave me a whole different not a whole different set but you gave me some different people and you actually moved some people Where you had Yolanda as a good friend she became just a group friend four days later Okay and you had valid reasons and keep in mind that things do change Just because someone was a best friend last week Don t mean they going to stay your best friend They re not Nine times out of 10 I promise you guys When I was in high school I could there were three there was four of us and I considered them my very best friends Now I don t know how deep they would ve had my back but I considered them my good friends We talked on the phone we shared secrets we shared stuff you know when we was sneaking and doing stuff We shared those things but today I really can t tell you where they re at Now there was some friends that I met in college that we re still friends to this day They re friends that I ve had since I came into teaching that I don t know where those people are Because I ve been teaching when you think of teaching for 18 years people have friends people have come and gone in the teaching profession but I haven t kept in touch with all of them because there has to be a there has to be something in common that s going to keep you friends It can t just be I see if I see them just at school and that s all we ever talk about is school and schoolwork and complain and fussing and about lesson plans and stuff then nine times out of 10 those are just my associates Those are just acquaintances people that I pass in the hall We laugh we joke but we don t share any intimate conversation Okay I m glad this was a good exercise for you guys and next time we re going to look into conversations The type of conversations you have with each one of those type people 
 How old are you Five years old Five years old Blake is this a bear Yes Yes Is this a bear Yeah Yes Is this a bear No No very nice Is this a fire truck No No Is this a penguin Yes Yes What s your name Blake Walker Blake Walker Give me eyes Awesome Where s your eyes Where s Blake s eyes Here s the eyes Eyes Good job Eyes Where s eyes Eyes Very good Eyes Where s Blake s eyes That s the eyes Eyes very good How old are you Five years old Five years old Do you want the elephant No You want the ball No You want the book No Want the fire truck Yes Vroom Vroom Oh my turn fire truck Excuse me I train please I play train please I play train I play train please Train My turn train Thank you I play train Choo choo Choo choo I play with train please Train Choo choo My turn train Thank you I play train please I play train please I play train please Train My turn I play train please Blake I play train All mine I play please I play I play train I play train please Train He s traveling with the whole thing He is at least waiting until he gets closer before he starts Uh huh He s not repeating My turn I fire truck I play with fire truck please I play fire I fire I play with fire truck please Fire truck My turn I fifth please I fifth please I play the please Fish Fish please Fish Uh oh Fish broken Bye bye fish Let me see Now see Alright See I knew they worked All done fish Bye fish Right bye fish All done fish I fish please I play I play Fish Please Fish Fish All done fish All done fish Bye fish I play I play fish please Yellow fish Orange fish All done fish Done fish Bye bye fish I play I play with fish I play with fish I play fish please Fish Can you count fish one two three four Fish all done Bye fish I play fish 
 At first we put only tap water in it and then we all of a sudden changed it So but there s still tap water in with the oily water So you think that s why the control got messed up because it had too much Well that s not variables changed my only reason What s the other reason My other hypothesis for the control cup not growing was like the seeds were duds Were your guys s the oil ones That one s not yours No Ours is the one that s all grown Oh why don t you go get your cup and show people So this is oil Okay well the oil one did grow really fast and all of a sudden it died it looks like Kind of So like at first it was normal with that thing and then well I don t understand that chart Yeah me neither because it looks like It looks like it didn t grow then it grew really really fast then it went down Super What happened was it grew and then it over polluted and then it just died Looks like that Well like Well like what I don t get is I see the other oil one it seems like the oil one is growing bigger than the other ones It just like suddenly grew all of a sudden All the oil is the same with the control which you have all of a sudden all of a sudden also these diagrams Also in the control diagram that went back down to zero centimeters I don t know Yeah this chart might have messed up Because that means both these plants die And then the control regrew Yeah it doesn t make any sense It doesn t It turned white and then it died and turned brown because on my chart it grew point it grew it grew 0 14 and then 0 14 again and then 0 04 so like alive dead alive and stuff When it grew the second time did it grow or did it subtract The second time I think it died and then the last time it just kept on growing but the first time it started growing it grew second time it grew one centimeter What did you put in to help it grow What did you put in it to help it grow Oily water So did the oil or the manipulator control grow more The manipulative one grew more because it grew and then it died So why do you think it did that Because like I what I thought is that it was too much oil on it and then oil gets on the leaf it like it helps the plant grow or something Just killing other Doesn t the plant feed off the leaves So the oil got spread on the leaves and then it s feeding the oil then it died Look at yours compared to mine because yours is way more controlled ones than ours does because the only one we had was the experiment plant Do you I think the reason why the vinegar or the acid rain made it grow because like acid is good for you and it s mixed with water so it s not too bad for the plant But I think it got way too much acid and acid actually eats things It kills it and that s why I think the plant is all dead because like you said Nolan it did grow because acid is good for us but yet when we have too much it dies So that s why I think this plant is all shriveled over I agree with you because acid is part water and that s what rain is but there s a little bit of acid so water s good for you But acid it doesn t grow it s not good for you so Well actually it is good for you but not a lot I think you re Maybe just a little bit of water in it more than acid rain and then when we kept spraying the acid rain on maybe it got too much acid rain And then the acid rain overtook the water and died So it like decreased by a lot That s why I think it s just like the Red Bull because Red Bull is like gives you really much energy and then you just crash without any energy See right there Just like Red Bull It increases and then decreases What d you think Misha Well yeah I think like what you said Nolan because the regular plant grew just fine and then that the experiment grew like good and better than the regular one but then it like the acid overtook the plant just like Nolan said What else I noticed about my control plant it started big at first and then it decreased in size Then it got bigger so it s going off and on in size So it actually did kind of better than this because at the end it did better than that one and the last opposite It like died after the second one it only stayed for a couple of days or a couple weeks Yeah but it was only to a point it was living because when I did my second observation it was still kind of full but it was broken on the side So it started falling into a point where it fell in and got buried in the oily water basically It died My actual skin and everything the plant grows faster but it also dies faster and I figured from like the oils on my hand Why do you think it did that Because the oil on your hand Because the oil on your hand may not be the exact same thing as like oils in a car but oil still has the same base But how does it make the plant grow faster if you touch it with your hand I don t know Instead of wearing gloves maybe it s just the stuff inside of the oils and everything but it grew faster and also died faster Like the plant that we have now is dying faster but this one since it has water normally and everything it s healthy and stayed big the whole time But the other one is like that but it died If you have what you were saying earlier when you have oil on your hand and then it was you polluted it with oil don t you think you polluted that one too No well like it s my whole point is that it speeded up the process What speeded up the process Like the oil when I plant a bean or something when I plant bulbs for tulips or something and I touch it with my hands instead of my gloves Then it actually seems I may just be paranoid but it grows faster and then my mom put hers with gloves and it didn t grow as fast I don t know the depth of that part or something I don t get what you re saying Are you saying that you have a magic touch and you just make plants grow faster No I think it s just the oils of your skin So what would the oils in your skin do for a plant Like the oil for your plant here Is it the same like the oil that we used Like it didn t make them healthy but it just made it grow faster because this one took a little bit longer to get bigger but the other one Show me your data that suports that This Yeah What s your data that supports that The These ones Yeah the one the data that supported it was that oops is is it went with the control It already had grown and it was after a week and ours still hasn t grown And it was growing at 0 16 centimeters per day and then the next time it was growing 2 7 centimeters a day So what does that tell you That it was growing a lot faster but it wasn t necessarily growing as efficiently Okay What do you mean by inefficient Efficient What do you mean by efficient I mean like it grew faster but it wasn t necessarily healthy for the plant for it to grow so fast So was there other evidence that you would use that would prove that it wasn t healthy Yeah because the leaves now they re all gross and blotchy and they re dying and they re crunchy and not as soft and smooth as these And they have a shine to them because of the oil What did the rate of growth confirm that At first it was kind of spiked for a little bit and then it started going back down and now it s dying a lot faster than the natural plant because these plants it grows in a steady period of time With that it grew really fast and now it s dying really fast So what conclusion did you get That oil still makes the plant grow but it s not necessarily healthy for it Do you agree Yeah because me and Because my group my experiment when we did this it was growing super fast and now it s like dying and stuff And we think that the oil has a chemical in it that speeds up the process of the plant growing but then it speeds up and of slows down the process of the plant dying because On the grass a little bit and the number of leaves will only be like two and then it shrivels up and died And then the color would stay light green and kind of brown like how it is right now and then my data was according to my graph the acid rain plant grew more than I thought It grew 25 centimeters but it started to die because of It turns light brown and started to die The leaves increased from two all the way to six leaves by the end Okay My question was what would the effect be if I changed the water to salt water and I put if I change the water to salt I predict that the plant will stay the same height as the control plant I predict a number of leaves will stay the same as the control plant I predict the color will be white ish gray ish My manipulator variable is water to salt water According to my data I was correct because the height was the same and the number of leaves were the same The data shows the height of both plants were zero centimeters and the number of leaves was zero on both plants The rate of the growth was zero On the salt water there was crust on it and it was Restate that so that Jessica gets it and see if Jessica knows And then like we were saying Olivia was talking about maybe how it looks burnt and then like you know how water it attracts a lot of light and so people get tan Yeah Faster and then so maybe the shine for the oil maybe it attracted more of the heat from the light and it burnt the leaves so Like the glisten from it Yeah Maybe that s why it looks all burnt and Because it reminded me of when you see the old movies like how it s a burnt reel Piece of paper Something like sands off in the reel of a video and you just see a hole get bigger on the burning screen That s what it kind of reminded me of Because it has a brown wrinkle around it And then it s dark and then it s kind of brown and crisp so that s what it kind of reminded me of and that s what made me think of it Yeah and then how I thought of the idea of it attracting the light and heat was how Olivia said that when you re in water it attracts more heat and light to you so maybe that s how So that s how I got the idea of maybe that s what happened So do you have anything to add Jared No You Jessica No Okay Okay so I think the reason why mine didn t grow like before how the salt would have absorbed the water Because when Mr Kelson sprayed it all of the salt right here you could feel it It s all stuck to the top so the water can t get down to the soil and all that So it can t grow at all 
 Yes I think if it s really really quiet and you want to talk about something then go ahead But if a lot of people obviously want to talk probably a good idea to raise our hands Okay what else Be involved Be involved yes I will be keeping track of who contributes to the discussion Because everybody has an opinion but I need you to express that opinion What else Don t criticize other peoples ideas Don t criticize other peoples ideas Okay What might you do instead Suggest something give your outlook give your opinion Okay Give your argument But don t insult the other person s ideas This is a safe place to share ideas okay Now we re going to have three jobs I m going to need a task master a reader and a time keeper Time keeper You want to be the time keeper Alright you need to let us know when we ve got about two minutes left of the class I want to be the task master Okay so what does the task master do They make sure that everybody s on task Yeah what else What might that look like Subjects get off or out of control So people get off subject we could a little bit of crowd control What about if everybody wants to talk and they start raising their hands You get to pick on one Yeah task master gets to call and make sure every body gets their chance to talk Okay Yes Is there a praiser Actually that s a good idea Let s have a praiser I want to be him You want to be the praiser Alright Michael is the praiser What s the praiser do Oh can I do that Dang it always You can team up with me Can we This class yeah you guys want to be a team Okay So what is a praiser What are you guys going to do Give compliments Okay give compliments Compliment their ideas their expressions okay And then I need a reader Preferably somebody on that side of the room I don t know how to read I m unavailable You ll read No Who would like to read About five seconds before I call on someone I ll do it Okay so the questions are all up here there s five of them You re going to read them so the whole group can hear Okay Okay Alright so task master Oh I m here Okay you re on task now and we re going to start by having the reader read us the first question Okay should people own ideas I don t really think so I think it should be shared like for public opinion Like public knowledge like how they were putting the genome stuff out on the internet Great thought Thanks You re doing good Well I think that the information should be shared but the people who found it or came up with the idea should get credit for it I think that if you come up with an idea shouldn t you have some like you have conferences everybody gets together and talks about stuff So why don t you have scientists and stuff that like created this idea come together and have a conference and talk about it so then ideas are spread out through all those companies and stuff And then the people that made that contributed to it have like a patent I guess you would say or just like copy or not copyright it Like discovered by or Yeah like that Good opinion So coming together would be easier then Sometimes I feel like if If no one gets credited or gets yeah They won t want to like They won t want to Put the information out there Yeah put the information out there Like they won t have something to you know Work for Work for There you go Yeah because I think that everybody like wants a part of getting like Because you want that credit because you put all that effort into it So why not get a little bit of credit That makes it worth it How do you like that one Okay second question Should people own genes No Yes Well you kind of already own your own genes I mean you kind of they re your own Like any unless you clone yourself I mean nobody else has the exact same stuff You could Let me give you an example of an idea of somebody owning a gene The breast cancer gene that was discussed in the video which is actually a lack thereof of a particular part of a gene that is patented by a particular company Which means they found it they spent money to find it so they own the patent on it If you are a person you don t have to be female just to look for this but if you are a person who would like to go look for that gene you have to pay a patent fee to that company because they found it That s what it means to own a gene I think owning a gene is just having a company that has a lot of money that can be like Oh I m going to put a patent on that so boo ya can t take it Yeah I don t think that s right I mean if someone they should like put it open to the public because I mean if it s a gene like say breast cancer they should t just keep that private and make they pay for it Yeah So it s sort of like owning a part of a human If you own a gene by a corporation it s like owning a part of the person who has that gene or doesn t have that gene So It s sort of a moral issue Would you want to be owned by a company just that little tiny part of your DNA I wouldn t Excellent point You would Good job Jenna I wouldn t Oh okay You practically just went against everything we just said Anybody else have any input I agree with Jen Okay third question Would you want to know if you carried a gene for cancer Yeah No I would not Well it depends on what age I m at Because like then you have that whole impending like doom your whole entire life like Oh I m eventually going to get cancer might as well just die That s why I die But if you do know then you have the chance to actually deal with it You re going to have to deal with it anyway Yeah but if you knew you would have all that time to realize and to put things in order in your life You would know you would live life to the fullest I would I would live life to the fullest if I knew that I actually had this cancer I would know and I would do the best I could to live my life without settling Yeah so the shadow of you that eventually And that would just push me forward considering Drive yourself Whatever I do Yeah And maybe just maybe if I knew I would work to try to cure it myself So then I would be helping other people as well I would want to know Remember that there are no right or wrong answers to these questions Please feel free to share I think my what s it called my opinion I d want to know so that if you didn t know and you have kids you could be passing it on to them and wouldn t that hurt you to see that to have your kids have cancer Like I would think that And then if like I did I would want to know I would like Jen said live life to my fullest and Because some things like if I was per se white I would go tanning wouldn t that hurt your cancer Because like radiat Well that s what causes it you know what I mean I d just do things differently if I had it Remember what they said in the video it s often a maybe It s not a you will have this it s a maybe There are things that they can check for that they can say definitely you will or will not get like Huntington s Disease which is a very devastating disease Remember how they talked about Tay Sachs which kills very early Huntington s is somewhat similar but it kills later in life And starts to show signs mid 30 s and usually death is somewhere in the 40 s or 50 s so that s significantly earlier since life expectancy is in the 70 s in this country So Would you want to know yes or no if you had something like Huntington s which is definitely a yes or no but what about in a situation that s a maybe I don t want to know if it s a maybe because then you live with that fear that you might get it or you might not I would still want to know Yeah because what if your body starts shutting down like one night and you just start twitching in your sleep Wouldn t you want to know that s from cancer rather than your brain s messed up and drugs or something I don t know Yeah I think I d want to know I mean like instead of just not knowing what s causing all this stuff happening in your body Some think it s because I m a very curious person I d want to know what s going on I would want to know Because like Jenna said like one night you re just having a seizure or something you could take like medicine like that they prescribe to you because they know what you have rather than just like trying to deal with it and like that you could die because you never even knew what was happening So I d like want to have that back up plan with me So just to clarify we re talking about an offense end rather than a defense team So rather than waiting until you have it and reacting taking preventative measures ahead of time Like an inhaler for asthma Some people have to take their inhaler every single day twice a day morning and the afternoon but there s other people who don t have it as severe or a higher risk not as high as a risk who only take it when they re having an asthma attack So what you re saying is having like the pill every day constantly I would still want to take that chance So you would you want to take the pill Yeah If you know you have cancer early enough can t you get rid of it Can t they get rid of it If it s like Yes the earlier you know the better chance you have Yeah that s why I would want to know I don t think it would matter that much because even if you do have cancer that doesn t mean you re going to die from it Like you could get hit by a car today and nobody could tell you that nobody could predict that So I don t think I wouldn t want to know like if I was going to if I have cancer or anything I don t know I don t think it s You don t know that that cancer s going to Yeah and then I m just going to be in fear all my life like thinking like Oh I m going to die from that When that s not necessarily Like the you know exact thing that you re going to die from Like it s not a guarantee so Very good Yeah it s because of that Great job It s because of that maybe that maybe like you might be like how that guy on the video said you have a 99 of getting a heart disorder you might be that one percent that doesn t get it And you spend your whole life preparing spending all this money on preventative measures and getting all these pills setting up stuff and then you go through your whole entire life and you don t even get it That s true That he does have a point But then wouldn t you want to take those precautions because You d be happy that you did but then you spent all that extra stuff But what if that extra stuff is what made you not get it No I mean you don t like you don t get all the stuff just in case and you don t take it s like you don t even take the medicine It s only for like when you have like Travis said if you have a seizure you can take that it stops it Well that s kind of just like getting hit by a car Exactly Preventative measures is like looking to see if there s cars and if you don t look I mean you could get run over you could not But then you also like what if you lived in fear of getting that taking all these precautions is kind of wasting your life trying to prepare for something that may or may not happen That s why people should at the right age when you have the right maturity decide whether you want to know or not and not have it mapped out when you re born whether you re going to die or not Or by what In the movie how they just like took that thing Right That would be freaky as a woman Like you just went all throughout nine months of that and now you get to find out that your child s going to die in it s kind of freaky That actually brings us to our next question Okay What genes would you want to know your children had Why and how would that change you as a parent I wouldn t want to know at all I mean that s part of giving like human birth the surprise I guess It s a gamble You can t always like create the perfect human being Well if you could find out what genes they were going to have could you fix them Like how that person got rid of the forehead thing Right now no But that is a direction we re heading in You can right now completely sequence your child s genome if you have the money and get an approximation of what they will look like and what effects that That s messed up I don t care what my child would look like I don t really care But I just don t like you could prevent it from having these like life threatening diseases like cancer or Huntington s or like Parkinson s Disease Alzheimer s But then again that s a way of like too like I would want to know life threatening diseases but not because like you can cure like seizures You can like can t you Like my friend s been cured of that She had them and then now she doesn t anymore because she took medicine and stuff now she doesn t have it But there s people that have been taking those medicines and then still have it now which doesn t make sense Is that cured or treated Treated Yeah Cured means that you no longer have the disease Treated means that it s managed with medication or It s treated then Wait it s cured Yeah it is cured But anyways How would that change you as a parent knowing that You would know what to do if you have it Stay with your child at all times I don t want my kid dying Your kid s going to be in like a stroller until age 13 See it wouldn t change me as a parent It just wouldn t change me I think it d make someone stronger Because going through all of that hard times like with your child and it being sick and stuff wouldn t that make you stronger than having a normal healthy child And make you closer to them But you would still love your child the same way You would still try to have the best memories with your child either way If you knew that this that your child was going to die or not You would still do the same thing Except maybe change their diet or Take more precautions Yeah more precautions Pad their room They re going to be falling over and hurting themselves or something But you wouldn t change your experiences with your child I would Well I wouldn t Would you Bernard What Change your experience with your child Yeah Just don t go to Disneyland it s not worth it It s not worth it he won t even remember it Nope Oh the fifth question What does any of this have to do with you Like as in personally or as in That s a good question I m confused Say that again As in personally Yeah both ways as in persoanlly and as in a generation Give yourself super powers Hey stay on task Good job Stella Thanks I guess you re just kind of getting us ready for the future you know Like thinking like about your children like in the future like what if like what if you really wanted to know and then like what would you actually do about it if you ve never thought about this before Is this technology possible Yeah Not quite yet So who s going to have to make those decisions Us Our generation This generation and next generation The genes are us And if you want to know everything about yourself if you want to know then you have to go through the genes But if you don t want to know then you don t have to Yeah And so those people that think it s like That want to know should Wait what Never mind Should be able to Yeah should be able to And then the people that don t want to know shouldn t harp on them they should just keep their opinions to themselves And see it from their eyes too and just have an open eye to it not being so negative So what happens if say half of society would like to have their genomes sequenced or their children s genome sequenced and the other half does not want to or doesn t have the means to because it s probably going to cost money Right What might that how might that impact society as a whole Not just the individual As in this country individual s rights are paramount right Hmm So it ll be messed up like it is already How 
 Guys ready Yes Okay number one start give your idea Read the word give your idea of the definition Okay what s your word Soldier okay and okay you re gonna give your idea What s your idea of soldier

get to write an example of a patriot Try to write in a complete sentence I bet you can You just draw pictures 
Okay But before you check over what you need to make sure you do All of it Get it completed right Okay awesome So your goal would be to Get homework completed Wonderful Okay Excellent Okay Now I brought some extra markers and stuff here because I know you re a visual learner that you do a good job remembering things that you figured out on your learning styles test So this is for you to do You can choose any colors to make it look however you want Okay So you ve got your goal and then we need to figure out why is that goal important So your goal is to Get all homework done Excellent And why is that important Because when you re in fourth grade you don t get all your homework done and you on fence and when you get on the fence I ve been there a couple of times and is not very fun and for the good achievement you get to go to Hot Wheels hmm So if you don t do your homework You re on a boring fence Okay You have to stand by the fence at recess And if you do do your homework you go to Hotshots Homework Hotshots And that is What do you have to do to qualify for Homework Hotshots Do all your homework for all the Oh Wow So All your homework throughout the nine weeks and then you get to go get to be a Homework Hotshot which means you go to Hot Wheels and enjoy the day skating Excellent Okay So you just brought up a good point umm So this goal is important because not only do you not want to stand by the fence and you want to be a Homework Hero What s going to happen if you do your homework You go to Hot Wheels You go to Hot Wheels and what do you think What effect is that going to have on your report card here If you re doing all your homework what s going to happen to those grades You get all the grades go up like the 100 200 That s right Very good All right So go ahead write that down Why you think homework is important Excellent So this goal is important because you can always get good grades and homework is a way that teachers help the students reinforce the things that they are learning in class So that s an excellent way to get good grades Okay So we know our goal and we know why it s important So let s think about what kind of rewards we re going to get for reaching that goal You get achievement awards You go in a limo with the principal And you go out to eat and Hot Wheels too right So those are some long term goals over the next nine weeks You get to complete your homework the next nine weeks You get to go to Hot Wheels and might even be on the principal s honor roll to take the limo ride Pretty cool huh Okay So that s here We ve got Don t forget one thing that you get to drink soda while you re going You do I didn t know that I ve never been in there I ve never been in the limo but I heard Oh my goodness Well that certainly is a nice incentive something to motivate huh Good So that s kind of a long term motivation We ve got to work hard all these nine weeks to accomplish that right Okay So we ve got here When I meet my goal for the quarter Quarter is another way of saying the nine week time period you will what What do you get to do if you do all your homework over the nine weeks I will go in a limo Well that s for principal s honor roll which is definitely an option What s specific for homework umm When I meet my goal for the quarter I will go to Hot Wheels Go to Hot Wheels Awesome Excellent So the nine weeks sometimes it can feel like long way away can t it Okay Because nine weeks is not easy They are not easy to do your homework Because it s a long time before you go to Hot Wheels and we only have eighteen weeks in school So it s easier sometimes to stay motivated and work towards a goal if you have some incentives that come on more of a short term basis Meaning that instead of waiting all nine weeks to go to Hot Wheels which you will get to do if you meet your goal Let s think of something that we can do maybe once a week That would be a good incentive for you Study Okay Well studying is part of your homework plan Let s say that you study and you turn all your you do all your homework and at the end of the week when I check in with you when I check in with Miss Butler and I check in with your granny and I d say So how did Annamarie do Did she get all her homework done mm hmm And they say Yes she did What do you think might be something that you re willing to work towards here at school that would be a reward once a week I will come to you and I will help you You d like to help me All right So could we agree that let s say I check in on Fridays with your teacher and your granny and you to find out did she do her homework What are they going to tell me Yes Yes And then on Fridays you get to come and help me mm hmm That d be wonderful Now I teach a first grade class every day at 12 10 I know you do a really good job helping out at home with your niece But she I do not get to see her Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday But on Friday I do Because my mom My mom watches her And sometimes when my sister and I and the baby s not here we actually look at photos of her because we really miss her and we talk to her on phone Awesome She s lucky to have an aunty like you Awesome Well I know because you do such a good job caring for her that you d be an excellent helper for me and my first graders Will that be a good goal for you Okay So our next section here Can you read this When I meet my goal for the week I will get to go to go to Hot Wheels I think Well Hot Wheels is for the whole nine weeks But each week Remember our What we re working towards on Friday that you get to come Help you Right So you get to come help Miss Charles on Fridays Okay You have very nice handwriting Thank you Okay So do you Thanks Okay So this goal is something that you re in charge of right You re in control of achieving this goal But you re not in it alone Because there s of a lot of people who want to see you reach that goal and to see you doing an awesome job at school So who are some of the people the adults in your life who are on your team who can be helpers for you as you reach this goal My grandma my aunty my uncle my mom and my sister Wonderful You have a lot of people So these are people at home that can help you reach your goal all right So let s go ahead and put those down for supporters at home Awesome All right So you ve got a lot of people supporting you at home I ve got five And how about here at school Who s on your team Miss Butler and Miss Charles You ve got it girl I can t wait to support you on this goal Okay So the people who can help me at school is Miss Charles Is it okay if I put in Miss Ficker my assistance teacher because she helps too Definitely That s a great person to add And so are you Thank you Okay I just realized something What s that All these teachers name has a R in it Miss Charles Miss Butler Miss Ficker It s a good attention to detail you have there Okay So we know that our goal is to get all my homework completed Okay And it s important because you can always get good grades Excellent Now on the short term if you re doing a great job getting your homework done every week Each week you will get to come help come help Miss Charles on Friday Excellent And I will know that you re doing a great job because you can ask Miss Butler my grandma and me That s right Okay And over the whole nine weeks when you do a good job getting all that homework done what s your reward I get to go to Hot Wheels Awesome And then although you re the one in charge of this goal there s a lot of people on your team Who are those people on your team from home My Mama my granny my sister my Uncle TJ and my aunty People on you re side All right And then when you re here at school who s on your team Miss Charles Miss Butler Miss Ficker Awesome All right So what do you think How s the school going to go It s going to be great because I will follow all of these Good and I m here to help okay All right Well I think the first step towards achieving this goal is to make sure that we manage our time really well And I know we talked a little bit before about kind of your month We looked at the month of February and figured out what big things you have coming up What portions of the day you spend here at school or at Church and what you do how you help out taking care of your niece So that s the month of February So what we re going to do today is really focus on this week and make a plan So what I ve done here is based on the information you told me before we ve got this week starting with today Monday February 7th and you will notice I ve the time of day all the way from 6 in the morning throughout the day till Yeah 10 at night So I have these spaces blocked off So what are you usually doing Monday Wednesday Friday from 7 to 4 Come to school You re at school right So this whole area Is school Is school That s right You re here at school Will you write school Sure Sometimes it s easy for me if I just draw a line to show that Like that Okay School Okay So knowing that you re in school from 7 to about 4 O clock and we also need to think about some other regular things that you do during the week So you told me before that 
 I think that Igneous and Metamorphic they re the least there are two books that don t use em cause they re Well my Igneous Yeah it Igneous and Metamorphic cool off and react And only a few particles came off but I was Yeah it s just awkward because mine was boosting most of yours Well yeah When I did my alien on my first try it was 42 grade Then now when I m measuring it again it was 22 grade It Mine never changed all it did was lost a little bit of it s rice crispies That was mine But I feel like Igneous rock like 20 Well yeah Cause the weathering does a lot of things to the rock s outside And Mine was the same as Igneous and metamorphic And so if I d shake it like through weathering a bunch of rock would fall off I haven t done anything yet It was three I can t wait to Oh I have to say the one with the marshmallows cause it s Well for my Sedimentary it was harder Yeah mine too What Cause when I did mine only one piece of my Sedimentary broke apart and The Sedimentary My Igneous rock It has like almost It might be a little inaccurate since these are not real Sedimentary rocks You have to keep that in mind Well yeah So but what if they were real Sedimentary Would we be able to tell what they are Yeah Obviously Do you know any Sedimentary rocks that looks like a granola bar Yes I saw them in my yard They re called a granola ball No That was probably granite which is an Igneous rock For Jeanie do we write just how many lasts Cause mine must ve had Okay so when I when I did the blendering of my Sedimentary I lost only three grams off of my Sedimentary rock So I m not sure what would happen if I add these two Because of the heat out of the cause if you were to put heat to a rock like our little blue Metamorphic rocks what would happen was the heat would melt it and it would give pressure to stick down to the tinfoil Yeah that s how that happens because this is probably the farthest off we have from a little while Yeah Like last we and like have you ever heard of a rock that s called Metamorphic rock Yeah It can be greasy Let s talk about why we use the models Obviously you re never gonna be so lucky as come across a rock that s like the taffy Why did we use the Laffy Taffy for our model Because the heat and the pressure the heat and the pressure would like stick together but like a Sedimentary rock We use our fingers to add that heat pressure We had to simulate it somehow we couldn t do the actual Earth process in the classroom Do you agree with that Mm hmm Okay so you understand why you understand why we use that material for our model Okay Right it probably melts And why did we use the microwave for the Igneous rock Because What were we trying to simulate there From Magma is a really hot substance and this is what Igneous rocks can form from Could we actually manipulate and touch magma in the classroom No No Could we work a marshmallow Yep So we understand the connection there We re trying to use materials that we can bring into the classroom but that will still simulate lava magma the processes Okay So pressure I think it has less effect of all the It had a lesser effect going through the processes of Of both Weathering And erosion And erosion okay Now you guys can think about this if you didn t like the samples and examples up here that I used you could always do it different Food material To make up your own experiment later Okay Let s talk for a moment Why should we measure again after our rock samples have been through weathering and erosion Why are we measuring again Look at your rock samples do they look the same as what we measured in here No No What happened You have to measure the difference The difference and why would there be a difference What could we do to our rock samples Changed dramatically when you did the weathering on them Let s use the same what did you use when you pre measured I would keep it the same Why would I keep it the same Because it s Can we compare centimeters to inches Yes You can Think about that because later when you have to come back and do the difference how are you gonna do the difference with some centimeters and some inches How can you compare those two measurements You re telling me you wanna go centimeters here but inches down here I would keep it the same They would make it mathematically You working on your difference Your difference in mass This your pre mass Explain to me how you got to that Where are the books They might add on to another sedimentary rock cause it s like never ending For some reason my Sedimentary and my Igneous rock They both lost a half inch in length Yeah mine too In my igneous rock grams it lost 20 grams and my sedimentary lost 10 grams Mine lost no grams Mine gained grams Your gained grams Yeah I had 17 grams I had 17 grams and then it came back to 21 And this one went up one Because when this one went up three Maybe you should check that over Cause it weathers and erodes away Well I m guessing that most of the bits and pieces of the other people s stuff went into mine and made it bigger Cause it can do that it can See Right there All around the Oh I see it See Other bits and pieces of other people s went into mine and made mine bigger With mine a bunch of bits and pieces And mine started to melt Because your observations say it crumbles apart it s breaking apart and moving Okay what about these gaps here These gaps Yeah how you gonna do that For some reason my Igneous rock Into the sample It made it bigger Made it heavier Did it have more mass after the Your protective sleeve s coming off That s a good possibility that might throw your measurements off Did it happen to anything else Any other sample Now you re working on a difference in You gotta find the difference in length and width and you re gonna find the difference in mass That s interesting you could explain that away right there Mm hmm isn t that the one Igneous the one you were saying got the strange results You can talk to me then Well that s probably how they make the canyons bigger Maybe because some of the rocks after rain and the sandstorms they could just pound together and make a big old rock So Okay so if it erodes off another rock I m listening are you talking about real life rocks when they really erode away Mmhmm And it starts to rain cause a lot of times it s like wind and rain A lot of times it takes the sand away from the rain with the rain and here s another rock which makes a bigger You re thinking sometimes with real life rocks you could have actual sediment mixing in with igneous rocks Right do you remember how we talked about how igneous can morph back into sedimentary Those bits and pieces are melding with igneous rock when you have that blend where igneous is morphing into sedimentary rock okay So that would also cause reason for your measurements I like where you re going with that Try to make that connection You know Unis was giving me a hard time earlier about how metamorphic rock s not made of Laffy Taffy So how s this go back to rocks in real life Think about that Some of our videos that we were watching About what salts quartz in these two processes You have to let the water go down Cause the heat inside of it could ve frozen Cause they heat over there we had it kinda Whoa what s the answer 19 grams 19 Igneous Igneous How could you make that Explain it to your little sister She s not gonna be able to understand that she wasn t here What could you put on your rock cycle diagram Okay So you re gonna have This is 17 17 for what Igneous What about sedimentary Tell me how Sean needs help Um he needs help with Okay where he s trying to find the mass of the sedimentary rock What do ya mean No I was saying that it may have gotten darker Darker because of the heat Yeah A lot of rocks do that Yeah But it could be jus the pink Yeah it could be I could write down that it could be pink Yeah what happened to my metamorphic rock is I can Yeah that s because of this thing in between our finger and Mine it didn t get darker than mine though So you could add that to what you put in So how would that affect our measurements How did it affect your width Igneous and sedimentary rock could Now talk to me though if it s in You wanna know why those are there Because a lot of rocks don t have protection that doesn t help them And a lot of kids drop theirs inside their bag which mixed with the Sedimentary It could And sooner or later if it just stays in there and rolls around guess what it would do It would also become a sedimentary It s just like the rocks it s just like the rocks in life It s more similar to real life Yeah The eroded bits would stick to other rocks So I just added like bits We have bits and pieces See if I was to shove this in my bag and just roll it around in all of this this would also become this because this isn t on the mat This would begin to stick And when you ball it together it makes it appear coloring to it that show that it s inside there I think that the igneous and the metamorphic rock After each sample ones that were weathering and erosion So you re gonna compare your two measurements pre measurement post measurement to see if there s a difference for each rock Hmm Hmm Do we have to subtract Do we What s your key word that could tell you what to do Difference Go show me I know you re thinking You just told me what key word tells you what to do Where were we Finding the mass After we ve done the weathering and erosion Okay are you gonna get started Yes Yes Jack are you finished with that scale Can we use manners please Can we use manners Can you say please pass the balance Talk to me guys just for a moment about the differences in those in your We ve got Ashley s igneous we talked about that I figured out for the metamorphic that changes did actually happen because they put the sedimentary came on to the metamorphic So we can see again how just and it probably had a lot to do with our service and our bag that s how those pieces of sediment got attached to our metamorphic rock And I think it became darker because the heat because of the pink And because of the pink Yeah Okay think about in real life sedimentary rock when those levels when those layers are smashed together Okay don t some of those layers change the color with all that heat and pressure Okay that was your metamorphic Yes Brooke And also you get the igneous in there it sticks to it and you can just put it inside there cover the layers off and it actually gets inside the metamorphic So you all noticed how your rock samples are very true to real actual rocks and how they could combine with one another and result in a completely different rock Okay So on your next page where you get to make your rock cycle diagram maybe you could use those observations and those understandings when explaining your outcome Not the candy rock cycle the real one It says that you could use a diagram okay Using your textbook Level Readers Science Journal or the rock cycle experiment that we just completed Anything you want to be able to explain the rock cycle Okay My igneous has gone down just a bit 
 Who s gonna do the skyscraper So we got to put size color and shape Size color and shape Ok I m gonna do a skyscraper Beau is that for the past or the present That s for the present Skyscraper Present the present The present ok And the pyramid is for the past Yeah And you ll do a pyramid for the past I was gonna do a log cabin That s what I was gonna do But we have to use different things because we don t got no logs Well actually they still make log cabins now We can use brown for the logs Jonathon says they still make log cabins now They do Yeah they do We don t really make pyramids any more do we No Yeah but they could be hidden in Egypt Yeah but there is four lines What we gonna do with the other two What I want you to do is list three details Color size and shape So what shape will your skyscraper probably be A rectangle A rectangular prism A rectangular prism That s what Dillon said Rectangle Rectangular Prism Okay Then you can talk about your pyramids Ask them they re your team A square pyramid Triangle Oh he said a square pyramid Yeah let s do it A triangle You think it should be a triangular pyramid Yeah I m with Dillon Well talk about it Which one do you want to do I thought square pyramid was more like a real pyramid You know because it has four sides It does have four A pyramid only has four sides Well a triangle has four too It does One two three four That s a square honey because it has four Well if it has three sides how many sides does it have Three Three So you have to decide So we could take a square and make it like a Dillon agrees a square pyramid too I love having y all together Let s do square pyramid and rectangular prism Good deciding Alright What are you guys discussing right now We re discussing what all we wanna do I like that Okay We re not sure what play we re doing You re not sure what play you wanna do Because everybody keeps picking everything So how are we gonna figure it out But I agree with Randy So what do you guys agree on I agree with my plans He wants like an old time car and I don t agree with that But we don t understand how you do an old time car How do you do a play or skit about an old car That s what you need to tell them The only time Okay Aaron said something about the classroom and that I was going to be the teacher Or something like that I wanna be assistant teacher Randy likes that And this is two people from the past and two people from the present Hear what Jacob said Jacob wants to be assistant teacher You re the teacher assistant teacher So when will that be in the past or the present Present Haley could be a teacher from the present and then me and Randy can be from the past and then they can be from the present too And then we ll come to where they are then they ll have to show us what changed Did y all hear Aaron s idea You can say that to them I like Aaron s idea Listen to what Aaron just said guys He has an idea that you may want to do Ian and Jacob and Haley are from the present And me and Randy are from the past and we come And they show us all the stuff that has changed I agree with Aaron I agree with Aaron I agree with Aaron Or we could do like you two are teachers and like me and Aaron and Ian are like students And then them two teach us Oh that s an idea You could do But then how do we do the past Well but you could do the past and then how could you do a skit about the past and a skit about the present Yeah They would be the same except one is the past and one is the present To where like no one had desks and then in the present we have desks Oh What do you think Ian I wanted to do people from the past and future they all meet together and do things from the past and the future Well are we doing the future or the present Present Well then people from present and past and they do things from the past and the present Okay Well decide It sounds like you got some really good ideas Why can t we just do one if they are doing stuff from the past and the present And you choose your own people who live in the present Well Ian if your working in a group should everybody do their own thing or should we work and kind of come up with the same idea Yeah you choose your own people but you do it in the present Sounds like y all have to just keep on You may just have to make a decision Ok You may just have to make a decision Sounds like you are doing great guys How do you spell transfer trucks Huh How do you spell transfer trucks Transfer trucks Let s sound it let s tap it What letters T Trrr A N C E R or something Trr like tree T R You got it Shannon Did you hear Shannon Let s tap it Ta jarius Trr Aaa A What letter is that Nnnn N Ssss C K S Ssss Transssss S I got S F F How do you make er at the end of a word E R You got it There you go and you know trucks So what are y all doing with transfer trucks I don t know He s the one who wanted to write it Why was this on Noah s desk Case has some names Yeah Ok but what But why did y all um You re describing what each persons job will be And I have that Noah and Ta jarius and Madison are gonna do what The waves What kind of waves What are y all showing from the past and the present I wanna do waves in the present Do waves change from the past to the present Do you mean like ocean waves Have those changed over time I m doing transfer trucks What s it suppose to be A I m doing transfer trucks How have those changed over time Horses carried them with like umbrella s over them Very cool And we saw that kind of wagon on the smart board earlier And you said that was like a truck You could pull that up back up there I could pull it back up Do you wanna see that again Cash do you wanna do the illustrations for the trucks over time Shannon what are you doing What are your illustrations gonna be showing change over time She might do cars or something Do you wanna do cars You don t have to do cars You don t want to Lots of things have changed over time You can actually buy food and not hunt it How do you spell Shannon That s one of the things you could draw the change from the maybe you ll do washing machines Yeah Yeah that works Yeah Cars change Do you wanna do transfer trucks No You re already doing them Guys Do you wanna do washing machines Madison Draw a washing machine next to that You wanna do washing machines Can you hold that up so they can see it because Shannon can t see it Where did ya wash your clothes at Turn it over like this and you d rub them against here Different isn t it Yeah When I was little my great great great great great great great grandma grandfather he had a washing board he took a picture of and then when I was big I was allowed to see it Very cool There was a picture Alright It sounds like you ve got some work to do guys I love the idea of showing the illustrations of the trucks over time and the cars over time I think we need to think about waves though because waves are a natural thing People don t really build and change those do we No so we need to think about something that has changed over time And don t forget our books Buildings Buildings Buildings have definitely changed over time Alright guys Keep it up you are doing great Alright let s see what you guys are up to Okay what s going on over here Well we re thinking about About Cassa coloring Ann coloring and me coloring and drawing and her drawing I love drawing You love drawing That s what I love I love typing at home I love all of it Very cool Alright so what kind of things are you gonna show how are you gonna show past to present with your clothing We re gonna show the style the color Okay can you tell me what you re gonna draw We re gonna draw dresses Oh dresses And shoes Like dresses and the shoes that they would wear I can get my old dress My mom s old dress she s got I have it and I can design it You can Uh huh So are you all four going to show dresses from the past and present Yes Or are some of you gonna do past and some of you do present We re gonna do it all together I love that Them two are coloring I m coloring and me and her are drawing Very nice You re drawing Yes we re drawing I m coloring Very very nice Well it looks like you guys are ready for your next page Let me ask you this how has clothing changed over time The color has definitely changed The colors have changed And the shoes Ladies used to wear long dresses and now they wear not that long of dresses Oh so they used to wear really long dresses and now They have short dresses that come up to here Yeah and shoes they wear lace up boots Laced up boots I think my mama has them I won t be able to wear them but I might be able to bring them Oh that d be cool if you bring those It sounds like you have great ideas And they wore hats back then cause I m thinking about my mom s dress I mean I can design it I am very very pleased with how much you ve accomplished together in your group let me get you the next sheet Okay We all have our things done and we re going to get it And we all have each others phone numbers Here s the next sheet Let s look for a second Who will design the piece from the past and Who will design the piece from the present Now that doesn t mean it has to be separate Right you can take it home Well me and her Well it sounded like we re all okay Yeah we re all basically doing it Okay Why is this change important to people today and How could this continue to change in the future Hmmmm There s some questions to think about So have you worked on this some more You ve decided to what you re gonna do Skyscrapers and pyramids They re doing the pyramids me and him is doing the skyscrapers Them two are doing the pyramids we re doing the skyscrapers That was nice Good going coming up with that Good job We re doing a square pyramid You re doing a square pyramid Yeah That s easy all you gotta do is start out as a square and draw triangles at the top So when I was with you before you said this is hard we don t know what we re gonna do and all had different ideas and as it turns out this is kind of easy What made it easier Working as a team Working as a team Dillon would you mind sitting over here sweetie so that everybody can hear and see what you re doing Yeah Kinda off by himself over there huh sweetheart Alright the last thing you need to fill out on your papers is How has this changed over time Buildings how have buildings changed over time Pyramids pyramids been tooken down Did we ever build buildings out of gold No I got something Pyramids have been tooken down to make more space in Eygpt like more land Okay What about buildings in general How is this building different from McWilliams It s bigger It s bigger and has more space Which one is bigger McWilliams And it s newer It s newer so how do you It s newer or it s smaller He says it s newer 
 That one hurts It says volume by use the formula to find the volume Okay so I got 53 when I added up the numbers Yeah I did too I took it and divided by three 17 6666 Just do 17 6 No 17 point three sixes So we ll just Just no Hayden we have to find 17 666 cause all six of them put 17 6 I know but we are now let s just round it up one to 18 Okay Yeah So with average it s 18 Okay So now we have to do based on our average how close were you to your guess so how close were we to our guesses so like I was close by seven I was close by nine We have 18 here how far was nine and 18 I don t know Nine Nine plus nine is 18 right Oh yeah So write nine right here I was by five Okay All right based on our average how many drops would it take to make one liter 18 000 What Oh yeah You got us correct a few times Multiply it by If we had it to drops times 1000 cause that s how many milliliters are in a liter we get 10 000 Okay so now we do water disposal Follow the directions to find the volume of three marbles using water fluid So first we have to add milliliters of water to 100 milliliter So we have to add 20 milliliters of water into this So Giselle you wanna do that No Okay That yeah Pour it so this gets to 20 okay I ll pour it then Oops whoa okay Try not to put too much I ll pour it out Let s try again it with a dropper No you re supposed to do it with a beaker I know but if we re really really close and we can t do it with a beaker then we re gonna have to do it with a dropper So we just do this Okay we re at 20 I think that s 20 We re at 19 I got it Okay Just Don t drop it too fast cause I okay Okay So now we have to add the three marbles so We ll bring em on this side Yeah you have one Hayden has one and I have one No let Alina have one You do Alina poured the water So it s you Amy and Hayden Okay Okay so we have to like tilt it to roll down the cylinder I think I can do it Yeah I know but it s the easiest way No not that much you don t wanna don t wanna pour some out Sayonara sucker Okay the water level now is 26 exactly All right so it went from 20 to 26 So the difference in volume is six and the volume of the three marbles is six right What do you think Alina Yeah How do you think I got six I don t know Well subtracted 20 from 26 Because it s 20 before the marbles and 26 after so the marbles must be Okay Kay How we doin over here Pretty good All right I m gonna ask you a couple of questions about volume What have you learned about volume so far Whenever you Alina look at the board that I made for you okay Whenever you drop drops of water into the graduated cylinder what s happening to the volume What happened What happened to the volume of the water It was at 20 and then 26 It got higher It went higher It went higher okay so we can say then that volume does what What did it do Rise It rose okay Volume rises okay so the volume rose good and what did you find for the volume of the three marbles using water displacement Did you get that far yet Yep Okay We got six because the water was at 20 before and then after we put the marbles in it was at 26 so it s six cause you have to subtract the 26 minus 20 Good okay If you can switch places with me I wanna be able to hear Alina Okay All right so I m gonna ask you another question When you were doing if you got six if the volume of those three marbles is six milliliters according to what you have we need to change that to a solid measurement okay This is the solid measurement cubes that we use to measure solids Marbles are solids So Alina can you can anyone tell me how we transfer that six milliliters to cubes To centimeter cubes Each one of those is a gram and if Each one of these is a gram that s correct And if one milliliter is equal to one centimeter cubed and all and in that case it must also be equal to one gram so that s why for this I wrote that the difference in volume was six grams and the volume of three marbles is six grams I could also figure out that these are our three marbles and we have six grams then each one of them is 15 grams Okay but grams is that a unit of volume or is that a unit of mass Mass Mass Good Alina it s a unit of mass So what Hayden said is correct One centimeter one milliliter is equal to one gram one milliliter of water is equal to one gram but what do we know about the cubic centimeters We need to put the units in this term So if you got six milliliters for the volume of the three marbles then how can we change it to centimeters cubed How many milliliters is this is one centimeter cubed Do you remember one It s a one to one ratio like Eli told us in home room So six milliliters must also be equal to six centimeters cubed So and this is the unit of volume but you re also right the mass must be it will also be equal to one gram but we re talking about volume not mass So it s the weight it s the volume Yeah It has to do with three times three times four But you have to explain why Because So how do we know this But why do we do that You don t know the answer right now Because it said that Three cubic centimeters And a height of three cubic centimeters I don t know if that s really a three with a height of four Yeah with a height of four So we have to do our work Cause we built the work right there And like Height from a And the height Hold on So So Summer three times three and then Yeah times four I m up to three times three That s nine and then times four gives you three times When I did this it was four times three I know that Is So three times 16 No Three times three is nine times four is Okay it s three times four Okay it s nine times four Why would that be 60 36 Yeah so we did three times three we calculated nine times three So that gives you nine and then because there s a height of three you multiply by four which gives you 36 because it s a basic math problem And it gives you 36 Okay So explain why you know that And then And then we go on to number two But wait for her to finish I am I m just gonna be a little Change the length width and height of the rectangular prism without changing its volume Try and it and explain Of course not because we re gonna feel like I think is something s wrong Well we can Well I guess if No we can t cause you can take that one off the building height No we could tip this over this way and solve for Why would you do that What We re done with problem one So now So I guess we could Yeah But no but in we d still have we would still have the same volume All right so the next problem is can you change Summer are you still I m fine I know but we already read it though She can read she needs to read it Ryan So what say we couldn t because the numbers we ll have to do the oh wait no No we could No because like we won t We re doing the height and we turn it sideways Yes we would It s true Okay So So How are you guys doing For number two we wanted to we had it like this and we wanted to turn it sideways cause that would change the height around Okay so let s talk about number two that s the one you re on I m completely knocked it over All right so the question is on number two can you change the length width Can you change the length width and height of the rectangular prism without changing its volume Try it and explain Okay so first of all the first rectangular prism you built so this rectangular prism okay was one centimeter I mean three centimeters long We did three times three it was nine because it had a line So three times three is nine then times four times height of four I don t know Okay so this is the rectangular prism you built for number one correct Okay and then you just multiply its length times its width times its height and what did you get Summer I got 36 36 And I m thinking that more than one thing can equal 36 like if we had Okay so how many cubes did you use to get this Two for 36 This 36 How many cubes were there in all In all that was 36 It was 36 you had to count out the cubes right So can you use the same But have like a different height But have a different length width and height Well yeah the answer would be yes because more there are multiple pieces you could do six like well you do two three and six Okay Two times three equals six six times six equals 36 Two times three times six would equal 36 Right as long as the three would be height So six could be this Okay Summer what do you think They think you can change these numbers and it still be 36 cubes Could you still use 36 cubes build a rectangular prism and but get different numbers here You can why do you think so Because it has to change it from then like the 36 would still be the same 
 Anything else So what composter would you want I think we would want maybe like a three tray or four tray vermicomposter And I do now admit it would be helpful to get one that would be cheaper Maybe you guys have a different idea Maybe I was thinking that maybe we can make one because I printed off some directions how to make a vermicomposter So again that would save us a lot of money just to make it Like this might cost 20 to get all these supplies And I know some people have supplies at their houses that they could bring in to use for this And this might cost 20 when a store bought one off the internet may cost 100 Yes but the store bought one s are quality and a professional makes it So they know what they re doing I doesn t really matter I mean it has the same purpose it does the same thing I just matters on the worms The only thing that we really have to buy is the worms Dylan and Ben I got to admit I do agree with Claire Buying one would be a good quality and what do we know about I know it says what do we know about Now where are you guys in your conversation We re deciding to do wood metal or plastic But he said that the wood would rot and the metal could rust It could rust because of the moistness of the compost Okay It s not metal We re not talking about metal So we might do plastic On what If we make it Purchasing one No if we make our own But this one is award winning Seventy dollars All right and did you know what website you found that so you could share it as a class This is buying a vermicomposter that would cost 70 And what did you say about yours This is about like 20 because we need two of these eight to 10 gallon plastic storage boxes And we need two of them and it says the cost is about five dollars each And that would save us a lot so we could get Weebly pro tools and then maybe later on we could by the reusable bags So what are your thoughts on helping the whole community I think we should build this because it s better and we would have more money left over And how would you spend the other money left over I would spend it on like stuff that we need for composting like for tools Okay wait we have multiple conversations going here in this group So let s wait I would spend it on the tools Weebly Pro and if we have some money left over we could probably get more from the compost And then we could get that tea thing that gets the tea out And that way you could get more money And then we could get something else What s Weebly Pro It s like an extra you can search it up on Google Isn t it a website It s 26 compost and then you can have a many slides as you want videos And then we can sell our compost on the internet and that would help a lot So how is the Weebly Pro better than the Weebly that we already have Because you were the webmaster on the class website on the composting website And you want to what do you want us to do We can have buy the six month plan and then the guys for next year they figure it out And how would us buying the Weebly Pro help the community It would help us to sell it and to inform about compost Okay any other comments or thought We could it could maybe inform the people more because we could make a video of how to compost so they could make their own Okay inform who Be more specific The viewers of the website All of our guests Yeah There s a greater chance it s not gonna fail Guys we re not playing the what if game I not saying but we have a chance that the cups might break because they re cups and they have an easier chance It has a bigger chance of not failing We have to take risks We have to Plus you would have the pride of making your own If we make our own and we mess up then we re just wasting money What if what if what if what it I m not doing the what if Cause remember last time when we built a If you make it there is a greater chance you will fail Maybe instead of cups we use PVC pipes I mean they re that cheap and I mean they would hold longer than styrofoam cups Shhh too many people That s better quality I do agree with you Adam but I also do agree with Dylan and Ben on two different subjects Guys why don t we just make everything We can make the compost bin But if we make everything reusable bags Why don t we buy the vermicomposter and then we make the bags The reusable bags are more like for people to buy if they want to have an easy reusable bag And then the tools we might really need later on when we don t need the reusable bags We might need the tools or we said we might need to go buy this now and it might be too late already What s the major difference between the vermicomposter and the reusable bags Jessica what s the major difference between the two In vermicomposting it keeps reproducing there s three products While the reusable bags when you sell them once and that s all you get from that bag And with the vermicomposter it keeps going It s very unlikely almost impossible that all the worms are going to die in one night Plus why would you buy the bags if you can make them Cause my mom has a friend that makes her own bags out of store bags like Walmart and Target bags And she melts them down and puts them into a bag Why don t we buy the vermicomposter so it s a better quality and we make the bags They re easier It s very hard to find a perfect vermicomposter that s plastic and won t break Most of them are terracotta and they ll shatter if somebody knocks it over It s also wood and wood will start to absorb the smells of the compost and then it will start to smell bad How do you know we re going to do wood Compost things on the internet are using either terracotta or wood Terracotta shatters really easily Okay so we need to do more research on this I found a four tray bin that s plastic for 89 99 But still why would we pay 100 when we can pay For quality a mere 20 I know but the materials we use aren t made for composting Listen to Carly for a second What Carly Because if we do what Ben s mom s friend can do you could easily save more money like you do if you make the vermicomposter Do you think you could get your mom s friend to come in and teach us as a class on how to make our own like she already does I think we should buy the vermicomposter first like buy it or make it and then buy the reusable bags So just like Ben s mom s friend s bags But we should make them both because then we will still have some money left over to buy other things like tools Like a new aerator If we make the reusable bags we won t get to put our symbol on it which I think is part of the bag We re thinking about doing ovens Cause it s like one two three four five six If we made it we wouldn t have a guarantee that it would work because we could screw up the way we make it Or we could just mess it up in general But if we bought one it would be kind of guaranteed to work But sometimes we miss a part or a tool that we need to put it together How do you know that sometimes what experience do you have that sometimes all the parts aren t always there Because when we were making the other one and forgot one of the tools so we couldn t do one part of it And then it just all got all messed up It just threw us off So from your experience you know that sometimes when we order something we don t always get it This part is the leading thing right there it comes built All we have to do it put the plastic bars together and it will be kind of easy Cause it just like goes Yeah and you can work as a group to make it Because it s like those styrofoams where you pull it together And you can just see where it s put together the sticks Like the couplers on the sides So we have something to be proud of that we made Everybody said that we wanted a see through one so we could actually see the dirt And this one s not see through So if we made our own could we get a clear tote cause the worms don t like light So you can lift to look And the worms don t like light so when you look at it lift it up look at it and then put it back down That s a good idea No one else has thought about that Christian And how do you know that the worms don t like light Because we looked it up on the internet And then one time I was in my house and I saw a worm out in the street and it was kind of like rattling rattling in the sun So then my sister kicked it in back in the grass So then it was much happier and I re research that Okay but do we have to do vermicompost No we don t have to do it at all It s going to be our class We need to vote on what s going to be the best for the community What about reusable bags I think the reusable bags are And why How is the reusable bags different than what we re already doing If we sell the if the people next year sell them at the Holiday Boutique then if we sell compost then it would be the same customers And if we give the customer something different more people will come because they ll yeah and they need bags They could buy bags to put their stuff in that they buy And for backpacks and stuff for when they go grocery shopping they need something to put them in instead of just wasting all those plastic bag They could use the reusable bag I have an idea I think we should stick with our old compost in our tumbler And then we should get the bags And we should have the compost and the bags of compost tea And then they could buy the bags and they could buy the compost and they could have the compost tea in the bag and they could carry it so it s not that hard So we could use our bags as the packaging for the compost Yeah that s what I was thinking It s gonna cost extra And then make it just a bit more expensive cause then you get to keep the reusable bag and the compost You know if you put your money in the bank they give you money This would basically give you money because you can make the compost yeah the interest yeah So we can get the money from this and then we can buy the bags for the high level tea But that has no holes for the worms The sun is coming right into But would it fit in our room So we need to get more information on this Remember we were talking about the internet could be wrong about its size Yeah but normally they don t do false advertisement This is like in a this the bottom is like this size of a desk You could compare this to this vase or this container that they would put the plant in It s like a shower it s like the size of a shower Yeah you guys need more information We need more information before you can make a decision on that A lot of information on this already But we won t make tea if this one would have really worked cause it s made You know the more it costs the better it works Do you agree with his comment No Yeah that s what Cara said Can anyone give an example I don t agree with that because when I was real little I bought some toy cars and they didn t work as well as I got some that were cheaper And the cheaper ones worked better than the expensive ones Okay you guys continue discussing that 
 Okay What s the next one Zach Jen you can put on a 50 line poem on that one here if you wanted to I got that You have Okay what was the main What was the summary What would be a good summary sentence Well they competed in a game known as the Memoriad Uh huh You guys had that one don t you You have the names and faces there That was great The game Are you doing the vocab though No Okay So wait hang on Should we do the pictures or the vocabulary words You can just do anything from that article The pictures were just to get you thinking about it That s why we did the words And the vocab was just to help us understand So it doesn t have to go off the vocab But the vocab kind of connects with an idea So it may kind of work out that way You ll have to let Zach see because you took what he had which is great and you added to it Do we put the name of the movie I m doing It s a song The croak part is a song Mm hmm that was part of the Okay I was getting There there s the song I was stuck on the reading one too Got one left Zach what s the text structure Sharpening his pencil Just go like that So was the Puppet in 1970 Or was it Yep 1970 That must have been old 1968 is when the Yellow Submarine came out Yep All right Do you guys want to put your pyramid up there Zach do you want to help do that Do you agree that he was right on the text structure Yeah See if you can build it I tried to size it just about right as close as I could get So it should fit in there pretty good I don t think it s sized up very well What I just got it as close as I could Zach It may not be 100 perfect And then the person that didn t read the story can read us what you guys put for your answers That means we got to do another one You each got a chance to read Yeah that s the tone one We need one more detail Did I make it a little too big or is it pretty close It s a little long Could be a little long huh Had a little extra at the bottom Next time I ll shrink it up just a little bit We still have one more That s fine And who read it Was it Zach We ll let Zach read those when the girls get done Okay Do I read the summary Do you just want me to read I don t know if he knows Start with the details Memoriad is an unforgettable competition Memoriad games is memorize 50 line poems People compete in the games called Memoriad The game is to memorize it Memorize names and faces and memorize a 50 line poem Very good And what was your text structure Description Description because they were describing all about He just talked He did the talking you did the writing Somebody gave you ideas Kinda maybe It was a good partnership The girls are just about done We ll let them read theirs And then we ll do our Jeopardy Can we tape the Jeopardy game Mm hmm yep We have the same people in Jeopardy that were in here Yes it is the same group Okay let s not have a sword fight right now She has one more task there She s got it all grammatically correct Okay Let s just Judy over here Do you mind if it s off to the side There s another one There s two of them Oh did it fall off Well we can put a little piece of tape over it Oh here it is There you go that should hold it up good All right see if you agree with what the girls have here Are you listening Zach Got a pyramid all set up Our text structure is wait do I start at the bottom Start at the bottom and the details kind of add to the summary The movie they were talking about was the Yellow Submarine starring Is it starring or staring Starring I bet Starring the Beatles The Beatles okay Their song called Being Green was made in 1970 Summary the television was made in 1953 Kermit was in 1970 Stoplight was made in 1920 They all had one thing in common They were in a color Very good I love that last sentence They all have that in common they re in color Text structure is sequence Sequence because It tells the order of them All the years very good Okay one of you guys go grab a marker board one from each team And I ll go get Jeopardy And you ll need a marker to write on the marker board I will pull the screen down All right Zach Zach Where are the markers You can grab one back there There s one up here As long as you got one or two for your group you can take turns Now these questions I think will flow pretty well today Whoa I can t even see it I think the yellow is better I know with the lights on it s a little harder but it helps to have the lights on Did we run review What Did we run review Text structure My music didn t come on Confucius says Vocab Text features Features Thank you Zach Yes they re different Confucius says Yeah Okay who started first last time Was it the guys Yeah Okay we ll let the gals start today So do I do text structure Oh you re gonna win Text structure 500 Text structure 500 Yeah what s the Confucius Says We had done these little matching things way back at the beginning of the year when we did this unit they were little sayings and you decide just which text structure they go with So that might go with text structure Yes it ll be a text structure question yeah Is that what you guys wanted was text structure right Yeah Okay In our state dams have been built Zach on many rivers These dams are used to product electricity we need But they also create problems Scoot your chair closer to your partner Scoot your chair back Prevents the other wildlife near the rivers Therefore we should not build any more dams Instead we should use solar energy or energy from the sun to produce electricity This will help us protect our wildlife and enjoy the natural beauty around us Hmm which of the five text structures We think it s problem solution Problem solution correct Give yourself 500 points Because it said problem in there All right what would the guys like Hey Sorry Zach what do you want They did text structure 500 It ll pop up yellow after I click on the next one Vocab for 500 Vocab for 500 Want to read that one Zach You should take some time to ponder the question before writing your response Hmm what does ponder mean You think Ahh perfect To think about Give yourself 500 points All right what would the gals like Should we try the Confucius question Yeah For 500 Okay Confucius says for 500 And Marissa can read this one Confucius says A beautiful sunset is treasure for the eyes This is one of the five text structures Description Yeah description Description very good And I ll just set these out I got something that might help you guys since a lot of these have them you just kind of have your choices right there What would the guys like Very good Text features Text features 500 Text features 500 Which text feature is an alphabetical listing of subjects people and places you find in a book Index table of contents title What do you guys think Alphabetical listing What do you think Zach Index Index Index would be correct Good job guys What would the gals like Oh 500 Yeah I just did that 500 Should we text features for 400 400 okay All right Judy can read this one What text feature gives definition for vocabulary words Wait what is it Wait Yeah what do you mean for that Oh I didn t that one doesn t have the choices like the other one did It would be an index a glossary or a title Glossary Glossary is correct I put the choices on the other ones I just must have missed that one Very good All right Confucius says for 400 Confucius says for 400 Could you go for Mrs Lloyd s for just a couple minutes Okay I wanna go tell Mr Debush That s all right I ll just get you guys a pass here in just a second We ll do a couple more questions here All right whose turn to read It s Zach s Zach s turn Okay Confucius say First feed the lion then enter cage Hmm Sequence Sequence Do you agree with him Yeah Yes very good Sequence All right what would the gals like What one did they do They just did the Confucius says for 400 I want to do that one for 400 or for 300 right I think yeah Confucius says 300 Okay Yeah Okay all right Oh man basketball Whose turn to read Confucius says Net in soccer is much larger than net in basketball Compare and Yeah compare and contrast Very good All right so they did this one Zach What would you guys like You want to do vocab for 400 Vocab for 400 Yeah vocab Vocab for 400 Okay Many professional golfers first began playing as amateurs Very good Just a second What do you think First players Okay the first players You re exactly right Oh my gosh People who have done something for the first time and they don t get paid They re amateurs All right what would the gals like They did vocab Structure Yeah Structure 400 Yeah They want the big point ones Is it my turn Yeah I think so Living in the country is very different than living in the city A city dweller need to be careful of traffic and other people In the country there are fewer cars and people In the city many people can walk to the movies stores and other activities In the country people must drive to get to places Compare and contrast Yeah Compare and contrast And she agrees Very good All right what would the guys like What do you want Zach Vocab for 300 Vocab for 300 Oh it s your turn Zach I depleted my savings when I bought my new basketball shoes What do you think Hmm what do you think One for depleted Oh I know this one Drained Drained yep Empty gone you used all your savings And basketball shoes can cost a lot of money so I can see that happening What would the gals like Confucius oh wait no no no Did they do text structure 300 Nope he just did the vocab Okay I want to do text structure for 300 Features for 300 No text structure Oh text structure I can go back Structure for 300 The eye is made up of many parts The white part of the eye is called the Sclera sclera and the colored part is called the iris The iris comes in many colors including brown blue green and hazel The iris is covered with the cornea which is clear and round Description Do you agree Yeah I should know about the eye because my stepmom s a she works at the eye company Wait did we just pass text features Oh she does They just 
 Hello guys After all the hard work you ve put in on doing your presentations and your tri board and all the really cool stuff you ve done now we need to put it all together and see what you think about these energy sources that you ve done all this research for Okay So first off doing a little poll Which energy source do you like the best and think it would be the best one to use Solar energy Why It looks pretty cool and I don t know it seems like the most efficient way because the sun s always there and the sun won t run out That s the word whenever you re done using it You can sell it You can keep the energy from the sun from the morning and afternoon during the night You can sell it Okay so he thinks solar Who else Okay Go ahead I like the wind Oh so you can talk to him Because you want to be able to talk to each other right I liked the wind one because it stored up the battery And the battery whenever it wasn t windy and so it kind of was always there It didn t matter about the wind Yeah you can answer the question I also think that wind s the best one because not only can you store it and have energy for whenever there is no wind you can also make money off of that So maybe if you get it in enough homes you won t even have to have a job You can make money off that That s a very good point That s a very good point making money off of that energy source Which other ones did we say could make money Um the solar Solar can make money Well I like the wind Because it s like the sun is going to burn up one day but the wind is always going to be there And the only bad thing about it is that the birds are going to die but that s okay Okay well what are some pros and cons then So you just said birds would die if we use wind power okay Does that outweigh the benefit that you get from using wind power I think birds dying isn t that bad because you know we eat birds so I don t think it would be that bad if birds do die I mean I don t think a lot of birds die because of the wind solar energy Not as much as oil or any of that other stuff Yeah or like we eat birds The other one I like is the hydro one that James did because His was ridiculous That was nice So what part of it were you most impressed with Like not like the demonstration but it was a great demonstration but hydroelectric power in general what part of that Like how if you have a pond or something you can put it in there and then it will power up your whole house Do we need moving water Oh yeah you need moving water to have that You d have to have a stream but you could basically do it anywhere you have moving water And if you really wanted to spend some money there s also the pump storage plant from a high reservoir to a low reservoir So that one actually sounds pretty good So somebody want to defend theirs Rakif I don t really like mine because Which one did you do I did oil Natural Gas Oil and natural gas okay Why not Because mine isn t as abundant as the wind or as the solar energy so it s probably going to run out pretty soon Like oil natural gas and coal do run out They re not going to be as here as much as the wind or hydro or something like that Well there s a lot of dangers involved with using oil right Oil rigs pipelines lots of dangers involved right Oil prices can cause high gas prices That s true too Remember in your presentation you talk about some of the dangers What were those dangers and are those dangers any better or worse than some of the other dangers for the other energy sources For oil Yeah The pipelines can burst and they can kill marine life in the water if the oil gets out They could cause another oil spill Explosions But coal I know you re supposed to like stick up for your natural resource but I kind of think coal can be good but it s mostly bad because a lot of people s lives are getting killed because of all the gasses smells and being down there for so long And I think that s also very bad And the land it hurts the land and the environment Coal is a very dirty resource if you think about it All the coal dust it can cause a lot of lung problems So the miners that go down there they re risking their lives right Yeah Any of the other resources as dangerous as mining coal No Nuclear energy What Nuclear energy is the worst Okay what about nuclear energy How dangerous was that when you looked it up It s a six out of ten chance Of what happening It depends It costs way too much first of all to build it It is very expensive That s true It s got a lot of risks like if it gets into your water or if you breathe in the radiation I imagine it could It smells bad Okay does collecting oil use more energy than it provides Good question What do you mean by collecting oil Like if you have to have the process of going underground and drilling the oil does it use more energy than it provides No I don t think so Because in my presentation it said it produces like a widespread like a very large amount of energy And also that your wave and tidal power powers our system as you said in your presentation Oh good point Those two actually work together When you talk about the wave and tidal power that energy could be harnessed to run your offshore drilling So that s a very good thing as well It s a benefit of drilling Absolutely Are there different energies that do benefit each other Yes the solar energy and wind Because the wind energy is based off the sun because of how the sun waves come onto the Earth and then it turns this sun mill so it produces the turning of the mill so the sun and solar energy and wind energy The solar energy and the wind they actually work together because I ve seen some wind turbines that have solar energy panels on the top One then the other can go That s okay I think solar energy is a really good thing because for a lot of power plants like for times the condition of natural resources like wind even hydroelectric if there s a drought or something or not enough water flow you could always have the solar panels stuck on top of the plant or anywhere Right because we ve found that solar is pretty cost feasible right Yeah it s not that expensive And actually you won t have to pay an electrical bill if you get that If you were going to use solar panels to power a wind turbine or something you re better off just using the solar panel It would just cost more money to have to get the solar panels and the wind turbine or to have the solar panels power the turbine It doesn t power it It s just like another way to get energy at the same time that you re getting the wind When there s no wind there s not much of a wind That s what the battery s for Hmm interesting I have a question for solar power too For solar power how can I make aluminum more efficient in the future Well it doesn t use a lot of the gas so it doesn t affect the environment So it doesn t affect your breathing And you don t need solar panels like you don t need to turn stuff on during the day because the sun through the windows can give you light and then can store up for the night Okay I have a question What natural resource do you think will be the most used in the future Like 50 or so years from now Wind It was used like 3 000 years ago so if it was used 3 000 years ago I think it would be used 3 000 years in the future That s not necessarily true because it could get more worn out by the time 3000 years in the future comes The problem with the wind thing is it can be used in country like rural areas because in other areas you can t put a wind turbine in a normal neighborhood Because you can t can you put one You mean I could put one outside the school here Well it would give energy to the school and the rest of the houses that are near the school Well I d put it on top of the school because then there would be more wind higher up Right and we have to worry about spacing right Because we were saying wind power is built usually where On wind farms where you have a lot of flat land Because if you build in a mountainous region are you going to get a lot of the wind If it s high enough it ll probably be enough Then if you build your wind turbine high up on a mountain what is the chance of that wind turbine maybe getting struck by lightning or being damaged that way Yeah that could be a real problem because of the wind and the way it could be struck down Right that s very possible So when you think about one energy source is there really one energy source to go with Or do you have to take into consideration a lot of factors of where you live what s available Because again talking about building a hydroelectric plant we established you need running water Is there running water everywhere around the United States No No And what s the problem if you flood an area even if there is a running water what happens if you flood the area Well they have to decide Usually if it s going to be a major problem they will actually dig a separate reservoir for the river to flood instead of it coming up on the banks of the river and destroying homes and things That s mostly our United States rule But in China they really don t care So they flood three or four cities multiple towns fill up three gorges of water Wow That s just insane Because once you disrupt water flow you have a problem So again there are some pros and cons to these Okay we re going to take a second and we re going to try to rank the resources in terms of which one you guys think is the best one to possibly use So if you had to pick one that you wanted to go with whether there was running water think you have those things beside you don t limit yourself there but turn to your neighbor for a minute and discuss which one you think would be like 1 and 2 Because each one of you might have a different opinion Give each other a little bit of a reason why and we ll get back together in just a second Alright guys another 30 seconds Then we ll get back together Alright three two one Let s wrap up our conversations Alright How many people by show of hands went with one of the non renewable resources like coal oil or natural gas Cool So everybody picked a renewable resource as the way to go Alright Ryan I think it s either wind or solar power How many people agree Oh so wind or solar is the clear choice Jonah why The thing is I think solar would be first Because solar energy you can use almost anywhere pretty much But the wind if you live here you can t get it as easily because there s not as much wind So it would be a lot easier to have solar because you can use solar anywhere because the sun is shining pretty much everywhere We think solar too because the sun is always there even if it is winter or it s a little cloudy the sun is still there Yeah but what about at night time So Maddy what did we find out about solar At night time like a lot of people go to work during the day so no one s at their house using their lights and stuff So there s a battery that stores all the energy and then you can come home at night and you can still power your house You still get some light at night bouncing off the moon Dustin what do you think I was thinking that solar energy would be great because I was comparing it to if you want to charge your phone and you have it plugged in and while it s plugged in it s fully charged and you can still use it and it won t un charge because it s still plugged into the wall But if the power goes out at your house then it will stop charging and you ll have that much battery left So it s kind of like if you re out in the day and your house is charging while there s still sun So you re still getting energy and at night time when the sun is gone you ll have that energy saved in the battery of the solar thing Well it s the same thing with wind power You d still have that battery there Yeah Wind power would be Would solar power still work during a storm It depends how severe the storm is So you mean this is like built to last Yeah if it gets struck by lightning I don t think it would still work But you know when there are clouds outside during the day on a cloudy day you know the solar radiation is still getting through the clouds right So that solar panel would still be getting energy from the sun on a cloudy day just at night you would still have to use the battery that s been stored Just like with wind power There is wind power all day long all night long but sometimes it does die down at certain times so there s a battery too there as well Exactly I agree with solar power but I agree that it would be great for being on your houses and things but I don t see the purpose of a solar farm It takes up a lot of land Just the point to collect the sun I think it would be better putting it on a house or combining it with another power plant like wind power or something like that because And cost wise it would be probably expensive because it was 900 for just one of those panels And Miss Shonda said it would take about 12 just for one house That s basically about 10 800 For one house But we also think that solar panels blend in more than winter lines Just imagine random winter lines in your front yard Yeah but we saw pictures or a video of a solar powered house and most people don t like solar panels because it looks unattractive on the top of your house Same with the wind power wind turbines would look unattractive But you can still decorate them if you want You can t really do that with the wind power I mean solar power thing because it s mostly black That s a good thought So going forward thinking of an energy solution because as you guys get older energy is going to be something you have to worry about We ve seen the gas prices The gasoline prices for regular cars go up You ve seen the ethanol being developed Is it good to keep developing new technologies How many of you guys once you start driving think if you could do it or your parents could do it for you would drive a hybrid car I would Okay would you drive a hybrid car Yeah I would drive one because it s more in miles per gallon and with rechargeable cars you can charge your car instead of using gas and spending more money That s good Also the emissions from your gas 
 Oh water or more I guess And what gets thrown into the pond The pebble Is there a pebble Oh that s so cute okay So wait what order these do these rings show up What order Yeah like what s the procedure when this was like like this and then this one or then this one They start small and bigger and bigger So drop your pebble in the pond there you go And it gets bigger as it goes up Okay and so now maybe talk through Maybe talk through what is the given what s the constant rate of change where you re looking for it and how would that be seen visually So the rate is increasing constantly at one foot per second Per second The ADT is two pi R BR the first Which one are you guys on Number one okay good In order for you to find for QR may define the ADT We need to find the ADT of different orbs What The ADT concentrating with them So it s like four for DR Okay so What did you do with your sand Show me what happened here Okay air is gonna come into the clear hole and then right into You picked the sand problem tell me about your sand problem It s talking about sand quality to a how to apply it at a rate to be permanent Okay And out of the following the diameter of the base in it Is It s going to make the shape of a cone when you pour it in one spot that s the idea And the shape of the cone will be approximately three times however high the sand is being poured from Okay so our cone has been smooshed but you see how it s still kinda narrow a little mountain in sort of the shape of a cone Right And what s the unknown what are we looking for here We re trying to find the rate of the height of the pile Oh you can do it We said that s possible Okay so Kathy you re able would that be DVDT DHDT DRDT all these DTs we can kinda run together Just blow it up Can we do AHDT Sure AHDT because you re looking for a rate of change for the height Now you re actually on the hardest problem This is the trickiest problem and you have correctly chosen the cards for these But here s what makes it tricky I want you to read through this slowly and let s figure out the unknown and if they give us what other rates they give us Now you actually just told me what the unknown is right DHDT DHDT Okay what other variables do we have on this card besides DHDT and the rate of change AR ARDT ARDT and DVDT Okay now you read it again while y all are listening and see if you can pick out maybe do DVDT or DRDT What was that For both At a sand and gravel plant sand is falling off the conveyor and onto a conical pile at a rate of Plus What information did you just get You can say it again if you need to Sand is falling off a conveyor and onto the conical pile at a rate of 10 cubic feet per minute Okay Good that s DVDT cause it s the amount the volume changes and the label kinda gets screwy too right Okay so now we re listening for DRDT We hope we hear DRDT because we need that also right The diameter of the base of the cone is approximately three times the altitude So Okay so it s giving us information about radius compared to altitude but it doesn t seem to be giving us DRDT right Which means we don t have DRDT And the radius is two feet And the radius is two feet So what s the height again It s the height of DT So we need to find how fast the radius is changing So this right here is the decision Nice The DVDT equals four pi R squared to the DRDT So this is the hardest when you get to the math What we need to find is DRDT when the radius equals two feet Okay All right Okay I guess the next one we can figure out right now How many cubes we got Three Three okay All the edges of the cube are expanding at a rate of three centimeters per second How fast is the volume changing if each edge is one centimeter We have you doing the edges of a cube the radius of an aired balloon So the radius one 370 370 370 So D DS over DT is three Right Plug that we can just plug that in cause it s not a constant Tell me a little bit about the problem you re on Does it have three cubes in your problem Like why does it have three cubes in the box We started with that this other one Okay And it shows after a second it would be that big And then after another second it would be that big Oh good okay so it s showing that it s the same cube and it s getting bigger It s like three stages in an environment Very good very good Correct interpretation Yes And It also shows the volume of the Now what does this question ask you for at the very end What are you gonna be trying to find How fast the volume changes when it enters from Yes I have a question for you here s a think about it question Cause you re finding DVDT when it is exactly one centimeter right that s what the question s asking Do you think DVDT would be greater or smaller when it s past one centimeter Do you think the rate of change of volume will be getting bigger faster or will it slow down Slow down Slow down Slow down My challenge to you is after you do the math problem and you have your equation to work with try two centimeters and see if you were right Yeah so go above and beyond the question Was your conjecture right or were you like oh no we were backwards Kay Okay The base is gonna be point oh eight with the ball at a descending rate And it is asking how fast the pouch is moving to the wall in the last part Oh you look great D two So okay let s pour the sand again So what five So it s pouring at 10 cubic feet per minute Talking about the change in output So what s constant Its cubic feet per minute So that s the The sand being poured in it So that s the volume I don t know Okay We have choices as to who can t I have four And zero to bring it down Yeah I m just gonna bring it down Problem number what Problem one Okay next problem Are we agreed A ladder 25 feet long is leaning against the wall of a house The base of the ladder is pulled away from the wall at a rate of two feet per second How fast is the top moving down the wall when the base of the ladder is 24 feet from the wall So then You definitely got the demonstration item perfect that s right that s exactly what s happening All right Okay You guys are gonna get this one It s what s supposed to be a Length And what made you pick that one It s the Pythagorean theorem And then why would you wanna use the Pythagorean theorem Because it s a three sided it s equal to the right triangle Yeah exactly uh huh All right Okay now I ve got a question for ya Is there any part of that equation that will always give confirmation we want to that you would actually be able to substitute a number in at the very beginning Okay good good All right What would that mean about your derivative card What would you know for sure If you put 25 right there Get a constant rate of one foot per second Anything special for this derivative card DZ over DT equals Well if the original if your ladder is 25 right here where would the 25 originally be put In the Z In the Z okay I that would say that X squared plus Y squared equals 25 Now take the derivative of this with respect to time Would it look exactly like this or a little bit different One we re at a constant rate Right And so when you do your math you can go ahead and put that as zero and then just work with those Good That s good So What s the The balloon s increasing Yeah Following the radius It s the what s the radius it s four feet The radius yeah you have to find what the radius is at four feet and Find the radius when it s at four feet Which one are you on P two When the radius is four feet at what rate is the total area of the disturbed water treatment area So you would define the area Wait which are you on Okay so you have three balloons Right And you could use those three balloons if they are different sizes to show what Okay Okay The rate of change So if you have one balloon and put one back into it and then that s when you have Okay let s see what they look like So let s see if we can have different stages of our balloon here You look like you must be at the last stage cause that looks pretty big Okay that must be the beginning That looks like the beginning too Can one of em get middle stage I think you ve got the baby balloon though I think that s the biggest that guy s getting I didn t know they were different sizes Yeah they are actually different sizes One more Do it And you let some out maybe you got it Oh perfect okay Tell me about what s going on with this balloon What s goin on Oh increase Four cubic feet and they Oh what are they I think I m thinking of the wrong one Like it s not Like it s not measuring each breath it s something No you are thinking right This is is this like what we had Two days ago Yeah a couple days ago Like is what was constant a couple days ago in our activity Air is being continuous air pulled away by the rate of Yes So like the volume the rate of change of volume is constant Is that true on this or is that a different problem Okay and so what is the unknown that you are trying to figure out The change of the radius How the radius is And what do you predict will happen with the rate of change of radius with the larger the radius gets It ll stretch out That I m sorry It ll slow down Yeah I think that s a good conjecture That would be like what happened the other day when we looked at it slowed down quite a bit the bigger the radius got Sounds good And it is because it was what The volume Cause the volume Yeah F four for that that ll go on the left F four and D six Have you gotten to the balloon part yet Let s talk about the other one okay One Okay the other balloon problem was about surface area Is that right Have you done this one yet Yes Okay how many blow up the balloon and let s see what s happening in that balloon Kevin what was happening on this balloon It s the rate of the The puddle B a formula problem Okay so how is Jesse gonna show us the surface area of DVDT Okay so let s demo that Causing ripples Thank you nice demonstration What is constant on this problem The area and then Yeah the radius 
 How do you know How do you think it might be different Okay maybe Ethan goes here Measure yours and let s see And which one do you think you re going under I don t know Okay all right Okay well you all listen to him listen to him You all talk about it You talk to them I m gonna walk around It s my turn EJ Okay let him do the writing Why are you taking them out of that one Okay and what are you trying to make it do Balance Okay balance Let s see you trying to make it balance Okay We need to put it right there Okay Did you balance it now Okay so what do put in that point I m going to scoot this just a little it And then you write it down good How did you know it was balanced Good You said which one was heavier here Okay why did you say Think you can do that one How did you know it was balanced Is it balanced What about that At first which one was balanced Because why It was heavy okay Okay so how many of those are I think it was one more Okay you re put it in You ll put what in this one And the number of crayons you all used You had another object that was moving Look right here You think their eraser didn t move What you all gonna test next Did you even measure that one And I ll come back Alright what are you all doing here Do you think if you did the scissors and Matthew did the scissors do you think it would measure the same Let s do it Okay Let s do it one at a time What s happening You guys can t measure try this one Here s my question If Matthew blows the paper clip is it gonna get the same distance as if you blow the paper clip What do you think You don t think so Why not Matthew you blow Okay all right so remember that okay Now Weslee I want you to test it You said you thought it would go different See if you can make a difference Yeah why did it do something different What s that that you re blowing out Air Air and what is it Gas Gas good All right you all can go ahead and finish measuring I saw Ella trying Now if you and Ella both try to blow on that do you think it s going to move Why don t you think it s going to move You think it s too heavy And you don t have enough breath Try it and see See if you all both do it if you can get it to move You re going red in the face and it s going away Did you all think it was going to move You all didn t think it was How did you find this What d you do Counted Okay counted and what are you working on right now The colors Okay which one do you have to count now Which one do you have there This one and what is that one What is that one A solid a liquid or the gas Solid A solid how are you going to find out What are you gonna do Look at this You re going to look at those can you count those I m gonna come back and see if you counted and made your graph okay You re doing good Okay Okay can you come over here and count You might have to get out of your chair you have lots of them One two three four five six seven eight Eight Five six seven eight Check your numbers and you checked to make sure All right whatcha going to do now Tally Tally them okay think you all can do that Okay you need help putting it on remember which one is the total How did you know that so quick I heard you started counting and then what did you do You found it quickly You remembered from that okay How else could have known that fast Go down there Go down there okay good
