 Two times two Aggregating rules smaller the denominator the bigger the fraction That don t work sometimes I know what you re thinking Six eighths okay One two three Hey look Four five six You know it s like division too Yeah that s Okay six eighths Versus what Six eighths versus three fourths Okay One two three four five six They re equal they re equal One two three They re equal I just did that They re equal Wait wait wait Wait That s what I said didn t you hear me say that I said if you do equivalent fraciton It is Divide by two Can we do it the easy way Nah cause this is basically the easy way I mean look Okay what if we didn t have tiles What if we didn t have Imagine if we didn t have tiles We d have paper and pen People back in the days they never had colorful They didn t have a pencil neither Oh yeah well you know what I m talking about They had clay and a pointy stick All right so where s the paper You guys want to use a pen or pencil I already got one So who wants to go first I ll go first I will Okay group members I can t really explain it You can t really explain it Then show me If I said four tenths and one third Okay so then how do you know that four tenths is bigger than one third looking at those fraction bars Because you add this and minus this It s It s one more than you need No because if you add one tenth to one third it s still going to be bigger Oh yeah All right but just looking at these two If I said one third and four tenths which one s bigger Four tenths Four tenths How do you know by looking at them Because Three four Like six Four tenths It s wider than one third Good it s wider than one third So now you guys just finished envelope number two and you guys have a couple questions to answer about envelope number two Who s turn is it to write Kayla Kayla s So why don t you read the group question for envelope number two Without using the fraction tiles how could you explain to someone why five twelfths is smaller than one half How could you explain it to them that five eighths is bigger than one half So what about that question How would you explain to someone that five twelfths is smaller than one half Just like we told you it s because twelve well twelve six is half of Six twelve Yeah six twelve Is half of a twelve And five is just a little bit smaller than six twelfths Okay very good What about what about five eighths is bigger than one half Israel what do you think How would you explain to someone why five eighths is bigger than one half Five eighths Yeah How could you explain to someone that five eighths is bigger than one half this question right here How would you explain to someone that five eighths is bigger than one half Because like more eighths one eighth is bigger than like one and like more it adds one half and one half So what number would eight as a denominator would be exactly one half Huh Which number which fraction with eight as the denominator would be equal to one half Four eighths Why do you say four eighths It s one half Can you show me with the fraction tiles Didn t you say not to use the fraction tiles I know but I want him to see that he s right that four eighths is equal to one half Okay guys okay good So then how would you explain to somebody why five eighths is bigger than one half It s one more one more you add to it You know that one eighths is equal to one half because they re like even numbers One eighth is equal to one half Four eighths four eighths That four eighths is equal to one half Okay All right guys keep on going Answer the questions for envelope number two and you guys can get started on envelope number three okay All right guys So you guys are on envelope number one Yeah We re done with envelope one we re just like answering this question You re doing what We re done with envelope one but we re answering it Okay so what is the question for envelope number one Anthony can you read it It is Someone in the class said that nine tenths was more than one third because the bigger the number the smaller the fraction Are they correct How would you explain to them where they were correct or incorrect So that s something that I ve heard a lot of people in the class say That the bigger the denominator the smaller the fraction Is that always true No No why Well because well the smaller the denominator that means like sometimes it could be like smaller smaller but sometimes I think like well actually You re doing good keep on going Well since like they re the whole Okay So like two pieces is two pieces one s shaving it all away and the other one is for So what does the denominator actually tell you about a fraction How many pieces the thing is cut into How many pieces it s cut into What does a numerator tell us about a fraction How many are shaded How many are shaded So then why right here why right here is nine tenths so much bigger or bigger than one third Because it s close to one whole Because it s close to one whole And how could you explain it with what we just talked about Savannah Because it s 10 is the denominator and three is the other so if there s 10 that means there s 10 of the small pieces and there s nine of the small of those pieces But there s nine of those pieces So how many of those pieces are shaded in Nine Good And what about for one third How many pieces would we shade in for one third One Good All right guys well keep on going Keep on going you guys are doing well Try to answer these questions and then start with envelope number two okay All right guys keep going All right so which envelope are you guys on right now One we re answering the questions You re answering the questions Yeah and now I m writing it down Four So what did you say What did you actually say for the second question Oh we like if you just I m not gonna say it exactly how she wrote it but we just we all agreed that if you keep Simplifying simplifying a fraction into its lowest terms and if it can t go any lower than like then it s one half or one third you ll know if if it s equivalent to one half Or you can find a common denominator You can find a common denominator and that will allow you to do what To see if they re both the same number To see if they re both the same number Yeah Pretty much the same number Okay why don t you guys start envelope number two then Open up envelope number two and see how you order these on the fraction line Let s try one half first First three fourths Wait Wait Yeah three fourths goes right there five eighths goes right here No no it ll go right here Wait It goes right here So why don t you guys use the fraction bars then to figure it out Because I know three fourths is half of one Three fourths is Half of wait No it would be more It s half of It would be more It would be right here Wait I want you I want you to explain that a little bit better for me You said that three fourths is half of one half I mean one fourth is half of one half OK one fourth is half of one half so what about three fourths then And three fourths would go right here because two fourths is equal to one half and three fourths would be in the middle between one whole and one half Right Also I was going to say that since we all know one half is right here three fourths would go in front of five eighths because one half of eight is four eighths and then that goes right here one half of fourths is two fourths and then that s not the same Three fourths of eight would be six eighths Good And how do you know that four over four goes right over here Cause it s one it s one whole Wait No that would be the same place as three fourths Wait yeah that would be the same place Why would it be the same place Because Oh it is You said it s an equivalent fraction can you explain what they said Why did they say that three fourths and six eighths are equivalent fractions Because they re the same Because because four times two is eight and three times two is six Okay And why does that make two fractions equivalent then Could you show me using fraction tiles I ll help you You can do this Four five six So how many of these do you need Six seven So what are you getting the six for I m getting eight six I already have six though Three fourths One two wait where are the fourths I believe right over oh Okay so show me show me using the fraction tiles why six eighths is the same as three fourths What do you notice We notice that they re the same length They re the same length And also we know that pretty much what Akosha said that if you multiply or if yeah if you multiply like if you multiply three times two and four times two it s six eighths because four times two is yeah four times two is eight and three times two is six Do you notice anything else about it here That two eighths equals one fourth Good Good All right guys let me see the rest of this Yeah How did you know that five twelfths was less than one half Go ahead Six is half of twelve and five twelfths is lower than six twelfths Okay Okay Why did you know that one third is inbetween one fifth and five twelfths Cause like we don t that the smaller the denominator the bigger it is and so one fourth would be in the middle So that would be on the other side of one fourth Okay All right guys keep on going You re doing good We ve over It s over So which one are you guys on now Four but we need help with one of the questions on three Five no we need help on number four Let s look at the question on number three that you guys are stuck on then We re not We just have a question on what it is A conjecture A conjecture So conjecture is something that we we ve talked about before in math If it says What conjecture it s kind of like what a hypothesis is in science 
 This is a classroom where I push in for language arts This is a morning meeting area and this is also the area where any whole group instruction would take place Over here is the area that the assistant sits and works with children and does phonemic awareness activities Here is a word wall and where the students keep their folders with their reading books in it their book boxes Here is where the classroom teacher does word study This is the independent work station And here is where I sit and I m responsible for the reading instruction This is where the guided reading groups meet This is a little reading area over here Where the students can do some independent reading You know what Jane told me to do that I liked also Looking at the word and chunking are good things to do Jane said go back and reread and make sure it sounds right and makes sense And that s something Jesus I want us to start practicing a little more When we get to a word that tricks us Put the book flat Sarah please We want to go back and reread and check and make sure it makes sense Okay here s something else I want us to do today with this book Rascal I want us to think about what happened in the story today And we re going to do it this way I want all eyes up here We re gonna use this wipe board It s a big wipe board It is and you have a little one And you will probably get a chance to use it too But first I m gonna write on the big one Okay The first word up here Jesus I m gonna ask you to help me read it I m gonna chunk it because you know the first part of this word Child Some Okay Jesus is gonna help us Okay Jesus go ahead and help me read this word Some Can you try body Somebody good job You see how he broke that into chunks Do you see that Jane Somebody Let s think about the story Hands down I want you to think about the question before you put your hand up Somebody Somebody s in the story Who is the somebody Who is this story mostly about Kelly s gonna help us Kelly who s this story mostly about Put your hand down Sarah I think is Josie s taking Rascal to the vet You re right Josie s taking Rascal to the vet So who are we talking about in the story Are we talking mostly about Rascal or are we talking mostly about the vet Hands down let her think She ll ask for help if she needs it Who do you think the story s mostly about Um Rascal Rascal I agree Thumbs up if you agree Thumbs up if you agree Sarah do you agree I agree do you agree You do I see a thumbs up Okay So what did you want to say about the title of the story Maybe the story was mostly about Rascal because the title Jackie did you hear what Sarah said She said that s some good thinking Sarah She said she also knew it was mostly about Rascal because the title was in it I knew it was mostly about Rascal because I read the story and they talked about Rascal a lot in the story Rascal Rascal Okay Rascal s in the story Alright Rascal now there s a problem At the very beginning of the story and I m gonna go back in the book and look and see what it is Sarah what s a problem in the very beginning of the story I read the words and it said he didn t want to go in the door to see the vet He didn t want to go to the vet Why do you think he didn t want to go to the vet Jackie How come Why do you think Rascal didn t want to go to the doctor Let s listen to what Jackie says Cause he s scared He s scared How did you know that he s scared Jackie I agree How did you know that Because the picture shows he s looking like he s upset or sad And I like how Sarah said she read in the story Eddie she read that he didn t want to go to the vet Turn the page I see other things happening I m gonna ask you about that in a minute Okay so somebody is Rascal And Rascal the problem is he didn t want to go Rascal didn t want you know what Kelly come up here and help me write Cause you can write the rest of what I m gonna write Come up here Didn t Oh I m gonna do the want part Didn t want Rereading helps me think about what I want to write Rascal didn t want what To go Can you write to go Don t forget to space Rascal didn t want to go to let s have a bigger space Rascal didn t want to go to the I like how you re all looking to see You re good that s fine Just keep going Good thank you Rascal didn t want to go to the Who wants to try vet Sarah you want to try That s a word we haven t written before But I know that she can think about the sounds in it and I bet you she can do it Good job Thank you Sarah Okay Rascal didn t want to go to the vet But but what Eddie but what He didn t want to go But He went and he was scaring the animals Oh my goodness Rascal didn t want to go to the vet but he went anyway and scared the animals Hold on a minute Jane cause I know you re gonna help me But he went anyway Hold on one second then you can tell me and scared should we say I m thinking about how this should sound I m thinking about what happened in the story but he went anyway and scared the other animals or other animals or the animals He did scare cats who else did he scare the mouse Can I have a quiet hand for someone else He scared the cat the mouse Jackie who else did he We can always let Jackie help Let Jackie help let s look Jackie let s go back and look And you re looking at the pictures Jackie s gonna help us Jackie I see the cat that Jane said What other animal do you see in the picture that he scared the parrot and the rabbit Oh okay the parrot and the rabbit Okay he went anyway and scared a rabbit I m gonna put this mark here cause I have a couple things I m saying a cat and I don t have room here so I need to erase this word so I have room to keep writing He went anyway and scared a rabbit a cat and what s the last thing I need to say Kelly And a what Parrot Parrot And I wanted to say Okay what did you want to say I want to say that I really know about these I know their names they call commas You re right thank you Kelly helped me because I didn t say what these were called She reminded us that those are called commas Thank you Kelly Okay one moment Jane I want us to think about the story and I want us to think about what s happening Rascal didn t want to go to the vet but he went anyway and scared a rabbit a cat and a parrot So we have a big problem we need to find a solution We need to find a solution What is our solution to the problem Sarah Can you sit on your bottom so you don t fall and hurt yourself my solution is that at the end of the story right here he goes in to the vet so he doesn t scare the other animals Okay I like how all of you went back to check the solution and you went back in the story to help you understand what happened Jane I like what Sarah said and I m thinking about how I can write that Sarah was looking at this page and she saw how he went into the vet and now he won t scare the other animals Okay Can I read this page Yes and in fact Jane wants to read it and she s gonna I want all of us to read it with our eyes because I want us to listen to how that sounds with those dark parts the author said Go ahead Jane are you ready I love how that sounded and I saw you were practicing that too Kelly Let s all practice that to ourselves The big dog growled grrrrr Rascal ran Jesus how did she know How did Jane know to say Rascal ran How did she know to read it like that The author wrote it in dark and big He wrote it in dark and big he sure did And he said something else Eddie that I want you to look at He wrote it dark and big and what else did he put there at the end Remember what that mark s called It s a big fancy long word That s okay Sarah s gonna help us This mark right here Eddie is what we re talking about Comma Nope but it looks Somebody that s talking Yes and when they re loud go ahead Sarah An exclamation mark Yeah That word is a very long word and it s new to us Eddie so we re learning it Do you wanna try and say it after me Exclamation mark yeah That shows they re excited You mean this Yeah Oh I though you were this Oh well no wonder I was tricking you by accident I m so sorry Eddie Yes I was talking about the exclamation mark Okay Rascal didn t want to go to the vet but he went anyway and scared a rabbit a cat and a parrot And so the end of the story should say that it s a solution Sarah was He ran into the vet What made him Why did he run Because he was scared Of what the dog Jesus did you hear what Sarah said So let s think about that But but he saw a what Big dog Come over here and help me write Me and Jesus are gonna write this together Come on over here Jesus Lemme move this out of your way I m sorry Okay go over here And turn around so everyone can read come over by me But he you can write the word he Go ahead Write it under here Thank you Now I m gonna help you give me the marker Jackie I need you to look over here so you can help us if we need it Go stand over here for a second But he oops he saw you go ahead a a what He saw a what Jackie he saw a what A big dog A big dog And those are words you know go ahead Now come down here so we don t go too far up Dog Oops something s tricking you Go ahead and turn that around Thank you go ahead give me the marker back Thank you Hold on But he saw a big dog and what happened What happened Sarah He Yeah ran And he ran Okay come over and help me write that then please Come on over over here And he ran Good Go ahead and sit down and he ran where Into the vet Okay I m gonna just finish this And he ran in Into is easy because you know both of those parts And he ran into the into the vet Or into the vet s What s that place Let s put that office or room Let s put room But both of those are good choices 
 Well you know what especially after Mrs Bennett taught you the three things she wanted you to do in reading by having you look around the room and skip around the room and flip on the carpet we thought Oh boy that Nathan really needs to do something hands on And I know from you being in Reading Recovery that when you heard a book twice you practically knew it I mean you knew the story You could go somewhere and tell it right Yep When you read the book is it easy for you to retell it What is it like to retell a story that you just read Not so easy for me cause I had to pick up a book look at it for a minute and then I pop it and then I know it Okay if I read a story to you would you be able to go tell it to someone else Yes Okay But right next to me Okay Okay All right well these are the things we re gonna practice And because we don t want to leave out the visual style of learning because it s also an important way to get information we re gonna focus on the auditory and the kinestetic the hearing and the hands on type learning and we re also gonna include some visual so that it will strengthen that part for you But we wanna make sure we re getting you where your strength is Because you are fantastic at listening and doing hands on activities Oh you have a plan in your mind about what kind of castle you re gonna build It s not a castle It s gonna be like when I see that in movies Like a tower like where the Egypt Egyptites The Egyptians Yeah Like a pyramid Yeah Okay cool All right Would you like some extra things like maybe some games or some extra things you can do to help you remember in class Yeah because my teacher she gives us free games like learning games in our math book There s math games and you have to put your thing on it and you have to guess who much it is And if you get it right you stay on there Okay cool Well I want to add some games like that that you re gonna And we re gonna add some things that you can do to help you remember directions in class and remember what Miss Smithson has asked you to do Cause one of the things that I ve noticed is that when Miss Smithson gives you two or three directions you ll start one and then you forget what the other ones are And you re like Ugh what do I do now Yeah because my brain it has so much stuff and because if I get more it kind of breaks the other stuff And you know I wasn t gonna talk about this yet but by you saying that your brain has so much stuff I wanted to remind you about do you know what good listening looks like Uh huh What do good listeners look like Their hands are crisscrossed with their hands in their lap and wherever the teacher goes they keep their eyes on em Okay and then if you have a comment if I say Would anyone like to ask a question or make a comment about what we re learning Let s say I just taught you about Clemson Football Or I like hockey That s my favorite Okay let s say we were learning about hockey The equipment used in hockey okay So if I asked you to either ask me a question or make a comment about what we re learning would you tell me the names of some of the hockey equipment that you know of Or would you ask me a question about a piece of hockey equipment that you ve seen but you don t know what it s called Or would you tell me a story about how you really like hockey Hmmm how I really like hockey I knew you d say that You always do that You remember one of things that Miss McGinnis taught you in Reading Recovery And one of the strengths this is what I love about you one of the things that a lot of people have trouble with when they re reading is that they can t relate what they re reading to themselves or to their lives You are absolutely fantastic with that Fantastic If there s a story of a dog and I have a dog and my dog did the same thing Right So since you re so good at that though sometimes I think that that is one of the things that gets your mind off on on Hey my dog did that Instead of on exactly what your teacher s wanting you to do So one of the things about being a really good listener is to remember what comments and what statements and what questions are necessary for what you re learning And which comments and questions should wait for later even though they re zinging around in your head okay So if I m doing a whole class lesson about different colored fur on dogs and I say Can anyone think of a color that a dog s fur might be What would be a comment you could make Black and brown cause that s what my dog is made out of Okay black and brown All right let s say somebody says blonde somebody else says white and then somebody raises their hand and they say Well I don t know what all colors dogs can be but my dog Sandy is really pretty Is that a comment that is necessary for what we re talking about No Okay so that s one of the things that you can practice And I love your stories and I know Miss Smithson does too And you have a lot of kids and grownups in this school that feel really close to you and we feel like we have a good relationship with you because you do share things about yourself Yeah but I only do that at the beginning of the day the end of the day and at writing Cause I write down the things in writing Good well then I m glad Miss Smithson is also working on this with you because as much as I want to know about you I don t want it to distract you from what it is you re supposed to be thinking about Okay Okay Three more blocks Okay let s talk about some of the things that we re gonna put in place for you okay A couple of em I m pretty excited about okay We re gonna work on your memory with reading and in general with classwork so that when someone tells Nathan what to do Nathan s gonna be able to remember it Instead of getting distracted and thinking Huh I have no idea what I m supposed to do next Yeah because in my class there s some kids Zachary and Brody and the two new kids they re talking in the back And that s can be very distracting can t it Okay do you know how to focus Do you know how to tune people out What do you do when you re distracted in the classroom I just turn around and go like this Okay do you think you know how to tune people out without having to tell them to stop What if you knew they were gonna talk no matter what but you still needed to listen Could you I could do this to block their sound Okay you could That kinda reminds me of the bat we were talking about for some reason It s kinda like you re directing your hearing at one place And sometimes I push it to what I m hearing at So then when I do that in my mouth I can hear it more good without noises from the construction site that s near our house I can focus on it Okay I think that s fantastic what you ve just said You make a conscious effort to focus on what you re trying to hear That what I want you to do when you notice that other people are talking behind you Instead of worrying about what they re doing I want you to focus on what you need to be hearing I want you to stop and think I m not gonna listen to them I m gonna listen to Miss Smithson Okay And see if that helps Just like you strain to hear the construction noises okay All right we re gonna do some fun things with you that I think you re gonna like First of all I know you love video games So one of the things that we ve tried before that doesn t seem to be working very well is Odyssey And I know that when you get on Odyssey you like to choose the math games over the reading games Probably just Why do you choose math over reading Cause I wanna get more math so then I can just focus on reading cause if I m really smart at math I can just drop it so I know everything I know sweetheart It s a lot more fun to do something that you re really good at So we re gonna change up your computer program Instead of having you work on Odyssey during the day instead of Odyssey you re gonna work on a new program called Earobics And it s supposed to be super helpful with your reading skills And Mrs Price the speech teacher whose office is across the hall she said it is really fun and that she knew kids at Griggs Road that did it and they loved it okay So we re gonna try Earobics So we re gonna keep a computer game for you but we re gonna try one that hopefully is gonna work better to help your reading skills come up instead of Odyssey Okay All right The next thing we re gonna do is we re gonna give you a little tape recorder Have you ever had a tape recorder No and I haven t even seen one I know a lot of people don t use tape recorders anymore Most people can record things on their phone and all kinds of gadgets Well I had when I was little I had this little thing and it had a recorder When I would sing a song into the microphone I could record it and then play it to my friends Okay well we re gonna do something like that We re gonna have you if Mrs Smithson is giving directions and then you guys are getting ready to do an assignment or group work or whatever it is she wants you to do she s gonna come over and she s gonna give the directions to you You get to press record on your tape recorder and say the directions yourself into the tape recorder Then you get to stop it and play it back and hear yourself saying the directions Okay Unless you need them we re gonna have you put the little tape recorder away so that it doesn t bother you Like maybe in a pocket behind your seat or something And then only if you get stuck and you think Hmm what did Miss Smithson want me to do can you get out that recorder and listen Yeah or I can have it recording beside me so I could record everything and if I still remember it like it s so easy I can remember it I can just erase it Okay But I think the actual act of hearing it whole group with the rest of the kids in your room hearing it with just Miss Smithson telling it you saying it again yourself and then hearing what you said that may be all you need You may not have to listen to it again I think just making sure you re really concentrating on what the directions are is gonna be a really good thing for ya Okay also oop I gotta get something from over here Okay One of the other things we might do is maybe Miss Smithson might tell you something like give you a direction and she s gonna whisper it in your ear and then you have to whisper it to the person beside you And they re gonna whisper it to the person beside them and it s gonna go around the table until it gets back to you How many of you all sit at one group Five or six I think it s gonna be five cause we got two more kids Okay so sometimes Miss Smithson might say Get out your pencil get out your math book and turn to page 50 Okay So then you have to whisper that into the ear of the person beside you What would you say Get out your pencil and get out your math book and turn to page 50 Okay and then that person would have to whisper it to them Then it s gonna come all the way around and then the last person s gonna say Get out your pencil get out your math book and turn to page 60 Is that right I ll just turn back to em and say It s 50 It s 50 Okay okay That s another way we might make sure that we understand the directions before we get started Sometimes my teacher she just writes it on

the letter that makes the sound that you hear at the beginning of the word worm Worm W W What letter W Good job We have been talking about spring and we have been talking about the seasons of summer and winter and springtime What season are we in right now Winter Winter Very good Well this book Hedgehog is Hungry that s written by Beverley Randell is about a hedgehog And he is asleep during the wintertime And he wakes up in the springtime and he is hungry But first look at this picture Have y all ever seen anything like this before No I saw a hedgehog in a book but not real You ve seen a hedgehogs before in a book but not real Not me Hedgehogs are pokey And when they curl up their little spikes poke out They pop up That s right Why do you think they pop up Cuz that means you re scared That means they re scared Nature protects If a person runs into the pointy stuff they ll say Ouch That s right And it protects them Well as we are reading this book today we re going to read this book to find out what Hedgehog is going to eat What Hedgehog is hungry for and what he is going to eat I want you to look at your partner and I want you to tell your partner what you think hedgehog might eat I am thinking he is going to eat a worm I think he is going to eat a snail Okay Alright Well I heard I heard worm and I heard snail And she said snail too Why do you both think the hedgehog is going to eat a snail Because there s one right in front of it I think it s going to eat a worm You think it s going to eat a worm I think he s going to eat a leaf You think he might eat leaves Okay Alright So we re going to read this book to find out what Hedgehog is going to eat Alright why are we reading this book To find out what Hedgehog is going to eat But guess what There s going to be some words in this book that we might not know how to read One of the words we are going to work on today is new high frequency word And remember high frequency words there aren t any rules for them are they We just have to learn the way they look so that we can learn to read them Can you read tell me what this word is Here This is the word here I love how you decoded it We already learned about it We have learned about here Here is on our Word wall Word wall isn t it Excellent job Well today it is important that you not only know how to read words but it s important that you also know how to spell words So I m going to give you the letters that you need I want you to dump them out and I want you to spell here for me I m going to turn this around so you can t look at it And I want you to spell here for me I hear Lilly saying it s Here I spelled it Alright I m going to turn it back around Are you all ready Alright check it H E R E I did it Are you all right What word did you just build Here Here Alright now we can build it so I want you to write it I want you to write the word here Not look at your letters Okay Are you ready Show me how you write the word here And then I ll let you check it again You re almost there What else do you think comes next I think you push harder You want to try pushing harder You think you got it Natalia I put an exclamation mark Here You put an exclamation mark at the end I spelled it You did Alright I m going to turn it around You all ready to check it Did you get it Alright read your word Here Here Very good H A R E here Here It s not A Alright now one way that we can help ourself is by looking at high frequency words and learning all of our high frequency words Our high frequency words are on our word wall So that s one place that you can look if you get stuck Another thing that we can do is we can look at the pictures to help us with the tricky part So we re going to go through and that s what we re going to do right now We are going to look at the pictures Are you ready Hedgehog is hungry That s our title Now what time of year do you think it is Winter Winter It is definitely winter Because all of the leaves are off the tree Because all of the leaves are off the tree Alright let s look at the pictures Now who do you see buried down in the leaves there I see Hedgehog You see Hedgehog Is Hedgehog awake or is he asleep Asleep And you know why he s asleep Because it s winter and he hibernated And he s hibernating Very good turn to the next page Now what season is it What season is it It s spring It s spring And is Hedgehog still asleep No No Hedgehog is awake Let s turn to the next page And there he goes Here he comes He s going out for a little walk What do you think he s doing Find something to eat He s going to find something to eat Let s turn to the next page Hedgehog is hungry And what is the first thing he finds He finds a Snail I was right Uh you were right And me Okay let s turn to the next page He s still hungry He ate worms and caterpillar Okay now that is a very big word caterpillar How did you all know that that was the word caterpillar I saw it right there Alright listen closely You all just told me two strategies you can use to help yourself when you come to a tricky word You can get your mouth ready for the beginning sound Or you can look at the pictures Tell me again You can get your mouth ready for the beginning sound Or you can look at the pictures Okay let s turn to the next page Now what does he find What is that Okay we talked about one of the strategies is we can get our mouth ready for the beginning sound Alright let s run our finger underneath it now Let s look at it Let me write it Let s do Bug Let s spell bug and see How would we spell bug Get your arms ready Is that going to be the word bug No No So we re going to have to look at that This is the word beetle Can you say that word Beetle And look underneath it What do you see underneath it That is a slug Ooooh Now just like eyes are up here Lilly Eyes are up here Okay there we go Just like we can get our mouth ready for the beginning sound you all also know how to decode words Is everybody s eyes up here So we can get our mouth ready for the beginning blend which is sl What sound is the U going to make Uh Because there s only one vowel And what sound s the G going to make Guh Let s blend it together Are you ready Sl u g Slug Now look at me You have three ways now You can look at the pictures You can get your mouth ready for the beginning sound And you can decode words that have one vowel in them Alright let s close our book up All the way up When you are reading I want you to read to find out what Hedgehog eats What is your purpose for reading To find out what hedgehog eats Alright start reading Hedgehog is hungry What did we say he was Use the pictures to help you with the tricky part We said he was a asleep Asleep Good job It wasn t doing that space in there That s right because asleep is one word There s our high frequency word here I m tricked You re tricked Alright so what will you do H un gry Hungry Very good Hedgehog is hungry Good job Slug Good job It does spell the word spring Good job Alright I love the way you all did two things I love the way you can all use your fingers to help you point I saw Lilly stretching lots of words out When she came to a word that she didn t know she got her mouth ready and she stretched those out just like we did with the word slug I saw Poniyota using the pictures help her with the tricky part We are reading to find out what hedgehog ate Do you remember what hedgehog ate Snails He ate snails What was something else he ate A snail A snail What was something else he ate A bug A bug What was something else he ate He ate a beetle bug A beetle bug Alright let s read it and make it sound like talking Hedgehog is hungry Hedgehog is hungry Winter is here Hedgehog is asleep Spring is here Hedgehog wakes up Here comes hedgehog Let s all get together Here we go Hedgehog is hungry Here is a snail Hedgehog is hungry Here is a worm Here is a caterpillar Here is a beetle Here is a slug Hedgehog is hungry in the spring Very good job I am very proud of you all 
 Exactly Right So what do you all think about the fact that this is written almost sort of journalistically I know you re the big newspaper man and everything What do you think about that That s what I m talking about I m talking about the growth of the poem overall The first passage it s almost not objective but it kind of states what s happening It doesn t actually say what the author is thinking As the poem grows and goes on and goes to the next passages it becomes more poetic and more descriptive and it s more of the author s point of view and the author s stance on what s happening Nora what do you think about the poem so far I thought it was a good like utilization of the message I m taking African American history this year Okay We ve been talking about the slave trade the last few weeks So that first part we were talking about how they were like the sickness What are the specific lines that you think best describe the sickness and the death and everything We have jettisoned the blind to no avail It spread The terrifying sickness spreads It s claws have scratched the sight from the captain s eyes The slaves were all tied together in their own so the sickness and disease could spread through them But also the slavers like the white people on the ship were also susceptible to disease That s where they got the idea of whites becoming more like the blacks because they re in such close quarters that it s inevitable almost and the fact that they are holding themselves above them superior as civilized but they re still acting acts of barbarism is very much a historical principle So you really think that there s a moment of transformation in this poem where the whites who are theoretically the real barbaric people become like the blacks who they think are savages I don t think it s even a point of transformation I believe that the author Robert Hayden is talking about this as it has been So this kind of opens in maybe a stress when they re sailing on the slave ship and they talk about this and it s like there s all sorts of imagery throughout this that implies that these blacks are er these whites are becoming like the blacks What s your favorite line that shows this Nick Standing to America bringing home black gold black ivory black seed Now I especially liked the middle part of that black ivory Because ivory is usually white Of course Yes Yeah So you have the juxtaposition of black and white Yes I think the lines after that Deep in the festering hold thy father lies of his bones New England pews are made those are altar lights that were his eyes Jordan what do you think the about this religious connotation Well seeing that I m not too familiar with the Bible Judaism and Christianity are similar but in these two paragraphs that you were just reading I saw a big contrast between the glory of taking back these animals these slaves and making the best of them in the new world Between that and the evil that they re really bestowing upon the slaves Standing to America bringing home black gold black ivory black seed is kind of glory and that contrast between evil Deep in the festering hold thy father lies of his bones New England pews are made those are altar lights that were his eyes They also kind of need a religious figure throughout this voyage because throughout this we see that they re going through a time of spiritual crisis What port awaits us Davy Jones or home I ve heard of slavers drifting drifting play things of wind and storm and chance their crews gone blind the jungle hatred crawling up on deck It s like they understand that they re becoming uncivilized and they re trying to find a way to change this To justify their actions Yeah That s what they need a justification for their actions So they say God is with them and everything is okay And you have that sort of anaphora of the hymn that Jesus our Savior pilot throughout this entire thing that sort of brings and invokes the God into all of this so that it s almost as if to me they re looking for their justification They re looking to justify the horrific actions that they re putting out Which is ironic because these are often these spirituals are often sung by slaves to get through all of the times of turmoil So it s ironic that they re claiming that God is on their side as a justification for the enslaving of blacks I think it s also ironic though that the blacks are the ones who receive the justification from a lot of the whites in the new world At the end talking about John Quincy Adams he says it was completely justified what the blacks did when they revolted and attacked the white slavers The suffering that they had been enduring And that s like the moment of irony Yeah The slavers are saying How paradoxical indeed that you whose wealth whose tree of liberty are rooted in the labor of your slaves should suffer the august John Quincy Adams to speak with so much passion of the right of chattel slaves to kill their lawful masters And with his Roman rhetoric weave a hero s garland for Cinquez This is what I want you all to think about Think about the historical connections here John Quincy Adams one of our founding fathers fourth president of the United States was ultimately the man who got freedom or found freedom in court for Cinquez and the other slaves that were on the Amistad which is a ship that of course being discussed in here Think about these historical connections I shall return All right group What s going on We re talking about a poem You re talking about a poem I m going to talk about a poem too What a coincidence I know Isn t it coincidental What s going on What are you all discussing so far We re looking for the marrow part You re looking for the marrow part Yeah I m glad you all have your Beloveds out and everything What really interests me is the fact I think we have a real instance here where the 60 million or more to whom the book was dedicated This is their story is it not What do you all think How can we connect our reading of this poem to our reading of Beloved In the second part in the last paragraph it says The fever is melting down my bones Yes Right now we re connecting that to Stamp Paid who at some point had said that he was tired in his marrow as in his bone marrow We re looking for the page right now Okay Found it Okay And it s on this Whoa What is that Read the passage to us My marrow is tired he thought I ve been tired all my days bone tired but now it s in the marrow It must be what Baby Suggs felt when she lay down and thought about color for the rest of her life Okay So let s connect what you say in this stanza you have I d be trading still but for the fevers melting down my bones What is it about that stanza that you want to connect to this allusion We thought that her fever is melting down we thought that it was it s pretty much the exact same connection because it s bones going into the marrow so the outside going into the inside The fever is melting down to my bones it s just taking a different way And to get more than a physiological point of view here the marrow is where Where is the marrow In your bones It s like the core So Raphael when we re suggesting that the marrow is being corrupted in some way what does it mean for us It basically means that the entirety of the whole of the being is being corrupted Okay So in essence then from a symbolic point of view just like in Beloved we can relate this to the poem What kind of corruption do you see here For me it was mainly corruption of hypocrisy Okay Hypocrisy in what context Mainly that the enslavers honestly believed that they were in the right that they were different like this passage this short passage here It sickens me to think of what I saw of how these apes throw overboard the butchered bodies of our men true Christians all like so much jetsam Yes And then at the very beginning they re talking about how they re throwing slaves overboard Or even when the slaves decide to Lost three this morning leaped with crazy laughter to the wading sharks sang as they went under Yeah So there s this sort of weird juxtaposition of the whites being thrown over by the savages or the apes at the end versus the slaves who choose to jump over at the beginning Laura what do you think is going on in this particular context With all of the jumping off board it s a true escape to eternal freedom I guess if you believe in Heaven The thing that confuses me is I understand why the savage blacks would throw the whites over obviously death and more of a pain but it also ends their misery in a way of staying on the ship with the slaves getting the sickness the blindness and having to wait I think it s like another three weeks before they come to port So it s really contrasting and interesting how it goes back and forth This poem focuses I think on both sides on black and white Yes It really does illustrate both Which do you think is best illustrated Laura the black side or the white side The black side is really I don t want to say common but it s similar to everything you hear about slave ships And the slave trade and the slave trade So I think it s interesting that Hayden decided to also put in the white side of it because you don t really focus on what came of slavery Even though it was a horrible thing on the last page here it says That you whose wealth whose tree of liberty are rooted in the labor of your slaves I thought it was interesting because I often fail to make the connection that through the slavery we actually were able to grow as a country and through our liberty first we were able to bring the slaves out eventually through the Civil War Jordan continue I was looking at more of the religious side of it as with what you were just talking about Here it says Their moaning is a prayer for death Yes Some try to starve themselves And then you go down one two three four stanzas later it says Jesus Savior pilot me over life s tempestuous sea We pray that thou will grant O Lord safe passage to our vessels bringing heathen souls It s not so much praying for death it s praying and knowing that Jesus can lead them to freedom forever and allow them out of Who is praying for Jesus here Jordan The slaves Really That s how I took it Okay Did anybody here take it a different way I took it as the sailors Exactly Good Not that that s I think you re on to something in the sense that the religion of the slavers was eventually forced upon the slaves themselves So I think that they could be So I think there s a real sort of duality there For this point in history they evangelized Evangelized They had already Evangelized Yes It s a hard word to say Africa I know the Dutch for example had already been there So historically speaking then Raphael when you say it s the slavers that are the ones that are praying what s ironic about all of this That they re so much in the wrong and they don t see it all and that kind of hypocrisy And they re looking for justification for their actions Speaking of justification what I want you to think about now for a few minutes I m going to talk to the other group up front here why is it that the white side of things is all reported to us literally through almost a journalistic style It s all quotes It s all basically kind of like it s from a ship s log So think about this and I m going to be back to talk to you about it All right group what s going on It s all going on It s all going on Okay Tell me What have we discussed Everything Everything Tell me more Well we ve discussed about how in this stanza That there was hardly room tween decks for half the sweltering cattle stowed spoon fashion there that some went mad of thirst and tore their flesh and sucked the blood That was talking about the capture of the Africans Yes Who wouldn t be so thirsty that they wouldn t tear open their own skin and drink their own blood Which is just crazy in terms of the suffering Yeah And how that shows that in some way they were driven into some sorts of savagery And yet in the next stanza it talks about how the crew would lay with the The Guinea Rose Yeah The crew and cabin lusted with the comeliest of the savage girls kept naked in the cabins Okay Well let s talk about it for just a second We have a real juxtaposition of pleasure and suffering What do you think Yeah It s a real contrast between describing these people as sweltering cattle ripping their flesh open and then it goes right into how the crew like would sleep with these women Exactly They re fully taking advantage of them Imagine being kept naked in a cabin for the whole journey Yeah It s a very big contrast because they are calling them animals So what happens after their lust In the stanzas right before we begin section two of the poem what details are we given about what happens to this specific crew They abandon the ship It goes up in flames Exactly So it s basically set on fire and then what happens 
 But you re putting children in your sweatshops How are you gonna get more money How are you gonna finance the country still Both of you need to listen to Cambodia Because Cambodia I am awesome Cambodia is awesome What are you doing to fix this Well for the money problem I m not really sure but you can get loans for other wealthier countries and then as you re getting better pay em off and then for and then for child labor you make a law that kids have to go to school and learn so that way they can get better skills and stuff And then put their after that works and everything to age laws I m the only one with an answer I have no child labor whatsoever Whoa whoa whoa I thought we discussed that you do have child labor but Well we do have some child labor but it s more the grits going in and making your child choose the forms to get hired So what do I win as the only one with an answer How did you pull your country off child labor You need to be giving them suggestions and ideas OK what can we do what can we do to crack You told us some solutions the other day Right so that s why you guys are supposed to be discussing now OK China do you wanna go ahead and So China you know how to get rid of all your child labor in your country You have a plan you have your whole plan in place Pretty much What s the first step what s the second step what s the third step what you re gonna do Yeah you wanna hear it I do First we ll make it illegal for children to work all day And the other half they go to school OK but wait a minute but don t your parents your families depend on that income that those children are bringing in Yes but if they work half the day while they re at school they still earn money But then they re losing half their income But then on weekends they can But they work weekends right now anyway Maybe we could establish a minimum wage over there Oh Now there s an idea What They could establish a minimum wage Yeah OK so you re gonna establish a minimum wage Yes and going to school to get a education helps them get better jobs when they re employed so they can get more money with better jobs so then they don t have that issue So what are you going to do in the process because you are gonna have to have children leaving the workforce just starting to get their education that takes several years for that generation to become educated what are you gonna do in that gap You still have to have a plan for those 12 13 14 years What about programs like those they used in like the de de depression that s the word OK that s what you guys should be discussing those are some of the things you should be coming up with They could start Keep in mind that needs money But then they would get loans from wealthier countries and as they re getting stronger and more OK take those ideas and work with them You guys are on the right track you re rolling with it So put that down establish a minimum wage OK Cameroon what was your solution Say the children stop working and the adults get it well it would be taking money away from the family Not other than the ones we came up with on Friday like have countries send money What about that like education like half school half work campaign it s like where where you re working part of your wages pay for your school and then you take the rest home And then like with me in my country already go to school So I guess all those times you mentioned But they only go for like six years from age 7 to Wait I don t know OK anyway that would help with like the country being France for the win Like the same thing but more Coffee OK if it was our major export it would get rid of poverty and many things Where s your country Where s your country OK never mind I was thinking you move at the same time but no If we work together with the coffee export like If we combine the export If we produce Well I meant like from whatever we sell we could try to hawk them together to help each other create better education Y all can combine your profits in coffee and begin making schools You have an industry that brings in a lot of potential money correct Right OK but remember you don t sell that product to the customers you re selling it to the businesses But that s bringing money in to your businesses It s the businesses that hire people and you create jobs So you need to figure out a way to take that industry that product and expand it so that it s bringing more money and bringing more jobs Which is gonna help because then you ll have adults you have 45 income We can combine it so that children who are of suitable ages can have jobs What would be a suitable age Eighteen Eighteen This mine is not an easy job is it It s hard work it s dangerous down there To have twelve year old kids down there You re still United Nations correct Is that gonna be agreeable to you You can create laws that forbid businesses from running her product So whatever she suggests to you you have to make sure that that s OK because remember you can tell her sorry it s not gonna happen Yup Which means you have more money going out than coming in correct So you need to figure out a way to change that You need some money coming in So what are the strengths your country has That you could potentially build and grow when she s got the diamonds I saw a pendant on the internet and it had like a string and there was like three fat fond doves on one string OK that s a factory purchase but what you could make I don t know That s what you need to know What does your economy depend on I mean you have to produce something It says making foreign OK I have a question what is a foreign exchange It s Nestea s largest exporter so you are exporting product So you do have some products that you re exporting Oh you re Taiwan You have a lot of textile factories you make clothing Your country s the one that s got all the sweatshops So that s what you need you need to build You should be suggesting some ideas to her Giving her ideas say OK you ve got a product to export but you need to do this and you need to do this and you need to do this They need to find some way to pay Exactly Wait I have a question for the United Nations OK how you said setting up your steps well if there s not a lot of educated people then how are they gonna find teachers Well if you said exactly Well first You could hire people from Different countries Maybe if you like hired somebody from like the US that s educated they could do administry of helping like educating adults and then they re educated They re doing the same thing that kids are they ve been in child labor and stuff plus when they got older they re just working again so they haven t really changed anything so to change that I guess maybe if you got other countries to come and educate them and then after that they could the educate the children So you couldn t get the kids out of the work so fast because you still have to educate all the teachers And the kids have no where to go Well I say since they re already adults that we kinda like work on the children more with education I guess because the children are small So before you even take the kids out of these places You have to get all the people and you have to So you have to figure out some like you re gonna have to figure out a timespan of how long that s gonna take It s basically you re taking elementary schools you like I mean they could set up a scholarship That way they could go from like And even your country could help pay help pay the people that are teaching Because in the long run you re gaining that money s gonna be spent The population is gonna face it they get the cotton for the clothes and get the food for their teachers and all that If we can help poverty To help pay for some schools Yes that would be amazing We could also have all the adults work the rest of their life like insanely or something I m the government I can say hey there s laws now that a kid s gotta go to school and he can t work so many days of work so many hours of work 
 This one is probably medium So this one is mine So this has to be a medium And this one has to be a large because My medium is half way up to here So it has to be a large So you make a prediction about how many small rocks it takes to make a big I think it s gonna be 12 small rocks That s a good idea Put our small rocks we have here so we make it draw two little blocks and if we have 12 Draw a rectangle and just put put your line through right here What do you think how many small rocks I think that there is going to be eight We have eight rocks So I think that there s going to be What about you I have 10 11 12 Boys and girls I had a good question If you ve got more rocks than you do boxes you know that we ve got how many boxes How many boxes Ten There s ten So at the top you can write since we ve been working with place value with tens and ones you can put ten We know that s how many boxes we have You could put plus six if you have which number 16 16 If you all had 11 what could you do You got ten so you would write plus one If you had 12 you would write you ve got 10 so what would you write above it Plus two So you can do it that way Good question Now what about you make a prediction of five then you ask us how many baby rocks we think that ten makes I think that there is going to be These can be large And there s one two three four four larges He s already told you how many mediums there are However you think Very good So you ve got yours sorted by size or you could see if there s another way you can sort your rocks We just did size first so we could do our work Very smart Very smart Tell me about looking at the graph how many small you had Diana How many small rocks were there Five Alright how many medium rocks did you have 11 And how many large Four Good good and you sorted them Oh you got some nice rocks Oooh Nice rock there it s pretty Neat Now this looks much better much better Medium there s one two three four five six seven eight nine Three four five six seven eight nine 10 Wait wait One two three four five Now we need five more to make 15 One two three four five six seven eight nine Four five six seven eight nine I counted 14 Put them together One two three four I d say like maybe it goes with the white Okay what about this one That goes with the white right What about this one Hmm I d say like what does it have the most of I d say probably white What about this one This one goes for tan This one is this one goes This one goes too This goes with the gray too This one goes to the I think it goes It goes with the white Now let s see I think it s a pretty rock Wait oh That one goes there I know it They all do Wait these go with the green No this one this one is gray It s still got sand in it This one is green and at least it looks a little bit greenish I d say like maybe green too We ll have all yes Okay now this rock Okay Diana Cam and Gaelin What I want you to do is you ll probably how about you just take the rocks Because I can t remember What s going on We re sorting them a different way You re sorting them a different way And what way would that be How did you all decide to sort rocks I thought we d sort them by color and now we re gonna do it by cut Tell me that again because I don t I don t know that part Now since we did the color we re going to do is we re going to do by texture What s texture It s by how it feels Oh well can you teach me Find out the texture from these two rocks I see how it feels And since this one feels very smooth I ll put it by itself Well can I feel it Pretty smooth Pretty smooth Have you felt it Feel it How you think it feels Smooth It does feel pretty smooth And it looks like a piece of meat It looks like a piece a meat Yes Better not eat a rock should I Okay where does this one need to go It needs to go Over here We haven t finished quite yet so Okay And this one is like I ll say pretty rough Pretty rough can I feel this one Oh gosh Whoo Yeah It does feel a little rough It does feel like it s got some sand on it You know a word that I can think of that makes me think of that Rough Rough or gritty You know sand is gritty feeling Well that s kind of gritty It does feel a little rough It can stand up It stands up I m gonna do it put it by itself Okay And we re going to keep on doing it Until all of them are sorted Okay this is a pretty cool rock how does it feel I ll say pretty bumpy kind of rock Pretty bumpy pretty rough Oh this one s very rough So rough I can hardly stand myself Look at the shell on it It does have a shell in it On the other side look On the other side turn it like right here it has another shell It does so what kind of rock would this be A two fossil rock A fossil rock And what kind are they what s it called If it has a fossil imprint in it Fossil If it settled and got a fossil Sedimentary It would be a sedimentary rock Very cool I m so proud of you That was definitely very rough Have you felt it This is What do you think On the back is kind of squishy It is rough Okay you all keep working you re doing a good job I m proud of you Okay Now you can put it with the rough the super rough I think this one is I can tell I say medium a little rough a little smooth This one goes in the middle This one is smooth This is super rough Let me feel Smooth I m gonna put it in the middle because I think Very good Arianna I like the way you One more medium rock than large Because we have eight medium and seven large Because you can see A smooth side and a rough side Because if you add two more together it make 12 Medium is seven and large is eight And I have an idea when you do your rock what about you trace it 
 Yeah I wanna talk to you some more This is cool that s probably how you attract them is start doing this Hey tell me why you think Adam he s able to do this again Because he has these legs like his legs stick to the ground so I think they can do it because they stick to the ground to get the strength then he pulls it up and he does it again Hey that sounds like a connection to what we ve been learning about the structures and the functions Yeah so when it s time to start making those connections I really want you to write that down with your team Just make sure that that gets on your paper Okay I want you writing out how many paper clips is this beetle pulling Two grams Two grams right now mathematician get busy Okay I m gonna keep putting another one on here to make sure Put four on there let s see if he can do it with four Hey little buddy don t don t don t No no no no pull him away What am I doing He s making a sound He s making a sound He s making a hiss He s making a hissing sound You think Why do you think he s hissing Maybe because he thinks we re trying to hurt him Yeah for self defense Yeah alright Let me go check in with some other teams You all keep working on your beetle Okay What s going on at your all s beetle team He s pulling The beetle is pulling two times its weight Two times right now Yeah So how many paper clips is that that he s pulling Two Three three He s pulling three Your beetle s not moving You think it s because of the loudness Yeah Class city class should you be going to other team s beetles I know it s fun and I know it s interesting but should you be going to other team s experiments No ma am You need to be engaged with your team Okay We re trying to Okay Did he pull two He s pulled two and then we re gonna He has pulled two Okay So let s see let s just give him a little nudge in the rear When I put a pencil right here he ll go after it Oh well see if that works do you think I know like earlier he was trying to get out of the bucket Let s see if he can pull it He s doing it He s moving Oh my gosh I see he s moving some but I haven t seen the paper clips move yet that s what we have to wait and see Are the paper clips going to move Wait I have to do my job They re moving They re moving So he just pulled three grams Okay so Did the beetle pull three grams Beth where s your sheet Go ahead help Talk to each other about what s happening Woah you can t hold him you have to leave him on the table Wrecking ball Somebody pick these up I got it You hold him up good teamwork You hold him up You re hurting him you re hurting him There we go now we ve got four paper clips on there Now lets put the paper clips behind him Now Talk to each other Talk to each other I think he s I think he ll be able to pull many many many Right now I think the beetle may be able to pull Eight eight That s how many we have Oh this team over here has eight I might need to go over Woah wait wait wait Get a green Let s see him in action I am noticing that we underestimated our beetles didn t we We underestimated our beetles didn t we Yeah Our beetles may be able to pull more than we anticipated We can do nine Okay Not yet not yet Keep working mathematicians keep track He s going Talk to me team about what s going on He can talk It can pull nine times It pulled eight Its body weight It is pulling nine times its body weight Wow how many paper clips is nine times its body weight Nine grams Nine grams Holy moly Did any of you all predict that this beetle would be able to pull nine grams No we only did all four We only thought four he d pull four We only thought four We only thought four Okay are you all making any connections How in the world is this beetle able to pull nine grams of paper clips Nine times its body weight What do you think Oh now look when it s on the desk is it able to do it No its harder for him to do it on the desk Why can t it do it on the desk I think he might have a better grip on the construction paper What grips better What structure is gripping better on that construction paper Because it has It s because it s got it s got like suction cups and I guess it s not used to the slippery desk It has claws to pull it It s pulling it I think it looks really It s what Abby Even though it s really loud in here its still moving It s still moving even though it s loud in here that s right I think it just wants to go to Justice You think the beetle s trying to go to Justice I don t know about that Are you gonna try a tenth paper clip Yep Yes Look look ten Ten paperclips Let s see He s taking your pencil He s wants to get your pencil Oh why do you think Because it s wood Because he likes wood And what type of animal is the beetle Bess Betsy beetle But what do they do Why do they eat wood They are It s pulling ten Why does the bess beetle eat wood Look at him I don t know if he s pulling ten or not Look at him Because he s a decomposer He is a de He is barely pulling ten He s having to work really really hard Yeah I think it s probably time to stop adding them to the beetle you think I put max Maximum is ten Do you think we can add Class city class if your beetle is struggling and like arching its back and like flipping its legs but it s barely pulling it it may be time for you to give the beetle we don t wanna be mean to the beetle Our max was ten Okay So we re left on thank you for taking them off Alright class city class Yes baby yes Put your eyes on me Oh I m waiting I m waiting Thank you Most of us have come to the point where the beetle is struggling okay And having a hard time pulling the weight At this point if your beetle is struggling it is time to start the summarizer and the connector job Okay so I wanna hear you talking summarizing connecting what has happened Let s give him a rest Yeah let s give him Wait don t pull that Oh my gosh How many is he pulling Seven Okay here I ll bring you some more Where are the rest of your paper clips Right there Get off He s starting pulling Okay oh be nice to my beetle friend I m trying to He keeps on getting his foot stuck to my hand Hi little buddy Oh I almost touched it We learned before that beetles Hang on you re learning that beetles what That beetles are really strong but with their little legs and their thorax maybe Their thorax you think is what makes them really strong Because the thorax it may be the biggest part in their body Yeah it is probably the biggest part What else on their legs what on their legs are helping it Their Look at it I know what it is Their The thing that s sticking to the table and helping it move faster Okay so the sticky part on their feet Here let me do it Yeah okay You all have done a really nice job noticing what structures of this beetle are helping it to be so strong How do you think it uses that in the wild Like out in nature How do you think it uses that It s functional and it almost You may even think it s cool but he could use his wings to fly away Some beetles do have wings to fly away but what do you think is I need you in your seat Nathan what do you think it s using to move Its that s a lot of strength Its abdomen Right okay its abdomen is but in nature What might it use that for It might use it to catch its prey maybe Okay what does it What does it do What does it eat It may eat Casey say it again to your team Organic and it breaks it down It breaks it down What is that called What type of insect would It s a it s a d A d A d A d A D A disposer Not a disposer close A decomposer That s it Not a disposer but a decomposer good And so okay think it s okay Think about if it was trying to dig into the wood of a tree Wouldn t it have to be really strong It can make a hole In the wood of the tree That little thing the little might be to decompose the wood So it can bite and then break down It s really gonna have to be biting harder Yeah that mouth part is really strong to bite Okay so now may I have your attention how many do you have We have 10 You have 10 and it s pulling it let s send him home I want 11 They re moving look at his legs how hard they re trying to pull You might he might be able to pull 11 I m gonna give him one extra No No 12 Okay you all keep working on that you re doing a great job Thank you I wanna come back to my very first team Carrying 10 10 Ours can carry 11 Yeah It did Yeah And he pooped on the paper Okay it pooped Twice It pooped twice Yeah twice Okay let me put this here I don t know where to put it There we go So what are you doing Are you adding 11 We re gonna see our 11 puller You re gonna do 11 What connections can you make The legs are like a crayfish The legs are like a crayfish Yeah How They have joints They re jointed How do you think those joints help that beetle to pull 11 times its body weight The beetle is like a able to grab on Yes so Tim s saying something say it loud It helps it walk It helps it walk but And escape from predators And escape from predators how Because What might it do with those powerful legs What did we notice them doing in their containers They get under the what They get under the rocks and the dirt Like Tim like when he was on the corner Tim was like picking him up and he was holding on to the paper He was holding the paper Tim lift him up Okay Oh yeah it s neat I can make a connection What s your connection If we didn t have jointed legs we couldn t walk up stairs if we didn t have jointed legs If we didn t have jointed legs we couldn t walk upstairs right Is that what you said Coner You re okay You re okay Alright I want you talking to each other Help Halle she s writing down some of your connections Help her team help her Talk to Halle What s another thing The aphid s have pincers and the bess just have Tim s telling you something It has little like claws Hang on Tim s telling you something Listen to Tim The aphids have pincers and the beetle has these things that helps it eat out the wood They look like little They look like pinchers The beetle has a pincher like a crayfish A pincher like a Oh this could pull 11 Good connecting keep connecting 
 So you re saying here why did you pick it why did you pick the two points that you did Okay why Are they random No you just tell me why you think those two What Okay average Okay So I ll come back here in a minute I m gonna tend to this table What okay what is I don t know what I would there Cause they have the what is the all right what is and what is You guys it should say what is the slope okay It should say what is the slope It represents the y intercept Yeah it said what is the That s what I m saying people All right I m just sayin it would Okay three Can I have your attention real quick please All right once you find I see most of you have yours in point slope would you also put it in slope intercept okay Because that ll help you with question number three okay then I ve got through question number three Go head and find your answer and Here we have what is this Linear Okay is that a line No Okay Were you supposed to draw a line through it Okay what does it say down there Okay why you did number five before you did number one it said draw a line through right This is like a not a line okay A line is straight so you wanna draw a line straight through there But before you do that I want you to answer and do one two three and four first Should we erase this Uh yeah but don t worry about it right now I want you to work on finding a what two points did you have Um Okay and why did you get that Because What s easy mean Like one plus one And what kind of slope did you get Oh you haven t done it yet Okay I ll get back to you all right But 72 s What s number two What is the slope What is the slope value What is the slope What is the slope And then I was gonna I actually had started out with what doesn t mean in a situation But when you Y equals one and x yep okay y 1x Now how do we find what s the ordered pair here Okay that s the slope intercept form Oh that s what got em mixed up So what is it though And you don t have point slope What is the ordered pair for y intercept Is that the one where you have parentheses with two n and then another one that s like No that s point slope Okay I just want the y intercept Okay 2 is the y intercept in this equation y mx b Right it s two What did that tell me That s what the y intercept is What does it represent the situation Okay now wait it s Okay is it for two people So is for people Okay now if you were to look at your graph which we haven t done yet And where would negative two cross Though I m not sure that s Now I m also seeing something here about Why do you have a two here Hello So 30 32 I know right Making me erase That s okay So it s three six nine 12 then all this other junk So you can get up there and get 33 Always thinkin Six is six eight is eight I m sorry Three seconds For every how many people For each person three seconds a person Okay no that s person according to your data So it took three seconds to pass from the church right Now what is minus 24 Okay that s a year you have y intercept is negative 24 and it represents Okay I want you to do one graph Okay yeah whatever your Y is starting at By the way this is a They want you to draw a line Okay so what is Time in seconds right Where does the y intercept It crosses x okay It crosses x The y intercept crosses The y intercept crosses y Okay the y intercept crosses the y Okay so y is gonna cross the axes that is talking about what Okay All right It s crossing talking about time okay It s supposed to say what is the slope the slope is wards for s You should move your line so that it follows the dots Okay I m gonna come back here What s the problem Time They re confusing me All right so number three you said the y intercept is six elevenths of a second is that what you re saying Six elevenths seconds Okay and you said that was what Okay All right what were the people doing People were passing books So six elevenths okay means that it took six elevenths were no people What was happening during Each person to pass So was each person passing the book at six elevenths That s how long it took for them to start passing Six elevenths of a second Okay So who passed the first globe I mean who s was that Angela Okay so he did what He had to run around and then to come back And here and turn a person Right He had to leave his desk Okay now is that an average throw Okay what s your average that you re talking about 14 seconds for every 11 men Okay so we might wanna just change that to a decimal okay So just find out how many for one person Just change it to a decimal And you might wanna change six elevenths to a decimal so you can have an actual Okay That s great all right That s okay does everybody understand what Jade was saying I think the reason why she did that was because We had to make a line Okay now Okay that doesn t mean make a line graph Oh Okay Are you Drawing a straight line a straight line Now we just wanna look at what you got here Okay what did you put One One And what does it mean I got 1 27672767 Okay and what does the slope on the line Now don t worry about your line right now just answer these questions What does the slope on the line your slope of one represent in this situation One second per pass Okay all right you re gonna do one second per pass Averaged Per Person One second per person to pass the book Get back right Okay So what does your y intercept represent If it s at zero with no passage that s what the seconds are that s what the point is Okay say that again If there s no passes like the time starts at negative two seconds I guess I don t know how to explain Did you get a negative Yeah Now is that possible No No Okay Why might you have a negative Sometimes it drops Okay but if you have negative time okay can you She d be like oh yeah that was negative three seconds ago Yeah negative no that was three seconds ago but it wasn t so you got a point two right seconds All right Now let s just think about and you said it was what negative two seconds but He wrote people Okay when was there a time when there was zero people I mean in this situation during the book pass When was there zero time Never When it s When okay When they start moving but somebody was moving I think it s zero passes No all right what does your y line represent Time in seconds Time in seconds So the y intercept rounded out that s what Time in seconds right So it s a time when was time when the books were not being passed Somebody had to all right walk over and pick em up and then somebody had to walk over and put them 
 So good morning everyone Good morning Good morning today today what we have is we re going to have a debate based on a couple things that we have recently experienced One was research that we have conducted about the chemistry in scientific measurement that s required in order to address a local issue that we have with current regulations on water and different lobbying groups trying to change those regulations for their own interests and the groups they represent Okay And so we had a field trip to Wastewater Treatment Plant that allowed us to gain information locally from scientists to see what they re doing on their side and what their opinions are for either side of this debate that is current in our city So today I m going to start with our overarching question which has really helped us in our research and is now going to help us to just devise our debates The overarching question is up on the board if you d like to see it It says how is scientific measurement applied in the creation and the regulation of our local environmental protection laws The environmental protection side over here is proposing new tighter regulations that may have an impact on local businesses and rate payers or the people who pay for the water utilities in our city So I ll discuss the format of our debate First and that s again up on the board I will be finishing up my introduction here and then we will have our lobbyist group introduce themselves who they represent and what their major goals are for today s debate Okay Then we ll have a question session where each group will be able to probe into the reasoning and the deeper understandings to reveal your research and each side of the story so that our City Council members on our outer rows back here will be able to reflect upon what is being said So city council members please be writing your notes When we get towards the end of our debate time period we will then have you folks make a debate It s going to be a vote on whether or not we should agree with the environmental side and their decision to make tighter regulations to change current regulations to allow lower levels into the water of various different chemicals that they will be discussing Okay At the end each side will have a one minute opportunity to discuss a focus summary statement in which they will be able to summarize the things that have been revealed during today s debate Good And then as I said at the end we will have a vote City Council will vote on whether we should make the restrictions tighter on the water quality standards in our city Are there any questions before we begin Okay excellent And so I believe the this side had choice and so that means that Corbin and his group for representing industry will be allowed to have that closing the last closing statement today And so we ll start with Tyler and then we ll try to go back as fairly as possible back and forth So Tyler if you d like to start with your opening comments about who you represent and why you re here today Our side of the argument focuses on the environmental side of the debate We believe that new water regulations via legislation that would more effectively treat our drinking water should be enacted The hazardous and deleterious chemicals that are in our water particularly the excesses amounts of nitrogen and phosporous need to be controlled While it may negatively affect the selfish interests of industry our group would like to promote the idea that doing nothing and leaving our water the way it is is not an option Excellent So Corbin we re ready to hear your side and who you represent Our side focuses on the business aspect of this debate We hope to persuade the EPA and City Council to agree that the waste water that we put back into creeks and streams meets the criteria that is currently the standard for cleanliness And that it does not need improvement except for a few chemicals which does not improve nitrogen and phosphorous or that we do not need to severely increase taxes to pay for all of that Outstanding And so and then we will begin I guess then with Tyler who can go ahead now and you can ask your first question And we ll be looking for City Council members If you have any questions that need to be clarified statements that you would like to determine what the reasoning is behind it please raise your hand and we ll make sure that you get in immediately Okay This is so funny Okay we figure that since you say that our waters don t really need to be it already meets the standards of cleanliness but already in Colorado we see fresh water species that are becoming more endangered as the more chemicals because of the pollution that is put into our waters via industries like metals and dentistry have already become endangered and extinct and we just would like to know why you think that that means that the water s clean enough Okay let me ask you this Do you have information on what chemicals killed those fish We have like the excess amounts of nitrogen and phosphorous that the EPA the standards that they re trying to enforce now Like we saw on the video this creates the dead zones because it removes oxygen and the algae algae blooms start to produce So it s mostly the nitrogen phosphate that s preventing the correct amount of oxygen in the water for the fish to breathe technically Okay I d like to follow this up with an article from I believe this is from the Gazette which is our Colorado Springs newspaper Since we re focusing this debate on Colorado most likely our city we see that our city does not have a problem with algae blooms says the writer of this article So therefore when you talk about algae blooms we don t have a problem with this So why should we be focusing on it Because the water runs off the lakes That does cause a problem with us Okay But even if we did have I mean a few Like I said again our city does not have problems with these So we can t therefore we can t focus our debate on these things because it doesn t apply to us Well that one article in a local newspaper from one writer said that we don t have problems with algae blooms But I ve been in the mountains around our area and I ve seen many lakes ponds just completely covered with algae and scum And that so many of our local creeks Monument Valley Park and stuff are just littered with gross algae and it creates these dead zones that the fish swim into and do not have any way to swim out of because they have no nutrients in them and just die on the spot And the same thing happened in the 1960s with Lake Erie and it later happened with Chesapeake Bay like we saw in the video And the same thing was happening where they said we don t need to fix it everything s fine and then just as nothing nobody did anything The lake soon was dead and it was like there s no fish in there And the water s just completely ruined with all kinds of chemical wastes so doing nothing isn t really Okay so I m gonna interject What I m hearing is that there s a debate in here about whether or not our local water is an issue so I d like to hear from somebody in the City Council area who will be making a vote today How about your thoughts about the current water quality What you have heard from your constituents in the areas where you are located and to determine whether or not you feel currently right now what level of danger are we at Have you heard a lot about this Do you feel like we are in need of serious change So we can direct the rest of the debate Okay Anybody who would like to contribute Okay Stephan Well all I know is that where we re located we re at the we re pretty much the first people that use our water and then it goes downstream for other people to use it so so when we were talking about eliminating the pollution the pollutants that we put into the water it s not it wouldn t be really affecting our city but the cities that are down the stream from us Okay but this article says that our excuse me I think I read this wrong our state does not have a problem with algae blooms Regardless of the algae problem it says without the oxygen the fish bugs and other organisms that live in the water will die and quoting from the same article it says in the worst case scenario you basically have water devoid of all natural aquatic life But that s a worst case scenario that we don t have right now and we haven t had and it s not an issue in Colorado Granted it might be an issue in like Chesapeake Bay or Lake Erie But we don t have it here it says so And multiple scientists have backed that article as well Now Corbin do you have any measurements or do you have some values that you can back that up with Not specifically on nitrogen and phosphorous I tried to find some but I found So does anybody have any of that information because we want to know how close to danger are we Do we know about current levels or about where we want to go with this Okay I would like to comment on I m sorry behind you I just called on her Oh excuse me So even if it s probable wouldn t you want to prevent it from like happening here with the algae Well if it s not happening already then what do you have to do to keep it from happening Yeah if it happened but it hasn t happened yet Yeah but what she s saying is it might happen Yeah I mean just saying that something might happen is just like saying something awful might I mean I could say that you know an earthquake might kill everyone tomorrow It might happen We don t know if it s going to happen But fish and other organisms are dying It is happening It s not necessarily just the algae but it s the future problem We ve already seen issues with the Yeah let s see what Nina has to say as far as City Council Well I just have a question wouldn t it be better to be safe than sorry _ You re right it would be better to be safe than sorry but like I said the levels of toxins in the water right now do meet the EPA required standards So therefore it is a safe level according to the scientists who work for the EPA But we re saying that the EPA standards need to be improved Yes yes we realize that Because they re not they re too low and there are many chemicals that are new because of new industry in metal companies and many other things that are dumping into streams And those chemicals are getting through How would you go about doing this How would you go about stopping the pollution Because something that s important to remember here is the fact that the pollution is not only caused by industry it s something that s misconcepted is for example cars People think cars pollute the air and it exactly does pollute the air But when it goes up and it becomes acid rain and it falls back into our creeks it s also a pollutant Therefore industry s not the only people who are polluting the lakes It s actually U S citizens doing the same work too Okay I like that And so can you be more specific Did anybody gain anything on the fieldtrip about learning about which types of things the citizens in our area are putting down their drains Yes That may cause issues Yes Okay I ve got a whole bunch of them Alright Corbin why don t you share then what it is You want me to read all of them or just So we re not focusing just on one group There may be other groups as well but also maybe it could be addressed as a result of this debate Go ahead Corbin Well the guy that we had giving us the tour of the wastewater facility did make some funny comments that he s found some pretty ridiculous things in the water treatment plants Some of those examples were railroad ties dentures and he found a live person inside of them one time So it s not like the waste treatment plant is purposely putting all this out there It s you can t stop humans from putting out waste and a lot of the stuff that they re putting in there that they re actually reducing the levels to parts per a billion or parts per a trillion which some of the machines there do do are poisonous things like fluoride Which actually the highest water treatment plant that puts out the most fluoride is actually Mason which is right up there and lead and mercury And it eliminates that from parts to a billion from parts to a trillion Well first of all I would like to answer Mr Dunmar s question or Mr Waz question I m sorry We do have information on how much nitrogen is required in the water and it s 10 parts per million So that s just to answer that question and then to move on to yours Yes of course as you said in your own words you can t stop people from the pollution that they do cause However it is the job of the water treatment plants to kind of remove that pollution and to produce a safe environment And when we don t have strict enough regulations this environment is endangered for not only for people but for also the wildlife for the economy for you know natural systems that occur within Colorado It s all you re putting it all on the line Okay let s talk about what would happen if we did restrict pollutants that go into the water Okay Well let s talk about the costs that everybody s the citizens are going to be paying that they said that all our state is going to be paying Before you talk about cost would you rather pay more and be safe or pay less and risk dying Okay I would like to comment on that That s an asinine statement because do you have a statistic on how many people have died from water pollution I do have a statement from the Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Ki moon says More people die from unsafe water than from all forms of violence including war You just said from the United Nations Yeah this isn t yes we re talking about a local issue now but that is a statement that proves that Okay I would like to comment on this once more when you said United Nations that s Okay I m sorry We re going to have to go to hand raising I believe because we re getting too fast of an answer before someone gets a chance to finish So Theo finish up and then Corbin will follow behind you No I made my point Okay Well like you said you do realize that s a local issue but the U N is United Nations of the world So that s not a local issue You re bringing up a fact that s from countries like Africa that don t have clean water at all nonetheless water So of course they re going to die from water poisoning but here in the United States we have the cleanest water in the world no matter where it is And Colorado also has one of the cleanest state populations of water if you will out of all the states Yeah because of the regulations we have in place and with the new chemicals that are being put into our water we need to restrict our regulations What are the new chemicals Yeah they ve been there for awhile We re having new problems though Can you explain it Everything such as nitrogen and phosphorous It hasn t been an issue before Why is it an issue now It has been an issue It absolutely has It has happened all over the United States Okay when we talk about nitrogen we re talking about if we restrict that we re talking about maybe shutting down part of what we do here As we all know that we are we do grow many crops in our state And nitrogen mostly where it comes from is fertilizers used in that industry So to say that we re going to restrict nitrogen would be we might have to restrict or shut down some industries that do produce food Such as what What industries For fertilizers Fertilizers You can t use fertilizers on your lawn because if you have And not even lawn crops Crops lawns anything because the fertilizer you use goes down drains which go into creeks which is really polluting it more than the wastewater facility was So shouldn t the wastewater facility pollute it less since we already have natural pollution coming from these facilities We re already doing so much to prevent these chemicals from going into Okay so Will I hear you re saying that we re doing a lot What was learned on the field trip Specifically what role do the scientists play who are employed by our city What role do they play at the wastewater treatment plant And how does that affect your group s goals for today s debate What are the scientists doing specifically and how does it support your side Like they said on the fieldtrip they use bacteria E coli to break down the wastewater that s in the water It s not like they re adding pollutions to it Their job is to take it out which they are trying to do By doing that they add some phosphorous and nitrates that are just byproducts of it but they remove a lot of those afterwards It s not like to clean it 100 it s going to cost 25 billion dollars and that s just for the state of Colorado Okay let s see a City Council members I m trying to get to them quickly I m sorry Amanda behind you Stephan Where did you get that information that it would cost 25 billion dollars This is from the Gazettte The Gazette article It s from the article Science has proven that to remove nitrogen and phosphorous from the water which is you guys s goal to restrict it it s going to cost about 25 billion dollars to remove it all If you just want to do parts of it it s still going to be 2 46 billion dollars Which is four times the amount of what it is costing right now to remove the things from the water Wouldn t that be better tough than having to fix up a completely good stream that destroys the economy Well I actually on the fieldtrip I asked several of the chemists that work there whether the pollutants that we put into Fountain Creek and what we re doing for the environment and they said the water they put back into Fountain Creek is the water they get out of it It s cleaner than that Yeah So in my opinion that statement is totally absurd We re putting cleaner water for nature and nature seems to enjoy it more as I asked the chemist as well And farmers down stream also enjoy that water to water their crops and it helps their crops grow more than Fountain Creek s streams already Excellent point Corbin Why don t we try Alexis and see what she has to say I have a question as to how the water pollutants destroy the economy You can say a lot about the economy What do you mean by water pollutants destroying the economy Well you say that 
 Do not put any button caps in the center of the ridge Put them right on the bottom edge on each side of that felt Do I get a lot now You get what You can t do anything down here You need to help him roll that out He s going to need help right there You can put one in one side and then pull it down through there One right there When in doubt put a button If you re wondering if it should be in there it should be We re a little far apart right here You definitely need to put one right here So it s under Reach down right here and put one in This back end going to um Wrinkle Before you put a nail there Can I nail the top part of this Yes absolutely Because if I Your feet need to be on a button regardless on which side you re on you need to be on the button Please nail that one right behind you This sun coming out like this makes this felt Hot Hot and soft and it ll tear easily Now this is 30 pound felt it s not 15 pound felt So it s a lot thicker than what you got two common kinds you re going to be putting on Okay Okay how are we doing over here If you lay it up there the top won t fly down That s right That s good Communicate Communicate with each other right there Did that work out work for you Yeah Stand this way How many rinds do we need You got your left rind Now we need our interval going up to the roof Tell us what it is What you need to do on a three tab How far what is our interval here Remember Can you remember What is it Speak up Five Five Five inches okay Don t be scared You know it You shout it right out Five inches Five inches up Every five inches Be sure to measure from the top of the seam Don t measure from here It s got to be from right here Measure up five 10 15 20 Just go ahead and mark it up you re roof Get your layout there and your layout there Double check each other Check behind each other If the layout s not right and we have to tear shingles back off are those shingles any good No What No sir They re not any good Let s make sure we double check behind each other and get the layout correct Remember Team work just like on the job Anybody can make a mistake You have a couple of eyes on it Checking behind that s a lot better You can mark on this side It s not going to hurt a thing You can put a bigger mark on there so you can see it Alright Something like that Okay You can see that That s not small and tiny That s big Look at the difference right here Enrique My marks and your marks right here You can especially I mean this is relatively new felt This felt gets marked up and scratched up If you put a large crow foot mark on here you re going to know exactly where to hold that thing Make sure that you get it where you can see it We re going to cover this stuff right back up Now watch this felt as I pull this up and down See those bubbles in it Right here I got the bubbles at the top that means I gotta pull it down to get those out You want this stuff laying flat If it doesn t it ll probably show up underneath the machinery If I pull it down too far it pulls a wrinkle in the bottom So you want to make sure you get it straight and get all the wrinkles out of it I ve got them out and I m just a little bit below my line right here but that s okay It s more important that this is out right here that it s on Does that make sense Yeah So just make sure Now you want to come out here at this point and get you one right here Don t forget our nailing pattern that we discussed Here here here here and here You can feel right here where the plywood is You want to put a button right here and your nail line is going to be right in here on this You don t want to nail into the fascia board You want to come right across in here and put them every six inches And about every two feet right here and one occasionally Be careful not to step on the felt Step on the buttons so you don t end up sliding Just be careful anytime that you re stepping on felt You never want to step on loose felt Okay All right Go ahead and nail that off This one right here See how you re doing this shingle Yeah We re gonna come back with a starter right here turned upside down This right here is gonna have to be cut off So go ahead and just cut this off even that ll be fine right now This one over here don t nail that yet Hold on just a second Come here a minute You can do it that way That s one way that you can run it down and cut it or right here I can just take this soldier just like this and I can cut it off right here Or I can just lap it up there and nail it like it is The other soldier is coming down to right here So just come up here and cut this off Got your hook weight on you Yeah Take and cut one tab off of the shingle flush it up and nail it on and then go ahead and start your starter tabs up there It doesn t have to be straight right I just cut it Pardon Does it have to be straight Just eyeball it No it doesn t have to be perfectly straight just go ahead and hook your hook blade right here and pull it straight back That ll be fine Hold it down There you go Never cut back on your handle These right here we ll be able to use for the caps on top so don t throw these away Tabs always go in on these So make sure your tab s in flush it up and nail it off Once you ve done this you need to pull a layout and in the classroom we talked about layout on three tab shingles If we re gonna go off the end of the building what are we gonna pull Thirty 36 We re gonna pull 36 inches and we re gonna pull 30 inches Top and bottom topping your lines All right Does that make sense Yeah Okay so do that Once you nail this off do that and then run your starters You can go ahead and cut that off The inches right here you can go ahead and cut them come right here and cut it off right here on the edge of the plywood and then that will have you ready to put your shingles on in a minute You got a hook blade Y all have it You go ahead and do that then you can do the other side right here Go ahead and get your lines snapped put them on there and mark it and pop your lines Either way You can do it either way it doesn t matter but since we re gonna go ahead and start these they need to be on the 30x36 way out anyway Flush it up and hang it Don t pull that down If you do that s just gonna take and break that shingle off This right here is establishing the overhang that we wanted that inch and a quarter off the edge of the building so we want our finished shingles to come right here also When you pull your 30x36 for your layout on your three tab you want to go all the way to the edge of the soldier joist Go ahead and mark that at the top You need to keep them moving you gotta have it marked up there Go ahead and mark it up there and mark it right here Get these popped and then you can go ahead and get Darius to get you a shingle and have it ready to go and y all will be ready to put these things on Put your starter on it Here Thirty and 36 It s raining buttons See that button landed right there Y all make sure that you pick these things up when you re done You should be able to reach right here and nail this plywood on without any problem Once they get right here you can t nail it move down the line Hammering Talk to him what do you want him to do Put a nail right there There you go Brandon is telling you right Y all hold on a minute What does putting a nail right there do I mean you re about to put it right there It holds it center because that way no bubbles or nothing comes up It s gonna hold it right Keeps it straight So really you can start putting buttons from down there to here it s not going to affect anything Because he s got that button in From this point on we can t put any more buttons in it until he gets it where he wants it down here He nails it off Right but you could nail this Go ahead and start doing that Working together as a group to get the job done is what it s all about This is not a one man job you can t roll this stuff out and do it by yourself It s not a one person job If you want to mark that and pull that up to where you can get to it there s nothing wrong with doing that What you don t want to do is put your foot on that felt right in there Watch about cutting back towards your hand like that Just be real careful There ya go Mike put your hand on that roll for him I got it That may not be enough to cap that ridge off So we can roll it as far down as it will go and piece it if we need to You need a button in it now He needs help Help him right here Yes sir Where at Hold on come on the line right there Yeah come on right here Is that on right Yeah next put the felt right here As far as starting this next row you got a line on Thirty six inches You got a line on 36 inches and you ve got a line on 30 inches We want to make sure that when you start this next run that you re not breaking Let me see a shingle right here I want you to watch I ve worked on several houses the whole boxing fascia boards and all this is rotten on the house The reason for that was this right here They put their starter on like you re supposed to to allow for the throats of the shingles We have no water penetration down here But once you start this starter tabs up over to your 36 inch line if I laid this 36 inch shingle down and nail it off I have a straight avenue of water to get down to this felt This felt will only hold for so long It s going to get down here it will rot it out and there you re gonna be So you wanna make sure that you start this on your 30 inch line and then give me one more shingle Then when you butt this shingle up to this one now what I have is I got my break right here in the center of the full tab and I m six inches away from it That s why our nailing pattern here is important You want to nail above every throat in the far line slightly above in a three tab shingle Four nails 1 2 3 4 Just like we discussed on the PowerPoint Above the tar line Pardon Above the tar line I can t hear you Above the tar line It can be in or slightly above Most people are gonna put them in them or slightly above them Your video PowerPoint was slightly above but the main important thing here is that you have it to where If you put them in random if I put one right here or in the middle of these two I could possibly have a nail where I got a shingle breaking Or I could possibly have a nail in line with a throat that s gonna line up on top of the next one It s important to go here here here and here The purpose of this tar line is when this sun heats it and it heats up you have the next shingle on top of here it helps secure it down so wind don t take and blow it up and rip the shingle off So it melts down It ll actually seal and melt down to it All right you re doing good but go ahead and make sure that you do this with this hot sun out here today you will wanna keep these cut So use a shingle to square it up or your speed square Mark your line and cut it straight down right here You can nail it on first that will be fine Or you can go ahead and cut it before you nail it You see this shingle right here that s got the little slit in it That is exactly six inches is what that is So you can take this shingle right here Put your speed square up here take your hook blade and follow along it and cut that off Then you can nail it on if you wanted to do that Either way there s multiple different ways to do it The main thing is don t just take this put it on the 30 inch line nail it down and don t do anything else to it until you get up there Y all do it as you go These hot days like this cool that down and it won t get it s form back It ll look bad So we want to keep it looking good All right how we doing Good Good What about right here You need to put it along the edge if you don t follow along the edge There s three buttons if you started one at the top one at the bottom What s missing One in between so let s get them in there Jake you mind getting that one Is that going to be enough to roll all this If not we ll get another roll and finish it out Just go ahead and run with what you got That ll be okay that will lay down beneath Be careful about the top edge of that felt Run that y all can stand on this Get a couple more buttons in between here we re a little far apart right here I like to see two foot Go ahead and hop up here and stand on a button Get you a couple more in the middle and then cap that off Lay it right down the center 
 Okay so what we re doing is you guys are trying to figure out which one of these invisible tapes yeah is the best So the first thing you gotta do is come up with a nice question for your problem that you want to solve Sharonda you wanna share what you ve come up with Which tape is the strongest Which tape is the strongest okay Now see that s good because you don t like We were discussing earlier you don t wanna say which tape is the best because you really don t know what does the best mean Strongest stickiest longest lasting but I like it which one s the strongest Do you ladies have any ideas I said it was Scotch Well we were gonna hang the same amount of tape up the edge of the table and stick a marble to the other side and see how long it holds the marble for and that s how you can determine which one is the strongest Okay so y all have marbles I have You got some marbles that sounds fine So you re gonna do a sort of a time test which one can last longest okay That might work You might wanna do a little test run tomorrow because if it s something where their gonna sit there the tape s gonna sit there with a marble on it for be able to get that done So you might wanna think about maybe adding marbles to see which one can hold the most or do something to the tape to make it drop the marble I don t know what that might be We re gonna come up with some more creative ideas I was gonna maybe cut like like this tape is cut halfway into it to see how long it will hold with the marble on it Oh once it s been cut Yeah That would be good okay But and again you have to make sure that you cut each tape the same distance You gotta be fair So what about give me a passionate sample hypothesis that y all came up with If the Scotch tape is the strongest then the marble will stay on it longer If the Scotch tape is the strongest then the marble will stick to it longer So in your hypothesis you re mentioning the type of tape and you re mentioning what you re measuring Okay I m having trouble finding the group control experimental manipulator Okay remember think about your variables think about the especially for your manipulated variable what you re changing between the groups The tape Yeah the types of tape I understand Okay I ll come back and we ll discuss the other ones Alright guys Josh Sir since y all have already been working a little bit give me a sample question what you re problem is the question that you guys came up with Our problem it was which paper towel sucks up more water Okay so you Absorbs more water Absorbs more water or sucks up that s fine We re just nice and simple it means the same thing So you guys are going straight for absorbency Yes sir What about a hypothesis Darren If Brawny Bounty and a name brand paper towel are tested then Brawny will absorb the most water Nice and simple nice and simple See you mentioned all the different brands right in the beginning and then you picked one and said exactly what it would do better absorb the most water Okay perfect Now have you got any idea how you re gonna test the absorbency Any ideas about your procedure what kind of method are you gonna follow to figure out which one absorbs the most water We re gonna use water What do you need with water Like water we need water We need water yeah We need water but how are you gonna use the water to test it First we ll get a measurement of how much water we have in a container And then we ll put the towel in the container and see how well it sucks up the water To see if the level drops and we ll measure it from there So you re saying put a known amount of water in some kind of container and we ve got tons of beakers we can use Then put the paper towel in there take it out How long you gonna let it sit in there Like a minute Well you gotta know You gotta come up with the time and it s gotta be right on Cause you don t wanna leave Bounty in there for 10 seconds but Brawny for 40 seconds That s not fair You ve gotta keep it equal But that s the kind of stuff you ve got to think about You ve got to be detailed Alright and then you re gonna measure what liquid is left in the container Yes You can do that Yeah that ll work okay nice and simple So whichever one leaves the least amount of water behind should be the best as far as absorbency Yes Okay For our procedure we re trying to think and like maybe you could put like three of the same stains on one sock and then test it without one You definitely need to use the same stain You don t wanna have Zout going against coffee and Clorox fighting mud That s definitely a good idea so what kind of stains might you use We ll use what kind of we got We can use food coloring Yeah food coloring I actually have some food coloring Or we could use I got some barbecue sauce Barbecue sauce As long as you do not eat it during the lab That s fine I like that Because that s more natural I mean Ketchup And that s already measured for you like in packets that may not be a bad idea Or mustard Maybe yeah now if you re gonna do those kind of liquids we ll have to find a way to measure it We can use hot sauce Or hot sauce Okay that works that is more liquidy that might actually work Because we can pour it out we can use pipes or you can use pipets or beakers or something to measure it out so that each sock gets the same amount You don t wanna again don t wanna put twice as much hot sauce for this to fight than this one that s not fair Yes sir Okay what kind of hypothesis Our hypothesis was if we test all three samples Test all three and then I believe that the Clorox will remove the stain faster So you re picking Clorox why d you pick that Because the Clorox is sponsored by more by more varieties of stain removers and they beat So in other words you ve seen commercials about it Yes sir So you re taking what you know inferences like we talked about talking about what you know and making a prediction This one seems familiar have you heard of Zout No sir Okay most people say they haven t I don t know why I picked the same one because that s the only one I d heard of And the reason why we said Instead of using a marble which I forgot at home and we used weights but they were way too heavy So we put a glue stick on a piece of each tape that was about 10 centimeters long and we made a cut in it that was one centimeter because one half centimeter was too steep or thick And then we recorded it and we found that the first one that dropped was this one which was a second it didn t hold on at all And then this one was 17 seconds and then Scotch proving to be the strongest dropped at 79 seconds 79 seconds alright cool So what does that data then tell you Sharonda You said when you collected it what are you looking at what you found out with your data What does it prove That the Scotch tape is better And it s not even close So I like how you guys have chosen to use a bar graph because I can just look at it I can just look at it and go wow look at that The bar is up so huge compared to the other two Okay so it s very easy to distinguish which one did the best Okay Did you find maybe ladies that you had any kind of error Well yeah the first time I cut into the tape I cut too deep like twice Cut too deep Yea and then we found out the weights just tore right away They were way too heavy They wouldn t even hold on when I let go So you re very careful about making it drop Yeah Alright cool Okay so what kind of data are you collecting Mark I mean what kind of data are you guys trying to put together We trying to figure our which one is stronger which one would last the longest Right now we re seeing which one lasts the longest for how many times we rinse it This is the first time we re rinsing it and then we re trying to wipe it up again Okay and this is still the This is still corn syrup Still the corn syrup Okay cool alright that ll work So how are you gonna organize this I ll chart a graph and we re gonna see how which one tears first on which rinse So you re just going straight up by the numbers before it rips Kind of simple so that gives you that generates you some numbers to use okay Alright Michael did you guys I know you re still kind of in the middle of collecting your data Anything you see that can be done better something maybe you made an error with Something that seems to not be working like you expected Dropping this one Okay That was one That was one alright anything else Maybe that you re noticing with your anything that you re noticing with your procedure that you could to make it This guy could help out a little bit more We could ve put this stuff in a little beaker thing would ve made it easier Put what in the beaker Our solutions and stuff so we could ve put it in there That way we have an exact measurement That s true okay so what what you re saying is that your experiment may have some errors because you don t really know what s left We got measurments but we don t have exact measurements So you think it would ve been better to do that if you were to do it again that s what you might do Okay alright cool Carry on Okay hi Jeff and Keosha Alright so you re right in the middle of collecting your data Do you have a have you come up with a data table yet Designed how you want it to look Not yet how do you think you want to You gotta make it organized when you put your data in How you gonna write it down Any ideas What about a graph Well you re definitely gonna have a graph too But you also need a data table to record it now that you re starting to get some results I don t know to do that like Okay well we ll just think about it then make something up What do you think will be the easiest way to organize Okay let s do this what results are you looking for The best thing stain cleaner Okay based on what I mean what are you using as your rule to say that they clean the best Color change or Yeah Okay How much it took off How much it took off how are you gonna measure how much it took off By by the color Or do we need to use something I don t know this is up to you guys This is your experiment What do you mean by the color Like how dark it went to light From darkest to lightest Okay you do that I mean you could compare it side by side That s a good way like a scale sure You got any other ideas You could do that Alright so let s just say you went straight up we re gonna compare the original color to the new color How can you organize that into a data table What kind of information would you need to put in there The color Yeah the color change Okay so the color changed You definitely have to have the brands you ve gotta know which one did what So how are you gonna write down the color change How could you organize that into a chart That s hard I know I know I think you already told me the answer What would you say you were looking for what did you say you were looking for The color change How were you gonna compare it From darkest to lightest From darkest to lightest okay So isn t this sorta like before and after So maybe you can have a somewhere in your data table a column or a row where you re talking about what the color is before describing it So it s gonna be what kind of data since you re describing it What kind of graph should we use We ll get to that in a second So what kind of data is that where you re just writing down like descriptions and colors That s what we ve been working on We re not using numbers Well we ll get to the graph in a second You know what kind of data it was where we collect descriptions and colors and words It s right there Say it It s You ve got a Quantitative Well that s numbers Qualitative Qualitative so that s what you re doing Now how you gonna put that in a graph From the darker shade to the lighter shade right Decide what goes where Okay that sounds good to me What kind of graph I don t know If you re trying to compare and contrast these Double bar graph Sure That would probably work Okay here so you guys have been working on which paper towel absorbs the most liquid I see y all have a data table that nice and simple Record how much water they Absorb Absorb how much water they absorb And what kind of conclusion Ms Goodwin could you draw for your data For my data I drew that Southern Homes had absorbed the most water And then Brawny absorbed the next absorbed the next most And then it was Bounty was the last Bounty came in last but only barely Only by one So Josh Yes Based on the results that your group got how would you how would that change your thinking In other words how might that change your shopping habits if you had these to choose from Well I would pick Southern Homes more than any of the other brands because it absorbs more And isn t that what it s supposed to do Yeah Okay So Darren looking back at y all s procedure looking back at your entire lab is there anything that maybe if your were to redo this lab right is there something you might would change about it to make it better or more accurate Yes I would use different measurements of water like three of them Three Yes You mean like repeated Like maybe for each paper towel do it three times Yes Okay alright that s actually a pretty good idea because when you do those extra trials it helps to eliminate mistakes Because you could ve found out with these two being so close if you would ve had time to be able to do it two more times you could have found that maybe on average Bounty ended up beating Brawny or vice versa you never know Okay Mia What about what about your hypothesis was it right Did you pick the correct one No I picked Brawny Brawny okay so what kind of new hypothesis based on this Let s say that you guys came up with a whole new idea that was different from what you did this test Like another whole procedure like Darren was saying do it multiple times maybe it s completely different What kind of new hypothesis would you make if you were gonna do a similar experiment with a twist to it I would pick Southern Home Just because it won this one Yeah Okay so based on your results you might choose the same one Anybody think they would choose a different one I d still stay with the same one Which was which one Brawny Why would you still pick Brawny Because it was close it wasn t it was like it wasn t that close but if we would ve made like more if we had tested it more then it would ve probably stayed And so do you think it s possible It is possible that if you did a completely different test than just seeing which one sucked up water maybe if you tested strength Brawny could have won that one Yes I know it could Okay cool I like how y all did the lab it was nice and simple And other then Darren s error did you see anything that anything else you would do differently Anything else that you feel that you could have done better other than just maybe doing it extra times Test to see like how thick it is Test the thickness of the paper towel Yes Are you straight So in other words have a second type of test Okay sure I ll probably change the temperature of the water Change the temperature of it Yeah Oh that s true So you have to add in different variables because maybe one of them works better under Heat or lasts better under higher heat okay Cool awesome Tim It s okay Tim doesn t have to be over here So let s see what kind of chart you have Now explain this chart to me Deontay because all I m seeing is check marks I did mine I just did something simple Okay that s fine I put my name right there and I put if it left a light stain I left a check mark and if it left a dark stain I meant stain I put a check mark Okay so I see some of y all are still working on your graphs and how you wanna display them Alright So why did you choose a bar graph So we can do like the levels of the stains we got like medium Medium Light and dark Let me see So you saying you re doing you re going kind of like a qualitative data light medium dark and you re just sort of shading up to the level you think that it had Okay how could you do that better What might be a more reliable way to gather data I mean the color change is okay I mean the color change is fine because that s what you re looking for right When you buy a stain remover you wanna see that it takes the stain out What might be some more reliable data you could gather if you were to do this differently for the future You need to come up with a creative way to get better data or more data maybe The more data we can get is by looking through the sock up under the sock to see how dark the color went through Okay so compare the levels and how much stain was pushed through the sock Yes sir Alright that ll work What else Or we can tell by if it s a light if it s a ring around a light spot then we can tell if it cleared and if it clears some color off of it So you re talking about maybe the shape of the stain or Yes sir the shape of the stain Okay possibly And if it s a ring around it like this one right here if it s a ring around it it s a light spot and we can tell it isn t t clean enough Alright so how about this Whose opinions did you use to get these scales I used my own for mine Okay Cause they think that one was the best and I think this one was the best So what might be think about this what might be a better way a more reliable way to get more data than just your opinions Ask other people s opinions Ask other people Again if you were to redo it do you think it would be a better idea to maybe ask some other people Yes Like going around the class asking what they think Getting a vote Like a vote like a survey Yeah a survey Or a vote okay Alright last thing Now that you ve finished it what kind of problems did you see Is there something that okay if I did this again I know we could ve had some error during this point like we could ve made a mistake here We saw that if we woulda let the colors and the stain remover sit a little longer that it wouldn t have come out 
 Spanish and you would know if I mean you would know what they re saying because you learn English and you talk you learn English and you know how to talk Spanish I agree with you because like because like if they when you said that they had to read write and speak English like they put something that they put something that s English on your paper you d probably understand it more so that s why I agree with you But when they fill out the application what if the application didn t Well The application is about like where you re from why are you coming here for like they want to know a lot of information about you I think we should I think we should keep it at one because if you fill out the application you ll know more about people and their birthday and stuff like and then they usually bring them a present Okay so it s important to know about somebody Now the citizenship board might not go to their birthday party but it is important to know when their birthday is right Okay what were you saying Ariel I think he must fill out an application because I think you should fill out an application so you can so if you come to America you can If you come to America they ll know when your birthday where did you come from and stuff Yeah it s important to have that information Why do you think we need to know where they came from Because I think they wanted to know where they came from because like if they came from a bad city and they want to come to like a good city and A city or a country A country A country okay If they came from a bad country and they wanted to join a good country then you want to see like they want to see like if they got like If they were bad like where they came from that would be yeah they d have to know that I think I would be because like when they like different countries have different holidays so when they be out like they be out celebrating then nobody won t think nothing s wrong with it because they re celebrating and they don t know that on this day that s when they re celebrating their country I didn t even think about that We need to know about their culture so that we can let them celebrate That s important too Great conversation So we re gonna keep that one or get rid of it We re gonna keep it Okay So let s move onto the next step and see what you think about the next one That you have to live in the US United States for five years I don t believe that you have to live in the United States for five years because like if you re like I m five years if you re married you re going to have to live for three years but then like the reason why you should live in it five years because like you could get used to the country and everything that s what I think I think that you should live in America for five years if you come from somewhere else because like some people they come here and they see that they don t like it and they try to move back to where they came from and when they try to move back somebody already took their house or something and if they go they ain t gonna have no money to come back because they re just gonna be outside homeless I think there will be some changes to live in the US Two years because if you re real old if you re old then they say that you might die in a couple years then if you re staying here if you have to stay here to become a citizen for five years then it takes longer then you wouldn t get the chances to make choices before you die I think you should change you have to live in the US United States for five years because what if if the house is dirty and it s not clean Like if it s like the tub still got stains in it Explain that a little bit more to me So you said that you would change it to how many years To one year To one year becase if you got in a house that was dirty you might want to do what If the walls was still had stains on it Well what would you want to do then Move Okay where would you move Still in the United States or back to your country Still in the United States Okay so you would still be there so would you want to just stay even though you move from place to place I will Do you think you would change the number of years they re gonna be in the United States or just not make them stay in the same place Not make them stay in the same place Okay so we need to make sure that Ariel knows do we have to stay in the same place for all five years No not really No okay I think that if they I think that they should give them at least one year to figure out if they want to stay in that home or go back to where they used to live So I mean if they don t like it on the first day so they won t have to go back again come back to see or come back somebody else at your house At your old house I disagree with you and I agree with you The reason why I disagree with you because they said still living three years just like if you re married and I agree with you because like when you said that they come from the first place I mean the first day they may not like it and they could probably go back where they came from that s why I disagree and agree with you Okay I think we should change it so if they look at their choice to go back to their home country for like two months because then they ll miss their family members then like when a couple days in their country and nobody was doing it in America then they could just go back to their country for like a month or something So maybe you guys need to discuss how many years they should stay here in America and maybe if they could how long they could go to visit their relatives in other countries Although I think those are all good things to keep discussing So maybe make that decision on how many years and then move onto the next one and I ll come back and see you Here but you you trying to become a citizen here but you like want to like you re trying to vote like say if you lived in Germany you re trying to go back to Germany You can t that s not being loyal to the US because you re trying to become a citizen to the US and you re trying to go back if you was living in Germany you re trying to go back to Germany What do you think guys Well because they have to want to say that A if you don t then they won t have to send you back because you have to be community and jobs so they can get you jobs and what to do and I think that we should keep the rule because say if your old country got in a war you would say you tried to take up them and you re already trying to become a citizen of the USA and you take up for your old country that makes you not become a citizen That don t mean if you re born in your like regular country that don t mean like you can go back go back and forth and take up for them and then when we re having a war you want to take up for us you can t do that You can t like if you grew up in Germany you can t take up for Germany because you e trying to be a citizen in the US now You can t take up for Germany even though you were born there You got to take up for the US Do you think that s hard for someone who came to the United States to forget about their old country Woudl that be difficult Yeah In my opinion I think that d be difficullt because like with me I can make a connection because when I went when I had when I used to live with my grandma me and my momma we used to live with my grandma and I couldn t forget about the things that I did at my grandma s house so my grandma and my cousins but we still were around but I couldn t stop I couldn t forget about what the fun things that we did Yeah So what should we put here Well I think we should keep it because like you can t go back to your like regular country to do like like you can t fight for the army the army they re trying to stay here to protect us and you re already trying to become a citizen for the US You can t like go back to Germany Then we should keep that because then so we should learn how to be nice I don t know Like we could put so that if like you grew up in Germany you can t fight for Germany So we re gonna put that Okay You have to be true to the US Be true to the US How about the next one that says Have good moral character Is that one that you would keep or get rid of Get rid of In my opinion I d get rid of that because people like that s like that s like having like you gotta be like nice to people Some people they can t take it Like they can t take that they can t like people like I can make a connection because my cousin she got like ups and downs because when people they just like irritate her and they be aggravating her she can t take it no more she just like she just gotta get mad and stuff Like people they can t take having a moral character Like my cousin she can t do that because people they be like bullying her and stuff and she can t like keep like she can t keep on standing right there and people keep on bullying her Brittany do you think we should keep it or leave it I think we should I think we should get rid of it When I was in the suburbs with my godmother she said that my godbrother was getting picked on in school by a bully and he just felt like beating him up What do you think Adune Well keep it because like why would you let some people get away with most of that stuff You re just gonna let them keep doing the same thing And without the rule Without that rule everybody people would just keep getting beat So what I hear all of you saying is that you don t want people to get beaten but you also said that sometimes it s hard to control your anger so you can t you re not always a good person all the time Sometimes you make bad choices Do you think we could maybe change that rule so that everybody would be happy with it Yes I think we should change it to like like when you re like around like older people like elder like older people and like they re real old you can like like you can show like good moral character around them but then when they like go and stuff like when they re not gone like when we was talking about immigrants on the like they was on the boats you don t know what type of people is on the boats It can be like elder people you never know Like you can have good moral character around them but like when you like when you re like around your mother don t she want you to respect you Don t she want you to respect her But we should change the rule to like sometimes people can just like have a chance to get some people back that really did something really bad to them or caused them to get hurt or something so we should change the rule to like it s kind of like hard for a name but we should think about it I think I have a cause and effect for a good moral character That s why they have like if you have to fill out an application that s why they re trying to like that s why they re trying to like fill out an application to see if you got good moral character or if you re cra 
 How much bigger is one than the other It s like a thousand times It s like four times Wait Those zeros are really skinny Well they weren t too bad It s quite a big difference isn t it So is our picture drawn to scale No No Can we make judgments on what s happening by our picture No Not unless its drawn to scale right Rachel how would we redraw that to make it more in line with our numbers Which side is bigger The one with the negative Okay so we want to make that three times seven to the sixth minus six much smaller right Yes Would you please redraw Make it about a fourth of the size I ll try You can just do a new one Don t forget arrow tips please Okay Now does that picture help us understand why our hypotenuse is almost the same as the side Okay so do we use our picture to make judgments Yeah Okay only if it s to scale Thank you ma am Okay Sam You understand that Okay Alright now one more thing we needed to do for the Yeah Go ahead That hypotenuse has got a curve It s okay We ll make allowances He doesn t have a straight edge up at the board Okay Raci what else do we have to do here Find the direction Find the direction Raci how would we go about doing that Okay so tangent No that s fine We can use tangent Which numbers will we use then Okay And Pardon me Are we trying to find the hypotenuse right now No We well yeah we re going to We just didn t write it that way To solve for Theta we would do inverse tangent okay Now what do I tell you always to do with this Make sure It s in degrees In degrees A couple of you had it in radians That s because in Precal we I understand that but So Okay now we have the angle Is that the angle of the resultant No What would you do Jonah 180 Add 180 because It s in the third quadrant Drew would you agree with that Yes Because Because the resulting forces can t They can t there s no forces in the other quadrants so the resulting force couldn t possibly be in another quadrant Okay but how do we measure that angle Counter clockwise from East Okay good Alright Any questions Sam Question I didn t add the 180 but then I put my answer as a certain number of degrees southwest That would be fine So you can do south of west also because it defines where that angle is Alright Now do you guys feel better about this problem Okay John Can you measure that from I said it was I m pretty sure this is incorrect but 12 and a half degrees west of south I mean now that I realize it s Yes you could have I guess it s technically the same thing It would have been west of south Did I mark it wrong Yeah Alright well just show it to me later I might have just missed that angle there Okay I ll make that correction for you John Okay Let s go on Jonah Jake thank you Jonah you re going to the board for this one What should I write We can erase all of number one Taylor would you please read the problem for us Sure A proton accelerates from rest in a uniform electric field of 640 What does that say Newtons over Coulombs Okay let s stop there for a second Hold on Don t erase the nanocoulombs You see the difference between an N slash C and a lower case nc Sometimes if you re reading too fast you are going to mess those up I do it myself So always take a good look at the units Units help inform you what you have Okay thank you At some later time its speed is 1 2 times 10 to the second For A you have to find the magnitude of the acceleration of a proton For B how long does it take the proton to reach the speed C how far has it moved in an interval And D what is the kinetic energy at the later time Okay so Connor Calling on you again here Magnitude of the acceleration How would we go about finding acceleration normally if I just said Connor tell me how to find acceleration What s the first stuff that comes to mind f equals m a f equals m a Okay or a equals f over m f over m Jonah a equals f over m We re working with a proton Mass isn t given in the problem but is that going to be an issue for us No No because that s our table of equations So the mass of a proton 1 67 times 10 to the minus 27 kg So we have that part but we don t have the force So Rachel how might we find the force Isn t the e equals f over q so we can use the charge of the proton to find the To find the charge and what s e It s a constant No no no its not a constant Oh isn t it the 640 newtons over coulombs right And what does e represent Rachel The electric field Electric field good So if we solve this for force what is that going to be F equals Okay you can plug numbers in first too that s good Jonah Can you slow down for some of us please Yeah Jonah you re not supposed to be looking at your sheet so put your sheet down What did Jonah just write up there Okay he went too fast So let s back up He plugged in the variables He plugged in the numbers But do we all know where that equation came from Green sheet Green sheet And e is the Electric field Good okay And f Force q The charge of a proton Alright So now do you all know the charge of the proton It s equal to the charge of an electron Very good alright now we can find force right What was the force then 6 13 times 10 to the 10th I got 1 02 times 10 to the ninth That s the acceleration Oh my bad Yeah I was doing acceleration F equals 1 67 1 024 How did I get this problem right Oh there it is right there 1 024 x 10 to the negative 16th And that brings up another good point Write your work more clearly right Because if you can t follow your own how do you expect me or the AP reader to do that So do yourself a favor Make sure its clear Okay Where do we go from here Ann Back to a equals f over m And we have force and we have mass now right Okay now I have led you through the problem solving steps for number one and number two A John lead your classmates through 2 B Okay 2 B You have Do you want me to lead the class I want you to ask questions Don t tell us I want you to ask questions okay Okay So you need to find time So what equation would you use Jonah stop using the sheet No I told him he could use it Wouldn t it be velocity equals acceleration times time It is Yes Oh come on Jonah don t It s actually v o times x times t not x v o times t That s right Isn t it v o times t You are thinking of the equation for displacement Oh yeah x times v o Well v o is zero because it s from rest Alright Drew what would you plug in The speed that you re given at the beginning of the problem and you found the acceleration Oh the speed is 1 2 x 10 to the sixth and then you plug the acceleration you found from the previous problem into that equation and solve it So t equals No John s leading Class what does t equal 1 96 times 10 to the negative fifth Negative fifth or negative seven Five Alright Sam you lead for part C Read part C You lead Part C How far has it moved in the interval And if you look up to the problem nope you don t have to look up to the problem You look up to number B which we just did Number B Yes you do Number B and you look at the time that we just found and that s going to be the interval Thank you Jonah So how are we gonna find time Ann Or distance Sorry distance Why d you ask me a question You told me to ask you a question No I didn t Alright anyone else know Gretchen you look like you know What s the equation to find distance in number C Distance equals velocity times time Nope That s not what I got But I guess you could do that You could do that No you can t You can t do that Why not Because I was gonna do that at first Gretchen but then I thought in my head that since the object s accelerating the velocity is not going to be constant throughout the path of the travel I have an equation You have an equation Ann I do What is it How about x equals x the original x plus v o times times t plus one half a v squared So what do we know about v o and x o Ann That they are just zero So what can we do to both those first parts of the equation Just throw them out the window Drop it like a bad habit Drop it like it s hot So that would be half times acceleration times time squared And conveniently letter A letter A we found the acceleration which was what Drew 6 13 x 10 to the 10 Nice is just and the time in letter B What was it Raci 1 93 times 10 to the negative So if you pound that out on the calc Can we just pound it out You cannot just pound it out because you have to Do what Miranda I don t know Put the square in there Change back to degrees Oh you snuck it in Snuck what in The square I don t think I said the square No I didn t but Jonah thank you for saying the square for me Pound that out in sig fig wise what do you get I got 11 8 11 7 John If acceleration does matter couldn t you also use the equation v t Because I also did that and I got the same D equals one Write it on the board please D equals What s d I know it works I just don t know how it works I m going to tell you in a second One half v average times t So why will this also work then Let s get some of your thoughts Ann Because if it s the average then it s looking at the middle velocity instead of the top and bottom so you just Wait a minute It s the average velocity and really the equation is the quantity vo plus v times t Yeah that s what I wrote down Right and so you take into account the acceleration with the change in velocity So wait a minute If the equation is vo plus v Then you just get rid of the No Yeah you do v plus vo times t the quantity vo plus v Times t would just be v average times t Okay let s write the whole equation out John one half parenthesis v o plus v end parenthesis t Then isn t vo plus v just v average So t equals v average times t Not v average No Yes But vo plus v divided by 2 Oh okay I m sorry I see what you mean I missed that Yes sorry But it can t just be final velocity Okay Is there another equation we could ve used I saw some of the other ones on your sheets that worked Anybody in this class have one of the other ones Jonah did you You could do V squared equals 2 a x So another way v squared eqals 2 a x and solve for x right Good job so you can see there s multiple ways of getting at the same answer right And D letter D I ll have Gretchen lead Letter D is asking to find the kinetic energy at the later time So what equation would you use Sam Would it be kinetic energy equals times the mass of the object times the velocity of the object squared Yes And then if we know the mass of the object of the proton from the first equation and that was 1 67 x 10 27 kilograms Thank you for using the unit And then we found the velocity in letter Given Or it was given right So 1 2 x 10 to the 6th Meters per second Thank you Squared And then you can just plug that into your calculator Sig figs 1 2 times 10 to the negative 15th gs or kilogram meters per second Meters squared over seconds squared Don t forget you have to square the units Kilogram meters squared over seconds squared Kilograms meters squared over seconds squared Yeah What is kilogram meters per second You have to convert the meters I could have sworn kilogram meters per second was something Oh momentum That s not what we re looking for though right No it s not No we re good Okay now Better understanding Yes You gotta stay on top of stuff You can t let those distractions get to you Okay Pass your quizzes to the front face down I ll put them in your files for you Do you want to see I ll take yours separate Are we allowed to retake them Pardon me Can we retake them Sure Thank you You gave me a minus six Well I had everything Okay now we are starting the next chapter today so I have some handouts to give to you Do we have till this Friday to retake the last test Yeah and quarter ends on Friday so anything you guys need 
 Do you know how to make a U shape like this You re gonna make the U shape with this first It s gonna make a U You re making sod homes What are sod homes Tell me what all you know about a sod home There were some homes that were dug out That were built the dugouts were in a hill okay Tell me what else you know about sod home Okay and why did they use sod to make houses Yeah okay so they didn t have trees What kind of land were they on A prairie A prairie and what is a prairie It s a flat kind of land and it never has any trees Okay okay Would you have wanted to live in a sod home I d choose a log cabin where Okay were there any good things about a sod home Um yeah What is something good about a sod home Okay what are the walls like in a sod home Are they thick are they thick walls Okay okay Did they have any furniture in their sod homes They did why didn t they have furniture JD why didn t they have furniture in their sod homes Because they weren t I think Abby do you know why they they didn t have furniture in their sod homes No but Did they bring their furniture with them No because of the wagon It would take up the whole wagon Okay so what did they bring What did they bring Hannah A gun They did they brought a gun And food okay So they didn t bring their furniture with them Why not Why didn t they bring their furniture Cause it was too big and it would take up the whole wagon Okay Okay Didn t they have more than one wagon Yes That s right a wagon train very good Okay I m gonna leave you guys to work and I m gonna be back and check on your sod homes okay It smells very good Okay and I ll help you I see that you have trunks Why do you have a trunk Oh that s very nice to help Eli why do you all have trunks Because um the pioneers had them The pioneers had trunks Why Why did they have trunks For their clothes and stuff And toys And toys Like we re making the doll Okay what were trunks made out of Wood Wood Oh you guys are sharing it s so great Thank you So their trunks were made out of wood What kind of homes did they live in Sod houses and log homes Sod houses and log homes Log cabins And log cabins Okay That s right that s right And so when they traveled when they left their homes what did they travel in A covered wagon A covered wagon Was there just one wagon No They got in a wagon train A wagon train and what was a wagon train It s a bunch of covered wagons Oxen in a wagon train In a wagon train would you have wanted to be at the front or the back of the wagon train Why I have an idea Erase erase erase erase You won t get that dirty You won t get that dirty Why would you not get that dirty at the front Because they can t move their Okay Okay What would happen in the wagon train Would they take care of each other Yeah Okay What if a wheel broke off of a wagon They would have to help each other Okay okay they would help each other Tell me this Eli Where was the wagon where were the wagons going West They were going West Why were they going West Cayden They thought they would settle the land Okay Karev why did the government give them free land Okay they were What did they have to do on that land Build a house Okay build a house that s right That s right so what kind of house did they build A sod house They made a sod house Why did they not make a wood house Because there weren t a lot of trees on the prairie Okay but you said the trunks were made out of wood how did they get trunks made out of wood Because they made it before they left They made it before they left that s correct Can the doll have long hair You re doing a great job You re just gonna have to imagine that That s right they made their trunks before they left Did they just need one trunk No Okay Twice Okay Do you know Eli Can you go show me on the map where the pioneers went on the prairie where the prairie was Okay and what is that The Prairie The prairie and how do you know it s a prairie Because there s no like mountains there How do you know there s no mountains Because these are the mountains Just like regular colors are not Okay and so on the prairie what kind of homes did they build Sod houses Sod houses So where did they build their log houses at Right in this area Okay Very good and why did they build em there What was there Wood A lot of wood Good job You can go sit down Thank you You did a great job Very good job Did they take everything with them on the trip Why did they not take everything with them Okay so when they got there did they have furniture to put into their sod homes No because They just moved in they had just moved in Where there good things about a sod home Eli what was good about a sod home That s right and what made them that way Because the ground is cooler Okay the ground is cooler Were the log homes good as well Yeah Okay but what was one bad thing about a log house compared to a sod house It s not warm in winter And do you remember when we did a Venn Diagram about the sod house and the log house and compared those two Yeah So that was the bad thing about a sod home is the animals could fall through What was the best structure to live in A log cabin A log cabin So that animals couldn t get on top of it and If you lived in a dug out Cayden would you if it came a big rain storm would you rather be at the front of the dug house or the back of the dug out Back Why It s a dryer place isn t it Okay you guys continue to work okay Tell me what you know about a log house Willie tell me something you know about a log house Okay they didn t have any air conditioners Kennedy you guys are making a log house What are you putting in your log house Dolls and some family and some furniture Okay Did they have a lot of furniture for their log house Brody Did they have furniture for their log house Yeah but when they got there they had to have time to gather up some furniture That s right when they first moved there they didn t have any furniture But eventually they built some didn t they I see you re putting a fireplace in there What did they burn in their fireplace They were burning um buffalo chips They are In a log house they re burning buffalo chips That s right in a sod house they re gonna burn buffalo chips Why not wood in a sod house Because in a prairie they would run out of if they had enough wood they would build a wood house build a log house That s exactly right Were there buffalo chips where there were log houses No Why were there not buffalo chips So buffalo cannot run in the forest where the trees were Where did the buffalo live What was it called The prairie The prairie And what is a prairie Open grasslands that s exactly right And what are you making Dillon A quilt Why are you making a quilt Tell me why the pioneers needed quilts for To sit on them what else did they do with them Willie They on them when they were on their way What else Dillon Okay did they not have beds Yes No they didn t Okay That s right Okay they had to sleep on the floor Are you putting a kitchen in your log house No because they Well where did they keep their food at The root cellar Where tell me about a root cellar What s a root cellar It s where they kept their frozen food Okay was it inside the log cabin or was it outside Outside Okay And what was the root cellar like Okay Brody you re exactly right that is great thinking That is great thinking Did they keep any food inside their homes Yes What d they keep inside their homes Flour and sugar Flour and sugar and where would they have kept those In what container What kind of container Were they barrels that they put them in Yeah Yeah they were barrels You guys are doing a great job and you re working together and I m gonna come back and check on you in a little bit all right Look what I made What is that Willie It s what A lantern A lantern why do you have a lantern in your log house Okay and so you can see Yeah That s right cause they didn t have electricity did they Cause they had So they could see to cook Good thinking I need to do my little girl okay I ll do the girl 
 Love the many questions that you re asking Asking questions is a great way especially if you re wondering something Feel free to ask it even if you go in a little bit different direction Also the more you reference the book you can give us some things going on in Brave New World and the more specific you can be the better that helps us understand somebody actually connected to the book and maybe how it s connected to them So two things to be thinking about But if you give examples the more specific you can of real world examples also the better off You guys are doing a fantastic job though Talking having a natural conversation letting each other speak and all that So continue with the next question Are we doing that on here What s that Are we doing what we re supposed to in here Yeah and my outside people ya ll are doing fine continue with whatever you want to put on here As long as it s related to the conversation obviously Ya ll want to talk about Bernard John now Yeah Absolutely Alright how do these characters show a variety of ideas about individualism and conformity I ll just kind of start out Here s my answer I kind of said that they were like the Russians who wanted their blue jeans They knew what they wanted and they kinda went for it And in the end society pretty much pushed them back into their place And was like No don t stand up and rise up against us Well I would say I see a similarity between like Bernard and John because they both had individual ideals but I definitely that John was a lot stronger in his beliefs than Bernard was because I think about how Bernard had at first he was all individual and he had these individual beliefs and then when he when they got in trouble kind of in a way all three of them with the uprising and all that kind of stuff He kind of went back on what he was saying And John he stuck to it like he actually did something about it When he actually kind of protested and he was able to go back to being an individual And he went into doing his own thing with his own beliefs So I just feel like John was a lot stronger in what he believed throughout it than Bernard who was kind of allowing people to look at him put on him worried about what other people thought about him and all that kind of stuff That s true Cuz like whenever Bernard was more of I guess a weirdo he does always like question society and why everybody acts the way they do But as soon as he started being popular he started bragging to Helmholtz about how like right here it says And I had six girls last week one on Monday two on Tuesday two more on Friday one on Saturday So as soon as he became just like everybody else he started to like it far more and it mattered much to him that people like people did what they did like not explicit relationships and everything So you re right John was stronger than Bernard I don t think John ever conformed he stuck to his beliefs pretty much the whole time Yeah he always stayed an individual like he made sure he didn t conform Was Helmholtz conformist or individualistic Because he did a lot of the same things that you know normal people do but he also read as an idealism at times I think he s somebody who he conformed to what he had to just to get by But at the same time he had his own thoughts and believed what he believed I just don t think he really stood up for what he believed in So we re Yeah I think so It s almost like it s almost like a fair weather friend He did what was best for him to keep him going got hit and suffered trouble I feel like I don t know maybe I m crazy but I thought Helmholtz was like reminds me of this is stereotypical but he kind of reminds me of like an old professor you know He like just like goes to work Helmholtz has like good thoughts about stuff but then he didn t like live the life Wasn t he some sort of He was like a top guy professor A psychologist or something He was a scientist Alright so kind of sticking on that topic What about the books and how they nobody really read how they kind of all of the books related to I guess individuality and the whole world what life was like before was locked up I can say the same John was reading Shakespeare and how Shakespeare is all about like love and tragedy and there s like sorrow and there s also you know the aspect of love with Romeo Juliet And how the people didn t really Helmholtz would his job was reading it to them and he started laughing about it because he was trained not to So I think if people actually read about it you know the feelings and how love is supposed to be Then people wouldn t go along with how their relationships would be because they d wanna maybe wanna experience falling in love with someone or having that one person would cause a lot more problems with that knowledge along with seeing how people how there s tragedy People are becoming sad and how in the New World people are always supposed to be happy and everyone s getting along Then in these stories there s like love conflict and everyone is fighting and it would cause problems because from that people could form their own individual problems and then they start to have their own individuality and form opinions and start asking questions which leads to a lot of things Books are they pretty much written to express those emotions in which the whole state is trying to block up anyways That was why they re there So the book do you think that the books are kind of what drove Bernard to be a nonconformist and then as he got away from reading and he started conforming back into society What I think happened cuz they were saying I think he was like bipolar or something and everyone else was like something He was shorter than everyone else and I think he was already kind of like put aside cause they were saying that they think he had alcohol given to him as he was a baby so that made him weird So all along he wasn t like everyone else So he wasn t a like no one accepted him for who he was but whenever he got famous or whatever people began to accept him Huh He wasn t able to conform is that what you re saying Yeah I don t think he was able to conform because no one accepted him for who he was except for Helmholtz I think if someone else was in his position like read even like saw a book they probably wouldn t even try to read the way he did They were so used to not I don t know not having books I don t think the same thing would happen to somebody else It kind of reminds me of I don t know if you guys have seen the movie The Book of Eli How the entire time he s trying to hide the Bible because that one guy wants the Bible because he wants control over everybody Because like if he has like everything in the Bible he could like tell people certain things and they would just listen to him so he could be a master Like in this book how everybody like the Controllers just want control over everybody and without books like I think it s just another type of their control That s a good example Also if you think about it present day a lot of people don t even read books anymore They mostly know that they can and you can watch the movies instead There is also technology where you can learn about something without even actually having to read the book So do you think in a way that s kind of like the same way of eliminating how they did in the story and how they eliminate books and there s more technology is like a weakness Today you know we re all about technology so we eliminate more books and there s more movies and more technology Real quick I wanna throw in one scene that I want you guys to think about also You just brought up a point about if people in the world today saw these books would they even know what to do with them What would they think about them We do have a point in Brave New World where someone does see a book that isn t used to seeing these type of books and responds to it When Helmholtz looks at the Shakespeare that John has So what did you make of Helmholtz s response to Shakespeare And what do you think that maybe suggests about people s attitudes in the World State Especially since the Helmholtz would represent I guess an enlightened view point in the World State You remember the scene that I m talking about Yeah Yeah he started off by laughing at it and didn t later on in the scene he kind of hid the fact that he had read it and that he knew what was going on I m just wondering where it all It s page 183 Page 184 says the second paragraph like third or fourth line Helmholtz said listen to the scenes of the world first meeting with a puzzled interest I mean I guess being the enlightened thinker Helmholtz is kinda curious about it and wanted to know more But at the same time he had that conformity which was kinda scaring him away from it Cuz he didn t want to get in trouble I guess He doesn t really seem to understand what s going on in Romeo Juliet because at the bottom of page 184 same page we saw him laughing about it because he didn t understand why the mother and father are trying to force the daughter on someone she didn t want So I mean it just kind of shows how different things were I guess that goes back to the differences in society between then and now For now and the future Like to do the last comments about John or Bernard comparing and contrasting I come up with something that didn t really get mentioned John the reason he s an individual is cause he was born he was like literally born and grew up on the reservation Bernard the reason he s an individual is because of his physical stature So Bernard is an individual because of physically but John is different because of who he is He was born like that so that s what makes they re two different people in individuality standard And that s why I thought that Bernard was so easy to go back to conformity because the only thing that made him different was his height And that s why John couldn t because of who he was I thought Bernard was the person that John would be if John had been born and raised in his World State where Bernard had The only thing that made John different is that he spent so much time on the reservation where everyone s different They value individuality You had some good ideas just to kind of wrap up with that last question Something to think about also you guys kind of hit it on this essentially what we have is two characters in Bernard and John that both do not fit into their communities Right And the world is saying everything is designed to fit exactly and if you don t fit then you re removed from that situation And the Savage Reservation you are basically shamed out of that group Now that s the way John he s trying to interact but because of his mother and because of his birth he is shamed out of it But notice whenever John goes to the World State and Bernard takes him and becomes a celebrity because of it All the sudden Bernard is very happy to be part of the World State So once Bernard can actually conform and gain advantage from that type of society he s more than happy to continue on in it John though being the way he is he s never had the opportunity to conform to any kind of society and he still has that shame culture inside of him that he continues to live by the whole time he s in the World State right So that s something to think about too is not only are they isolated when they are born and different Then what happens when all the sudden one of them can conform and can be a valued member of that society which John sort of is but it s more for him being strange and weird and exotic then it is him being a person and being brought into it Guys that was a great first half What I need you guys to do in the center circle is go ahead and log in to your computers Outside circle people jot down any last minute ideas you want on your paper responses And then in just a minute we ll switch So now we re taking notes as well as having the competition on there Correct and did that go ok for outside folks Yeah It was ok to do both We can still take notes while we re on the inner circle right Oh sure absolutely 
 How you guys doing So 3 Oh what did you do by touching those It made a short circuit It crossed Wow the orange is a lot less than the kiwi and the apple Yeah It s only 3 Why do you think that is 03 Maybe because It s like different rods or something Oranges are more sour than the other fruit Not and like have more acid or something Because it stops the energy We want it a half centimeter apart right Yeah Two centimeters Around So okay go ahead Make sure they aren t touching 0 1 It s not even measuring at all Oh 0 1 0 01 Oh 01 That s crazy I know How this supposed to be one the other two were so high 0 98 I never thought fruits and vegetables could have so much energy Except for oranges I thought this would have as much as the apple My hypothesis I actually thought that the orange would have the most Go ahead Alright Lizzy you can do the voltage reader Stick them in a half centimeter apart And a centimeter in Okay Lizzy make sure they don t touch Don t short circuit them It s like completely zero The bigger it is the more volts it has The middle one it left like a little here and this was the most I think it s more concentrating volts in the middle more than anywhere else Hmm I wonder why that would be Okay so now we have to get a calculator Okay so 0 22 Plus 0 09 Plus 0 28 I got 0 1966667 So what are you gonna do with that number Round it up Okay 0 20 But wait doesn t someone else need to try it Oh yeah yeah yeah that s a good idea 0 22 plus 0 oh never mind Divided by three I got the same answer So what was the answer to the investigative question What do you think The The apple had the most Do you agree with that Yes Why do you think that is Do you have any guesses It s It s bigger It could carry more volts It has yeah It has like more juice Yeah that s true I think the juice Was your hypothesis correct Actually it was Like right here well Well actually I said the potatoes will have the most voltage because like usually they potatoes for like cloth and other things to energize with but I guess apples would work better What was yours I thought the I thought the carrots would produce more because you know usually when you like eat one it s like very wet wet when you just get them so I thought the carrot was going to win but guess not I thought it was the apple I already said that My hypothesis I thought I think the potato would have the most because I heard like I ve heard that potatoes could produce a lot of energy and last year when when they were doing a science experiment they said that they had potatoes for like volts So I suspected that they may have been have a lot of voltage also Okay To our investigative question our question was which fruit will produce the most energy And the Kiwi Kiwi and apple had tied for it 0 98 So I don t know maybe like some other time we should do another experiment and see if we get the same results I wonder why the orange was so low though Maybe because we since we put it too deep or something No we did the same thing we put all of them Yeah I know Well So then our so our answer was that the kiwi and the apple both had the highest So how about your hypothesis I thought orange would have it I thought orange would have it I thought orange had it too And had the highest Why Because it had like I thought the apple would because we didn t I thought the apple was because of how much bigger it was How about you Kirsten what did you think I thought the orange because it has more citrus in it I mean yeah I would have thought kiwi would have less because it s so small Yeah me too That s what I thought Then what was our evidence Apple had for an average had 0 98 Orange had 0 16 And then kiwi had 0 06 0 16 And then kiwi had 0 98 So kiwi and apple tied And then our evidence is our data table because that s where we recorded everything Yep So then how can you be sure that you conducted a fair investigation We did them the same length apart and So what are you guys trying to figure out over here We re we re trying to figure out what if the apple carrot or potato has enough voltage to light the food battery What is the food representing in this case A battery Okay Yeah Okay how you gonna figure that out What is your plan We are gonna do gonna try to do a voltage reader and put try to see how much voltage there is in an apple potato or a carrot I think we should use the apple because in our investigation it had the most voltage well like the apple but should we do a parallel battery or the something that starts with an S battery Series Series let s do series Let s try series It lights up more Yeah it s brighter Okay let s get it done Oh wait we re gonna need more There s a wire in here So I think that the apple will like light up the battery brighter Or at all because it has I think it s gonna have the most it has the most voltage and so it ll make it become brighter Which do you Oh wait we re doing a series battery so Maybe we Where s the other apple It s over there Reece has it Need to wrap it around tight Can I check Jayden do you wanna do it Sure I ll have the honors Keep this one untouched because I m gonna wrap this wire against that because it needs to this negative Just the white one Okay there is no wire in this Okay so I think we have enough wires here What do you need the wires for To wrap around to make a series To allow the energy to flow through Okay so what s the purpose of the wires So that the energy will be able to flow What is the energy that s going through the wires Electricity But okay so what is the function of the wires To like be able to pass from one spot to like the battery to the light Okay so you have two different wires Why is that To be able to You know why you have two different wires Um no No I m gonna give you a minute to think about it Okay Is it working No not yet Well I don t think it s working I think I didn t Oh it s going No I don t think I wrapped the wire around right Oh yeah because the This is really short So yeah it was tucking it Let s see that and that and that Yeah that thing s wrapped up tight Well if the volts are enough Don t the apples have to be touching No they don t have to be touching They just have to be the wires just have to go from positive to negative Yeah True But if they don t have enough voltage we should use a potato Yeah we can put the potato to help Yeah we need to put them in every fruit And then connect the wires like that to that that to that So make sure they don t touch Yeah so kinda wrap it around with the wire Yeah try to wrap it around as tight as you can so that Do you what do you guys think do you think that fruit could power our school I don t think so It might power a small light bulb like the ones that we use in here but You don t think there s enough voltage to supply our whole school No Well like maybe if we put like a bunch of fruit on the roof or something I don t know how that would turn out but maybe if we put a whole bunch and like stacked it on top Would you think that would be economical You think that would be beneficial to us in any way Maybe Why It could but we d have to keep changing out the fruit and changing out the fruit It d be lots more work that s for sure Don t let them touch That connects to that and that Do we have another one Because this one is broken Can we borrow one from over here Oh we have one There you go What do you think is gonna happen I think it ll like because we have none of the same touching First we should check the voltage Well I don t we ll just see if it lights the light No don t connect those Why would you wanna check the voltage Just to see if it has enough potential of battery Would make more electricity All the averages I think it should be good this way Because we tested a battery and saw how much it was Connect one to it Then connect yours Lizzy Maybe did we do it wrong No I don t think so Well I think that maybe it loses potential inside the fruit Maybe it Try an separate those a little more Kirsten Maybe they re both plus and plus Maybe it s because we re using three types of fruit If we use just two What if we took the prongs out and replace that with this Okay try that Put it in a different hole this time because we just changed it Well don t What are we trying to do here We were trying to make all these the same one Why would you do that Maybe because they need to be the same From the both positive and negative Oh And we need to make sure so those could be the plus and minus doesn t matter which way And that and that needs to touch and then that one and that one which is exactly what we did But wait 
 Well frogs do sink they do It s sinking What do you think caused that to happen what made it sink that time I put it like that and And then it was sinking Alright but now we saw some pictures where the real frogs got on lily pads and didn t sink So what do you think is different It s like stuck to the ground and The lily pad is stuck to the ground Yeah I think there s something inside I think there s something in like dirt you know like that causes the lily pad to grow But with something in the lily pad seed We were looking at this the other day Do you girls remember about that Okay what were you all thinking about that They don t But what were you thinking Andrea You know these eyes right here we don t have eyes like this but frogs But frogs jump really high If they don t jump really the same they probably just almost jump if the momma and daddy frogs turn into get some eggs and the tadpole comes out That tadpole right there he was following it and then he stopped What if they took the flashlight they might move Yeah Like this watch When you take it off I did this in my momma s When you take it off and you turn it this way he looks back at it like this That s what he does How come Because when tadpoles like eat things that glow then when you take it off you put it back on How come why I know they just don t But that s not fair What else did you notice We did the spots What else did you notice Jamal look at it again Frog What body parts do you see Gray polka dots You said the spots The feet The feet what about it Lines on it Some lines on it And what are you saying Nikera You said it had some things on it That white stuff What is that What is that white stuff on it s feet See if I can get a closer look What is that Jamia do you see that The white things on its feet It s his foots It s his feet Do you have that on your feet No They need peace and quiet If they don t have a calm river Look they live in ponds Dude listen listen There are trees right here There s flowers Listen Latan be quiet I m thinking that this is very calm rivers and this is what you call that ooey gooey stuff that Ms Robbie called it That s the lake and that s the pond and there I am frogs They need grass they need flowers they need little trees they need I was thinking Aleha thinking about us living in houses We live in houses because can t breathe water This is my house and like there s dirt under there And there s dirt under there Then under that runs the water the blue water Let s add something to it So what made it work this time It stands upside down The frog floats It doesn t jump on any kind of one it only jumps on the ones that are round Because it needs something facing up to make the walls Because this is facing up so you think maybe the lily pad faces up Right if it does this it needs like a shield so the water won t get in because if the water touches it it will tear and it will sink Did you listen Because they need something on it like rain So you re saying if water touches it what happens if water gets on top of it It ll sink because it ll tear the lily pad up and it ll sink but with the flower on it it does not sink So if it has the flower you think the flower keeps it from sinking Because it s stuck It s stuck and it s so hard it makes it so hard and rainy and it dries up So when you dried the frog off did that make a difference Well it doesn t make a difference Frogs like to be wet Frogs are usually wet That frog is an African swimming frog because look at it s feet It does look like an African dwarf frog It jumps on the water It can run and hop on water Andrea what did you notice about this What did you notice I know that we have It doesn t float Let me show you which one Which one What about this one He was growing legs No this one s growing legs but that s what tadpoles swim in Okay you see them Shine it on it No You see they re moving because they re growing legs If you yell really loud the glass will break and then the tadpoles Frogs The frog s body There s a water snake There s a water snake A water snake What are you talking about over here This thing has a frog in it And he just swam Okay so we re talking over here Ms Robbie look So you re comparing the pond to your house Yeah Alright did you see this that she found out It says the frog is pulling off its skin I wonder why it s doing that Because so it can have different skin Why would it make different skin It might need different skin because of the way it lives The way it lives it has to take off its own skin just like a snake takes off its whole skin Snakes take off their skin Be a new frog The way they take off their skin is they shred it off They don t have any arms Snakes shed their skin off and they don t have no arms Snakes shed their skin Yeah Do you think frogs shed their skin too What do you think Aleha You found the picture tell me what you re thinking Let me hear Aleha When it gets old they have to take it off He has to take it off Why do you think he needs to take his skin off I was thinking Just a moment Daniel let me hear Aleha I can t hear When it gets too rough on him he can take if off Maybe if his skin feels rough Hmm I m wondering about that That s giving me something to wonder about Ms Robbie there s a water beetle Yes but we re still looking at this about this frog coming off She feels like maybe when his skin is rough he takes it off What did the page say It uses a word I m not sure about molt It said frogs molt a few times every year Because it s the way they live It s the way they live But we don t live that way the same way we do We get bigger instead of shredding skin You re right We get What what d you say Say that again We get bigger We get bigger And they shred And they shed their skin That s opposite Hmm I m going to write down that word molt We re going to talk about that a little bit We re going to try to explore that a little bit more The frogs are underground and they hatch out of the eggs and turn into the tadpoles and they re going to grow up a little and they re going to lost their tail and they re going to turn into an adult frog and then they are underground when it s winter When it s winter they re undergound Okay what have you all found out about comparing The frogs protect their babies Do the frogs protect their babies No they don t What about your They wait until they hatch They wait till they hatch Frogs have bigger eyes than us because they have those eyes like that on their heads and we don t And we have eyes that are small And when you were born did your mom or dad take care of you or your grown up Yes I went to my grandma when I m a baby Okay did your grownup take care of you when you were a baby Andreas Yes Yeah well what about the mother frogs No I got a lot of food I love You got a lot of food I eat chicken and rice everything Andreas just think about our tadpoles Is the momma frog in here taking care of those tadpoles No They wait till they hatch Maybe the momma frog missed them Probably if they die after wintertime 
 Brooke what did you choose The cylinder Why Okay five and what about you Ms Leah Cylinder Why Because it has two faces It has two faces and what about you Ms Cecilia The sphere and why you need to write your words down Okay so write your words down so you guys can hand in your sheet Who thinks wants to cut Who think will cut Here what about Samantha then you Okay and then me then Brian Okay but he goes you too You called You want to hold and stretch Well that s the one you re doing and you ll be cutting Okay so Katie cuts then Samantha then me and then Brian He is going to roll the shapes down the hill I ll stretch and you can hold okay Samantha Wait guys this is Guys it s the sphere Spheres Those are spheres That s the cylinders No This is the sphere color you already got Here how about I ll be Who wants cylinder raise your hand Who wants sphere Who wants cylinder So it s three versus one So do the cylinder first and then use Fine I ll get on it You guys working it out Alright Yes Blake what do you need We need more string You need more string Okay alright Keep that one right there and roll one of your other shapes and I ll get you a longer piece of string Okay Hold on I got it right here I ll tie it on there how s that Okay is that going to work for you Alright Isaac go ahead and stretch it out How long it was We need to hang that up You can cut this tie Okay I ll cut this time I ll have Don t roll it now I can measure it I ll cut it Now Leila roll it down Move the cylinder Blue blue oh we have only blue When you guys are measuring who s doing the holding You are Okay Foster hold it Who s doing the stretching Because you re going to have to stretch it out you can t cut it until it s stretched You re stretching and so Sierra s cutting Okay Foster you hold it you gotta stretch it all the way out Yeah okay cut it right here Like that Here there you go Open it a little bit more There you go okay And Foster go put it up on the graph and Sierra you can throw away the extra Okay good job What shape is this Hunter Sphere Sphere alright and what do you know what s special about the sphere It rolls and what s really special about it It has no faces It has no faces you re brilliant Okay the next one Whoa You can cut it You may be able to I want to straighten it Measure it The sphere went the farthest So was your prediction right Jackson Was your prediction right Yes No No So you want to circle no and you want to circle yes Anthony was your prediction right Okay so you want to circle the check mark for yes your prediction was right And then you guys can get some crayons and draw your observations and what you saw in your experiment I think The cylinder Okay who s letting this go Me Okay you can t measure it till she lets it go Ready go Cecilia let her go Look at the poor little cube Why do you think it doesn t go very far Because it has sides What kind of sides Squares And they re what Flat Flat alright but now you ve picked it up and you can t measure it Alright who s doing the holding Okay now hold on a second Leah so when you measure you want to turn it this way so the edge is right up against the ramp and then you hold it tight and then you can cut it right here okay Alright so who s holding you are Okay alright You hold this you hold that Okay can I go hang that up Now we do some Okay hold on can you hold this away for a second while she sends it down Ready Okay ready Alright now are you the holder Okay Use the stretcher Try and stretch the So Katie you took Brian s turn last time honey so it s his turn Okay girls what shape is this one Rectangular prism And what s special about it Because Because Because it has Because it has rectangle Rectangle what Faces Faces and they are Flat Flat rectangles right so did it go very far No Did anybody pick the rectangular prism to go the farthest You picked that one Okay so now you know it didn t go too far Alright so now you re going to try your Cube Cube okay good Who s cutting now Who Who s sliding it Samantha No I didn t slide it down before Samantha didn t So were you right Leila Yeah you did Yes or yes ma am Yes ma am Alright so you can circle your prediction was correct and then was your prediction correct Isaac No you guys said the cylinder went the farthest Was your prediction correct Okay so you circle here your prediction wasn t correct and then was your prediction correct Aspen No and what about you Blake yes Okay so now you guys can go ahead and clean up all of your stuff and then you can get one of the crayon caddies and draw a picture of what happened Blake I want you to help your team clean up before you start drawing your observations Good job team Hey that s mine That s my pencil Wait I m not ready yet I m not ready yet I got it right I got it right Yeah I got it right I got it right So which shape do you guys have left What is that Cone The cone and what s special about the cone And so what happens to it It slides It does slide on its face What else is special about the cone Cecilia It rolls in a circle Why Because You okay Because it has a flat face Mm hmm and what else makes it roll in that circle Leah It has a point It has the point on it so this is your last one to measure Yes Okay yes or yes ma am Yes ma am Alright good luck You throw that away I ll throw it away So was your prediction correct Hunter Yes Yes so the cylinder went the farthest for you guys Okay so Sierra if the cylinder went the farthest your prediction wasn t right so now you re gonna circle the X Does it matter that you are right No No you re just predicting and that means you re guessing you don t have to be right Circle the X and then go ahead and draw your pictures It s orange So you guys are gonna show the cylinder going the farthest Just do it Do it here Now I don t know what s going the farthest It was probably cylinder Yeah Okay so what shape went the farthest for you guys Um the cylinder The cylinder so was your prediction correct Was yours Was yours Mm no What shape did you predict Um the sphere Sphere but the cylinder went the farthest so were you right No so did you circle the little X on the bottom And then you can do your picture Was your prediction correct Brian Okay so circle the check mark and draw your picture and then you guys can copy the graph from the board on the back so you can show your parents what happened Good work team All right so this team s all set Okay so which one went the furthest for this team The sphere The sphere okay so was your prediction right Cecilia Yeah Okay was yours right Brooke So does it matter if you got it right Not at all Alright so then draw your observations draw what happened and then you can draw the graph on the back Now we have to draw the graph on the back 
 What were you saying Joe I said young people definitely benefit our society overall more than old people in the country Why Just because they can Progress Contribute more Yeah Like they can work and they can help our industry grow and provide opportunities for more people Yeah they re a lot more active compared to old people more who just is gonna basically sit at home I mean if we look at like the current political situation in countries that are rebelling the rebellion is completely composed of the youth Yeah If we look at the political situation in America like Obama s election was pretty much the 18 to 21 year old vote It s just like clearly they re like better at affecting social change In this time period that we re discussing why would you want the youth to come Well because this is like the start of all social change in the union and I want young people to bring a youthful energy and determination and some sort of hope about the country that they re moving to and that all my union in here They re gonna progress they re gonna like technology and they re gonna invent stuff So you re onboard with the I m just saying we still need more money They re going to be working and they re going to be taking money out of our economy because they re gonna want to pledge How much are they gonna spend Like we need old people to spend a lot like rich people to spend But we need workers Yeah no so it s like We need workers old people cannot work We need a combination If only get young people If we look at this list of people that we can bring into the country that we were supposed to look at to begin with the old people on this list aren t that rich Yeah but there s The bottom line is Gonna be more than just the old people there the old people other countries But right now we re focusing on that they re going to be moving and they re rich who would move here Why would they move to the Land of Opportunity if they don t need opportunities I didn t mean to say that That s honesty Okay Yeah but I mean I see that It seems like the majority did the majority rule on that Because I guess who was against having younger people come in I know Matt was Was Matt the only one who wanted older people to come in Ok and you were Also I m a loner You just went with the consensus Yeah Okay good Another point another point Also old people coming from another country just to spend the rest of their life aren t necessarily going to be all that interested in America Okay as a country And wait and also They re not going to vote they re not going to you know try to participate in the country itself so they re just here to die in comfort Okay go ahead Darvel On the way it s already tough enough to come across the sea to get to the United States because so many people died on the way getting there so they might die on the way getting there So don t even consider them to begin with Right Or if they re sick they can t come into the country anyway Like we re not going to let people who have cholera into our country because then it ll start spreading here so You said colema or column Isn t that more in Cholera That s like Okay I was like what What else did you guys have on your cards What about religion Does religion matter No I don t think it did No no That s one thing we I think we all could agree on Yeah Oh everybody What about the nativists What about the nativists Darvel you were okay with the religious freedom happening in this group Well I mean it s kind of like on the edge of the He s conformed But I because most of the time it s Christianity in the United States so Also majority rule Yeah majority rules USA USA Okay so who did you guys decide to wait was that the end of your criteria or No we had There s still reasons for coming race and knowledge of English previous jobs and Oh what d you guys say for English What d you guys say They have to know English Yeah we said they had to know Basic English at least At least a little bit They have to know some of it Or Enough to you know find out where the bathroom is Really Or enough to like communicate Or have the ability to learn it With other people who may not know English that well And Boss you were okay I mean I feel like I m one of the only ones who disagreed with that because like being a boss like I have connections like in every part of my city and every community and communities are often like separated by race so By race and And language Mm hmm So maybe different communities wouldn t have trouble communicating if they only knew one language Mm hmm But being a boss with my connections I could definitely like I could make it so that they could communicate and I can get them what they need help them out Okay I don t think now English is a necessity Well you wouldn t I think it s pretty I mean how are people supposed to communicate And it s just going to make life miserable for the people who are trying to make it Because I mean overall the majority speaks English But we do have immigrants in this country right now that speak different languages so they could just They re getting by though Right right I don t know if You should know them working in factories you should know a lot of these people Yeah but You might even know someone When I think of like different languages I think of like the Tower of Bavel or Babel it s like in the Bible story where like everybody spoke different languages and then the tower collapsed So like if everybody speaks different languages we can t get work done productively because we don t know what each other want Like if we say Yo go make this type I don t know just Do this job and then they do something else you need communication Darvel what do you think about the language piece Well I think that speaking English is basically it s a necessity I mean obviously you would want workers to come in because he just wants money He doesn t really think communication is that important but as a nativist I believe that it is Why What will happen if we let a lot of people come into the country with different languages maybe be different races different ethnicities What will happen to the country if we let those people in I mean that could create like conflict between the work because like Matt said they really wouldn t know what to do while they re working Also that could change the patriotism of the country as well But will they know why they re working Not really So people who don t speak English don t know why they re doing a specific job Well probably yeah I mean they know that they re doing a job to get money Right so does English really matter I m just asking I mean they re not gonna really X you wouldn t care if they spoke English because if they didn t speak English it might make it easier to exploit them I somewhat care Because they have to collaborate with the people they re working with to get the job done The way I see it is they can come into the country with a you know as long as they have the mindset of I should probably learn English to succeed in this country then I think it s a good idea Because if you re going to be immersed in a language you re going to be able to learn it eventually so I mean as long as they try to learn English or try to know basic English I think they should I mean I think I agree to Darvel Like if I was a nativist I m not saying I am but if I was a nativist I wouldn t want hoards of people who don t speak English coming because I mean it s like America s pure we ve got everybody speaks English like we don t want But does everybody really speak English right now Not now I m saying No not right now in 2011 but in our age that we re discussing If I was a nativist in my Even then right In my like Ideal world you would want everybody to like speak English Okay The whole world should speak English Oh goodness Yeah that s what a nativist would say I went with the English speakers because like to properly rebel and have a voice communication is vital and I think that people who aren t speaking English won t be interested in what I have to say can t even understand what I m saying so Okay well you guys decide and talk about who you guys are letting into the country specifically okay Yeah All right thanks guys Oh we already did Education s not really that important to me though I think it s really important Dude it s saying that a lot of these people going into this country aren t educated to begin with Well education like You would want educated people As a non union worker like I don t care about education I just want to keep my job and I want like union workers to get out of the country And as a union worker I want educated immigrants because then they would stand up for themselves and like change factory conditions Me being a tycoon I just want people to work for me I mean they can come to this country they can live the American way I ll supply them with a job What s the American way American way is to Well but you re not giving them any money Wait wait wait what s the American way 2 5 kids We are actually 2 5 kids white picket fence Dog Well that s the American is that the American way now or then We re talking about then Labrador Basically the American way is I want them to be doing better than the country they were previously in Okay That s my concern Well but they came here to like succeed and you re giving them like two cents an hour I mean for me with education though it s not that big of a deal because then again if they re coming to America they re going to have to learn our customs and our way and with them being uneducated that s easier for us to mold them into society and opposed to like we can mold their thoughts into like correct candidates to vote for and stuff like that But this is supposed to be like a free country and they came over here because we like grant that and we re just like manipulating them Yeah but like basically the only people I want in the country are like people that are going to give me jobs Like people who are kind of like Who are those people Kind of like sketchy people kind of because like You want sketchy people to come into your country Well sketchy people are about to give me jobs because like sketchy people are about to like What do you mean by sketchy What does sketchy mean When you re saying sketchy do you mean poor or like Nah I mean like people that are like rich and stuff and they ll like have a business and whatever but like They re corrupt a little Yeah they re a little corrupt so they won t like hire union workers and they ll keep their people ununionized so I can come in and take the work make that cash Know what I m saying Oh okay So you want it that people will have money when they come into the country but not be on the side of unions Exactly So that they will They ll give me jobs They will okay they ll hire non union workers They re not people that are going to be entering the workforce they re people that are going to be like already kind of upper you know what I mean Okay so you want people with money coming into the country Yeah exactly Okay Did you guys decide on a criteria already Yup Or are you discussing a criteria We have a criteria This is our criteria pretty much Okay what s your criteria We said non educated which some of us don t agree with Who didn t agree with it I don t agree with that Why Because I did not agree with it America is the land of education Everybody needs an education You can t come here Well but at this time remember education is not like going to school It s more of knowing a skill or a trade It s like street smarts almost Well if they don t know anything then they can work Yeah Okay And we decided on that Do people really need to know a lot though to work in these factories No but like No my business is to teach them how to use these machines We don t want them to be taken advantage of I mean but at the same time I don t really see the importance of education if they don t come with like money or some type of like I don t know some type of prior knowledge with like succeeding in America Because you may know you know how to read 100 books but that doesn t help you like start a business or something like that Yeah Yeah but not like that kind of education Like education enough where they know like that two cents an hour is not okay Like so they can stand up for themselves and like be able to like negotiate with you Why is that not okay I mean everyone has to get paid Everyone gets paid that same amount Yeah but they re living in like cramped shacks and like poor conditions I mean that s in your opinion A house is a house Yeah and then look at where they re coming from They re coming from religious persecution they re coming from these governments that are collapsing these war stricken countries Exactly and the government I think it s better to work in a factory earn some wage Yeah but how much are you earning compared to them Eat or have necessities in life I mean but there s also government support too That s where I come in I set them up with a place to stay stuff like that you know That s what government s here for is support of people that come in here So it s best when they re not educated it s best when they don t have money because that makes it easier for them to get help and that s what we re here to do is to help people But then they re relying on you and they don t know what to do with themselves like when you They re relying on him but then he lets them rely on themselves so they come in rely on him and then he kind of sends them like How Helps them out How does he keep people from relying on him Because then all right so I can help them decide for who to vote for in some type of election that can help them with their lives Like if there s a politician voting for labor laws I can help them If I m with that politician I can Yo this is the guy you want to vote for This is the guy that will help you That s like brainwashing though they like have a right to think for themselves Honey this is America Exactly Exactly Exactly So you re saying that nobody should campaign ever You re saying campaigning is brainwashing No you could campaign but you don t Exactly he s just campaigning Can I just say something No but he s like getting them all to agree with him Okay if you think about it this way you can really have people from all spectrums of money wise like from all kinds of economic backgrounds You can have the more rich people come in sorry the education backgrounds The more educated people are going to come in No matter what they re going to help our country more than hurt it Then for me I can supply the people who have gotten a lesser education and I can give them a job I can start them off in life and maybe they can go to the library and learn themselves Why don t you better their working conditions then if you like are helping them Because I mean still this is much better No because they like die in those factories It s better than being killed by their previous governments Wait have we decided No it s not It s not the same thing Have you guys already decided on this piece already Yeah we have like our set laws we just have disagreements about that You guys have disagreements So you guys were able to a consensus on them Yeah well we kind of voted on it We decided that they have to be non educated come with some sort of money Their religion and race doesn t matter Come with a family 
 Okay What objects or pictures do you see I see a flag A flag A sign The sun And the letters A sign Yeah And the birds There are birds over here People carrying bags Okay people carrying bags There s a ship A ship The ladies all have hats Okay The ladies all have hats on They look like they re dressed to go somewhere right Yeah Good All right Do you want us to write it in here You can copy it I have the words spelled up here We have Uncle Sam We have a boat Do you want us to write it I m going to have it up here Yeah Oh We have a flag We have this thing What does this thing look like Kind of like a witch No No Yeah It looks kind of like a witch Something scary anyway right Yeah Broccoli It looks like broccoli Okay Yeah it does It s kind of fluffy on top I agree All right There are people We ve got people We ve got birds Mm hmm So here are our objects Uncle Sam boat American flag I wrote scary devil looking thing If you want to put witch looking thing that s fine I m gonna put both Traveling people and birds I put enough blanks for a few objects but feel free to add more than the number of lines I wrote All right Okay Which of the objects whoops Okay Which of the objects do you see could be symbols The flag All right This is what I want you to do Stop Turn to the person beside you Beside you beside you beside you See if you can think of you already said flag That s a perfect example It is one of them I think four of these are symbols Not every object is going to be a symbol So turn and see if you and your partner can come up with any more Each pair can be that Two different Yeah Oh All right What did we come up with We came up with the top of his hat thing It s the same as the flag It looks exactly like the flag okay So what could Uncle Sam be a symbol of U S Of the United States Good Did you come up with one The traveling people The traveling people What do you think they symbolize They re from other countries Yeah They symbolize people from other countries Good Did you come up with one The scary devil looking thing Okay What is that It s clouds in the sky Okay It looks like clouds but why did the artist draw the clouds as a scary looking thing To get them out To scare them Or maybe it s the rain They re scared of storms Okay Who is the devil looking thing Who is he going after The people The people What are the people running away from From their other countries From their other countries So what could the cloud be a symbol of Bad things Immigrants Yeah They re the immigrants What is the cloud Yeah Their governments from their own countries Oh Is coming back after them or trying to scare them anyway All right Here we go We have these four Uncle Sam the boat the American flag and the devil looking thing I didn t do one for the travelers but you re right They can symbolize immigrants Uncle Sam symbolizes America This is one you didn t say I told you The ark this boat here symbolizes what The Bible The ark from the bible Okay Is anybody familiar with the story of the ark in the bible Yeah What did the ark do It saved It saved Noah his family and who else Animals And the animals Oh yeah Now I remember So what do you think this boat s purpose in this picture is What s the boat going to do Save them Save Okay So knowing that knowing that this is an ark and knowing that this is America what do you think Are these people being stopped or welcomed Welcomed Welcomed And how do we know that He s letting them in He s like come on let s go But how do we know that he s welcoming them and not telling them to stop Because it s the ark Because it says ark okay And we re connecting what we know about the ark to this picture That is called an allusion In English class you talked about allusion Allusion is when you refer to something that is famous Some famous piece of literature Okay The flag stands for freedom The scary devil looking thing is governments from other countries Take a second and copy that down Okay I ll go on to the next question How are the words How do the words in the cartoon tell you what the symbols mean Okay We talked about this already The U S Ark of Refuge are some of the words in the cartoon and they tell us that the boat is a symbol of the United States Okay Identify the cartoon s caption All right In this cartoon there is no caption There is no title at the top or at the bottom but there are some words that help us understand and that s this sign The sign says no oppressive taxes no expensive kings no compulsory military service So this is the promise of the United States to the immigrants To the traveling people Words or phrases used in the cartoon to identify objects or people in the cartoon Okay What words or phrases here can be used to identify I was going to say the ark Yeah The Ark of Refuge And what does it identify The ark It identifies the ark as what in this cartoon What is the ark The boat But what is it a symbol of Welcoming Yeah A symbol of welcoming people right Or a symbol of America itself because once you re in you re in America What words or phrases in the cartoon appear to be the most significant All right Calling the U S a refuge tells us people come here for safety We ll come back to it And here the sign says no taxes or oppressive kings Tell us why people left their countries To get good jobs Yeah To get jobs To have a better life Right What were they running away from From paying taxes From paying taxes From kings Now any guesses about what time period people would have been running away from taxes and kings 1900s 19th Century The 19th Century which would be the periods were very big Kings were a problem in some places in the world No oppressing taxes Even as far back as the revolutions in the 1700s people were dealing with this okay So you can use clues in a cartoon to figure out when the cartoon was written and sometimes things like these signs can help you figure that out All right List adjectives in the cartoon and what they mean What adjectives are in the cartoon It s on this sign for one thing Oh The kings Okay What did they call the kings Wealthy What did they call kings What kind of kings did they have It s kind of hard to read there Okay Here we go We ll do it this way Controlling Yeah More powerful than others Expensive can t see I know I know So oppressive means it s controlling Expensive means they spend too much money Yeah Compulsory means that you have to do something Compulsory military service means everybody has to join the army So some people might be running away from that because not everyone wants to be in the army The army s a fantastic place but not everybody wants to be there You do understand right Yes Okay Anybody not want to be in the army I want to serve my country Yeah Would you want to live in a country where everybody had to do it No I want to have a choice You want to have a choice I want my army to have chosen to be there Right Because I don t want a bunch of people there twiddling their thumbs and not wanting to be there okay Okay Describe the action in the cartoon Action I can t cover those I forgot to put the space bar Okay so what s happening in the cartoon We ve already said this Everybody s coming to Uncle Sam And what s happening The cloud is trying to get them away from Uncle Sam Right All right What is the message of the cartoon It s that we have to welcome the immigrants Correct The message of the cartoon is that the U S is welcoming immigrants who are trying to get away from places they don t like What special interest groups now this one I remembered to put the extra thing in there so you all have to think about it What special interest groups would agree or disagree with this cartoon Stop and take a second Turn to your partner See if you can think of somebody that would like this cartoon and somebody that would not like this cartoon Talk to you partner What is it Okay A special interest group Go ahead keep talking A special interest group is a group that talks to the government to try to get them to make laws for them okay So what kind of group would agree with the cartoon and what kind of group would not agree 
 Five four three two one stop I m going to follow the same norms you are so if I want to talk I m going to have to raise my hand Does anybody want to start us off Sort of an initial response or something that s been on your mind or a place we can go in the play to start this conversation In the last act when Emilia and Iago or Iago s been caught and Emilia is piecing together all of these things that Iago s done how it all works and she s telling the others around him what he s done he keeps telling her Be quiet this isn t your place to talk you shouldn t be here But whereas most stereotypical women would have just kind of followed what their husband wanted and just you know kind of been in the background Emilia actually stands up and says what she thinks is right Yeah okay What also talked about was how Desdemona kind of juxtaposes that in that she s like the very stereotypical housewife to the point at which she refuses to even like blame her husband for killing her so we kind of it s interesting how those two characters are just To touch on the racism part I would have to say it s not and at least if it is that isn t the main focus of the play I d say that it s focused more on these complex characters and their web of lies and the plot itself isn t focused on if it is I think because I don t really think it is I kind of agree with Chloe I don t think that Othello is a racist or sexist play It does have racism and sexism in it but that s because it was written by William Shakespeare in a time when that was the norm You can t really look at it as a modern person because we think of racism and sexism so differently from the audience it was intended for They thought of it as more of the norm so it does seem more normal Like it seemed believable and normal to them because that s just how their society was Then it also kind of looks at like how racism sort of caused it like Iago hates Othello and one reason that he gives is that he s black and he doesn t deserve his position and he kind of uses race to his advantage to do bad things So it s kind of looking at it s not racist it s looking at racism and sexism and saying like how they can be used and manipulated you know Yeah I kind of agree with you I think this play is really about like taking advantage of people any way you can So like if you have something on them like they re a different color or if they re a different sex then you can use that to your advantage by like putting that as an excuse almost to take advantage Let s return to that Raise your hand if Iago was your favorite character in this class Come on I mean this is a I have to say I agree I would raise my hand to that question which I find troubling because I certainly agree with some of the opinions that I m hearing here that we have this interesting contrast between Emilia and Desdemona as two different ways women can live with male violence and we also have this examination of how racism and sexism are used as part of the plot to take down Othello But at the same time I have to say I think that it feels to me like the play is set up for us like Iago more Iago talks to us he lets us into his world into his mind in a way that nobody else does So I d almost feel like we can t blame ourselves as the audience for identifying with him for secretly making part of us rooting for him or he even made me sort like glorying in his intelligence and his capacity for manipulation and just his power And I wonder what we do with that because if you walk away from this play being like I love Iago Then aren t you also kind of saying in a way celebrating what he s done Do you agree with me Disagree with me I think his ability to like his like logic and how he like plans things like how he like manipulates a lot of situations and how he like schemes to like use people s like baggage I guess to his advantage is kind of like I guess like the way he uses it isn t a good way but like if you could use it in a different way I guess it like could be viewed as like a good thing So I think there s a difference between like celebrating what he s done and just appreciating like the amount of thought and like intelligence that he has in using it in a bad way because like you can like Iago and like him for different reasons than Oh I like what he s done I like how he destroyed this person It can be just you know I realize that this is a very smart person and someone I really would not want to be on his bad side But like you just sort of you realize like how much I guess yeah I ll just use the word appreciate again You just appreciate like how much you understand his mind and it s just really interesting rather than you love him Yeah I think it s more like sometime s it s fun to like root for like the evil character Because you wouldn t actually do it like if you play video games like Grand Theft Auto Like you kill the hookers it s not like you would have to do that it s just that it s fun Oh my God Well it doesn t surprise me that Iago s the one that most people come away from the play with being like Yeah he s so great he s so interesting right Because like he s the only character that you actually get to know Everyone else just kind of like dies They get drunk and like stab people or they cry That s pretty much what everybody else does and then Iago s the one who like lets you in lets you know what he s thinking when he s bringing specific elements like with each person in the play he s different from each person and you can see that through the play Well as she was saying like how everyone else was crying and like going crazy or like either having an awful time or having a good time like they still trust Iago even though he s standing there not doing that with them I mean just like the way he s able to still convince them whenever he s not he doesn t seem like he s on the like he convinced them that he s on their side but he s not actually doing everything they are or he s not really doing anything to show them that s he s isn t feeling what they re feeling Alex I have a quote I guess It s at around there And their palates both for sweet and sour as husbands have what is it they do when they change us for others Is it sport I think it is And doth affection breed it I think it doth Is t frailty that thus errs It is so too And have we not affections desires for sport and frailty as men have Then let them use us well else let them know the ills we do their ills instruct us so So it s kind of like talking about how the men control the women and so I guess like that s like the sexism of the day or like of that era and like this is Emilia she s talking to Desdemona and she s talking about how like men control them and all their thoughts are kind of implanted by the men like Emilia like she got the handkerchief because her husband told her to do that and they re all just really obedient and everything Chloe I mean I think that yeah it has to do with the time period as far as the sexism in the play or whatever but I mean because that it s just the way it was but I think that when you look at the female characters in the play like Emilia she turns out to be one of the most influential characters and she s the one that takes down the bad person It s her that takes down Iago pretty much because she tells him the truth and then something that none of the men could do or even question Then the other thing I would say is that the women s loyalty to each other especially Desdemona to Emilia because it s back earlier in the play I don t actually have it but Emilia I mean Desdemona sings a song earlier in the play something Willow willow willow some more stuff about the song and then when Emilia s dying she sings a line from that exact same song and she says she references my mistress death So I think a lot of it shows how the women stick together It s also kind of like I mean I agree with you and I mean it s not sexist it looks at sexism because I mean you see how Desdemona is the stereotypical woman of that time and she kind of does what her husband tells her to she doesn t rebel against him she is completely loyal to him regardless of how he treats her I mean he s hit her and she just accepts it Even when he kills her she takes the blame and doesn t rat him out and it just kind of you have problems respecting her because of it Like I mean she s a good character but you just can t it s really hard to respect someone who just accepts everything that is done to her like that Then you have to juxtapose it with Emilia and she was a really influential character and is able to rise above and kind of try to take down her own husband and go against it It s kind of looking at sexism and saying like you know which is better for you Which do you like more Look at how the sexism and the roles of women has affected Desdemona and then how Emilia s been able to rise above it Can I jump in Yeah I definitely agree with you but my thoughts are also going back to Act I Scene III because I think at the beginning of the play Desdemona is very much not a stereotypical woman She has married the man she loves defying her father Knowing her dad wouldn t like it she ran off and married him anyway When Othello s talking about how he won her heart it was by telling the stories of the wars and it s actually very interesting because it says that Desdemona would seriously She would be very interested in these stories even to the point where she wished she had been born a man Then when Othello says I have to go to war and the Duke says Let s like Desdemona stay at her dad s house Desdemona says No I married this man to be with him Let me go to the war also So at least at that scene I think that she s a model of a very very active woman who wants to go to war with her husband she wants to be with her husband When Othello comes out in Act II Scene III to stop the fight between Cassio and Roderigo Desdemona comes out too and says What s going on what s wrong And Othello says Come away sweetie let s go back to bed Right I certainly agree that there s a passivity in Desdemona by the end but I don t know if I see that so much at the beginning Go ahead I agree I think that like sometimes Desdemona wants to be the stereotypical woman and then like other times she wants to be the like rebel kind of because like Mr Proctor said like she completely rebels against her dad at the beginning and then also like she s not the stereotypical woman because like every single man like in the play has admitted that she s the most beautiful woman that they want her and all this stuff and so she has some power over them too But yeah I just think it s interesting how like there are scenes where she s the complete like stereotypical housewoman and then other times she s like completely passive Even though it s been brought up that she defied her father to marry Othello she s still I feel like she s still very like part of that time period as far as the role of women because even though Othello wasn t her perfect husband in the eyes of her father she still jumped from the control of one man her father to another man her husband So Tanya Okay so about Desdemona I think that like even though she did that stuff she still was a stereotypical woman Like we said before those women they re supposed to be obedient to their husbands so like whenever she does kind of like rebel and do something different from or like kind of jump in to the conver like Mr Proctor was saying like those examples she s doing it for Othello She jumps in like she goes to war to be with him and then she comes in like whenever he s in trouble And then the thing about Emilia is she s doing stuff for herself Like in Act IV Scene III yeah that s what we read she s talking about how it s just like she would cheat on her husband once It s just like she says The world s a huge thing it is a great price for a small vice 
 Three Oh it makes like a cubic graph It s like a cube Oh whoa that s pretty cool What about what if only two of them are the same It s like a quadratic All right so as we go through the investigation now we re gonna look at try to come up with conjecture for that Numerically why do you think that happens If two factors are the same Because it makes like because if you have two factors are the same that s the same as like squaring one of the factors What happens if you square numbers They become positive I believe So it s always positive for that section Very nice Okay keep on keep on going with that All right Just say A B C D E etcetera E is the zeros of the law I m on the first one Why are they the same They re squared Go to Google Docs See if you can do files The file is gray Okay so what s gonna happen is you re gonna have a factor formula Unlike the other one we had it instead And what you want to look at is look at the factors and look at the zeros What s the relationship between the factors and zeros You may already know what the relationship is Can you predict what it s gonna be That the factors tell you the zeros Like the numbers and the factors tell you what the zeros are And why would that makes sense to you Oh because when it s X and you have a number after that that s where it is on the X axis So that could be where the zeros in a set right maybe Teresa does that make sense to you You look kinda confused Like so X minus one is No that is wrong then Well here look at your flag Look right here It s sittin right here So X minus one So that s one So there s one one And then X minus two is the there too Oh so it s the opposite of the form So if you haven t factored form then you know that it s even zero Yeah yeah It would be equal to zero right Yeah you re right Remember in algebra one the zero chronic thing Yeah All right so that does make sense Does the end behavior make sense It s in factored form but what s the degree of that It s three It s the third degree And what does a third degree what did we learn last time It can intersect three times It can intersect three times Does it Yeah And what s the end date Down and up Down and up And it is right Yup So that makes sense That does make sense Why don t you try it with quadratic factor here And why don t you put in an extra factor Just edit that Just add that X whatever something we ve not used yet What s the F in this one The eraser But you added this one right Yeah So what do we except s gonna happen How many zeros are we gonna get this time Four What s the degree So what should the end behavior be Because you weren t here last time so let s see if you pick it up So if it s fourth degree what s gonna happen on the right What s gonna happen on the left Both Good Yay High five Get rid of the space after the parenthesis Which one Between the parenthesis and the F Yeah add a space There s not an F See the sliders here This F was there to start out with So just delete it then Yeah just delete that So X minus E is just that So we expect did it come out the way you excepted it to come out Yeah there s four zeros And if you slide those zeros go ahead and slide some zeros and see if it still makes sense Oh that s good Oh because it changes whatever the final one would be at So if we had like X plus something where is the actual zero Oh it is X plus something it s the actual place that it is instead of the opposite of the place So if we say X X plus three where s the zero Negative three Does that make sense Because X plus three equals zero Yeah All right what s the next question on there Does the Y intercept change All right so let s look at your zeros and look at your Y intercept As you change the sliders does the Y intercept change We can t see our Y intercept you gotta scroll out Mr Dillard would you get me me the mouse over there The silver one Yeah it s a lot easier to do this with a mouse I got it Other way Because the Y intercept is Now it might be really Yeah it s right there Why don t we try making some of these factors smaller so that we can see it a little better I got it Oh fine I see how it is Okay can you see it It s like at negative 15 Okay is there a relationship between that Y intercept and the factors Or the zeros Why don t you guys talk it over What are the zeros So the zeros are what are the zeros And the zeros are all the numbers that are they re the opposite of this So it would be negative two four and a half and one Wait what s the Y intercept It s 15 Two Yeah it s down here It s actually 18 And it s negative 18 Four and a half times two is nine times two is 18 times one It s 18 You multiply all the end numbers together and you get the Y intercept Well that s nice That is cool But why does that make sense Why would that work Why does that work Oh Because to get the Y intercept the Y intercept doesn t have an X value so you just in order to factor this equation you would just multiply all the end ones to get it Oh yeah because it s the numbers after X like almost zeros zeros Well are the numbers after X the actual zeros If it said X plus three The roots X plus three what would the zero be for that Negative So they re the inverse of the zeros The opposite The opposite yeah You have to be careful with the word inverse because it has a lot more meaning All right so if we know what the zeros are and we multiply those and we got the Y intercept right Yeah What about A What happens when you slide A around Does that change Slide A around I already know what should happen You can just use the mouse I can t click it Move Oh that s why It changes the middle one Did it change the zero Start with that Does it change the zeros at all No No No it doesn t change the zeros Well okay go back to It s not changing the zero Well actually Well it s just changing it s steepness Yeah it s changing it s steepness and the width but it s not changing the zeros Well yeah it does because when it s flat then every number s changed But when its flat but that s only If A is zero since they re multiplying everything by A then if A is zero everything is zero So yeah you have a zero degree polynomial at that point Yeah Yeah Okay so other than when A is zero All it s changing is the steepness of the graph And not changing the zeros So does that change the Y intercept Um yes it is changing the Y intercept But I think it still works out as um you can still multiply all of them together Does that make sense Check and see if it still works Oh whatever A is is A is the opposite of the Y intercept Because if A is four then the Y intercept here is or that might just be Well that s a good conjecture Check some of the other things and see if it still works Um try changing yeah Yeah no that s not right That would be cool It was just the way I had it And that s one of the nice thing with the sliders because you might see a connection but you can quickly see if it works for all cases and not just one case The Y intercept is six Yeah it s still ah when you change A it s still going to effect the Y intercept and as changing as multiplying all the numbers together and then multiplying by A Does that make sense Yeah So all those numbers multiplied together is still six Keep going with this because the next thing we re gonna look at is what happens when some of the zeros are the same When we use the factor more than once Okay Keep going Are we on six now Yes What happens when two or more factors are the same So make E and E I m gonna make them all three I work hard for you guys you criticize me Um the E the E Oh it makes the when they re the same Try changing one of them Try changing one of the sliders We figured that one It just turns out to be the opposite So go ahead and change one slider Just pick one other than A Pick B or something like that The opposite of that variable becomes the Y intercept That doesn t explain the zeros Now something we want to find out Is there a relationship between the zeros and the Y intercept Oh there is When you change the Y then the zeros equal the opposite of the Y intercept Okay what happens if you change two No it doesn t Oh yeah yeah it does Oh yeah zero does The one that isn t the same numerical I think The right most zero becomes it When you move them the Y intercept and the zero both change at the same rate Because if you move like C steadily to the left once C is two negative two Jacob said Half the time when you multiply them all together you get it Yeah that s what we re discussing The absolute value of the Y intercept and then the absolute value of the zero if two of the factors are the same that s in If all of the variables are the same except one of them it becomes the zero it becomes the zero and the opposite of the Y intercept So now as you slide you ll actually be able to see the Y intercept If you set all the variables the same and change one of them it becomes the zero and the opposite of the Y intercept Okay so on Dave s right here Yeah the multiplication in case you like if you multiply all the zeros together you get the opposite of the Y intercept Does it have to do with the factor formula Yeah Yeah So the absolute value of the If you multiply the zero So does it make sense algebraically Yes Why does it make sense algebraically When you find the factor with that new grouping you have to it becomes the opposite But Y intercepts algebraically Because the Y intercept is when all the X s are zeros so you re just left with the one that doesn t have an X on it And that is the multiplication of all the factors All the numbers 
 Do you want to measure this separately Or do you want to measure this with the ground water Should we measure this separately Yea cause that s the round rocks Okay what were you saying Cathy Why is the ground water cleaner Because the permeable rocks They clean the water on its way down to the soil saturation There s 100 milliliters and you guys could you record the data real quick Write Ground oh no but we ve got to add this first Yea Wait we ve got to add Is it still But let s do the Is that too much Let s do the answer for number one while we re on it Okay It says Good job Describe what you would do Stop But why is your head right down level with the measurement We re doing that so we can make sure it s exactly even cause if we go over then we won t know exactly how much it is And are you measuring the runoff or the ground water right now Right now we re measuring the runoff It was about 380 It was about 380 Is it okay to get an approximate amount for the volume for this and not an exact amount I think so cause then when we measure this we could still Exactly Ashlyn which had more water Your runoff or your ground water The ground water The ground water had more Yeah Yeah cause they re overflowing Oh my goodness Have you measured your ground water yet Not yet I think you can see it for video Where is your ground water Oh oh I see Oh so this really did overflow Yes So when you measure your ground water what will you need to do with the water that s here in the tray I think put it in with the ground water Yea and measure that too Okay this is your runoff Yes Okay so so far you have how much About 380 And then there s some in here Oh you ve already measured 380 About Oh So that s 100 You are pouring that so carefully Jade Stop Good Because we want to have it exact so I had to Okay Ashlyn So Jade put in 100 once and then she put 100 in a second time So how much water has she put in there so far 200 How did you get 200 Um Be sure you talk nice and loudly honey Because I got it because plus it equals 200 because you put two in there Nice Good job Looks like you re doing great kids 60 Keep going Keep going Looks like it might have been slightly off Better watch it go Okay so maybe if we I think that s good but should we add the should I add the data in now No we needed that did you pour on water because that also Wow looks like we re getting a lot of data Your recharge is high Trial number one why do you say runoff had more water in trial number one I think because it clay s more harder so it s kind of more difficult to go through with So what is this number 790 What is this number 62 And which is greater 790 Yea 790 s greater than 62 Good for you honey How did you get this number dear I think we added them up What did you add up honey 790 and 600 I mean 62 To get this total Yeah Great I have a question for this group though How much water did you pour in on trial one 1 000 1 000 what Milliliters 1 000 milliliters But your total is only 852 milliliters It s still in the zone of saturation Oh Or it hasn t collected off the first Alright But it s interesting maybe the water from last time since we only had 852 ending last time Maybe this time the second sort of Maybe it some might against the window if the water from last time I wonder if it came down in the aquifer I wonder Maybe it s just holding it in there I wonder it ll be interesting to measure this time So what part do you have in your lab note We re adding we re have to answer question two and then we re measuring Describe what you observed when you poured the water over the ground water the second time What changed Taylor you go first Um well I think what changed is since the clay sort of got use to the water the first time and there wasn t very much water on the recharge water the first time and it got used to the clay got used to the water that there are little cracks or the water slipped through the sides and it went and now we ve got more recharge water than we had on our first one Do you think that could happen in real life Do you think we could have an impermeable surface like clay and then it could crack and let water through Why do you think that could happen in real life Some place that might happen for real A bunch of pressure If it rains for like millions and millions of years maybe like cement or gravel It would break it down and it would have like a little Do you remember the term for that Weather rock Yeah Weather rock Like what s in the middle of the road Yeah sure yeah Because when people drive on it it gets so much pressure And people keep driving on it and it cracks sometimes Sure And I m sorry I interrupted you when you were answering question number two I wonder if the I doubt anyone would do this but if we put pollution on clay If you put what honey Pollution on like cement of something I would wonder if it would get through Like sort of like water sometimes and since the clay s impermeable water can t get through it easily but I wonder if pollution would That s a good question you might want to do that experiment when you re done with this one That d be great to check Good job The clay became more permeable the second time we added the water Yes And then we should probably measure how much is in here Yes Oh that s kind of Yea because it s like soapy It is sort of soapy I think it s because of the clay being wet Look on this side Oh yeah I can see some of the white So why is the about 120 Because it s not quite at 150 but it s a little bit over 100 Is close close enough for this Or how do you know when close is close enough for this Um we know when it s close enough for this because it doesn t really have an exact measurement for 120 so we know that it s kind of half way between 150 and 100 little bit lower than 125 There s a lot more recharge than last time A lot more recharge Yeah We had 760 now we have 435 Holy cow The first time you did this you had 760 Milliliters Milliliters of runoff And this time we had 435 milliliters Oh that is a big change I wonder I wonder what will happen with your recharge have you measured that yet Yeah what was it It was I think it was 871 Oh my goodness Why do you think you had so much more recharge the second time you did this Christian Probably because the ground probably got more moist so it would make it easier to slip right through Do you remember the term for that When the ground gets all wet with water Soil saturation Great Well yea I mean the water level must have gotten higher Why do you say that Because the bigger the saturation is and the higher the water table is the more moist the ground is The ground is so the water can go through easier I think the first time we did it the water went through which made it easier for the second time to go through Cause it made it more moist And the rock pebbles were kind of scattered around probably mixed with the water So that s the pattern you re seeing What do you predict will happen on your third trial I m thinking that there will be maybe maybe possibly more recharge than runoff More recharge than runoff Did you have more recharge than runoff the second time No but we always have the tape on and it s less than 100 So they started like this and now they re equal and now you think the third time they ll Yea Oh Because probably since the soil s even more moist now that it will make it go through the cracks And Jasper what did your group discuss that you observed the second time you poured in the water that was different from the first time you poured it in The runoff water was kind of even with the recharge But before you measured it before you were just making your observations and watching what did you observe That the first time that there was there was more runoff because the dirt wasn t that moist Oh Great so that s what you wrote down for your number two And I have a question for you Christian How much water are you the drain person Yeah How much rain did you pour in on trial number one 1 000 milliliters So this is interesting How much did you measure after trial number one 900 So what happened to the rest of the water It stayed into the soil Oh So that s why the soil s all wet Cause there s still water underneath it So it s like How did you get 100 Because 900 plus 100 equals 1 000 Good job Alright I ll leave you to it Four three five would equal Okay we need to have less water than the last time 
 the fact that he couldn t do it because he didn t have enough money to do it What would you do in that situation Would you try to get money Isn t this kind of different because we re all girls Yeah but If it was a boy and he was the one who didn t have money Do you feel like the chapters that we read do you feel like you could tell what Pip was going to be doing Kind of You could tell that he was becoming more stuck up wants to change himself and not be around the poor people Are you doing the discussion director Did you do any questions in regards to his did you have any direct questions with regards to the text Yeah One of them was like how did Pip change from the beginning of the book to where he s at now like his character and basically how he acted What was the question I missed Brianna where you said about the girls I didn t hear the question I just heard your response His was in Chapter 29 when he is becoming part of her marriage he was just like how would you feel or whatever None of us really had an answer because the situation is different like it s different for the guys She s the one who s like the rich girl Who s the recording one So on page 128 paragraph two that s where Herbert tells Miss Havisham s story That s important because it kind of explains why she is the way that she is He explains that you meet Miss Pocket and then she s kind of like he kind of explains why she s kind of crazy All right Chapter 8 was interesting because he was home from war and in the camp He started to treat people He treated them like they were all heroes And he shared the cigarettes with him one time He shared the cigarettes with them and was even When he was amongst the Russians he didn t care They were struggling to survive He felt sorry for them which as a connector I ve connected it to I don t know if you guys have seen Tears of the Sun I have And Avatar In Tears of the Sun he wanted to go and try to rescue people but he got stuck behind enemy lines like they re struggling people too trying to gain their freedom And then same thing in Avatar Paul kind of reminded me of how he was behind and he was with the Russians but he thought that they weren t as bad as he the military was the only bad part about them Civilians he felt sorry for them that they had to go through all this They were being killed Their people were being killed And they were actually just regular people trying to make it Everybody was dying because they used all this stuff in the military and they weren t caring about the civilians The prisoners They were They had to trade whatever they had to get like a couple supplies to the refugees He started to wonder like why are people higher up people he d never met forcing them Yeah So then this whole section made me think about that So I thought that could be like the controversial part to talk about This whole section Which whole section The one you were just talking about They re talking about magic Yeah They re talking about the magic and being invisible and then he and scares them away It really showed a struggle between Antonio internally with religions Yeah In one he had keys and then in the other one it was totally crazy Yeah That s my next section is that dream I think it s page 119 That whole dream is really important because it s like it kind of highlights what I just said about how he might be the next person or whatever He goes to this dream and it s kind of the same thing he s been facing through the whole book his mom s side versus his dad s side And Ultima kind of comes out and is like Well you are both You have to find a happy medium It s all within the world of his dreams And then page 139 One part that I thought was really really important was his brother at the brothel These two chapters I think they re kind of jam packed I just kind of picked stuff that would be good to talk about And then page 139 paragraph three they re talking about how the group can be buried in the casket of time I just felt that was informative and something that we should look at Just pretty much the whole funeral The funeral was good styling Like I don t know these four chapters There was no part where you didn t It s like read these four chapters Exactly After I read the chapter I wrote some questions down The first one is what did the contrast between the golden carp and the black bass how the golden carp made the black bass jump And his missing of the bass symbolizes maybe like a win for Abel The golden carp story was just very interesting The whole controversy is that he s Catholic but part of him really wants to believe in this whole It s not like he wasn t interested in it but he still didn t believe But then he still respected the story itself and the respect of the carp It made me feel like the golden carp would bring it up Could Antonio It made me feel that Antonio s struggle between his mother s beliefs and his father s how his father was like on the corpse strewn shore I remember there was something like when you re in the ocean it s the same water It s like Ultima came in She was like You don t pick one You re both That s it You can t just choose one path You should be a priest cowboy I think the way it was portrayed was like because of the way he was brought up it was kind of showing the negative She s brought up She s not there but she s brought up too much I feel like she s a goal though to be like be some kind of spirit type thing He hopes that she s like someone who s not fake So I guess he s trying to like make things work with everyone else and see like what his relationship with other people and to finally be able to call a I feel like he compares all of his relationships to her He has that standard Didn t he point out like all the flaws of her That was just creepy I was just like Poor guy to have all of these weird awkward dreams I m going to say foreshadowing I m sticking by that and saying Ultima s going to die and he s going to be the new I m sticking by that and that s foreshadowing Look at you go All of those things are foreshadowing or are they just predicting something that happened in the past Most of them Well I think the one where remember where he went into a brothel in the one dream Right Exactly So I think that most of the dreams are foreshadowing They re not showing directly what happens but hints Basically I m a beast We don t even have to read the rest of the book because I just gave it to you Because we know what s happening I said also in chapter 14 the bad dream what do you make of it Is he seeing the sinners as deserters that all witches are being spun out and that he needs to step forward Or does the golden carp have like stronger power What do you think it symbolizes I think there are good witches and there are bad witches The bad witches are the ones that should be like That s Antonio s issue as well I think he s kind of figured out that there s something different about Ultima I think he s kind of figured out that he s kind of just like Oh they re evil and she s good If she s a witch then she s evil So it s kind of this contrast of can a witch be good It s kind of like the question of what he wants to believe versus It kind of relates to the Civil War and the Africans and their personal stuff It kind of relates to that The white people they didn t want to believe that they re intelligent and they re friends He doesn t want to believe that a witch can be good because he s been told otherwise And he s a Catholic and witches are evil I think that the golden carp symbolizes perhaps the rebirth I think the two most important themes symbol figures are the owl and the carp

 5 03 5 03 All right let s talk for a minute before you continue with your little test First of all let s talk about motion What do you know about motion Motion is the way that you get from one place to another It s changing position Changing position so just now Bailey was running was he changing position Yes Yes all right so how do we know that he was in motion Like when he is running toward me how do I know he s in motion That stays there and you can see him coming up Nobody else was moving around So that s our frame of reference He came over there so we know he s coming toward us All right so you guys did a trial How many times did you run Bailey Three All right so what are we gonna do now We re gonna have to add them all up and divide them by three Why are we dividing by three Because we did it three times Okay you did it three times You re finding your average What s another word for average Mean Mean good All right so let s find his mean or his average And then we ll record that and double check to make sure the whole group has the same amount or the same number Okay what did you get 5 21 5 21 is that what everybody has Nathan maybe you redo yours and just check since three people have that Let s name some things that are in motion What do you know that s in motion The earth The earth is in motion yup But I don t feel the earth move so how do I know it s in motion Cause sun is the frame of reference Okay so if I was thinking of the sun which is what they do and the earth we know we could see the earth is moving and the sun would be your frame of reference What else do you know that moves Animals Animals Insects Cars Insects cars Boats People People books Boats Boats All right so how are we gonna find our speed because now we know how many seconds it took him but what s something else that I need to know besides how long it took him The distance The distance traveled which is a hundred feet So what difference did we do Hundred feet A hundred feet Okay so what s the first thing you have to do is measure out your hundred feet Yes You did that and chalk marked it Good all right so let s We re talking about the average time taken All right so let s do that now 19 So let s talk about what that means 19 19 Feet per second What s that mean Feet per second 19 feet per second So if I say feet per second can you explain that to me What does that mean 19 feet per second Every second I would go 19 19 feet Good okay so if I m driving in my car and my car s going 70 miles per hour and I m on the interstate do I say my car s going 75 No No you d say miles per hour bleh 70 miles per hour Can you tell me Nathan why What does that mean 70 miles per hour 70 miles per hour means you re going 70 miles per each hour For every hour so that s good to know for vacations right Especially when you have little kids who are saying Are we there yet You gotta figure out how long it s gonna take you Are we there yet Right okay All right you re going to go into your next part and I ll be right back to check on you Who s the next person Jordan It s gonna be Jordan All right Miss Jordan Hold the longest tape and put it down right here so it will stay up He thinks he needs one more piece of tape Ready Ready Set go 1 76 1 89 Okay so why don t you write them both Do you have two spots Only have one You have two spots write one there and one there That s what you do there just like that What did you get 1 89 1 89 All right let s come talk about what you re doing So let s get the three kinds of balloons that you re testing Just gonna bring over here Dan why don t you get the um come slide that over here so we can get that tape off and get ready for the next one We might try that one here So we have A big round one A big round one a green one okay A long one Okay And a birthday one Did you all predict the same one would be the fastest or do you have different predictions Different Different predictions what do you think The Happy Birthday one You think the Happy Birthday one Long Long Long Long Can you tell me why you think Happy Birthday and then you ll tell me why you think long At first my prediction was the long one because it was not as much wind blowing against it But now there s wind blowing It blew it to the sides and putting more force against it which slowed it down and made the long go faster It d be like this wind Yes You had this big That is a pretty good prediction Why do you guys think it s gonna be the long one I think it s the long one because it s more smaller and the air can come off faster and it s more stretchier Stretchier Tight it s more tight All right all right we had some wasn t going all the way so we changed it to 20 It would stop about maybe three feet away from the end It would stop so what did you decide to do We changed it to 20 You moved it to 20 Okay so What else could you have done besides move it to 20 Blow up the balloon more Maybe blow up the balloon more Maybe the little one wouldn t have worked though huh It s not that much in there We tried the big red one putting more air but it still stopped The little one I think the wind kind of changed how fast it would go and how far All right so All right So let s come back this way Watch out behind you Megan Dan you can go over to There s motion in the wind huh 176 and 108 All right so here we go What are you gonna do first Let s do the round balloon first That was nobody s prediction right Nope So let s do that one first What are we gonna do 20 Add both up And then what are you gonna do Divide by two Why are we dividing by two To get the average To get the average Why did you do it twice Why didn t you just And there s two the two trials Why you did two trials Why wouldn t you just do one Why do you think that would ve been better to do two Divided by Then we wouldn t have to divide it we wouldn t have to find the average at all But I guess we d get a better result What d you get there 2 35 3 73 That s what I got 2 35 You add these two together and you divide them Remember this is the average Can you have four I divided by two but I got 3 73 Let s try again On the calculator I always do things twice to double check 2 35 2 35 Everybody s good Okay so let s go down to the bottom of our sheet and we are going to figure out our average speed So what s our formula for that How do we figure out average speed You do 20 because of the Okay so that s when we took 20 because you see we had 30 on our sheet because originally we were doing 30 So let s cross out you changed it to 20 And I think it was Dan that said if we were to probably no Hannah said we could probably could put more air in that balloon But changing the feet that ll work Now how fast did the first balloon go 19 35 by 20 Look at your formula again 8 52 Your distance is 20 so you re gonna do your distance divided by your average time Good 8 51 Okay and I ll come back to check on you you All right let s see how these guys are doing This one s a runner The line s over here right Jordan 16 16 We re at the end of Nathan s so let s go ahead and figure out Nathan together I ll come sit in your spot They re in here So to figure out Nathan let s talk about it together while we re doing it We need some more calculators over here Wait what s this 641 Everybody please do catch up Got your pencils Wait wait 641 575 Tell me again what we re doing average time 6 08 Does everybody have six Read it back correctly Six point O eight Is that how you read it correctly in math Six decimal Do we say decimal Six Six point zero eight Do we say point Six and And Eight hundredths Six and eight hundredths Ohhhh Gotta get it So let s look just at our average time for just a second Stop for a minute and let s look at the top at our average time How do we know who is going the fastest when we re look at just the top part just the time Average time The lowest The lowest number right cause he s getting in the fastest time So now when we go to the bottom and we re figuring out the speed how do we do speed Whoever s the lowest number The highest number The highest number it s going to be Let s go ahead and do Nathan and then we ll compare then we ll let Demi do hers 16 point 16 point 16 44 right Yep So let s look so far at the bottom Bailey Jordan and Nathan Who is the fastest So far Bailey So far Bailey okay so how can we instead of looking at this this looks like a whole bunch of numbers to me What can I do visually just to make it a little bit clearer Make a bar graph Okay we can make a bar graph with this Anything else we can do Line graph Maybe get each person to make a line graph Take your own three times and make a line graph with your own three times Because that would be you right over time That would be a great idea So we can do the straight line graphs That s a good idea with the line graph Bailey So when we make a line graph we ll do that at the end using this information and then we ll do a bar graph using this information Does that sound good All right Demi s turn s up Let s go Let s see how we are doing here Okay we re at the very end So which one ended up being the fastest The long one The long one But I think that Devon had a very good prediction I think his reasoning was good See that wind blowing In a race when you re in a race and you re running or when you re in a foot ball team what side do you want to be on if you have the ball and you re trying to get that ball to the other side You want the wind to be with you right Because if you re against the wind the wind is pushing on you so I think Devon had an excellent Good job Devon next time All right we re at the bottom Why do you think that balloon was the fastest I put The shape of it the wind went right past it All right remember there was unbalanced force So the force inside the balloon where was the force The wind the air The air that Devon blew inside that balloon the air inside pushed the balloon and that s what made it travel and it was an unbalanced force so when you let go It probably was the fastest because even though the wind was blowing it s on a round part to where it would spin and the wind would just roll off of the balloon and it would just make the balloon roll but it would still go as fast as it usually goes That s a pretty good idea too It s kind of like when you re driving a car if you re on vacation sometimes your parents you may see them driving behind a 18 wheeler Why do you think they would do that Because the wind blocks the Because the wind is blocking 18 wheel blocks it The 18 wheeler s blocking the wind so you can get more miles per hour I mean you can get better gas mileage doing that If you ever see your parents doing that Some people don t like to do that though because of rocks Rocks yeah it could be dangerous Yeah it could be dangerous becuase of rocks Good job 
 Counting on that I agree with AJ but also I think that What I want to say is that it kind of adds a lot more risk when they get rid of the space shuttle because kind of like what AJ was saying it s good to have a backup just in case you want it And we still do need to go up to space every now and again if we want to maintain stuff up there So we know that so we re having other people work with it but the problem is is that actually adds more risk because now we have to deal with the fact that What if they messed up What if they blow up or do something wrong And if they re not as stringent on safety standards as we are then there s gonna be a lot more problems and if it s not able to do the same things that s going to be completely bad too Okay Eric said Go up to fix things What would be some things that we would need to make sure that we re going up to maintain in space Just to kind of follow up International Space Station Okay International Space Station Some of the satellites we have in orbit Okay satellites that do what for us Television and communication Okay Ms McCall what s that one with the sun that is predicting the sun flares You can just write Sun Probe Sun probe That s fine Excuse me while I turn this on And the Hubble Hubble s gone a lot longer than they expected it to so if it breaks we d want to repair it Especially since we don t have a new one Alana I know how Mer was talking about the risks like with the Challenger and that was really devastating but I remember the wife whose husband died on Challenger She said that he knew the risks That s part of being an astronaut and being in NASA and willing to go up there and you re risking your life It s not like they went in there totally blind about that I think that s kind of the price of gaining so much knowledge about something so unknown right now We have to be able to risk our lives to get it and if they have people willing to do that I say go for it Okay Blanca and then Megan I get what she s saying with they risked their lives but you re also risking the money and time that everyone has put into it They spent all this time and all this money on these ginormous space things and to put them up into space And like the Challenger it just exploded and they didn t even really get that far just for one minor error And I don t think they should cut all the way like they were saying Have it just when you need it but it s still a lot of money that our country doesn t really have right now so maybe it s not the most important thing and there s other things that they need to fix before they can go back to putting more money into that We ll go Megan then Bieber So you know how we re paying Russia to fly up to the International Space Station I think what we should do is have a shuttle and have people pay us to ride up to the space station Because then we have more funding for NASA and then we have a shuttle Then people know they can get us instead of giving all this money to Russia to fly up there I feel like we should still have our own shuttle so that we can fly up not for free but we can fly up with the United States and then have open seats for other countries who need to come in They can pay us for it and then we get the money Okay Bieber you need to sit close Eli then we ll go Rachel I don t know what color to show but Russia s not making a profit off of us riding up there They re just trying to cover their costs It s not like we ll be doing good business ferrying people to the International Space Station It s not like a tourist attraction or anything It s pretty bland up there Russia s just trying to pay to get us up there That s the cost of flying somebody there They re not making profit out of it Okay good that s a downpoint Rachel I agree with what Eli said and also people were talking earlier about jobs and how it creates a bunch of jobs And I think I read somewhere that they created 25 000 jobs or something like that But if you think about it if there s 300 million people that s still less than 1 of the population So while it seems like a big number it s still not creating as many jobs and we could be creating other jobs somewhere else Especially with the economy so we could be spending the money that we would be spending on NASA on something else to help boost our economy before we start focusing more on NASA and spending billions of dollars Amber then Clark I was going to say I kind of agree with that because our economy is so bad right now Any kind of job that is offered will be really good for us right now at this point in time So I don t think cutting the funding for it would be a really smart idea because that s also putting a lot of people out of work Clark The statistics with the jobs created are probably from when NASA was being used a lot and now that it s been cut down already all those jobs have already been cut And I don t think in this economy people need jobs requiring that much education not everybody has that kind of education to have a job like that People just need regular jobs in general So you re saying their employment would be kind of geared towards upper level educated as opposed to maybe And like in science and stuff and not everybody has that That s a downpoint Luis Going back to the billions of dollars that are wasted or could be used for better things I found out that the funding for NASA only accounts for 0 7 of the US government spending I feel like if you just cut all of that that s not really going to make a huge difference when the government s spending 99 3 on other things We ll go Hallie then Troy Going back to the risk of sending people out into space I researched and I found out that the risk of manned space flights are actually increasing because the budget cuts have already happened As we re pushing for more people and more money we re actually hurting ourselves more because the safety and quality assurance programs have been trimmed back The risk is just becoming more and more That s an interesting point As we re slowly cutting back on the budgets already we re automatically increasing that risk because of those budget cuts Troy I actually support them cutting the budget because for one when they cut budget they re setting aside money to buy more space exploration from private companies Those people are more likely to employ more employees than the government which also stimulates the economy a lot more I mean if everybody s employed by the government like what could happen to Greece Okay Shannon hasn t spoken Bieber Kind of off of what Holly said with the risk and everything going up I did a little research and with NASA there was only a 4 1 fatality rate Out of something like 439 astronauts there have only been 18 deaths I feel like there are other jobs with a higher fatality rate than being an astronaut Okay so even with the budget cuts we re not seeing this huge increase Jillian A lot of people are making the points that it s only affecting the people that are on the space shuttles but at the same time I don t think people realize the amount of carbon dioxide put off by one shuttle launch It s 28 tons of carbon dioxide and it s killing the plants and fish around the site area and it has a lot of negative effect on everyone not just the people in the space shuttle So you re taking the environmental aspect Besides looking at costs besides looking at jobs there s this environmental piece specifically with carbon dioxide What is the issue associated with carbon dioxide Jillian The ozone layer depleted and global warming Thank you global warming Tyler To go along with what Luis said they only get 0 7 of the national spending but we also have gained more knowledge from NASA than any other government thing We can discover maybe how Earth is going to end and we can discover things that are more important than other government government spending So you re kind of going at the idea that the benefits are outweighing the small amount of cost when we compare government spending We ll go Eli then Justin Also Luis said it doesn t account for very much of the US budget and if we cut that spending it s really not going to go to anything more productive Maybe more guns or something It s not going to feed the world and buy food for homeless people It s just going to go to corporations and wars And then in regards to CO2 emissions does anyone know how much CO2 emissions a moose puts out in a year Far more than a truck driver Cows and moose I think they can flirt over that I think that s just moose So you re making the comparison to say the idea that even though it s a human made craft if we look at natural sources of the CO2 emission And the relative frequency that a moose passes gas A space shuttle launch doesn t have that big of an effect on the environment Touche Anyone have a cup that hasn t spoken yet that wants to jump in real quick Justin Going off of what Tyler said if we stop funding NASA then we pretty much cut off studying anything outside of our solar system because of the atmosphere of Earth just doesn t allow us to see that far So it would lessen the chances of seeing the birth of a star or the death of a star or where earth might be heading in the future Interesting point Amber then Eric Besides everything about the jobs NASA has created a lot of things that have helped us today different technologies Like in someone s presentation they were saying something about they re creating lighter systems for firefighters and then cosmetic companies are even using their stuff So there s a lot of technology that s been created because of NASA so I think it s benefited us a lot more than it hasn t helped us And so you re saying those products that have been produced because of the exploration are useful to us in our everyday lives It s not just useful for exploring many new things I forgot my order Was it Eric on that one I have a couple different connections One of them s with the cost Like they re saying it s 0 7 of the total budget but the thing is not only is it that low of a cost it s 14 billion just to give you an actual number It s 14 billion dollars for the entire budget of NASA This year just for this year alone To give you a comparison it s around 640 between 680 for the military budget That is 47 times more expensive Now you can say Well alright that s the military The thing is that first of all it has a lot higher mortality rate Second of all it s a lot less productive in general I mean we re pretty much paying people to kill other people on the planet I m sorry but that s not very cool in general For one of those things we re trying to get a high fatality rate not for our side but the other side But the other thing is that for jobs creations if you want to create more jobs and you re going for a more positive feel you wouldn t decrease funding for NASA you would increase funding Because think about it If you increased it 47 times to the military I m pretty sure you d get a lot more than one million even a lot lot more than just one million jobs from NASA if you increased this funding a lot because imagine whole new planets Just for environment alone is the fact that we have seven billion people on this planet and with seven billion people we can t hold that many people very long on this planet But there are so many other planets out there that we could easily fit everyone There s enough planets in this entire galaxy for each person to have their own planet That s how many planets there are So you re thinking planning for the future that it might be beneficial for us Holly As I was researching I found out that there s really no short term benefits and we re not guaranteed long term benefits Yes we are learning about things outside of our solar system and universe but the main goal of studying outside the universe is so eventually it could help us We re not guaranteed to find some new way to cure cancer or to protect the earth from magnetic storms There might be some way we can save ourselves but we re not guaranteed that So you re saying the unknown part of that research kind of plays into the factor We can keep researching but we may never find the answer Monique you got some info Yeah I think when Hepetiah said how benefits outweigh the budget and the risks we ve talked about what was up there The benefits are so much longer than what we have in the risk section We gain knowledge we need to study the sun probe and Hubble and International Space Station With jobs it provides a whole section of jobs having shuttles go up to space Not only that but they ve created new inventions through that and I think the inventions they have created is really important at home and in the hospital Going from there there s going to be more Not just stopping now So again tying in the cost benefit analysis that the benefits are much more outweighing the costs A J and then we ll go Alana I guess to counter what Troy said and what a few people have said when they talk about that more jobs can be created using the money It s not just about the economy When you think about it NASA wasn t meant to help the economy at all and it wasn t meant for job creation even though it has employed so many people Through the research that I did there was a story from somebody that s going to be retiring just because he knows he d lose his job anyway He said that After 30 years this is all I know We re losing the most brilliant minds our country has because they just don t know what else to do NASA s been open for decades and that s their job Technicians and analysts they re not going to just become accountants or something There s nothing after NASA That s probably the highest most prestigious thing What do you do after that It s not like they re just going to fill minimum wage jobs which is what most people are looking for right now anyway if you re thinking about job creation It s a good point you have all these highly educated specialized people as A J points out Where are they going to go Are they going to be able to find jobs within our country Are they going to go overseas and then maybe be helpful and more productive for other countries It s a good point Alana then Troy I know we re talking a lot about the cost benefit and job creation but I want to go back to the safety and I have a question for everyone just to think about The main part in all the failed missions especially with the shuttle and the Challenger it s basically been human error You know they talk about how the higher guys wouldn t listen that it was too cold outside and the ring would break and everything but I ve been thinking what if we were to use some sort of higher technology instead of relying on human and the possible errors that we make Like robots we use robots to build half our cars and that probably cuts down a lot on the human error rate So do you think using more robotic and higher technology than just humans would that help in any way with the safety issue and the errors that we make That s an interesting point We ll have to put that on the question board Troy what you got Kind of to counter what A J said these people are highly educated Minimum wage places are probably the ones that are hiring the least Companies with a lot of money are the ones that are hiring them now People that have highly specialized degrees they re really intelligent and they could be working at places like in finance Those people are being hired a lot more than people that have financial degrees If you can do quantitative physics those people are going to be hired a lot more than someone who s just a finance agent So your counterpoint is the idea that because they re so highly educated they will find some sort of a niche Yeah There s a lot of people that actually get degrees in rocket science and end up going into finance because it pays better Interesting Jillian Back to what Alana said if you re using robots to make it safer that s also just going to cost more money to make those robots and to find people that can make those robots If you re using robots as the engineers then you re having people lose jobs Interesting point So kind of a counterpoint to shifting our focus from human exploration to robotics there s some drawback association We ll go Rachel Going back to what Eric said a while ago he was talking about the military and it has a higher budget but I feel like the military helps a lot of people and it creates a lot of jobs and educates people because the military pays for a lot of people s education university and stuff I know a lot of people now since university is so expensive a lot of people are going into the military so they can get their education paid for So I feel like it should have a higher budget because it s creating so many jobs and especially for people who aren t necessarily has a doctorate in physics or something People that are really smart like what Troy said they won t really have that much of a problem finding jobs especially with a big corporation They don t have to necessarily work for the government or NASA or something So I think that the budget should stay where it is because that s pretty funny We ll go Megan and Tyler I don t know when it was mentioned but we were talking about how we re trying to find how the earth will be when all has failed and I feel like with all the carbon dioxide emitted and with our atmosphere right now we re trying to discover what our world will be like when all of that s gone I feel like that s really important for the development of Earth is to know what it s going to be like when there is no more What can we do so that we don t turn into a Mars or Venus What can we do now to stop it from happening Good so you re making connections to maybe the video when they talked about the future if there s an issue with our magnetosphere Potentially could we wind up like Mars So kind of getting a jumpstart to say where we are headed future wise So almost like a selfish need to figure out what s going on out there and where we might go Anyone that hasn t spoken yet want to comment 
 Well I can start I just kind of wanted to follow with Lina s going back to the very beginning of the book and sort of I guess a response to Mariana s comment I think that a big focus of the book is sort of that beginning story with the starfish like at the very very beginning when she talks about how one girl tosses back a starfish and then she brings all the other people that toss back starfish so it s not about making this huge change in one moment cause that s never going to happen It s about that one step where you inspire somebody else to take the next step And since we are young adults you know if we take that step now and we continue taking those little steps throughout our entire lives before you know it things are gonna change So even though it seems discouraging like oh it s really hard and upsetting and speaking from personal experience it can be upsetting it s about continuing on and taking those little steps Yeah you know at the same time I think there s something hard about it but it s not something that is beyond our control It s just we don t want to appear confrontational Because I thought we were having this discussion on Friday I was listening in my science and physiology class to what people were saying and was listening if there were any instances although it doesn t count as racism you count it as prejudice by definition I was listening for instances and actually something does kind of fit Because there was this one girl who was talking about how her stepfather was or her mom s boyfriend was really mean and was always cheating on her mom and yelling at her and he said Oh I wish you were white he wouldn t do that stuff if you were white This was a black girl There was this other in my physiology class Isn t that not racism Well that s not Do you think she was serious or don t you I don t know but you know even if it s joking it s still a pretty serious thing to say And besides there was a Mexican boy in my third block class who was making fun of one of his friends some relative saying get a bean or a shnean But you know even as jokes these still have effects and these are instances where I could have said Well no that s not an appropriate thing to say That could be offensive to people But you know I didn t just because I didn t want to be confrontational So obviously that s some fault of my own for not getting involved there Going off of what Tomas said about the ethnic jokes or whatever I m wondering if you re considered actively racist if those jokes don t bother you Like I hear that all the time in my third block class and it doesn t bother me It s kind of funny sometimes Because a lot of the time it s not interracial it s the same race You know what I m trying to say There s no Armenians but I can t roast another Armenian Should I throw this This is not gonna work Laser it bro Maybe you should just call on somebody and then throw it I think while racist jokes can show racism they can also show an amount of show how comfortable we all are with other races and I make fun of my parents I make fun of my teachers because I m comfortable with them Maybe we should talk about that And I mean I can do it because we love each other and it s okay it s unconditional So even if they may get annoyed at me we become stronger from making fun of each other I m scared So going back to what Lina was saying at the beginning and what Tomas was saying a little later is with the escalator thing I felt that was a good metaphor for the system but it also struck me as a bit of a false dilemma She makes it out that racism is the biggest problem facing us today and not to say that it s not a giant problem but I feel like one can be passively anti racist whilst working actively towards anti poverty anti hunger anti war and making a difference in the world whether it s in the field of racism or not And then going back to what Tomas said about the and I lost my point what was it It ll come back to me Who wants to go I think Tatum would agree with you and she would even I think say that while you re actively combating say poverty you are having a positive impact for say poor African American families And she points out the correlation statistically speaking between ethnicity and class But one thing I want to say in relation to some comments from over there is that I think that one thing that it means to become an adult and I m thinking what Holly said is to suddenly be forced to think of global concerns and think beyond our own individual needs and wants And I think it s really as simple as that what Tatum is asking of people That she s asking them now you consider your duties to the people around you I want to hear from other people I got my point for Tomas it s coming back It came back to me I had two points when I asked for the yarn then I forgot one of them and I just remembered it I want to encourage other people to speak up too And we ve got 10 minutes left There s a lot of voices that haven t been heard yet today What I m gonna do is something that I m gonna encourage other people to do too I m gonna toss it to somebody who s not wanting to speak and make them make their voice heard I ll keep it short and then I ll throw it to someone Okay Toss it to somebody who doesn t have their hand raised though So back to what Tomas said about the confrontational thing is it s really hard to strike that medium between either being confrontational or being patronizing And it s the fear of the reaction of either one of those that I think stops most people from speaking up Like either confrontation or you re appearing patronizing and therefore destroying racial relations even more So Samuel Yeah sure Well I was gonna say out of what Chris was saying sometimes racial humor can actually I think while sometimes it contributes to racism and I have a problem with telling too many off color jokes and gender related jokes But I think sometimes that kind of humor can start to eliminate prejudices and bring that into the broader dialogue and stuff So if you look at people like comedians say like Dave Chappelle how many can say that he s a racist person because he makes lots of race based jokes in his comedy On the contrary I think he actually helps bat those issues by bringing that humor out When Tatum mentions the fact that she thinks there s no such thing as being passively anti racist I think what she means by that is like it s sort of hard I actually got to mention you know our society we have a lot of comic jokes and all of these other things here present in the system of housing and stuff is unweighted or whatever It s kinda difficult to how should I say it I don t know what I was trying to say I can t put it out into words but anyways I kinda agree and disagree with her It s like you can do little things to change however what I was trying to say is that it s a lot out there and it may be difficult That was all I was trying to say I don t even know Here you go What I would say about jokes and stuff at times it shows that you know we re addressing it sorta kinda in a way but at the same time it just shows how much we see it played out in our society And then for some people that say it that aren t actually trying to make a difference it s like I mean it s gonna be hard to make a change and be like Hey let me correct that Because to them it s just like all fun and games But to us it s like okay Yeah It stopped It died I agree completely with what Laticia is saying Although for instance how Sam was saying about Dave Chappelle although people make jokes as they do address that in that manner it s not like people make jokes so people understand that Oh we need to break these stereotypes I ve come to realize that every joke has a little bit of truth in it Obviously yes by making these stereotypical jokes yes we re addressing it but my point I guess is just it doesn t necessarily prove that people are anti racist Alright I just wanted to say the question the prompt is why is there no such thing as being passively anti racist And it s because racism is so ingrained in our system and our being From when we re born we re exposed to racism consistently And because of that we can t be passively anti racist Our default setting for the most part is being racist Not overly racist but we are So it s not possibe just to not be racist by being alive Once you come to being in this world you are racist You can t change that so that s why there s no such thing as being passively anti racist You have to work at being anti racist It just doesn t happen So I completely agree with what Wyatt s saying The way I look at racism is it s like a poison and once you ve been injected or you know whatever to it it stays in your system forever And there s always gonna be a little part of it no matter how much you try to get it out of your system there s always gonna be a little bit of it in you So before you can fix the people who have been exposed you have to get to the source of the poison and stop it Which would be parents or teachers I don t know I m a source of it You know like crazy teachers who say the wrong thing and then students go home and like Oh yeah my teacher said this and then they go and tell their other friends and stuff and they kind of get passed around I don t know it s not you I m just saying I don t believe you Yeah I agree with Wyatt and Brooks because I think that we were talking about how Disney movies may have these subliminal racist undertones but at the same time there are racial undertones to everything that anyone says basically right There are always implicit messages which aren t necessarily said overtly which may come through to the way people word things There are subtle subtle messages and the attributes come through peoples speaking So everyone s totally surrounded by all sorts of prejudices from all sorts of different sources from the time they can understand words So yeah If someone s gonna hit you in the face it might as well be this I want to go back to what Brooke just said about parent kin thinking about racism I mean how many times have you ever hear your parents saying teach you a lesson about racists They don t even try They might just give you some parental info on your surrounding Or just say those joke you were talking about So you re saying that you think parents should have conversations with kids I m saying that parents should know how to combat racism and they don t even try Going back to what Ryan said earlier I agree because if they keep using racist jokes as jokes then it will become overused and kind of a clich so people won t want to use it anymore

 I can go into group two because that Except this one is like these two are like both like pop These two are kinda like both pop Because water s not bubbly This one s bubbly and this one s Coca Cola Or Dr Pepper Do you have a secret rule to use We re gonna get like one of those blue ones and that could be like the bubbles Because they re kinda the same Okay And this one like So I m gonna make sure I m understanding what your rule is gonna be Does it have something to do with bubbles or does it have something to do with it sticks to the side of the container It s the bubble Bubbles and stick to the side Yeah Okay so one group is gonna be sticking to the side and one group is not sticking to the side Is that right Yeah Okay great alright Alright friends In order to be closer together to really see how this is going to work I m going to ask Anagelia s group to very quietly come and sit in these three chairs here Go ahead and bring your liquids with you Thank you very much And What we re going to do is we re going to set up our rule so that it s up here at the front So actually Anagelia if you don t mind Callie and Natalie if you guys could scoot down just a little bit and then Anagelia s going to join you on that side so we can see this front area right here Okay Thank you So we can set up one of our groups on this table and one on this table For your what s my rule okay So you re thinking of your property and you re going to put the ones that fit the property here and the ones that don t fit the property here Who would like to go first Who would like to start Okay so Ryan s group Ryan s group Come up and set up one that fits your rule Just a minute Ryan Isabella needs to come with you One that fits your rule here and one that doesn t fit your rule here Just one just one One in each Okay thank you You can be seated okay So we have this one fits their rule this one doesn t fit their rule I can tell Bryson s already thinking about what it could possibly be This one can fit their rule Hold on one second That s where we re going but wait one second okay Let s talk about what we see Any ideas so far of what might be going on here Bryson do you have one that you could bring up that you think goes in either space The bubbles on the top Okay so you think it has something to do with bubbles Do you have one that fits bubbles That one He s got a hypothesis Now Lena he s got a hypothesis about what he thinks it might be Do you think this fits the rule Yeah Okay So now we need to check in with Isabella and Ryan Does that fit the rule Yes It does okay It doesn t fit my rule So your rule should be the same as your partner s Do you remember what that rule was Ryan Yeah Okay great Alright so Anagelia thanks for raising your hand Do you have one that you think fits the rule or doesn t fit the rule Thank you Callie Callie will you check in with Isabella and Ryan and see if that fits Isabella does that fit the rule Yes Okay Anybody else who s ready to bring one up Oh another rule Another one that might fit or doesn t fit Rigo would you like to try Which one do you think would go with this group Which ones from the ones you have would go with this group Bryson giving you a hint No that one doesn t That one here So you think both of these fit The blue one just the blue one Because look at this one It doesn t leave white bubbles Okay so if that one doesn t fit the rule where would it go Rigo Where would this one go This one Over here right Just hold that thought for a just a second No this one we said does fit it Right Isabella and Ryan are we on track so far Yes Okay Anagelia did your group have another one to bring up Okay That one you think fits in this side fits the rule And Callie you think this one doesn t fit the rule Look when it shakes Doesn t do anything Okay okay Natalina do you want to take a stab at stating the rule for us What s going on here I think it s the bubbles and not the bubbles because that whole group when you shake it it has lots of bubbles That one doesn t Okay so let s go back a minute though because you said two different things Sit on your botton Rigo First you said bubbles and not bubbles And then you said bubbles when you shake it and no bubbles when you shake it Is that the same rule or is that different Is the shaking part important do you think to that rule Okay so can you state it one more time for us When you shake it if there s bubbles it will go that one If it doesn t go bubbles it goes in that one Okay And Isabella and Ryan is that correct Yup Excellent so the shaking was the really important part of that great At least for this one it s weird Right because right now this one has no bubbles But if I shake it it gets bubbles later Okay Excellent Can you remember which ones you had in your group Yes Can you come and get them I m not sure if I can I m glad you can remember Can you remember Rigo which one you put out there This No that one s ours No this is ours Um yeah One two three four five I think you ve got five These ones are originally from Isabella and Ryan I think Yeah Isabella and Ryan can you come back and get yours Great Alright which partnership is ready to tell to not tell but to do another secret rule I thought I brought a blue Did you think you brought a blue one You figured it out Okay Natalina s group Can you put one on this side that is fitting the rule and one on this side that is not fitting the rule Natalina you want to check that one more time make sure that s correct Okay this one fits the rule you guys told me about earlier And let s leave this on the table Anagelia can you remind what the rule is Stick to the sides Anagelia can you remind Callie what the rule is too Go remind Callie So these two do fit right Alright show us one that doesn t please Okay Careful with the liquids please You okay Alright We actually got a little extra help here now didn t we We got two in this group that fit the rule and one that does not Isabella do you have one in your group over there that you think does or doesn t fit the rule Ryan can you sit on your bottom again please Watch what Isabella is doing Oh cool See if you agree Ryan watch what Isabella s doing and see if you agree Okay I agree Natalina Callie and Anagelia thumbs up Is that correct Did she put it in the right place Yeah Okay good Bryson and Rigo do you guys have one that you want to put in Yeah more than one More than one okay Oh three Oh Go ahead if you think that s right I think that s right Rigo Rigo can you tell us why you put these two here Because it can bubble Bubbles in it Because they have bubbles in them Does this Does not Just a second just a second Callie Does this one have bubbles in it Yes it does So it s not bubbles and no bubbles You re on the right track though Take a look again Ryan do you have one that you can bring up and add to our groups here Stuff on the side And this one it goes away after awhile Maybe this is the rule Thank you Ryan So far so good Yeah Okay Yeah Let s bring up all the rest Oh Bryson you can go ahead and leave those there You can go ahead and leave those there I think we re okay actually If you have any other liquids to bring up This one Bring them on up And put them where they belong and we ll see if we can figure out what the rule is Bring it on up bring it on up Ryan bring that one on up and see if we can figure out where it goes This one s confusing Ooh a confusing one I love a confusing one do you know why Because it helps you think It helps you think exactly It makes it more difficult to figure out Would you like to consult with someone Do you want to consult with Ryan Ryan come here a minute Your partner needs your help She s trying to figure out where this one goes What do you think I think it goes in no bubbles because no bubbles is the correct one Now remember we just found out though that bubbles and no bubbles is not the rule Because look this one has bubbles This one if I shake it has bubbles So bubbles and no bubbles was our last rule Okay Thanks for your help Ryan Anybody else give Isabella some assistance here Well you know the rules already right Anagelia What do you think Anagelia Which one do you think it goes in Listen to Anagelia Rigo What s your opinion what do you think Does it go in this group Or this one What do you think Even though you know what the rule is can you help her figure out how to classify it Rigo are you watching What do you think It goes in In that one That one In this group right here Okay What do you think Isabella You want Bryson s idea What does Bryson think I think it goes in that one Because Because most of them kind of move when you shake them But when you shake those they don t Oh interesting Let s try that out okay Okay Ryan come a little closer to me right now please We re trying out something different Bryson just said the ones Rigo you can stay where you are you re right close by No Bryson just said something really interesting He just said stand on your own two feet please Thank you He just said that these ones don t move when you shake them and these ones do move when you shake them and that s how they re classified So I want to just double check that I make sure that I agree with what you re saying Okay Bryson Does this one move when I shake it Not really I can t really Try it out Okay See what you think It kinda does Does this one move when you shake it Yes Yes okay Oh it sticks on the walls Ah ha So are you amending your rule Are you saying that the rule is it sticks on the sides Yes So this group right here is Ding ding ding ding ding ding This group right here is the one s that stick on the sides Yes Ding ding ding ding ding Ring the bell ring the bell But we still haven t figured out even if we know that that s what the secret rule is where does this one go That one That one that one Okay Natalina Let s take your opinion first Rigo we re listening to Natalina And then we ll hear from you okay Go ahead Natalina I don t think it follows our rule It does You think it s totally out here it s separate It s not in either category No I don t think it goes in this one You don t think it goes in this one No I do think it goes Because Because it doesn t really stick to the walls It doesn t really stick to the walls Okay you wanna hold it make sure Stick to the Other opinions Other opinions Anagelia I couldn t hear you Could you say it louder so the group can hear you Go ahead It should go there because when you move it some parts stick to the wall and some parts When you move it It sticks to the part It does stick to the walls Yeah Okay It s dirty Isabella what do you think I think it should go in this one because it kind of It sticks to the wall at first and then it goes down So and then doesn t stick to the wall Okay it sticks to the wall first and then it doesn t so you think it goes in this one May I have it just for a minute One thing I m noticing that s a little confusing for me if I look at this one compared to all the others this is the only one that s not colored in this group Does that make it feel like these ones are stickier because they re colored somehow So this one s not as sticky because it s less colored maybe I don t know So you re saying it sticks at first but then not so much after that Can we tell how much this one sticks No Yeah Yeah It really sticks It really sticks How about this one can you tell how much this one sticks Yeah It kinda sticks That does stick Most of it Some of it That does So it sticks but it is Most of it goes away and some stays Some goes away and some stays 
 I m not too sure if I like this screen print with the acrylic on top of it I m not too sure about that It makes it less It s different in an awkward way I don t know how to explain it It doesn t have any depth to it It has no dimension Like she s standing there he has to take the paint and try to add dimension to it and then It looks like she s laying down Actually yeah it does I mean he has to take the paint and try and add dimension to it and then add the cool and warm colors to make it pop And I m just not feeling it I like the Mick Jagger one but I m not feeling this Taylor Swift one See I like pop art I just I don t know Did you notice that What I thought it was a green that goes in to this That s on them it s more like a quiet like she s sleeping softness But I didn t notice it that it goes into purple periwinkle and this dark violet color that comes out of this red on the bottom half side Did you see that Then it goes in to two and he breaks off the colors And it s like All right let s take a couple of minutes and try to just wrap up some of our questions And then we ll talk about a whole group discussion and see what we all have and what we want to write In a sense it would be a good picture for the stance that she s in You know the title of the album is called Fearless and we decided that it is a powerful stance she does look kinda fearless In the way she s standing The way he did it it just doesn t look like her It s like the wind s coming back and it pushes her hair Yeah but you would think that she would want to be looking directly at the camera But then her hair wouldn t have been like that Yeah but they just need some big ole fans it s Hollywood You can get some big ole fans to blow your hair back You would wanna be looking at the camera if you want to be looking fearless You have to think It s more of country music I mean I could see if you were saying like hip hop pop And you get like all forceful What s Up I m here But they re saying you know she s a pop icon If she s a country artist then why are they putting her on pop billboards and pop charts Because she s mainstreaming into the different areas she s creating kind of a new version of country for the younger generations like you guys You wouldn t compare her to Kenny Chesney Those who want newer generation of country Right All right let s just try and get to our last question and then we ll talk about whole group and get you back in here Let s go ahead and start you guys can chime in when you guys have an answer if you want your input put in So let s just talk about the describe section What we really need to talk about is describing the scene in your own words What kind of words would you use to describe this piece Let s start with Mick Jagger Bold Bold Proud Proud Electric Electric Okay those are good ones What about Taylor Swift It s more feminine More soft It s pale it s delicate and Delicate Soft You said soft It s like he s almost scared when he s doing Taylor Swift compared to Mick Jagger Because Mick Jagger is all rough and boxes everywhere I think he almost makes Taylor look almost intimidated She s kind of pushing away The position and you have all these colors around her With the selection and Innocence Yeah I think we talked about that with Taylor a little bit You kind of have to look at the personality of each artist as well Plus really you have to listen to her lyrics then it like paints a picture She has an innocent expression I d say innocent yeah Okay Fierce You say fierce Okay It s like her personality she just breaks it out with this bold pose All right good So those are some good words key words to describe it So analyzing Let s figure out and pinpoint specific elements and principles of design that we see in the piece that we want to discuss Colors Colors Color s a big one In both of them actually Paint strips The paint strips it looks like it s a lot of paint It kind of creates a lot of movement with the way that it s flowing through the pieces All right so our big ones are color He said in the video color is everything And that s his main focus is color The different colors make the value in the picture the dark colors make the darker shades and light colors He uses more bold colors in Mick Jagger than he did in Taylor And like the contrasting colors of Mick Jagger are more loud I d definitely say it s louder Okay good Let s discuss the movement a little bit So if you look at it I see a lot of movement personally in the touch with the hair I like how the hair is like that and I like her position from the side because I think it adds interest Like I was saying a second ago if she was looking straight forward I don t think the hair would have the same effect as it does from the side And that s just my personal opinion but I like how the hair is kind of flowing through and it s creating the movement through the piece And then with the Mick Jagger one the movement in this piece right here is really interesting to me How he chose the green and the red to contrast each other I think that s big bold move in this area Good Now what are our focal points Faces Faces And what are the big things that factor in for that Why is that What did he do The colors around her make her pop The colors surrounding If you look the face is white right here and then her skin tone is pale as well So that kind of pops out against the bold colors What do you guys think about the materials The silk screen and the acrylic paint You guys got to see a little bit of him working in the video where he gets those huge rows of the acrylic paints from the jars and just dipped in a couple different ones And just started coloring So what do you guys think about his process and the materials he uses He doesn t really choose what direction he just kind of goes with the flow It s very free if you watch him Mindless Mindless creativity He does what comes to him which is interesting Any other comments about the actual process or materials I think It would have been more amazing if he didn t use the silk screens So you d rather him just paint it than add the silk screen I think it would be more like a wow factor And some of his pieces are just paintings More of the people though like the Rollins he painted And the ones he did for President Obama President Reagan some of the Statue of Liberty And also some of the other people like Aerosmith and the Beatles as well And he s usually famous for painting his faces And he would go into the color 
 Trying to find meaning for their lives or were they just trying to what were they questing for do you think Well Gilgamesh was questing for like immortality and that was for him and not really his people but Theseus I think was I don t know I think Theseus was just trying to help the people of Athens I don t think either of them were really looking to find that but they both ended up finding it I think both of them were like looking to help their people and then I also think like a small part of them was looking for glory I think it s kind of like looking for their destiny like they know they re meant for something bigger but they don t know what it is yet so they re just looking for what that is so Then he goes to take the test and the test kills him Or not Then he goes back to his father and he realizes that he s just like you know the father s really disappointed in the son and then he s really disappointed until the son I think it could happen in today s society I don t know about Gilgamesh Well yeah it was a really like Abstract connecting In the really broad sense it could happen but like Like the story line But when you look at details then like no But I mean minotaurs don t exist So it probably couldn t happen But like you were saying like metaphorically it could be something that you know Like the storyline could happen But metaphorically you could compare anything That s true Can you explain more of what you mean by metaphorically Like me No the only one was like You mean hypothetical Theseus not like he goes and fights a minotaur and when he comes back he s like not dead but his dad thinks he s dead and kills himself But it s like Haley said I guess Thanks If you have like a test and like you re bad Like a difficult situation in general Yeah and like your dad or parents or someone are like You can get through this like You can beat it and they think that you or like they think that you fail it or like catastrophe fail it or they think you do then they re gonna be kind of disappointed in you but like they re not gonna necessarily kill themselves because you failed a test But still You can laugh if it was someone else But maybe like on the inside he s dying Yeah Your turn Okay I just said what factors have to be changed to make this apply to modern times Well the Probably the whole like fantasy aspect of it would have to be changed At least like in the to the culture like the gods and goddesses aren t like a you know Big deal Yeah I think that the gods and goddesses kind of like connect with like the people that are not like in charge but that are higher up in our society like the government people and like parents and I just think more like mentors in general Yeah like people that are higher than us Like anyone technically could like you know that you look up to that you rely on for help It s like a figure rather than like Yeah A physical Yeah god God Yeah Well my question was show the similarities and differences between Theseus and his father Ooh okay So I think like they both kind of they re very different in their terms of like loss and like failure Because like when Theseus s dad like thought that he was like dead then he jumped off a cliff and committed suicide But when like Theseus like was with Ariadne or whatever and she like helped him to like defeat the minotaur then he just kind of you know left her on an island I think that I don t really remember how he got in the situation of having to give the people on Crete seven maidens and seven children but like I just think that because that happens and because he does that every year I think Theseus is a better leader he s just like better in charge of I think that they re definitely like different rulers too Because like Theseus is more like including the people like when he goes and like he led his army against Thebes but doesn t try to like most people would like try to steal stuff from the city but he s just going to like bury the dead and then he leaves So like that s more of a nicer leader I guess whereas his dad wasn t really like put in that situation but I m guessing that he would be one of those people who would probably take stuff from that city and not include people very often It says that Because he lived with his mom so he didn t want to have a son So then when he could lift the rock then he could come over and meet his dad Is this question number No we re still asking predict what would happen if King Aegeus and Enkidu hadn t died If the king hadn t died I think the son would have come back and they just would have lived happily ever after and there would have been no like not formed you know what I m talking about Because King Aegeus No but he would have died sometime and then Theseus would have taken over Yeah that s true Can you go dig a little deeper with what you said about the democracy What did you mean by that Oh just like right when King Aegeus died Theseus came over and said We re going to have a democracy instead of me ruling over all of you So like we don t know if that would have happened or because if he just would have stayed alive he could have like changed Theseus mind and made him think a democracy was a bad idea Mm hmm Yeah He would ve wanted him to be he would have that as king He would ve been more like his dad Yeah that s true But if Enkidu didn t die then Gilgamesh would probably like be happy and then like conquer a bunch of other stuff and like they would probably like die together She could have sent him to Athens to claim him as his Oh okay nevermind You re allowed to go on All right No if Enkidu didn t die though I just think that Gilgamesh wouldn t have really known like you know how they said he was really arrogant in the beginning I think he still was kind of arrogant until Enkidu died so he He would have stayed like that Yeah he would have stayed that way Mm hmm Because he went through like a stage of depression so Yeah Do you think that each one reached humility at the end or no Do you think that Gilgamesh you said was still arrogant even at the end No Oh he wasn t Not after Enkidu died but once he died it stopped of course but I think Gilgamesh was arrogant until he found out that he wasn t going to be immortal Well yeah that too Because then he had to like live his life to the fullest because he couldn t live forever He couldn t do whatever he wanted Who s your favorite character between each story Out of the stories Theseus Yeah I like Theseus too We all like Theseus Yeah It also said that Theseus was grieving Was grieving her loss or his father s loss It was both Debate which character had more impact on their society Can you say that one more time Debate which character had more impact on their society Oh she has the debate word in there Okay let s hear it I d say Gilgamesh I would say he wants to be king Let s let him finish his reason What s your reason You think who I think Gilgamesh Actually I think Theseus would because he changed the kind of structure of government and made it democratic That s it Yeah I would agree with you there in the way that he kind of completely changed the government structure where he lived while kind of Gilgamesh would probably be one of those leaders that is better forgotten than remembered and memory lived on is not probably a theme in that story While Theseus kind of left his ways and his story behind That people remembered on high rather than as like a low point of their society Weren t you going to say something Oh I was I thought you were I think Theseus was had an impact And the reason for that Because he like survived more than Gilgamesh did and he helped people out of the maze with Adrian s help right Yeah Predict what would happen if the King and Enkidu didn t die Well I don t think Athens would be democratic I don t think the king would have done it Yeah he probably would have been poisoned Why is that Gilgamesh I don t know because Gilgamesh probably wouldn t have been searching for immortality Yeah he wouldn t have gone on that Journey Yeah Okay well my question is how would you have handled some of the tough situations that each of the characters had to go through Wait what was the question How would you have handled the situations Wouldn t have done any of them No I get scared really easily and stressed so that would not be good the Labyrinth thing Sorry I didn t hear what you said I wouldn t go to the Labyrinth thing Why is that It kind of sounds like a bad idea I might go and just not defeat the beast and in the first place I probably would have traveled by water and not just said I m too good for that it s too easy Because I Bandits have sharp swords Yeah Okay what s yours Choose your favorite character and explain why From because you like Gilgamesh or Theseus Okay Oh not like our favorite character just in the story Yeah Well either way it doesn t really matter Well because my favorite character from Gilgamesh was Enkidu Is that how you say it Because I think he like really changed Gilgamesh for the better And helped him and humbled him Do you agree with that Yeah I agree with that because I feel like he was kind of like Gilgamesh was so awful and like Enkidu came in and just changed all that Plus I thought that it was kind of cool his journey from like a savage to the civilized guy Yeah I don t think that Enkidu really meant to change Gilgamesh though I think that it was just the circumstances surrounding his death that made that happen Enkidu s mom kind of made that happen too didn t he Did you feel like Enkidu was just kind of created that he I mean we were saying that we like him but did he seem real to you or was he just something created See when I read it the entire time he just kind of seemed like this robot that the gods had created to fix Gilgamesh so he didn t really have that much of a personality to me so that s my opinion I don t know Yeah he seemed like his pretty much sole purpose of existence was to balance out Gilgamesh And he did Yeah he did My favorite character from these stories was Ariadne Oh Well because I didn t feel sorry for her because she helped Theseus and like without her he would have been trapped in the Labyrinth But then to repay her he just ditched her on an island and just left her so that wasn t very nice So I feel sorry for her that s why Okay mine is how would you have dealt with these situations in Can you repeat it one more time How would you have handled these situa I wouldn t run away from the I would not have gone on this journey I probably just would have stayed home not gonna lie Do you feel like that people to be great have to go out in the world and seek these amazing achievements that that s what greatness is Not necessarily I don t think you necessarily have to seek them It all really depends on what your definition of greatness is I feel like to get that like glory and all that I mean I think you can do that if you have enough impact where you are you don t need to go off on a journey What do you think Dinesh I don t know I feel like if we re going by the definitons as you would see them within these stories that obviously you don t have to I don t think you have to seek greatness necessarily I don t think you have to seek it to find it but I think that you do have to go off if you re just going to stay where you are you re not really going to be able to achieve it So if you just sit on your front porch and watch your life go by that s not greatness That can t constitute 
 Alright Anne Carol what s your job How much sugar are you putting in Two tablespoons Two tablespoons There you go fill it all the way up to the top Thomason That s okay Thomas can you show her There you go That s okay You ll get it we re gonna make a mess today There you go Caleb way to open the bag for her Go ahead Anne Carol Why don t you pull it There you go One half cup of milk Good job Anne Carol One more We need more Need more That s good that s good There you go Alright good job baby girl What did we put in it Milk You can do it One whole cup One whole cup Hang on it s leaking Milk Milk spills Okay we ll get it You re good Alright Help them put it in there That was exactly one cup Exactly one cup Next is the milk That s okay There you go Okay now I need this Anne Carol Oh okay I need the other side Careful vanilla is really expensive I got it Vanilla How much did you put in A half Half a teaspoon Alright we re almost ready That was cool Whose turn is it Uh my turn It looks like chocolate milk A half cup Half cup Alright Anne Carol how ya doin over there Good It does look like pudding A liquid It s a liquid Do you think that s a solid Anne Carol No What is it Smells like it That s okay it ll get all over That s okay Sure no problem Yeah get it up to the top There you go Okay now Look good Yeah Alright Can we seal it Is that one of your directions Is that the next one Did we get everything in Yes Did we get sugar Yep Did we get our milk Yep Our vanilla Yes And our regular and our condensed milk Yes Alright Make sure it s sealed really really good We need the other bag Give me that bag sweetie Here you go Yep it s closed That s good we have two bags Oh what you got in there Thomas It s ice and rocks Is it sealed really really good Alright hold on we re gonna put this in first Hold on Alright what s in here Rock salt and ice Rock salt and ice Now what is this Liquid You think it s gonna freeze it Turn it to ice cream Let s find out Alright this one s gotta be sealed first Go ahead Thomas Seal it really really good You don t want it to leak Alright Yeah no cracks cause we don t want it to leak Think it s good Alright and then do this one Ready Anne Carol Uh huh We still got one more thing to do Four bags Isn t that right Ms Moore That s right Caleb Only two more There s like one bag and then three in there Let s see you make some ice cream Shake it and eat it Yeah About 30 seconds of shaking Yeah it looks cool Why you think we put rock salt in ice It makes the flavor Oh it s so cold It keeps ice from melting It does keep the ice from melting Very good Is it cold Anne Carol What happened to that We have like this ice cream maker and we like put in it and then we turn it on and it makes good My turn Alright I m gonna get this My hands are gonna cold I m gonna try to get the bag in the center Why you think I m rubbing my hands so they can get warm Do you think it s a solid yet Rub your hands Rub your hands Your turn It s gonna take a little while Yeah you can warm your hands up Because what s gonna happen if our hands are warmer It makes more warm Yeah it s gonna make it easier isn t it Alright you keep making that ice cream I m gonna go check on the other group okay Help each other Help each other Pass it on to Thomas Hey Thomas It s on the side we have to get it in the middle And the other kind needs to get cold Oh Oh it s so cold Caleb My turn please My turn No you already did it My turn It s my turn now It s starting to look like it It s mixed together Oh my goodness Whoa that s cold You think it s gonna turn into a solid Is that what s gonna happen Solid and liquid A solid and liquid Yeah because it melts Oh if it melts it s gonna be a Liquid Do you think that is a gas Anne Carol No What do you think it is A solid A solid It could turn into a liquid Do you think that an ice cube Hold on Amy s got a good question What did you say Maybe sometimes it could turn into a gas state How would you turn it into a gas Boil it You boil it Very good It could melt too and turn into a It could turn into one as it melts My house is a solid Your house is a solid Anne Carol Good job It s so cold Shake it shake it Give it a good shake Alright I ll be right back guys Try not to squeeze it then it might pop Ms Moore Yes ma am Will you do it please You want me to help you Okay Let s re check it and see Have to open a lot of bags What is it still Liquid So we re get it right in the middle You wanna feel it Whoa It s still a liquid Is it getting colder Yes It did mix together didn t it We re gettin there It does look like that now doesn t it That s okay Alright ready guys We re gonna get it more in there There s like 50 pieces of ice in there There is a lot of them Alright here goes your turn Kevin Getting colder Getting colder Hey look What you need sweetie Aw thank you darling Keeping your hands warm there Thomas Ready to go Do you think it s easier to go to the store or make it To the store Make it Is it more fun to make it Yeah Yes ma am That s okay You can make up your own flavor Alright if it s not your turn what I want you to do is you re gonna start to filling out these questions okay Yep you can start filling those out Alright you start filling those out You can help each other with these So what did you make Ice cream One thing was solid what was that Kayla Sugar Ice Ice and sugar Oh we did use ice We did use ice So three What else is in here though What else is in here Rock salt There you go Guys we re almost done Look look at it Keep going Yes It shows what were the solids you used Good you have one of them on there Salt Yep We used salt It s gonna be vanilla ice cream 
 Okay alright Okay okay So that s his position He s going to stick with it for a minute but then he might have to go around he might change his mind alright Okay This group agreed with Fernando okay That it s because the Earth orbits closer to the sun in the summer than in the winter Who would like to share they re thinking I ll call on you if you don t So what do you think Well I think it s because since the Earth like orbits around the sun like in an oval when it gets here it would be warmer because it s closer to the sun Okay And it s winter when it s away from the sun Okay So can you go and draw that on the board what you mean Because I heard you say that the Earth orbits around the sun in the shape of an oval Raise your hand if you agree with that Okay Okay Okay So that s the Earth and it s orbiting around the sun and he said that the shape of the path that it travels as it orbits is an oval okay Anybody else in this group has something to add to help him defend Fernando Okay I see Can I read what you wrote Sure He said that the orbit is not a perfect circle So that s sort of what he s saying there Is that right Yeah And how would it not being a perfect circle affect the difference in summer winter temperature or heat Well we know that the Earth if it was a perfect circle the seasons wouldn t change Okay It would be the same Alright Okay Depending where the Earth is Alright okay Anybody else have something they want to add in this group Okay Now anybody based on these two groups Anybody want to move from their group to these two groups Not yet Okay that s alright Okay Now let s go to Raul okay This group agrees with Raul and he says it s because the Earth s tilt changes the angle of the sunlight hitting the Earth Defend yourselves So I remember learning that the tilt of the axis is the reason for the seasons But I read the question again it says the Earth still changes and if it doesn t change it stays the same Okay Let s read it again Read it really simple It says it s because the Earth s tilt changes the angle of sunlight hitting Earth Okay So it says the Earth s tilt changes the angle of sunlight Yeah Does it say it changes the tilt of the Earth No Okay So you going to stick with what you said or you want to change Can you show me If I give you something can you show me what you mean Alright Okay So I m going to give you an apple and I want you to pretend it s the Earth okay And I m going to stick this bamboo skewer through it well it didn t go exactly right but just pretend So what does this represent based on what you just said This is the axis of the Earth So this is the axis and what does the axis do Okay So the Earth rotates around the axis which is what Ryan said right Okay And be careful because I just poked myself I want you to be careful Okay So can you stand up and show me what you mean and let s have someone else in your group that agrees with you be the sun and stand kind of in the middle of the room right here okay Alright So she s the sun you re the Earth show us what you mean okay Okay Well the Earth orbits the sun Alright What s the word you were just about to say though Revolves I think that might be okay too What do you guys think Do you think revolve and orbit might be the same Yeah Okay alright It doesn t matter Okay so you re going to have to make the Go around the outside of the desk for your orbit okay Well it orbits the sun in a tilt Okay Which one is tilt I forgot how many degrees Okay Alright okay So keep going It orbits in an angle Alright Hold it the way you think it s supposed to be Okay I think it s this one I m pretty sure Alright So she s tilting it but now and it s tilted Right now it s away from the sun is that right Yeah Okay Now keep coming around Of course does it make a little job to play that No But we re just imagining those who were in this room Okay Now stop there for a minute Is your axis pointing where you want it to Yes Okay alright Keep going You guys need to make space for her to come through on her orbit Okay alright So does that help some of you How many people think that she s right That the Earth tilts as it s going around its orbit It s actually kind of spinning on its axis while it s going around right Is that right Yeah It s spinning the whole time right What does that spinning give us What does that spinning give us Day and night The spinning gives us day and night okay Right Okay Because one side of the Earth is facing the sun it s what Day And the other side is in Night Okay alright Okay alright This group over here You guys agree with Susan Susan okay And Susan said that she thinks it s because the northern hemisphere is closer to the sun in summer than in winter So what do you think So like she said that its axis is tilting but as it moves around the sun the northern and southern hemisphere are closer and farther away Okay But on this side the southern hemisphere is closer Alright And when it comes over here the northern hemisphere is closer in the sun and Alright Anybody else in this big room have something to add Well I agree with her Natalie Because as it is tilted I believe that and so when it goes around the sun shines bright and as it s turning and so as it goes around it will change where the light is hitting it Okay Can someone add to that or give us more detail I m also pretty sure that like the state of Texas it s more closer towards the equator and so it doesn t have all of the seasons Okay So you think that places on the equator right here they don t have four seasons Summer fall winter right I think they do have seasons they re just not as different as like Okay So there s not much that difference in the heat from the sun and the winter versus the summer Yeah I think they re always getting the same amount depending on The same amount of what The same amount of sunlight and heat Because they re getting it directly almost Okay Alright Why do you think that What makes you say that So you think the orbit is elliptical like this group Fernando s group agreed But it s not enough to change the difference in temperature I don t think heat really varies depending on I mean it varies but not in that small of a scale depending on where it is And so just that little teeny movement ellipse or something will not change Okay alright Okay I think we have another group over here How about the Shakira agree ers Do you want to move now Okay Okay Everybody if you want to move to a different table go for it now okay Nobody agreed with Warner huh Okay So Eva s out alright People don t think that it gives off more heat right in the summer than the winter in Warner s group right So we re down to And Shakira s out right Alright Who said to me that they didn t agree with any of them I changed my mind You changed your mind Okay Alright So here s what I want you to do now okay I want to do another little demonstration okay Would you be the sun Okay And would you be the Earth Now here s what I want you to do for me I want you to orbit around the sun I want you to pick a spot Like let s say that yellow bucket okay And as you re going around I want you to keep the axis pointed at that yellow bucket no matter where you are Can you do that Yes Alright Give it a try Alright Alright Now stop for a second right there Okay He s still pointed at that yellow bucket right Keep going Alright stop right there He s still pointed pretty much at the yellow bucket and you re tilted over a little bit right Like she said Because we all kind of agree pretty much These two groups agreed with that What season is it right now In the northern hemisphere What season is it right now in the northern hemisphere Winter Winter Why is it winter in the northern hemisphere Because it s farther away from the sun Okay So it s pointing away from the sun right Do you think it s because the northern hemisphere is farther away No because it s tilted away Tilted away Yeah Okay Alright keep coming around here now Keep pointing at the yellow bucket It s a little bit hard to do huh Okay stop right there What season is it right now Would it be spring Perhaps It would be spring in the northern hemisphere What is it in the southern hemisphere Fall Okay So it s the opposite right Okay keep coming around here Alright keep pointing at the yellow bucket Now what season is it in the northern hemisphere What season is it in the northern hemisphere now This group over here Somebody in this group the table What is it Summer Summer Why is it summer in the northern hemisphere Because it s closer to the sun Closer to the sun And it s like kind of like Are we like a few hundred or thousand miles away from the sun A few hundred or a few thousand Or like a few million Yeah Okay So in the scope of that it s hard to picture do you think that the distance between this spot and this spot is that much compared to the sunlight coming over Yeah To make it that different Okay So you think it s more the tilt Exactly Okay I m not sure in your past science classes what is it about heat energy and light energy pointed on something that makes something warmer or colder Anybody have an idea Depending on how direct it is because what I was thinking is like if this is the sun and can I come up Come show us So if my pencil s the heat and the light it would be coming from here and it would be coming and it would hit with him this one more Right And this one will be direct Okay So I think what he s saying is that both the northern and southern hemisphere are still getting sun aren t they Yes Because we re so far away that the only which side of the Earth is not getting sun right this minute This side When it s rotating it s night time But during the day is it still pretty much light in the northern and southern hemisphere Yeah Yeah So what he s saying is that it s more direct to the hemisphere that s tilted right toward the sun It s still getting sun and somebody over here said something about the equator the places on the equator Those over there Who said that Say that again Like states or I m not sure Any locations right So like for Texas as an example I m not sure if it s exactly on the equator but I know it s really close to the equator Okay Closer than we are Yeah Okay I just read somewhere that it doesn t have all of the seasons Okay Yeah Somebody else said I think as much difference or variation Yeah Okay So this is summer in the northern hemisphere Now we re going to cut across our orbit and save time go back over to that side and what season was that again Winter What season was that again What season is it now in the northern hemisphere Winter okay So which hemisphere is getting more direct sunlight now The southern hemisphere And what season is it now in the southern hemisphere Summer Summer okay Alright Because the heat s having to go around Okay So let s go back for a second Raul s group said it s because the tilt doesn t change but the tilt as you re going around changes the angle of the sunlight that s hitting the Earth okay That s Raul s group You guys still agree with that Yeah Okay And Susan s group said it s because the northern hemisphere is closer to the sun in the summer than it is in the winter Anybody want to move groups now Wait Does that mean more direct or Well Or literally closer Literally closer Okay Anybody want to move groups Okay That s okay You don t have to change alright And this group with Fernando that is because the Earth orbits closer to the sun in the summer than in the winter Alright I m going to show you something and I m going to see if it changes your mind okay Do we get to eat the apples afterwards Well we ll see okay Alright Okay So take a look up here Alright This is a simulation What do I mean by a simulation You can come back and sit down with your group What do I mean by a simulation It s a photo or a video of what actually Right It s not out in the universe looking back at our Earth It s not from the space station or anything like that okay So take a look Alright And look at what s happening with the axis It s a little bit hard to see on the screen Okay Did you notice how like what we tried to do It stayed pointing the same direction right Let s do it one more time Okay alright Okay Now does this look kind of like what he drew on the board at the beginning Does it look like an ellipse Yeah Or an oval Yeah Okay So I wish I had a glass a clear glass We do right over there We have a clear glass That s alright We can use this Okay There is one over there We can use this Okay I want you and you re looking at this kind of from the side Does it look like that When you re looking at the rim of this cup or the rim of this glass from the sort of the side does it look like an oval Yes Yeah Okay Let me make sure you can see that It does doesn t it When you re looking at it from that angle But look at it straight down now What does it look like A circle It looks like a perfect circle Let s let a couple people experience that Look at it from the side now look at it straight down With this one you re almost looking you re looking like right here Okay So the glass it was right there I want you guys to try it too okay Alright It might But what I want you to think about here is this is sort of what you guys probably saw in your fifth grade science books maybe even in your middle school science books We ll have to take a look at the pictures in our books You know publishers the people who print the books they don t always do things the right way for us to work And do you know that there are many hundreds and thousands of adults maybe millions of adults who think that the orbit of the Earth looks like this because this is what they saw in their science books when they were kids growing up But just like the glass what happens I m going to do it again but I m going to flip it over We re looking at it from up above So look what s happening now It s a circle Yeah And did you know that the Earth s orbit it is slightly an oval but so slightly that it s really close to a perfect 
 From the top This way Starting from the top Woo hoo That went better Can we have a ruler Yeah 75 Okay make sure you record it 75 what 75 cm C M What s C M stand for Centimeters Centimeters Okay now we ve got to get the average I m gonna do the average Go ahead go to your next one I m gonna check on the next group Okay no you don t put 75 for all of them I m not Just on that one We knew it wouldn t go any farther Just put 75 for the first one Second part Trial two Now what do we do Okay go ahead Tell me what you found out What did you discover about bubble wrap sand paper wax paper and just the plain ramp On the bubble wrap it didn t go Because it was a bumpy surface Because all the bumps because it was too bumpy and had to much friction Too much friction okay And so what did you discover Sean I discovered that on the sand paper it got higher and lower What do you mean by that higher and lower and higher Can you explain that a different way to me well So what does that say about the surface Increase and decrease Spencer what did you discover So So it went farther on plain wrap versus the wax paper Yeah Okay so right now you re going to find the average right How are you gonna find the average Like 32 plus plus 30 plus 41 divided by three Okay you guys go ahead and do that Who s going to be the calculator I am You are Okay I might suggest someone else also be the calculator so you can compare your numbers and then I m gonna come back and talk to you about your results Okay Okay let s sit down Let s see what your doing It s not going very good on the sand paper Because it s just like the carpet Why won t it go as far on sandpaper Because it s like the carpet Okay what does that tell you about friction That if it s sand paper it doesn t have a lot of contact It rubs against the rug It rubs against the tires I think it doesn t One person at a time Paul Because it rubs up against the tires and it doesn t have a lot of friction If it did have a lot of friction it would go faster Okay so does sand paper have friction or not Yes or no No No Yes What is friction One person at a time It s like whoosh That s friction Hm Okay can you explain what is your idea Stephen Friction When a car rolls on carpet it s friction because it slows it down Sand paper slows it down too So far what have you discovered about friction and wax paper versus sand paper Wax paper Let s let Stephen tell me okay Wax paper is kinda like it s probably gonna be like the Look at your numbers and what have you discovered so far Because you already recorded them It s the highest so far What does that mean it s the highest so far It s the one that has the least amount of friction It has the least amount of friction okay And how do you know that Because we did the experiment And what happened It didn t go as far It didn t go as far on what Okay go ahead an finish your experiment Go ahead and finish on the plain ramp you have one more to do I see here Okay And then we ll talk about what we should do next Oh 39 That s showing you more about fourth dimension Let s talk about our results Talk about your results that you ve noticed Sh Stephen Tanner I need to be able to hear this group okay We found now that our total averaged out to 85cm for our total average Okay what does this tell you Look at your averages What does this tell you about friction That friction slows you down like the salt slows you down on ice Like the plain ramp is kinda like the ice It makes you go faster Right and you know what it s doing outside right now What is it doing outside right now It s sleeting It s sleeting it s snowing and the roads are very very slick So what do you think s gonna be a great idea because I know my husband s coming home from work tonight The roads are gonna be slippery What s gonna happen so they can create friction so the roads are safer What should the road crews do Salt They can put salt and Salt and sand Salt and sand Yes Why So it didn t go at all I wonder if it was small little bubble wrap if it would work better What do you think I think if they were popped Oh if they were popped I wonder if they would Maybe so Okay down here you have a graph that we re gonna talk about a little bit later But this is what I want you to do I want you to pretend like you re a teacher and if you were going to tell someone one thing that you learned today from this experiment that we did What would you tell them I want you to write it on the back of here What s one thing that you ve learned today that you would teach someone and then we re gonna talk about it okay I want you to talk about it when you re done writing talk about it with each other and I ll be back in a minute okay We can share when we re done writing Or we can share them as we write them So what would we tell someone I would say friction on the ramp would make something go slower What would you say I would say the rougher the surface the more friction I would say something about the same thing that you guys were saying except a little bit different I would say it depends on which kind of surface it is If it s bumpy it won t go If there s bumps and air all over on it If it s a smooth and soft surface it will probably go a lot faster So tell me what you are you still writing We all shared it Okay but I want to see it in writing Like I want to see something written down I said the bumpier the surface the more friction it makes Okay Spencer what are you gonna write Because I m gonna write kind of the same thing as Heather Is there anything your gonna change about it Or add to it I m gonna say the bumpier the ramp is the more friction and the less and the less further it goes Okay I like that I think you guys are learning a lot about this Sean I see your writing something a little bit different What are you writing I m writing the smoother the surface the farther the car goes You guys are right The farther it goes Because why Because the friction because the surface is too bumpy and it has a lot of friction so it was causing it to not go But on a smoother surface Barely any what What word is she looking for She said on a smoother surface there s barely any friction And I like what you said You said A smooth surface is like ice A smooth surface is like ice right I said the bumpier the surface the more friction Right but you also said something that if it was a smooth surface it s kinda like ice There s no friction to keep it from like if it s outside today if it s ice your car could go anywhere but putting sand down or the salt keeps it Less friction More it has more friction Okay Okay go ahead and finish What What do you want I wonder what would happen if you tried snow and see if it would run on snow and then we tried ice Oh so how would be do that I like that How would we do it When it s like an icy day or something and there s a little bit of ice somewhere we could bring the car out or something not like a real car Oh okay Just like a play car And try it out Try it out on ice and then they would put a little snow and then we would try and see if it would go faster on the snow or on the ice How could we change this experiment What could we do next time if we wanted to change it to find something different out I think you could use a plain surface and you could probably use popped bubble wrap We talked about that Popped bubble wrap and what else did you say The bubble wrap could be what Talk about that the bubble wrap could be what Guys I need you to not come in here You can use un popped bubble wrap and you can use the tile and you probably use like a grid with the marbles Instead you can like use a car Okay talk about that To see if it would fall off Now what would be the purpose to see if it would fall off With force and motion how does that tie in Well what I mean is will it like go far If you make a ramp and you try to get it on and wanted to see if it would fall off or not Like if it was on the It depends how fast it would go if it went faster would it fall off But if we re talking about friction does this have anything to do with friction Oh I love that So wood carpet and ice And we could freeze ice because we have big containers 
 Yeah I have a question It says how does the Skip predictions Move on Yeah Olympic athletes how does your data compare to Olympic athletes How does your data compare to the class average Yeah Do we do the predictions It does help to have somebody look at it with you Sometimes it s not as obvious as you think Scott we re going to stay on task right Good We re not doing predictions right No So take a look at patterns What you want to do for this question is look at patterns Do you see any patterns there Okay good It s not necessarily worse by the way It s definitely different It s worse Skye if you re like dead If we re talking about heart rate and yours is worse So we still have a little bit to learn how that affects you if you are inactive or not So let s look at the pattern there You see that That s kind of what I was thinking You just missed that one Again one of the things we can talk about then is data collection Exactly Come on let s go It s not the same numbers It s the same pattern Right Good Any patterns that you guys are seeing back there Yeah A little bit What might that be This is science be more specific Are there any patterns for number four You guys skipped it It s okay Yeah Four You don t have to do predictions You compare to athletes Don t do it for predictions but do it for your class data and athletes Okay Now that s a perfect simple question Now we take that information and put it into number six Hopefully you re going to make the mental jump that we need here What does heart rate have to do with homeostasis If we challenged our body with a little bit of exercise you know how heart rates work now the question is why How does that keep us alive There you go Good How much more time do we need Did you get this one right If you guys did then you understand the process hands down congratulations Make sure you share your answers Make it quick I don t want people in and out We good How about a drink Here you go We got it It s good No I ve got it covered okay Two more minutes remain in your seats Number six there you go You re good Good job Scott You re very subtle and very helpful Thank you Remember we ve got a mic that s on there All right got two more Thirty more seconds right Then you re back in your own seats If you can do six you re the best Ten seconds or so Get in your own seats for the next ten seconds Two things are going to happen we re going to start off with simple answers then we re going build upon them and then hopefully we ll get to the more creative ones at the end This class we have enough time to do that So let s do that right off the bat Question one Daryl can you read it or would you prefer to have somebody else read it I can read it Okay Good What is the hypothesis being tested Okay So let s talk about it In our experiment we were looking to get something measured What is a valid hypothesis for this experiment Scott we ve got and then Alicia Alicia let s go How does exercise affect your heart rate Good Now that s a step in the right direction The hypothesis has got to include the concept Alicia and anybody in her group want to help her out it s got to include the concept of homeostasis So can we do that Can we tale a look at our aim a look at our model hypothesis how does exercise affect heart rate That s a good start Anybody else have something else different that would support our understanding of homeostasis You re yawning You okay All right Let s sit up Thank you Little bit more Good Good Like you re playing third base okay Matt Good Let s sit back now There you go Got it Anybody else Go ahead If we do exercise then our heart rate will change Okay So that s kind of what Alicia said Go ahead It should keep going up and then when you re not it goes down Again a great great hypothesis if we were at a third or fourth grade level that s something we want to do But we re not at third or fourth grade It s a tenth grade class here I want you to get out of your seventh grade minds and add this concept of regulation You want to try How does homeostasis affect your heart rate How does homeostasis affect your heart rate Think about that okay You want to reword that Which causes which Oh how does your heart rate affect homeostasis Good But now we ve got to remember We combined exercise in this Kevin How does your heart rate change to meet the needs of your muscles and cells in the body You didn t use the word homeostasis but How does your heart change to meet the needs of your cells and your heart in your body Excellent I don t need you to write that I just need you to understand that s the direction we re going You want to try now I had almost the same thing I put Heart rate changing throughout exercise to the needs of homeostasis Homeostasis Now you guys are closer on it So this is about how does your body adapt itself even when stress with exercise to maintain balance to maintain homeostasis In the beginning of this unit you guys remember I had the balance board up here How many of you got on it I forget One person Two people That s it Three people Do you remember how hard that was to do Did we throw things at the people Yeah Was that easier or harder to stay balanced when that was happening Harder No I thought it was like easier What s the room for error How easy is it for one of the sides to touch or how not easy is it It s very easy Same with homeostasis That margin of error we re in a small range here If I take your temperature Dustin and it s healthy Not healthy Okay 98 6 No But what if you re 102 What if you re that tell you You want to try So 98 6 is normal But what if somebody takes your temperature and you re at 100 degrees or It s not normal You want to give me a word for that Sick You would be sick You d have a fever Something would be wrong with you You would be not normal right Good That s a small number 98 6 and if you have 101 you ve got to see a doctor or something You ve got to get rest You ve got to get medicine You ve got to do something to help your body heal All right Number one done Number two and three Daryl you did a good job reading the first one Richie can I ask you to read the second one Sure What are the controls in the experiment Okay So controls another word for controls anybody real quick Independent variables No Not at all Constants Things that don t change So above the word controls can you guys write the word constants Things that stay the same So Savannah good good opportunity for you to learn okay So when we say controls we re talking about the exact opposite of a variable which is a thing that changes Everything stays the same or constant What are some the examples of the constants that you have in this experiment the controls Go ahead The three categories The three categories We mentioned everybody in the same three categories Okay Go ahead The amount of time you re giving us And how much time was that Do you remember Two minutes Two minutes two minutes two minutes The amount of time was the same The temperature Temperature in the Stairway Good Because if you were going to talk about your own temperature actually that changes Again that s a whole other topic about homeostasis that when we exercise we start sweating right So you re talking about the temperature in the exact place Okay Anybody else Go ahead Where we exercise and then the height of the stairs like if one stair was higher than the other then it would be harder Right All the steps are the same Now here s a control one kid said in my last class and the other kids disagreed with him He said the exercise was the control that we all did the same thing No Do you remember what we did We walked the stairs Did we all walk the stairs the same way No Well some of you kids hustled right Like two minutes you were like bunnies like gerbils on the stairway You were just going crazy Others were just walking and it was okay Good Let s move on Three independent and dependent variables That would be helpful Thank you for your hand up We only need one answer of the two and somebody else will give the other one So dependent or independent whatever you want Heart rate is the dependent variable upstairs Okay one second One second So tell me a little bit more though Daryl Is it heart rate and how do we measure the heart rate Take a look at your graph Your dependent variable is going to be very well described on your graph Help me out Go ahead Okay You re looking at it Somebody want to help him out What is the dependent variable of this He s close but he s not close enough to be right Savannah Number of heart beats per minute Per minute You had to have the per minute on that okay That s the standard that we use in science Independent variable Kelsey would you like to try I m not sure I know it Okay That s okay What did we introduce in this experiment to affect our heart rate to see if we could stay balanced Exercise Bingo So your independent variable Exercise Exercise Two minutes of exercise is what we did Very good Your back group you have another one or it s all up here Okay Four how does your data compare to the Olympic athletes How does your personal data compare to the class Now remember we re scientists So you just can t say It went up and then it went down or whatever You can say that but it s got to be justified with some sort of specific numbers Richie had his hand up first okay Justine Okay Go ahead My heart rate predictions were very low because I didn t have any idea and then my actual heart rate was higher than the Olympic athletes because they re used to running a lot Okay Here s a good example of what I m talking about First of all what you did with predictions is great We didn t actually have to even do that one for this question but that s great Richie when you say they were higher what do you mean Your resting rate was higher Your post exercise rate was higher Your recovery rate was higher All of them Okay You ve got to include them in your answer You have to include that in your answer You ve got to be specific Go ahead Matt Margaret you re next okay Yeah Go ahead My prediction I had low numbers but after doing the experiment only one of my numbers was lower than the Olympic athletes Okay So again what was that one number Post exercise Post exercise was lower Wow That s rare by the way Did you see the class data compared to you then We weren t supposed to do the prediction but I m getting so many hits here How many of you to a look at your prediction compared to other people Quite a few people You guys when you were doing this you asked me What s the normal range And I didn t tell you I wonder what you would say your prediction is after I gave you a range I purposely didn t just to let you see just like you said Mine was off because I didn t know any better Good All right Five super important question here oh I m so sorry does anyone else want to contribute to the Olympic athletes I m so sorry Go ahead My actual heart rate was higher than the Olympic athletes but for the exercise one it was only seven heart beats lower Okay So what does that mean to you How close to an Olympic athlete are you is what I m asking I guess it could be exercise Like with the Olympic athletes I know it wouldn t be like anything for them For me to be like that far off is kind of like impressive Right And how would you know that Didn t you say you had like a cousin who Does crew Does crew at the Olympic level or just does crew She does crew at an Olympic level Wow a premiere athlete then Fantastic What s crew Crew is when you row a shell or row a boat There s singles doubles and quads Oh yeah Fantastic Anybody else before we move on Christina and then Scott I noticed that we re just like like I realized we re all like the same because when the Olympic athletes went up class average went up and ours went up so I noticed it was the same pattern just like depending on what we were doing it was different than the Olympics and all that stuff That s the big picture I want everybody to see here Take a look at your graphs one more time Do you agree with what Christina just said Forget about your prediction number Did you see that there s a pattern here No matter who you are as an individual in this class or as a class average or as Olympic athletes when we exposed our body to exercise what happened in all cases It went up So we would say it increased Okay What happened when we rested post exercise Yes It decreased It decreased Right So there is a general pattern Excellent job Christina Go ahead Scott Make it quick I had the same thing as her Okay Good All right Key question if we can answer six we ve got this lesson down pat When muscles are active cells use nutrients and oxygen at a higher rate and produce waste chemicals and heat more rapidly What does heart rate how does heart rate demonstrate regulation homeostasis in the body I ve got three hands up I didn t see the order I m sorry So I m going to go four or five hands up I got one maybe two I don t know Gabby three go ahead Richie if someone leaves something out it s yours When you re exercising like you re using more nutrients and oxygen so the blood has to carry more nutrients at a faster rate so your muscles get it It does that to maintain homeostasis So it s like using it constantly Okay Daryl She did a good job I m going to change the question for you What if your body didn t do that What if you re running up and down the stairs Daryl and your heart rate didn t increase It would have a hard time maintaining homeostasis Okay Excellent And what would happen What do you think You d be dehydrated and wouldn t sweat or anything Well I don t know if you d be dehydrated You wouldn t get as much oxygen because it wouldn t be working as fast and you wouldn t be like So it might get stuck in there while you re running up and down 
 Also causing habitat loss Anyways Indirectly through our use of C02 emissions It says that It is a naturally occurring greenhouse gas and we want to keep that right We want to keep it naturally occuring we just wanna work on our Levels Yeah Because our impact is not exactly natural It s not like we re trying to stop the unhuman related processes Just like what we re doing to increase it Because like it s been staying at a level until we started releasing a bunch of CO2 and then it went up so it s kind of obvious that we re the cause of that So I don t think it s going to go down then what it was before normally Yeah I think it s highly unlikely that this would ever happen Yeah and 20 to 40 degrees Celsius is a lot too I highly doubt this would happen If we reduce the CO2 emissions in what we re doing this is kind of ridiculous Give some more evidence for that Why Yeah why Explain why do you feel that way Because carbon dioxide is part of the natural carbon cycle yeah But we re contributing to make more of it There s so many economies and stuff that are dependent on it right now that are not going to get rid of it for a long time Therefore there wouldn t be such a drastic change in the amounts of carbon dioxide that there wouldn t be a drop of 20 to 40 degrees Celsius Because we don t plan to tamper with the natural Flow of the carbon cycle We just want to tamper with our which will take a long time anyway So we re going to be up and up and up for a while But we kind of already did tamper with the CO2 the natural ones because yeah we re trying to reduce our own personal emissions now that we re doing it now but we ve already gone in and tampered with it We ve already cut down millions and millions of trees We ve already so can we talk about I m trying to touch into what we ve done in the past and how if we kind of try and back out now then we leave the Earth in a sticky situation Does that make sense Well I do have a question I don t remember does the greenhouse effect exist naturally even as like a little bit right Yeah we just made it bigger So it s like they re claiming that without the greenhouse effect the Earth s average temperature would drop drastically well obviously because the greenhouse effect exists naturally but we re making so much of the greenhouse effect that we re trying to bring it down to normal levels We re not trying to bring it down below normal levels I think they re saying that this is going to happen if it s below the normal level but the problem is that we are already above the normal level so if we bring it down it s not going to make it a complete effect anyway I mean they are right saying that it s going to get significantly below as everyone said it s not going to be to the point where life will not exist But I mean the process by which sun penetrates the earth like some of the heat is retained because of that effect And what we re doing is enabling the Earth to retain more heat than it normally does So by releasing some of it by reducing emissions we are making the Earth much much cooler But we also can t get rid of the greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere So those would stay there and our temperature probably wouldn t drop as much probably still would drop maybe not as extreme And also we live in a world where we use so much carbon dioxide there s no way that we re going to get it to the level of just the natural processes I mean at least not in a ten year period I was wondering how long it thought we were going to slow so called global warming It doesn t really give us a projection I don t think we re going to have another ice age for a long time I mean we re having a mass extinction as it is the way we are right now I think if anything reducing it would help stop the mass extinction I think we ve kind of talked about all we can at this point Alright so at this point if you feel like you have talked a lot in an effort to get you to stop I m going to have you actually I want you to scoot your chair back like a foot or two for the next one to give some other people a chance to talk Yeah I have two you want the good ones with lotion The next one sorry is Concerns over CO2 emissions are unfounded Somebody want to read Okay Concerns over CO2 emissions are unfounded Water vapor is a leading greenhouse gas Today Mythbusters Daily exclusively reveals what climate scientists have been hiding from the public Water vapor is actually a much more prevalent and potent greenhouse than carbon dioxide Water vapor concentrations in the atmosphere between 30 000 to 40 000 ppm while maximum estimates put CO2 around 370 ppm Due to its abundance water vapor s a much more important greenhouse gas so human inputs of CO2 are negligible We should stop focusing on CO2 and refocus research and funding on reducing the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere Would that be parts per million for ppm Yeah parts per million Water vapor unit really really Okay We have a whole water cycle I know we have the whole carbon cycle and everything but we have contributed so much to the carbon cycle I mean and global warming hasn t really been a problem until recently gee I wonder why Maybe because I don t know we are emitting a lot of carbon I mean it s not like we ve been emitting more water you can t create more water Okay Yeah I m done I m sorry I think if you explained what the greenhouse effect actually is it will disprove the water vapor theory Because the way the greenhouse effect works is completely unrelated with water vapor How Well because like isn t the greenhouse gas a gas that lets in sunlight but it prevents the heat from leaving or whatever or something right But water doesn t I don t think water does that I thought it was a greenhouse gas We learned about that in chapter 20 But We did it on the worksheet maybe or the thing that we had for homework last night It s considered a greenhouse gas That s all I know You know what effect it had Sorry No it is a greenhouse gas I remember reading that But You can grab a textbook if you d like Keep talking Elizabeth Water vapor has always been there It has always been at this level Am I wrong Well I mean if our CO2 emissions are increasing and global warming is happening then you would be releasing more water vapor I mean heat would cause that to happen But then technically this is an effect it s not a cause then Is it possible to be both Maybe Like a positive feedback loop What do you know about water vapor It s a greenhouse gas We know that now Isn t it when water evaporates Clouds Nope that is an excellent point Hold on you guys what do clouds do They block sunlight So if the global temperatures rise there would be more water vapor because there would be more fluctuations of creating water vapor Don t look at me look at your people And people who are on the outside are not supposed to be talking Well just like Well she can finish Sorry sorry no go ahead Go ahead finish She said you could finish Oh Okay Well when water vapor think about it when you like boil water it s hot and it creates water vapor So increases in global temperature there would be a possible connection between increased temperature and increased water vapor Hot air rises Which way would it be though Because if increasing temperature causes increase in water vapor does that mean increase in water vapor causes increase in temperature Well you said that water vapor is clouds so wouldn t clouds would block sunlight so wouldn t that decrease temperature But that s kind of like contradictory Can that happen though Like how hot air rises and cold air drops so maybe forgot what that process is called Well it s like sometimes when you re on like islands or something that it s like all cloudy but still really hot and humid so maybe it can increase the temperature I have a question At what altitude do clouds form It depends I mean they can form at ground level That s what s basically fog What s the highest altitude that clouds are going to reach For the most part like on average I have no idea that is an excellent question But like what part of their is it under the stratosphere There s a laptop over there if you guys want to get it No one s ever asked me that That s a really good question I don t know I know that they re throughout the troposphere but I m not sure how high up in the stratosphere they go That s a really good I don t know Can I read something really quick Four natural greenhouse gases in the troposphere are water vapor carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide These gases have been present in varying concentrations in the troposphere during most of the Earth s long history Fluctuations in the troposphere concentration of these gases especially carbon dioxide and methane plus changes in solar output are the major factors causing new changes in the average temperature of the troposphere over the past 400 000 years And then it just talks about how from the beginning of the industrial revolution human actions have led to significant increases in carbon dioxide and therefore it correlates the relation to the increase in temperature of the globe I just read another thing Additional clouds can have a warming effect positively back by absorbing and releasing heat into the troposphere Or a cooling effect a negative effect by reflecting more sunlight back into space So they can have a warming effect So should we be worried about water vapor more than carbon dioxide No Why Because doesn t the CO2 cause the warming which never mind No no keep going That was good keep going That was it Okay Well based on what she just read and based on everything we know about carbon dioxide we know that carbon dioxide can lead to a lot of effects A lot of them bad And one of the major things is that it does lead to more water vapor and if water vapor is such an issue in terms of global temperature increase then you would think their first thought would be decrease carbon dioxide emissions But no Can we directly regulate water vapor No Can we directly regulate CO2 Yeah we can decrease our emissions We can switch to alternative vehicles We can find other sources of energy I mean there are a lot of options with water vapor we just have a water cycle We can t tell the water vapor to stop rising into the clouds like Yeah can you just pause for a moment No we can t do that because it s a natural cycle Are we done with that one So what do we have so far Nida Well that heat would cause the release of more water vapor and clouds can trap and release heat but they can also cool And concluded that clouds are water vapor first of all What we were saying should we worry about water vapor more so than CO2 Probably not because we can regulate CO2 but not water vapor And water s a greenhouse gas I call that using science I have a question for you In nuclear power plants how the steam comes from the cooling tower Is that water vapor emission That is considered a water vapor emission Okay so maybe we could control that aspect of it control the steam One additional thing to just sort of keep in mind and we ll talk about this later is what we call residence time Does anyone know what that is Residence time is how long a chemical stays in wherever it is And so one of the things that we re concerned about when we look at a chemical is its residence time So if we re talking about a water pollutant what s the residence time How long is it going to stay in water Is it going to break down quickly or is it going to be very persistent and is it gonna last for a really long time So when we were looking at greenhouse gases we re also looking at what s the residence time in the atmosphere How long does an average molecule stay in the atmosphere And water vapor tends to cycle in and out of the atmosphere a lot quicker than some of our other greenhouse gases Its cycles are usually on the order of days whereas others are on the order of months to years versus like do you guys know what CFCs are The ozone depleting compounds Chlorofluorocarbons we ll talk more about those as well CFCs are also a greenhouse gas but their residence time in the atmosphere is more like hundreds of years Hundreds of years to thousands of years That would be something we would be more concerned about So like the residence time of something radioactive could be like its half life Yep And then a third factor that we look at is also how potent of a greenhouse gas it is Some gases have more warming potential and some gases have less warming potential So we also want to look at what is its potential for heat trapping versus its concentration And we ll talk a little more about that too Alright we have two left I d actually like for you to pick one I m thinking maybe you should do the freezing temps one because we already kind of talked about the cloudy one but if you want to do the cloudy one you can do the cloudy one You suggest the freezing temperature one That s my suggestion but I won t be upset if you overrule me Let s do freezing temperatures Does anybody want to write 
 We all know it s splash Just put it next to it Your turn Okay let s see How are we doing How many animals do we have Do you have a few We think mussel It can be in the middle It can be in the high tide and the low tide Because it can move around And then it eats clams and clams would be in the high tide It can grab on to the wave It eats clams It says this eats clams I saw the of the mussels sort of in the mid high tide one day When you were out at the tides before Yeah Excellent so you re using some of your previous experience to help you Good excellent Okay I ll be right back It s a snail The shell protects its soft part As a hermit crab grows it moves into a new shell It may take an empty shell or steal one from another So it s like war I think that would be in the high Yeah that s a high Yeah I think the high tide I thought it would be in the mid or low But no Well it could move down there What s your next one Tuesday put this circle right on top of the clock Same time Same height Wow that s pretty interesting isn t it Good for you Oh you re looking at your first one What s your first one Yeah just line it right there on the clock That s eight Yep like eight Yeah excellent And Margo you re getting your first measurement Negative one Oh awesome Monday s negative one Hello Kazhu I will show you where you need to go It s negative something I don t know what negative It s right here Look here Did you find out they went that low Yeah Mine went to negative six Wow I didn t put Tuesday and then I m going to put a block under it You had one that went really low Look at that Awesome You set that up first pretty well didn t you Look s like we got Monday and Tuesdays getting done Wednesdays are being worked on Perfect So much to hear what it is you guys are gonna discover from the charts Let s do a worm Whatever that says They have a veil of flaps on each side The worms usually stay buried in the sand If a wave comes it swims back down toward the sand and wiggles into it I m pretty sure that s low Yeah No how about maybe high High tide High tide No but the waves crash there a lot actually Splash There s more of the sand Yeah I think it would be splash Want to try splash on that one Good And you guys thought that because what did it say It said it buries in the sand and if a wave crashes it has to wriggle back down Okay So it stays in sand as much as it can How many does Nate have Oh two The whelk That s a scientific name That s a tough one isn t it Ah it s hard It s hard it s okay you can skip it Just say look for the whelk on rocky beaches On rocky beaches and on rocks sift or muddy gravel beaches The shell of the snail can reach about two inches in height It is a scavenger feeding on kin It also preys on injured animals such as limpets The snail has also So I thought the sentence said it also preys on injured animals such as limpets So preys on them what does that mean I think I know What do you think Andrew It means catch them and eat them It catches them and eats them Where do you think that would need to be if it s gonna eat limpets I think it would be in the high tide Oh you ve got both of them So you also might want to talk to Addy and find out what Addy has And try to figure out where those guys are before you place your whelk No so Addy what do you think What is one of yours Let s find out what yours are right Under each shell I think it s already in the high tide zone I thought it would be in the splash Wait no High high high Yeah high tide Okay the limpet Guys I thought it would be in the splash No remember you gotta like figure Okay I ll let you two go I thought it would be splash because No I don t think that The thing should be underwater most of the time It says Watch for whelks on rocky beaches and muddy or gravel beaches It could be in the middle True Yeah mid Okay mid No you have to say where the other food is I put it to high splash Okay you go then you go Guys look too much heart One that was lower than negative four And this is negative four What do we have Margo did you finish your graph Excellent How are you doing on yours Joshua You finished I m on Friday You re on Friday So maybe you two should start setting up your circle Pick your question Margo Joshua And this is your question And set up your circle right on there Grab your graph and a chair And sit in your circle off to the side there I think it s either low or splash No not splash Not splash Otherwise there wouldn t be anything Lower mid I d think low No No remember at the aquarium they were underwater completely No things sticking out Only some of the spine Yeah but the rest it was just boom there I am doing it I m doing the sand dollar for my report And it s high No remember at the aquarium also it was at the bottom of the tank Remember No it was at mid I remember I checked And also anyways I m doing the sand dollar Okay Okay so Margo do you have your question with you So everybody gets a chance to converse and talk about the answers to that question Or maybe you might realize something or come to a realization about your information And all of you can contribute to the answer Okay So go ahead Were there any patterns you noticed doing your graph What are they I noticed that first it went to medium then it went lower and then it went higher and higher the third fourth and fifth time My pattern was that each time each level started getting higher and higher and higher and so it s really high Mine would go to 12 to 12 then it would go to 11 and then it went down to 10 and then it went down to nine It went lower and lower And it was kinda like a mix Monday and Tuesday were the same and then it started going higher and higher and higher all the way What was unexpected I ll go first It went lower than the average on the chart It went lower and then it started going higher and higher I thought it was just gonna stay in the negative parts but it actually went up to the nine In mine I expected it to be some different levels but it kept going higher and higher and higher and then when it started to go even higher it just kind of stayed the same Mine went higher and higher and higher and higher again Okay who s next I am Unless you want to go Read your question What was your highest tide What was your lowest one My highest was Tuesday and Friday They were both negative one And Friday and Thursday they were both negatives Everything was negative Everything was negative on yours Wow Negative Even one below the negatives You have five negative Negative five Yeah that s right because you re grabbing you don t realize you ll get a negative five That tide s really low Very low tide level yeah Margo has her hand up go ahead Margo On the day that was highest was Friday It went all the way up to nine And my lowest was Monday and Tuesday because they re both negative one Oh and my lowest was Thursday Thursday and it was 9 Thursday and it was nine Yeah And Maia what was your lowest tide My lowest was Monday It was about at eight and then it starts going higher and my highest was at 12 So I m wondering now if we look at all of our charts all of our graphs who had the highest tide of everybody Who had the highest So you had a 12 I had two twelves No she had 11 So it looks like maybe Callen and Maia have close to each having a 12 I have the lowest score I have the lowest I think Joshua got the lowest with a negative five reading on his Anybody else have a negative five No I have a negative one But no negative fives Okay alright So whose question s next Alright I ll be right back 
 I think we need the policeman because he s the only one with a weapon He s the only one with a weapon though What if he goes crazy He s the only one with a gun Exactly that s a good thing though Wait a sec why is that a good thing Are you saying he d shoot us I didn t say it s a good thing if someone could shoot us No I didn t say that You said it s a good thing Explain why you think it s a good thing It s a good thing because we could stock the food Drake OK so he said two things But he might shoot us because we might be starving and he might start to shoot us We could take him he wouldn t shoot us Where you at Riley it looks like you re sweating I m trying to think between you two So you write down what you said you d do and you worry about everybody here Who do you think is the most important Eileen says the policeman does everybody agree with that or not Yeah Why Because if someone gets hurt He can respond to medical stuff yeah they re First Responders It s a good idea Anybody else Can you write down reasons why you should keep somebody Would anybody that you know that works here already That s good he s too old his life would be long So the old sir will be able to be productive to society Think about that Anything else about the male professor that you maybe thought about in support of communism Do you want that in your society or not No Why not Because Okay so freedoms are important to you Mr Malls Yes ma am Send Kyle to the office for a minute please He s in Miss Crane s room right now What core are y all in Because I told Mr Wayward where he was supposed to be and he said he was with you Uh he we re actually in 2nd he s with Miss Crane All right thank you OK you can resume Folks we re about I don t know Hey why should we keep the male professor What s the issue you have OK now this is just a question guys If someone s not fit does that mean they have no potential to be helpful to society Nah they could be really smart OK they could be really smart But she s nine She s nine She s nine so are you looking for right now or are you looking for the long run We re talking about the long run The long run so you got time So just consider all aspects just because maybe just because she has does she have anything to offer Let the group decide it sounds like some people are really for and some maybe are against it If you want a male farmer say aye Aye If you want the male professional say aye Aye If you want the female scientist say aye Aye If you want the male preacher say aye Aye Definitely female nurse We already have a nurse We already have a nurse Who cares I do In case he dies But the female med student s only in second year she hasn t even been to the hospital It might go for four years Exactly We got the scientist and the nurse to help her Plus she d be off breeding Excuse me No offence You know we only got like thirty minutes We only have fifteen so Hey we re about 5 or 10 more minutes and then I m gonna stop you in groups and you ll listen If you have not managed to already make your decisions here s the key point here s the key point Still got a group talking you need to listen About five or ten more minutes you need to come down to your five you need to have the reasons why you chose the five and we re gonna share those and reasons why you did not choose the five you didn t choose Keep in mind Edna keep in mind that five are going with you to start this new civilization that s gonna hopefully flourish and I hope you re all taking people with uh that you know will make it But there s also you gotta keep in mind there s five people you re leaving behind that most likely is not gonna make it But you you re concentrating on who you need to start this new productive society OK OK start closing up in the next five or ten minutes about who you re choosing who you re not choosing Those radiation levels are getting high very high Over here especially I know really I kinda changed my mind about that Because she s cute You can t change times and down I m agreeing with that Say aye again if you want Aye Finally They wanna take cripple girl and I m saying He s still overruled I posed this question just a minute ago So this is so we can look at mass So we can look at it two ways one you re looking at She can t do anything she s gonna be hard to keep because someone will have to do it second way of looking at it she And she doesn t have her doctor Uh is that true Once she had a doctor OK and then what else Have you ever heard anything about Yup So what if this person could be maybe a scientist or a It didn t say that But again you re not saying that she is you can combine that OK continue on You need to start choosing maybe 3 or 4 of your 5 And why you re gonna take or why you re not gonna take em OK male professor too old He s too old Five minutes I m giving you five minutes Start making decisions But why do we need a policeman if we got a lot of money Hey I wanna share some of the tips that some of you were talking about And one person said well she has the potential to become any of these things here she has the potential to be any of those so it might something to consider We need extra little kids and she won t help us with no extra little kids Somebody s ready to go just about so you need to make sure you get your five choices 
 Alright I heard the term velocity So I think that sounds pretty good Velocity of a skateboarder the more important you re going to have I like velocity Keep talking amongst yourselves I m just kind of here to guide you along Make sure the people here I don t want anyone to have their back to each other I know the room is difficult to do that but if you guys could try to make sure you look at everyone inside of the group I know it s difficult Wait The whole class Oh yeah I want the whole class to discuss this I thought you were doing like table and table No no no I want everyone to talk Sorry Okay You guys can talk just like I talk across the room Feel free to do so So someone when we ask their velocity You need more length to the tracks Steeper You don t have to raise your hand If you re looking in that person s eye or you re looking in my eye feel free to You need a longer track Distance Is it the friction I will tell you that we re not going to look at friction as part of the system Let s look back at that proposal for one second Just want to make sure I didn t miss anything It s always good to look at what they give us Let s see What science terms are in there Quantitative Qualitative Okay Energy Oh We got energy in there Energy transfer Oh energy transfer Okay So I think they want something to do with energy It said quantitative We should probably use the formulas for kinetic and potential energy right Do we have them Yeah We do It s half mv squared right And then What Christina said we re going to be collecting data quantitative we ll probably have to use some formula that associates with this I agree Okay Okay He gave us the formula E sub k 1 2 mv squared Energy due to the gravitational field E sub g mg Alright Let s make sure we know what each of these letters stands for M mass and the unit Kilogram G Acceleration due to gravity Lauren said force of gravity Okay You want me to write that in Which one is it Oh its the effect from the gravitational field Okay that s fine You will sometimes see textbooks that read gravitational force but what are the units for this Meters per second squared So that can be kind of confusing if they re calling it gravitational force and then they re saying meters per second squared because what do you think when you see those units Acceleration Acceleration right So I m going to put acceleration due to gravity Okay Good H is height Yeah h is height And that s in Meters Sounds good Okay So now we go over here Mass and kilograms and then velocity and that s in meters per second Good And then if you remember that force doesn t like careless errors so maybe we should make sure that we get from these fundamental units the derived units So what are the units that we re going to have for E sub g and E sub k What is it Joules Joules Oh that s right How do you remember that I m smart Okay That s good too Oh there was a pretest that had that on there That sounds good Okay Great You re taking that prior knowledge Energy is a jewel Energy is a precious jewel Alright You want precious Okay there s jewels There s semi precious and there s precious What are they diamonds and rubies So energy is a precious jewel Kilogram times a meter per second squared Newton Newton Good Newton times a meter A joule A joule Right Over here mass and kilograms Kilogram times meters squared over seconds squared don t forget the square Kilograms times a meter again is a newton Newton times a meter that s going to be kilogram times a meter over seconds squared is a newton and then multiply that by that meter and again you get joules Okay We want to make sure that we don t did everyone see how we got that joule there Meter times another meter right Yeah Because kilogram times a meter per seconds squared gives me a newton Times a meter remember this is meters squared because of that Oh okay Okay So you know the boss doesn t like careless errors so let s make sure that we have the appropriate units Okay I don t mean to interrupt you guys Why don t you continue with that You ve got some formulas here now For potential energy wouldn t mass and acceleration due to gravity be constants so height is the only one that that could manipulate So if the height is the greater distance from the Earth then it would have more potential energy because they re directly proportional Yes Let me ask you guys I can t help but interrupt once in a while right But I just wanted to If I put this marker on the table does this marker have potential energy What is the reference point Oh oh oh The table No The center of our planet Yes Okay So I heard a fight I think that s a good thing The more danger the more fun I thought right Yes They re going to wear their headgear Is this guy wearing any head oh he s wearing head protection Why is that important by the way So the force doesn t apply to your head Okay I like that Ah Inversely proportional right I like that yeah So it increases the amount of time decreases the force So yeah danger is an aspect here but this guy seems like he s doing okay He s got his headgear on but that s definitely if you re designing a park you want to make sure that the people that visit the park aren t going to be injured There are going to be accidents with skateboards but they ll wear their gear I m going to step back and let you guys continue your thought earlier Okay So how high do we want the If we want it to have a bigger potential energy transferring the bigger kinetic energy we might want to have the height from the reference point which is the ground and kind of higher I heard reference point Let me see if I can put a reference point on this I did just put a little click a button and get the reference point okay I think the thing should be on the ground Yeah The weight s like it s safer and it s possible Do you want me to just to extend the We ve got a couple of things going on here I m sorry A couple people said yes they wanted me to put that on the ground So if those people could say that again that would be great Say that again You want to put it on the ground And I think I heard a dissenting voice in the crowd Someone that said something else I did Oh okay I said that if you increase the height it s still possible to have it above the ground because you would have two supports on either side technically you d be able to go back and forth They haven t brought in the supports for this herculean innovation That s right I mean I don t think it really is going to affect the design structure so Whether it s on the ground or I ll just pull that down That s fine Yeah I don t think that s going to make a difference That might make it easier for the person to step off the track too when they re done You know this guy s going to get really tired There s no friction so he won t have to step off on the nice safe track But you notice how as long as the track is longer he doesn t go back up as high so if you have Alright One at a time I like this Someone said something Christina said something and I think Karuna wanted to add to that He goes just as high like there s no change because there s no friction So Yeah then he doesn t go up to the top I could put the pie chart in sure And can you start him at the top Alright So I m going to put the pie chart in and then you want me to he s going to climb up the ladder right There s like a pretend ladder here And then how s that Yeah Okay Now I noticed when I did that something happened The pie chart Oh yeah Why Sounds like a height there that s increasing reference point is greater I like that Okay I m going to let him go I don t know if I can do that actually but I will try Yeah we can play around with it Make the sides taller then he ll have a greater distance to travel and it ll actually be more I don t know if I can yeah I don t think I can do that I don t think it ll it only allows me to click on the blue dots there You have to add track to do that You want me to pull those off to the side Okay Okay So you made a little bit different half pipe Oh no Alright So you don t want to look there s some thermal energy What s going on with that Okay That might ve happened But why do I now see red in the pie chart Yeah There s a force that will allow for the energy to transfer Good Let s get him back on that half pipe and you know guys I don t think that it makes much of a difference in the design or engineering of this whether we make the bottom hit the ground or have it up So I don t really think that is going to make much of a difference But we do need to collect some data and start with this proposal so Where did we leave off I think there was something that we were looking to collect there Height Okay good Let s continue with that please Well measuring tape Oooh There is a measuring tape I don t even see these things Measuring tape oh It even says fet okay good So how s that look No no Well what do you want me to do with it Going to the ground That s not the ground From the reference point Oh alright I m right on the reference point Go up a little So what do you want me to measure Well where am I going to measure From what to what The reference point to the highest point Okay I think the highest point would probably be the center of him but they do have that nice little red dot Can we just agree that we re going to go with the red dot Yes Yeah Why don t we go there It can t be diagonal Okay Is that good Yeah Yes Shut the lights off for this measure Okay Now this measuring tape is a little tricky to work with I wonder if there s any easier way for me to get this Oh Oh that s pretty neat I suppose I could use a measuring tape or I actually have that so maybe that will help make it a little bit easier if it could speed things up So what do we want to say for the height Seven I don t know if I d say seven So we all agree it s somewhere between six and eight yes Yes I d say 7 2 And it does go over the seven a little bit so height equals seven point Two Four Six Zero You tell me or it s going to go forever Let s start over again Seven I don t think it goes to the half mark 7 1 Maybe we need a show of hands on this Who believes it s 7 Who believes it s 7 meters No one s raising their hands that s good How about 7 1 7 1 meters Alright I got one person there Now I m looking at this from an angle right And anytime you want to make a measure you do want to have your eyes right above what you re measuring and obviously I m just going to move over here just so I can get a little bit better And then what else can I do to try to really measure this well Pause it Yeah I think I m going to pause the animation Now if I was making an actual measurement I d make sure my eyes were perpendicular to whatever I was measuring What do we say about oh that s good What do we say about these measures that we make in science They should be you re only as good as your measures Yeah You re only as good as your measures What does that mean Kristen It means that if your measures are not precise and consistent then everything else won t be precise and consistent Can someone elaborate on that a little bit Or do you want to add to that No someone else can elaborate on it Okay Are you sure I can give you a little more No Okay Let s see Who haven t I called on at all today because I want to make sure I get everyone You haven t called on Jill Alright I m sure she doesn t mind repeating it for you I think you said you re only as good as your measures Because if your measures aren t precise then all your other work that you re using the measures for Yeah if you measure something for speed It would be wrong Why Well no if you It could be you re right If you make some poor measures and then you go to graph it No If you take distance and then multiply it by time then speed would be wrong Like if you had the wrong distance then speed would be wrong and then making it after that your graph would be wrong Well it would be wrong right from the perspective you said distance times time and speed is distance divided by time Did everyone hear that Yeah That s okay though You re saying we don t want to get off the main idea here If you re getting these distances wrong and then you re going to graph your slope is going to be incorrect yes So remember in science we collect data From that data we put it in a nice data table to organize it and then we look at trends and patterns graph it look at trends and patterns So if everything starts from our measures those next steps aren t going to be correct 
 Yeah the oil Okay so we discussed that one So Maddie is going to write down about the peanut butter What the observation was At the first observation it was 9 centimetres And it has grown In Joshua s words it has grown Good And you re gonna do that for all three of them Okay um The peanut butter No we just did the peanut butter Oh no I mean the banana it s it s It s grown like 4 inches taller Its like 1 1 and a half inch taller Its like one and half inches Okay what is that Look Its like 9 and a half 10 and a half 9 10 and 12 That s 1 2 3 We re looking at the bananas yeah wait that s half an inch Alright so did you get that Were the Cheetos recorded Okay good Alright so now we ve got let s look here Josh go ahead and read number 9 Compare and record the results from all three fat absorb absorption observations Observations Observations okay so we re going to look at all three here we ve got our data laid out here Look at your Cheetos Um the first time Cheetos was eight and a half inches the second time it was 10 and a half inches and the last time it was 12 12 centimeters So what does that mean Joseph what do you see when you see those numbers going like that Um its like growing because every time you check one its like a little bit bigger and it gets a little more inches on and it gets a little bit more big So basically the longer that the Cheetos sat on the paper towel the more fat and oil is absorbed into the paper towel right Okay So um Josh if you ll just go ahead and write that down about the Cheetos And Hailey what did you notice about the next food The apples Um two times it stayed the same and one time it got a little bit smaller Just got a little bit Yeah Okay it says two are the same and one is just a little bit different And that could have been just um where is our centimeters It could have been just human error where we just sort of measured a little bit off Okay Um cause if you look at this apple sample here there isn t really any coming out of the green circle is there So nothing was absorbed from the apple Did you see that Okay alright So if you ll add that to our list that we ve noticed we observed Shemaire you look at those potato chips I m going to leave that one here Tell us what the overall pattern was with the potato chips The potato chips Talk real loud for me Um ok the potato chips they like changed each time Like the first time it was 5 the second time it was eight and a half and this time it was 7 And what are those that you are talking about what units of measure Centimeters Centimeters okay So we want to make sure we get centimeters written in on there okay uh huh Alright so what does that tell you about potato chips Um that its not like that fat it doesn t got that much grease in it cause pretty much it showed like it was lower and then it got a little bigger then it just got a little bigger Okay so comparing the three here what do you notice Pretty much that this one has more fat than these two It looks like with this observation just this one here in class today and later we re gonna do we ll look at the food labels of potato chips and Cheetos But right now just on our observations it does look like the Cheetos have more fat right now okay But when we start reading its gonna be potato chips Oh that leads us in It s gonna be Cheetos So go ahead so um let s look at number 10 read that for us Josh What can you conclude from the observations and recorded data Which snack has the most or least amount of fat So you all will come and discuss that together and then you can answer that question right there Put most and least Fine okay I d say the apples have the least amount of fat And the potato chips have the least the apples have the least amount of fat then the potato chips second and the Cheetos is last And why do you think that might be Why do you think the banana has expanded the most Because its I don t think its because of the fat in the bananas and getting in Talk loud I don t think its because of fat with the bananas that s getting oil on the paper towel because bananas are pretty healthy and they don t really normally have fat in them Yeah yeah Okay so that s your background knowledge You are aware of that What were you gonna say It s like its not fat or oil its like its just water Maybe water absorbed in it What prediction would you make if we were to let this sit over night to where like the water would have time to dry up What would you predict this paper towel would look like tomorrow Let me go with Tray It would be all wet and soggy So you think it would actually be more wet Yeah Okay Emily what do you think Well I would think that the way it is now that the paper towels are gonna end up like that and the bananas would get all and more disgusting and Okay does anybody think that the banana might that the wet watery part might dry up Maybe I think it would expand a little bit more and then start drying until the water is out of the banana and then the banana starts to dry out too Okay well alright We ll actually leave that one out and see and we ll check on it tomorrow And see what it s doing And we ll kind of answer our own question there okay Okay wait we re not finished what do we say about the banana You have to talk louder though The banana I guess the banana like expands the wetness It expands a couple centimeters like a half a centimeter Good use of centimeters I like how you re using the actual mathematical term there The centimeter is good Okay while she is writing that I m going to let Tray go ahead and read that next question Well if you can see it Maddie will you let him read that so we can kinda be thinking while your finishing up there Um what can you conclude from the observ observation and recorded data What snack has the most most and least amount of fat Well um as my opinion I would think that the banana has more fat than the peanut butter and the least amount of fat would be the fudge Okay Josh Well I would think that the fudge has the least amount cause it has the least amount of absorbed like grease and fat But the banana has like all this oil water and all that like sinking into it Okay Maddie I think that the peanut butter has the most amount of fat because um like I said earlier the bananas are more healthy than the peanut butter and it s probably just water and this is like oils and salt and stuff making it more greasy and that s probably more fat absorbing into the paper and then the fudge hasn t had very much at all so I would say it has the least amount of fat I would agree with like most of y all because the banana and the peanut butter is like has like a lot of wetness in it And the fudge has like a little bit of wetness Like a centimeter Yeah about a centimeter But also the bananas could have the least amount of fat because they are healthier and that s probably just water Compare the results to the original group hypothesis Our hypothesis is that the potato chips will have the most fat Talk loud Our Hypothesis is that the potato chips will have the most fat Our group decided this after discussing Cheetos versus potato chips deep fried and adding salt and Cheetos are made out of cheese so cheese is made out of milk from cows which is healthy Oh wow lots of thought went into that Okay so read that question again how do we compare our original hypothesis to what we ve discovered now in our research We were wrong Say that again We were wrong Okay so according to our data what did you find Why do you say we were wrong Because like the Cheetos they had like a bunch of fat grease and stuff Talk louder And the potato chips they like barely have any They had some but it wasn t quite what you were thinking right What were you gonna say Josh we re gonna come right back to you No Yes Joseph She thought it was the Cheetos which we thought it was that and afterwards now since we found out that it was probably the cheese Talk loud When it gets stuck on you fingers it s all wet and oily and everything Okay No she s the one that said cheese was healthy Okay well think about it some cheeses are healthy this is more of a dehydrated powdered cheese added to the Cheetos right Go ahead Josh what were you gonna say She said that maybe the salt from the potato chips could ve dried up the grease maybe Okay Hailey Pretty much what Josh said It s the same Okay so you just agree with that So Josh maybe you could all just write down some of what you all discussed About the change from what our prediction or our hypothesis was to what we found now Okay And Hailey if you want to go ahead and start some of our discussion questions Okay Based on our discoveries from today what snack has less fat Joseph Um apples Claire Definitely apples Josh Apples Yeah apples When you go home today what snack would you choose based on the data collected today and why Joseph I d probably do the apples because it pretty much has no fat which we learned and I d probably want to eat no more Cheetos since I found out how many fat was in them now Never again Never Oh you wouldn t live would you Very good Hailey say that again I wouldn t eat Cheetos very often You wouldn t eat Cheetos as much but in limited quantities right Okay very good Shemaire which snack would you choose I d probably have to say apples too because they are healthy either way and I love Granny Smith apples they re my favorite Oh good good healthy snack eater I m going to have to say now since we found out Cheetos how much fat it has Then we start thinking about how much fat is actually in there we probably don t know how much fat is in there Right Well we re going to look at those food labels closer now that we ve investigated these and see which one really does have more fat the potato chips or the Cheetos 
 Okay So what s going on with this group You go ahead since you did it We made like a T chart Oh fantastic Graphic organizing Love it We put the ones that we re going to delete over here and then keep over here Now we re discussing why we deleted these or chose them Was it pretty easy to choose the keepers It was Yeah we agreed on most of them What about the delete Have there been some discussions We had to think about the smart and the healthy and religious Yeah Okay Good Oh and stay in school They don t have to stay in school So there were some that you had to discuss a little more Yeah Tell me some of your thoughts Which was the most difficult Probably the religious And also smart Tell me a little bit about the discussion you had with religion Well first of all we thought that it wouldn t be but then we thought some people had different religions and other people My dad has a friend my dad has a friend that isn t a Christian but he s still a really good person It s just like as you grow up being a Christian that s just what you think But then as you think about it that s not how you re a good person Okay So you stepped back from what you knew and you looked around Were you able to come up with some examples like was it your uncle No it was just a friend A friend So were you able to come up with some examples of people that were not religious people Yeah Can you tell me some qualities on the list that they have even though they are not the Christian My uncle he s not religious but he s a teacher So he s helping kids and stuff and he s really nice My neighbor she s really nice You can t even tell that she s not religious You always think she is She s kind and friendly She s respectful I don t know just really nice Okay So when we first put up our list that was one of the qualities that were on lots of list boom boom boom then just religious So we had to step back from it to really stop and think about that Or they could be not doing their best in school but they could be a really great friend or person Very good There s more than one kind of smart Yeah Do you think that having good qualities and keeping yourself with those qualities is another kind of smart Yes And you re right I know some mentally challenged friends people that are some of the most kind hearted people Good discussion Good going Okay Why did you do happy Because whenever you re sad then you just have that gloomy feeling hanging over you all the time Yeah And also if you re not happy all the time you don t have it all the time every minute you can t just be depressed all the time And then Stay in school Yeah Why did we go into stay in school Thank you Lexi Come on over here Veronica Okay ladies what is your question We re going two ways I kind of think that you need to be religious Because if you go to church it helps you become a good person But then at the same time there s like people in the world that are really great people but they re un relgious They can t be religious Like countries And they re still a good person even though they can t Also we were thinking people that do go to church aren t always taking what they learn and using it in their lives So you have found some examples of religious that are not exhibiting other qualities and then people who are not religious who show a lot of these qualities Yeah Okay So that kind of goes both ways I think we should delete I don t know I can go both ways So you can see both sides Yeah You don t have to be religious to be a good person Okay So can you set aside what your own religious beliefs are that if you believe this way if you don t believe this way something bad will happen to you Can you set that aside and just look at the person s qualities My sister has a friend that goes to college with her and she doesn t hang out with her that much but she doesn t believe in God And that s her religion But I guess that would be their religion So really everybody has a religion kind of but they can t express their religion or go to church and stuff like that Okay So which one s our leader Jordan you re our leader So do you want to take another vote and see where it stands Okay You re changing in a way Okay So where do you stand now Those are all qualities that make up a good person but again we all had to make a decision on it But again other groups can have different opinions about that or different opinions on how to make a good person So we can think that you need to be religious but then another group can say you don t have to be religious Right It s all about what this group decides I was also thinking about the Ten Commandments that it has a choice If you want to be religious that s also putting that in mind Okay So are you leaning towards deleting or keeping We re just talking How about you Grace I kind of think it s I don t know I think we should keep and then I think that we maybe should delete because you don t have to go to church to be a good person Does anybody have a personal experience in their own family of somebody who s not religious that is a really great person Well like they don t go to church or they re just not like Okay That is a great statement that Jordan made that will give us pause to think What does religious mean to each one of you So maybe that s another place to start What does that word mean And then that might help you decide whether to delete it or keep it Because going to church doesn t necessarily make you religious You can just walk into the church and listen to your pastor s sermon It doesn t mean that you re a good person So discuss that for just a moment Okay What does religious mean to you I think it means being saved and saying sorry for our sins and asking for forgiveness So that s like the main writing In my opinion of being religious I think that you take what you learn in a church s sermon and you use it in your world You know what I mean Yes If it s a very touching sermon and it s what you believe you can take it back and you can use it to help you go through problems or whatever and then I think also religious is that you re willing to share with other people Yeah You re not embarrassed You re not just holding back and keeping it to yourself No matter if people aren t religious and they ll come up to you and make fun of you here at school You re just willing to put it aside I used to go to a different school I don t remember now But he was a very very very good student And for some reason they did want to I don t know why I didn t figure it out The pastor got fired because it was just a job to him He did something very very inappropriate that a pastor could do with another person within church And he left because he was so embarrassed Why would he have been embarrassed I would have felt bad not just embarrassed And he was married You know what I said about you have to be willing to share Well there was this one pastor Let me turn the camera on you Hold on So there would kind of be a way of saying that it doesn t really work out So if both sides are Okay All right Regan let s hear again what you said about the deleting why would you thought you would delete it Oh I m not the one who said delete Oh okay I said delete it because I know people that are not atheist who are not Yes ma am I will tell her Thank you Scarlet Vicki is not here today Thank you ladies for getting quiet when the intercom rang Now discuss continue They re still Christian but they re still just as good as any other person would be That s why I think we should delete it But I don t know Okay Maybe it s the way she put it because she said it changes you inside but being Christian it does kind of change you inside Okay So you have a person in your life that you consider to have some qualities that make them a really great person but they are not religious Yeah They re not atheist but they re not Christian Okay Do you have anybody in your life that s not religious that you find a lot of good qualities My grandpa He s not saved but he still believes I guess it just depends on how the person acts Okay How about you Do you have anybody in your life Yeah named Delaney she s an older person But she really really likes her house and stuff And would you consider her to have qualities that make a really great person Yes But you would not consider her religious Oh no But she is not really atheist but she doesn t believe in anything But she doesn t believe in being atheist So we re kind of on the fence on this one in that some people think it needs to be deleted and others think no it makes a difference Do you know anybody who says that they are religious and they don t have qualities of a great person Yes Some people as soon as they get out of church they ll go out and do stuff that wouldn t be religious Yeah It s kind of like they don t have a Christian background They ll sit in the church room and they say I m a Christian because I m here at church but really you go do this at other places So then I guess it all boils down to what do you believe or what do you think that religious means A lot of people would say Oh I m religious but then like you said spend the rest of the week doing things Yes But they re kind of being truthful if they say they re not religious and they re not really religious So it s kind of two things so truthful but they re not religious Or maybe being a fake Christian like sitting in church They ll watch a football game just waiting for church to end But maybe that s kind of worse than saying I m not a Christian but also be a good person Okay So you re the leader in this group Why don t you poll each other again and see if they want to now delete other people Okay So go ahead and ask Okay So I put I m not sure yet We re still not sure That s fine That s fine If we re not sure yet we don t have to put it in one side or the other yet if we re not done discussing it This may be one that the group can t agree on I think it s a good thing to have but you don t have to have it to be a good person Yeah I think we can just delete it It is good to have but people can be really good people and not be religious Everybody agree with that If you re still thinking No I don t want to say that this is the safe place to say that Nobody s going to kick you Because even religious people can also be 
 Okay I can see two in here Can you read the article first please Yes Loudly The president of the republic should be an Egyptian born to Egyptian parents and enjoy salient political rights His age must not be less than 40 Gregorian years Mm hmm I agree with the president um Mm hmm He should be Egyptian born to Egyptian parents because it will have make him have well rounded perspectives and it may lead him to having interests to other countries and so It would make him have interest or will not make him prevent him It would not prevent him to um from getting to a different country s interest than his country Okay Good job I agree with Yessenia because if both if he s from parents that are Egyptians he can have some connection with Egyptians and he won t have pressure from other countries that want to change some of the rules they have And um have like wars with different countries about their economy and things they have different Mm hmm That s what I that s what my opinion yeah that s why I agree with her Good I disagree with the part of the where it says that they should be Egyptian parents Mm hmm But I agree with Jesus and his concerns about the Egyptian parents But my opinion is that they should have at least one parent Egyptian and the other another race Mm hmm Because if one parent s Egyptian like the child or the becoming president would have a something of concerns and would know some parts of Egypt and its government and if the other and this other race would help him guarantee for the governments in the other places and countries states Okay Good job Which the legislative process Good job I agree with Yessenia and Jesus because if they re from Egypt and their parents are Egyptian then they can have some cultural background and they ll know more from people and they ll have connections with the people Good Good So now what is the result now Do you think you re going to change the part I see I ve heard some different opinions here Are you going with the change or do you want to keep it as it is I think we should keep it as it is because I mean that s a good thing to have Egyptian parents and a background like Hilda said a background of culture Mm hmm So I ll say yes leave it Just leave it the same Okay Just that part Okay Very good So you will just leave that part as it is without change Is there any other parts for this article Yeah there s a second part His age must not be less than 40 Gregorian years Mm hmm Um I disagree because um when you re young you ll know more about technology and computers and everything Mm hmm And that s how um the youth and younger children in Egypt that s how they went and communicate I agree with Yessenia a lot because when a president is younger but not old he can connect with the youth and other younger people Because when Egypt was in the revolution the president was 81 years old Mm hmm Mm hmm Eighty four And behind the revolution was the young and they were like younger So he didn t really understand them really well and they didn t understand him well because he was a little older than them So for me I ll say 35 um yeah that s a good age for the president They can connect with teenagers and people of younger I just Very good I like the connection that you made Jesus between the age and the people who were behind the revolution Good job I disagree with Jessie and Jesus Good Yeah Because I think that part of the constitution is okay because 40 um 40 years is makes them have plenty of experience and to doing his their work And like it makes them like for like what Jesus said about technology they can learn about it and they can show them and all So basically they they ll pretty much know Who do you mean by they The becoming president That the old or the young The old The older one He cannot understand or work with technology that much Yeah Because Jesus said that they um they won t know about technology much Mm hmm But they if they re 40 they would have plenty of experience Mm hmm And they can learn about the technology and know how to communicate with the younger adults and teens you know Okay Good good I agree with Emi but I agree with Jesus and Yessenia so Mm hm That s okay Um because Focus on what you want to do Like youth was like 70 or 80 of Egypt Oh good But if he s older he s going to have more responsibilities Mm hmm And he can be more responsible Mm hm So I disagree with Hilda Responsibility Because when they re younger they re more active and more responsible Like they can remember most things where they keep stuff And when they re active they can like travel through Egypt and see what s wrong with the country and what s wrong with the economy and they can make changes and talk to some people about their opinions and things they want to change the country So I ll say the younger but not too young Like 35 and up Thank you My opinion is that 40 is okay because the young the young people like at 35 because 35 s not that young but lower than that can make a little bit of difficulties because they make they might make like a mistake They might not know a thing and they just put another thing You mean they will not be mature enough Yeah mature Sure Good Like the 40s the 40 year old people like they they pretty much know everything They learn it they were educated The government laws and Mm hmm this and that Mm hmm But I think that part is 40 years is better Good So you would like to say okay just to open or or or break it down to so young like 30 or 20 or even teenager right Well I like that the two parts that you brought Hilda about 70 that the majority of the population of Egypt are already youth And your part that you said that this will make Jesus that that will make help them to have good connection with the young people there Good job So what did you decide on I see that you re going with certain direction We should change it The first part of the statement of Art 75 Mm hmm Which is the constitution We should keep that as it is And the second part of the 40 years we should change it Well we should leave it like that as well Very good I like how you are compromising with them Emi and you are going with the change So what part are you going to change Um It will be transforming to what Thirty five Mm hmm Thirty five years Not less than 35 Not less Good job Excellent Very good After you take your notes let s move to the next article Article 77 The term of the presidency shall be Gregorian six Gregorian years starting from the date of the announcement of the results of the Mm hmm The president of the republic may be re elected for other successful years Mm hmm I disagree with the six years Um Yes Mm hmm Yes Keep going Because I think it s a little longer and some advantages are that people could get tired of the same president um having them over again And I think it should be lower for four years like in America And some of the disadvantages are that people could like him and he might be re elected for another six more years Um people could elect him because he did some great things to the economy and things to the country And that s what I think of for the first one What do you all think about it You think the first one should be as it is or changed Changed to four years Changed to four years Yeah Okay What do you think I agree I agree with Jesus because an example of this is Hosni Mubarak He he um was following supposedly the terms of the constitution which which he made an excuse and took many chances in um having the presidency So I for like 30 years So I my opinion is to lower it down to four years and if they re re elected which they can use democracy like here in America Mm hmm If they re re elected they will have at least 12 years Basically Okay Do you disagree Um the statement I agree because it will give them more stability and more time to elect Mm hmm I agree with Jesus and Emi Why do you agree with them Because six years is a lot of years and if they don t like him they ll have to wait a lot a long time so that another president can come into power Okay So you think bringing it down to four years is better than having the president for one term for six years Yes Okay The second one is the president of the republic may be elected for another successful years The thing I dislike about this is that they don t really explain how um the terms For example the president of Egypt um used an excuse to be re elected because um he said that in the constitution it said it didn t say specifically how much how many terms um they lead So I ll I ll change that that um leave specifically a number of terms they need to be elected Um Very good point Luis I didn t um Jesus I m sorry Very good point here You brought really a very important point And this is what will this was like the concern of many people over there The specification of of what Successful terms Of the how many terms very good Successive terms Very good Does anybody have an opinion or disagreement Uh I I agree with Okay I agree with um you because that s what Hosni Mubarak was really he was making excuse to like stay um him how like it is to keep him as a president and re elect him over and over to um and he was telling them that he was following the constitution because their theory said there was like no number of Yeah so he I agree also because like you said the example of Hosni Mubarak was the serious serious excuse They um the people were basically mad at them that um certain term because they didn t give a number of the terms so um that s why Hosni Mubarak made that excuse and wanted to take over Very good When the point of staying too many years in power or in office that brings to me something that s going on in other two countries You remember any of the other countries in the Middle East and Africa that has something going on there Because of this specific part Libya and Yemen What s going on in Libya now They re protesting against um Gaddafi Very good yes Good job I like how you remembered his name Why Why they are protesting against him Because he d been in power for like about 43 years Good job Mm hmm Okay what else is going on in another country Or what country is having something going on Yemen Yemen Yemen Very good Okay Well this brings us to go back again a little further something about different types of governments Remember Egypt was a republic okay When their the president stayed there for so many years that will not be a republic country That will be what A dictatorship A dictatorship Very good That will be a dictatorship So the the the type of government is if government is not a the republic or maybe democracy as they say or claim but it will be it will be A dicta A dictatorship Very good And the people in power the people in the office government office will be what Dictators Okay It s because they do what they want to do and they don t listen to other people Okay and what is another name for dictatorship or very close to it 
 So who can tell me in this group who can remind me what is our objective What are we discovering today in science I d like to see a lot of volunteers Lindsey We re seeing what soil holds water better and We re seeing which soil holds water better What s the term for that Holds water Chris It s absorbing the water What s absorbing the water The clay and the sand absorb the water Very good So we re trying to figure out which absorbs more water Clay or sand today Very good Who can tell me what was the first step that you did in this project Cameron First we poured in the sand What did you pour the sand into We poured it into a funnel Okay What s that thing on the funnel It s a coffee filter It s a coffee filter Why do we need a coffee filter on the funnel Because when it s on the funnel it makes it so that the sand doesn t run through the funnel Okay All right What s the second step Can somebody tell me what the second step is Cameron said you dump the soil sample whether it was clay or sand into your funnel What s the second step Caleb The second second step is to pour in the water The second step was to pour in the water Who can tell me what the third step is What s the third step Chris You record how long it took for it to drip every last drop into the cup of water What s it The water The water Good You re recording how long it took for all of the water what s that word called What did that water do to get from here to the surface to the bottom of the cup Cameron It drained It drained Very good What are you measuring in Are you measuring in seconds Are you measuring in minutes In hours Lindsey Measuring in minutes with the seconds You re measuring in minutes with seconds Okay Can you tell me how long your clay is up to for draining out the water Two minutes and a half Two and a half minutes Good Can you tell me Cameron how long it took for your water to drain through your sand It took 28 seconds Twenty eight seconds Good job Keep up the good work I really like all the diagrams that I m seeing Lindsey you did an excellent job at paying very close attention and following the steps in step by step order You can give yourself a point for science Good job Ladies can you tell me did your sand hold water Yes It did hold water How did you know that Because it absorbs some of the water I poured it in here and it had into the water so the sand holds 11 milliliters of water Good So you re saying that the sand held 11 milliliters of water You said that when you poured the water in through the sand then you dumped something in this graduated cylinder What did you dump in this graduated cylinder We dumped all the water that was in there What s there In the cup So you dumped all the water that was in the cup after what What did the water do in order to get in the cup It drained through the funnel through the sand down into the cup So it drained through the funnel through the sand down into the cup So then you took your water and you poured it in your graduated cylinder Luana you said you did 40 minus 29 to get 11 milliliters Why did you do 40 minus 29 Because that s how you find out how much the sand is holding That s how you find out how much the sand is holding How did you know to start with 40 Because we poured 40 milliliters of water in the cup to start Oh To start you poured 40 milliliters of water in You took the water that you had to start and took away the amount that was left which you got 11 milliliters Very good Excellent Gentlemen what are you noticing about sand and water We re noticing about the sand this time it took us two minutes and eight seconds for it to stop dripping We started out with 40 milliliters and What did you do with that 40 milliliters of water We poured it into the strainer to drain it down into the cup and when we poured into the cylinder we had 28 and a half milliliters Very good How do you figure out how much water is in the sand What subtraction sentence would you do Forty minus 30 So you re rounding up You said you had to 30 Yes That s a very good choice You re going to do 40 minus 30 so that tells you how much water is in the sand which is One 10 Ten what Milliliters Ten milliliters Very good Do you think some of that water s still in the funnel Because this funnel is still dry This funnel feels wet Do you think some of that 10 milliliters of water is in this not funnel in this filter Yes Do you think so Why do you think that Because it s soaked and some of the water might have stopped in there because it was so thick and sandy And now it s a little bit thinner Keep up the great work Sam and Madison what are you noticing about water with your sand and water with your clay The sand drains the water faster than the clay The sand drains the water faster than the clay Have you figured out yet which one holds more water Clay The clay holds more water If you were a gardener and if you were planting a garden what would you rather garden with Would you rather garden with sand or would you rather garden with clay Sand Why s that Because it drains water better and the drainage would get to the plants faster Okay So the drainage would get to the plants faster Where do the plants need the water Roots At the roots What do you think Madison I would do a mixture of sand clay and humus because mixed together it s loamy and loamy soil is good for the plants Great observation That s wonderful So you said you d mix all of them together because that would make a loamy mixture which would allow the gardeners to get the best soil for the plants to grow Very good Nice job What are you three noticing about water and sand and water and clay Water and sand it can absorb through the sand the water And through the clay it soaks and at four minutes You re almost at four minutes for your clay Wow What do you think this shows you about what happens on a rainy day whether it s outside in our soccer field Or what happens on a rainy day in your backyard Does anybody want to tell me what happens The clay it gets very muddy because the water is pouring down on it It might make a puddle because some of the soil on the ground can t hold itself so it might make a puddle Good So Matthew when you poured your water into your clay did you have a puddle at the top of your clay Yeah we had a puddle at the top of our clay because it was leaking little drops and it stayed on top of the clay We had to wait a long time till we could pour more water What stayed for a long time on top of the clay The water did because it didn t have small particle sizes so it was hard for the water to get through Oh so the clay has small particle sizes so it s hard for the water to get through Wow Good job What does that mean about the particle size for the sand It means that the particle for sand is bigger and it has more space for the water to drain through Good Excellent Did any of you draw diagrams of what your experiment set up looked like What it looked like I think you have a diagram on the previous page Did you draw a diagram Yes Okay What did your diagram show My diagram for sand shows that the water is going right through the funnel and it s pouring to the bottom And for my clay it s little drops because the clay is stuck together once it has water Good I can easily tell in your diagram which one s sand and which one s clay One suggestion that I can make to you though is I would like a few more labels If I were to never see this experiment before how would I know that this is sand and that this is clay So if you could label those for me and tell me what these drops are I don t know if they re water or or milk If you could do a little bit more labelling for me that would be excellent Good job Nice work Very impressive How long are you guys up to for your water being through your filter through your clay Five minutes and 45 seconds Five minutes and 45 seconds I can tell that both of you are working very hard And Xavier you re doing excellent job at staying in your seat the whole time You can give yourself a point right now for being on task Nice job Good What are you noticing about sand clay and water I noticed that the clay held less water than the sand and I was really surprised by that because I thought that water can go through sand fast So you were really surprised because you didn t think water would go through sand that fast And how much water did your sand hold Our sand held 11 milliliters Eleven milliliters Good And how much did your clay hold do you know Five Held five milliliters Wow What number sentence did you do in order to figure out how many milliliters were in the clay and how many milliliters were in the sand We did 40 minus however the milliliters were left in the cup Okay And why did you do that Because we had 40 to begin with and we needed to find out how many were left and I forgot You forgot Kendall can you help her out We got 29 in this and it began with 40 So we had to do 40 minus 29 Forty minus 29 is 11 millimeters Milliliters Good Remember millimeters is when we re using rulers and milliliters is when we re measuring water Okay Excellent job Which soil would you rather garden with Would you rather garden with sand or would you rather garden with clay I would garden with both of them so I could get a loamy soil and loamy soils are better for the flowers Okay So you would mix them together so that you could get a loamy mixture What about you Kendall I would do sand because water can get through it easily So water can get through it easily Why would that matter Because the soil and everything else and the grass and everything needs water but if you use clay it just stays on top and it can t get water Very good Excellent Looks like you girls are ready to move on to your graphing What are we going to graph What are we graphing today How much water is in the 
 So what about this part Is this any different or is this part the same as last time It s different because Well Let s let Rileen talk Chris It s different because it s wider and it got right to here and the other one came up to there It s like six more it s like ten more centimeters than last time Okay So once you guys finish with your observations you guys can start working on collecting your data for the canyon and for the delta See this part is completely dry It s pretty much almost half Water s above the side Watch that watch that it s gonna fall Look at that It s like a boat going down a waterfall That was sand I know The water has stopped going One minute s passed Thirty Oh There s a start to get ready It s not done playing It s still not done Well the water Look at this look at this I know we re still dry There s a pool of water at the end There s a pool of water at the end Look at this there s a dent there s a dent Oh wow Right here s dry Okay why do you guys think this part didn t get any water Because it probably went under So Cameron says it went under Xander what were you saying It was going too fast and it didn t it was probably right here so it didn t decide to go all the way over here and it went right here It formed a lake right here It went the easiest route So it s got eight or nine minutes So now ten nine minutes Is water still draining Yeah the water s still there When are you guys gonna decide when the end time is When this goes There s been nine minutes right And the water is dripping Last time we got 15 minutes The water s dripping into basin Last time we got 15 minutes So how does it all compare Because um it compares because it s almost the same and look at it like poured a pool or something Cameron you were saying this one is almost the same Like it took the same amount of time No No No I m saying it s getting there No the other one s longer because it drained a bigger whole Yeah So Elondra how was the time different for this one How it was like similar Let s hear what Elondra says This one went faster This one went faster Yeah way faster So you re saying it s similar not too different But Elondra s saying it went faster Do you agree with her Yeah and the deposition it s like way over here Way across there You guys are I think pretty much done with your water draining now Okay so Nine or ten minutes and it s done So you guys want to record your end time No no it s still going It s okay if there s still a little bit of water left in Once it stops draining you guys can put the tape over here and you guys can start taking your measurements Where do we get the toothpicks Don t we have to know what time it is 10 30 right Was this when the chocolate melts When s the chocolate melt Elondra What It looks like chocolate So are you guys ready to start taking your measurements Yeah Why don t you guys open up your science notebooks so you have the table in front of you and I ll bring by a toothpick so you can get started on the writing Yeah I think the widest part is right here Can I do the poking Huh Can I do the poking You guys have your measuring tape out We have to go get the measuring tape Tape that back up Here our widest part is right here Widest part is that No no no you re not supposed to poke it How long is that It s about to here Okay we got what we need Go from centimeters Centimeters Aw Cameron Cameron you messed it up That s not our longest part Our longest part is this Okay we have to redo it Wait where does we start Right here Here you do the poking Don t poke it into the thing but how deep is it Here grab it No you re not supposed to do that Remember what she did Okay this right here It s about three centimeters Three centimeters So depth of straight channel is three centimeters Okay what do we measure next Okay time to do the width How much was it Three centimeters Three Okay What s the widest Where s the measuring tape Around six centimeters How much Six Six centimeters Six Okay now we need to do width of soil drop to end of stream channel It s all this it s all from right here It s from here to here You guys we need the tape measure Yeah width from here to here No it s this long I ve got it with my fingers This long It s about 15 No it s 14 and a half No that s 15 Yeah 15 Oh yeah 15 Same with the other one 15 It goes all the way to the end Yeah length Okay 29 How many 29 Yeah and depth of soil dripped at the end of end of the stream channel Where s the toothpick So right here Right there yeah Okay where s the time Okay so can you hold that there How much is it Five centimeters How many Five Five c m Okay width of the soil dropped at the end of the stream channel So right here We re gonna actually move to here No no width Oh width Looks about 11 centimeters maybe 11 centimeters Alright length of the soil dropped at the end of the stream channel So now we re measuring that Here you can do it So what re you guys working on measuring now Length We ve got a long length 27 28 28 yeah 28 centimeters Jorge you can measure Now what do we measure Depth of soil dropped at end of the Wait what was it 28 Depth of soil dropped at the end of the stream channel Where s the toothpick I m letting Jorge do it Okay Jorge you can do this one So maybe poke it here Poke it in there Now put your finger down Put your finger down where it is Slide it down until you feel the dirt Good Bring it over to Kendra So you can kinda see the dirt right there That s not even a centimeter You start here Okay That s not even a centimeter That s three millimeters So we round it down to zero centimeters Okay Zero Okay we re all done No we still have to Work on your bird s eye view picture in your notebook Up in the big can Oh no they re over there Okay The same bird s eye view or a different view That s what I was going to I m especially gonna draw in here because that s really interesting Really interesting Did Cody just go get something Yes he did Oh my gosh he s so nice So did you guys finish taking your data Yeah we re gonna do our bird s eye view Before you guys look at your bird s eye view I want you to share What d you guys find from your data So let s look at your data tables for a minute Okay It kind of made like a cave No right here Yeah So I see the difference right here In the depth of the stream channel the basic stream was actually more than the rushing river What was more Like in centimeters so one centimeter off So Alejandro s looking at the depth of the stream channel and the last time it was three centimeters deep and this time it was only two centimeters deep So last time it was actually deeper How about which one was wider The rushing river So the rushing river made a wider stream channel Yeah I think the reason why it was wider is because more water came in It basically didn t spend enough time going in it basically just went Yeah and it made it more curved inish and stuff Okay Jorge what d you notice I noticed that right here it made a little cave and I think something like water I think there was a little whirlpool there Yeah there was There were a bunch of whirlpools Yeah there were doubles There s one right here and here So I think it broke the water I saw one little whirlpool right there and another one over here I saw one here So the water was kinda doing some different things in some of these places Yeah I think it s cause it curves like that so the bubbles keep on spinning if the water s coming through Yeah so the water s So what about the delta The deposition How is this different than your first experiment Oh my gosh it was five centimeters bigger Five centimeters bigger What d you notice Jorge The biggest part was that it was only this part right here Okay Yeah that was the longest part that was part of it all So Cody I noticed that this time how deep was your delta Our delta which would be to get that soil Yeah Zero centimeters So does that mean there s no delta So how did you guys come up with zero Cause it was three millimeters so we had to round down Okay so you guys have your data And the length of the soil It was a lot wider wasn t it Yeah the length of the soil was like four centimeters bigger It was from the end right here and it continued down So you guys remember we re gonna take this data Someday are we gonna put more of that stuff in here Oh put more of the earth material in Yeah And see what it would be like if you added more material Okay maybe that would be a question we could investigate Maybe the delta would be thicker because there s not enough room for all of it You know why I m asking you that Because I think it would be deeper because right here it only makes little ones here but the other one would probably make it bigger because it has more space Okay So you think these channels might be bigger Yeah If there was more earth material What if we made an even bigger hole Oh so you re wondering if it was an even bigger flood what might happen Maybe that would be a hole like this big Yeah you guys are doing that thing that scientists do after they do an investigation they start asking more questions I wonder what if we tried this So you guys have got your data so we ll be ready to put this in the class data table right Find our averages probably on Thursday Right now you guys are going to be working on you want to make sure you get the runoff sample draw what that looks like today we ll see what it looks like when it settles out later and then you guys are going to work on your bird s eye view and think about where s the humus where s the gravel where s the clay so you can add that into the picture Hey guys I m gonna like Yeah I was thinking the same thing like rip this up Whoa there s the biggest Oh that s cool Ms Maher it made a big dip I m guessing that some water s still down there 
 I don t want a straight line No I like curves Yeah a lot Because the friction in the air Yeah Pushes it and the gravity going on the next turn I think it s because there s like a big wall and that s a small little plane and everything has gravity You need to pull on the string And the reason why it s not going that way is because that wall will stray them away The wings get cool What was your longest throw How long was it Oh it was It was mine and it was probably one two three four five six Five No it s six One two three four five six Into the six but not before the six Oh yes into the six Alright Go over there check that out 38 Four hundred 538 centimeters Yeah Let s put how many meters Five meters Write 538 But why did because fliers don t go into the wall Because Everything has a little bit of gravity There s not a whole lot of gravity where it would just go Yeah and then that doesn t have a lot of gravity but I mean I can see that but he threw it high and it went up to the wall right there But it kind of did like that But it didn t really smash I mean it didn t go and stick Yeah it didn t go Gravity pulled it but it wasn t going to hold it there Yeah It s got more force on it Yeah I think there s more gravity up there than right here because that s higher and it s closer It s like it has a lot more gravity What has more gravity Up there Had more pull I think the reason why the sticks were going and the straw was going this way is because everything has a little bit of gravity And the wall And the wall it like a lot bigger than that stick and it s gravity that s pulling it there but it doesn t have enough gravity where it will just be like It s not like this Okay so if everything has a little bit of gravity what is the major gravity pull though that is bringing it down The Earth The Earth because That s why like if we threw this that s why That s why it chops Okay this one went it went three meters This one covered straw with paper and this one glides It s a lot bigger So when it went like here it went all the way down to the Yeah it s faster because it s bigger and this one s smaller and it doesn t go far Glider the other one s probably bigger This one s also flat so it s got a better chance to glide Yeah That one s like round and bigger and it doesn t flop on the and it doesn t go like far When you throw it it doesn t like when it goes it doesn t go far but this one like it ll go far What do you think would happen if we put a paperclip on either the front or the back It would help It would lay it a little bit down It would go a little bit down because it s it has more weight it ll go down If you put a paperclip on it like a paperclip s not that heavy but it would make it like when we fly it it goes up in the air and then comes back down and floats down That s why they re so short What makes it come down Gravity Okay And like you put a paperclip on it it ll come down Because the paperclip is heavier than the straw What if you put it on the back It would it would It would kind of slow it It would be like that Okay can you think of What about this one What if we put the paperclip on this one It would It wouldn t feel It would get worse If we put the paperclip on here then it would get all messed up because if it s flat and it s trying to It has weight it will just go Uh huh right That one when you fly it before we got the paperclip it goes high before it comes down But when we put the paperclip on it it goes straight down like that And like without the paperclip without the paperclip on it it will go like it will go like an ocean With the paperclip on there it would go farther It would go farther and then it ll fall just down like that but not go like that This one let s try this one See that one goes a lot farther And it probably goes farther because I put a lot of force on it If you even put a lot of force on this one it will go down because it flies like I threw it like that and it just flies off because it s the gravity And you throw that one it goes farther Okay so gravity makes it come down faster than the glider It makes it go down because if you just throw it without the paperclip it won t it will just come down because of gravity _ Yeah the straw one is going like that And then it just goes like see how it flips down But with the paperclip it ll go farther Like that Tyler what were you saying about the air Do you think that has a do you think that makes a difference in what Mary Morgan is saying this one kind of floats and then comes down Go talk about that See the air The air feels like windy in here It would push it and then it would It would go like this Yeah like that And it would just push It would just push it towards like where everything was Yeah and this one with the paperclip goes really far And that paperclip the reason it went far without the paperclip is because air pushed it and force What is that force called When you push it Remember it s called The thrust The thrust that s right So the thrust when you push the plane made a difference is that what you said Could you change the one with the straw is there any changes that you could make that you think would make it fly further Talk about that as a group Put two paperclips One on the front and one on the back Put the lighter one on the back Let s try that I bet it will It might go farther too Okay now push We have a paperclip on it and we re going to see if it goes farther the second time I think I bet it will go I bet it goes a lot longer That s fine Well It went to 10 It went to 10 Okay so I want you to discuss in this group I want you to discuss what you found when you threw when you tested this with the paperclip on it Just talk about that together Well So when there s air I think when they closed the air up it went in and back out But but but tied together So if you like flip off The paper clip The air like if you could do this and turn off the air it would go further But if you take off of it I mean if you it won t make it that far It will just be like The paper clip the straw it does help Yeah about the same as this one without I wonder what that one s like with paperclips Me too I want to try it This is my prediction I think it s on an angle I think that s going to go further I don t know because they don t have no air stream to hold it I think it will go farther I don t See Well you didn t put a lot of force on that one Well we all have to try But I still think it went the farthest but I think I think it s going to go farther Nope Well it went farther than you It went But I mean it didn t go You all tried it with this didn t you all Let me try it this way I tried it with that I tried it with that side It all went to the yellow but But it didn t Strong enough So what did we find out back here That it puts more weight on it so it goes What puts more weight This little paperclip The paperclip puts more weight to that one and it s not going to nose dive But I was standing right here and mine hit that wall And that s without the paperclip And then you put the paperclip on there it doesn t go near as far Why did that make a difference Was your throws the same Did you use the same amount of force What happened Mine felt like I was using the same force I think it s just because that since there isn t any air space on that one What do you mean airspace I mean like the air can t go through this Yeah like that s a straw it has a hole It s just putting more weight on that one so that s just going to go boop If you use this one and put the paperclip right here it s going to cut off the air coming in right here And that s going to go further Oh you re took off the air of the straw And that makes it go further Why does that Because the air in the straw is pulling it down because it s like Do you know what that s called Gravity Well the gravity but what about the air when the air is coming in Friction Oh friction Friction the air is causing friction Okay The air s slowing it down And also the air Okay now I want you to think about if you change this plane in any way what changes could you make to it to make it fly further We could cut it up Wrap around and then have that like this Yeah I think that s set to have the same throw Because actually having That one can go farther but the paperclips on it it won t fly further But if you put paperclips on this one it d probably go farther Put some paperclips on there Because paperclips add more weight Yeah and it lets it go further Here Tyler you want to throw That went two 
 So how would you describe that Can you find the exact spot where that is in the text where you can find those So you basically have found two character traits to describe to me right You guys have discovered that he can be what What was one of them again Jealous Sad Jealous Or sad So I want you to find that evidence If you want to make those claims any of those are great ideas But now you have to dig a little bit deeper into the text and see if you can find this Can you find examples and see OK Keep sharing You re doing a great job Toby wanted to play Because Toby was kinda jealous because Bouncer was outside by himself Didn t want to Nobody didn t and a little kid wanted to go outside the house Well I think he s thinking this himself Because he was thinking about what the other That s Toby So he s kinda jealous because he s talking to the other little dog and every single time he wants to play ball with him But he doesn t want to And the thing is the lady said it in the story it made it sadder than it usually would be sad That sometimes the stories make it seem so sad so good that that can feel So here where it says Why does Andy need a new dog Oh wait Why does Andy need a new dog wondered Toby He already has me Toby sighed and laid down Beside the dog Maybe Andy doesn t love me anymore They had to make it so that what happened and actually it s sad what happened It s not that it s sad but it s not so so sad but they make it like sad Toby wanted Toby wanted to play ball and he got a new dog and forgot I was about to Well he didn t really forget about Toby because he still bought Toby his food I know Toby wanted to play ball but when Andy came he got a new dog And then for the rest of the day Andy was playing with his new dog And Toby felt left out I say we put left out somewhere He s so sad jealous and left out So Toby wanted to play ball with Andy but when Andy How do you spell Andy A N D Y Andy Andy Where do you see Oh yeah When Andy told him he wanted to play ball Where are you Andy Andy Toby wanted to play ball but when Andy came he had a new dog And you spelled with a silent I think with the Andy Another dog A new Like this one Another dog No it s not Well whatever Who wants to Just write Just write I put Toby was jealous because of Bouncer Maybe we can put because he wanted more attention That s how my sister is She wants more attention We re not talking about your sister We re talking about Toby So Toby was jealous Toby was jealous because a dog s there Because Toby was a dog and Bouncer just came along and he didn t like him He s jealous No We have to write a reason why he s jealous I know Then we have to do part of the test Part of the test Did you guys agree on a character trait that he was at the beginning Jealous Jealous Jealous Do you have at least one example and maybe two Do you have an example Joaquin I m going to put Toby wanted more attention but Bouncer got more attention Do you have an example of why he wanted more attention I have one Can you find it Oscar When he was like maybe Bouncer doesn t love him anymore I only said that Can you find that So when you write it when you explain it can you find that part and maybe quote it There s another reason When they came through the driveway he got all And then when he came back he lay So that s like too many things Toby was jealous cuz Toby was jealous cuz Bouncer got more attention instead of Toby No Yeah Oh right here In the middle Toby since nobody What paragraph is that Paragraph nine He wondered if Andy had forgotten all about him Do you know why he paid more attention to Bouncer Because he s a little puppy And little puppies need more attention than big puppies Because little puppies don t know what to do I know And they re not even trained They have to train them more For like three months Yes That s why he needs more attention than Bouncer yeah Toby needed Because Toby really knows how to And he knows that s an old dog And you can see all the wrinkles That s how the dogs are Yeah those dogs have wrinkles when they re big already But they re still young OK Toby was jealous because Bouncer What did you write So I have In the beginning was Toby When Andy had a puppy he liked Bouncer more than Toby Maybe And in the beginning Andy was showing the puppy opening Opening the puppy and showing it to Toby Yes That s how he was like nervous Jealous Yeah jealous And selfish Yeah That s what I put in the beginning And then Toby Remember the part when he got the little ball Right Yeah and he was being jealous Yeah Bouncer Because he was a new one And the old one was Toby And the part when Andy closed the door in Toby s face and he let him outside Then he felt loner I believe that Toby was getting Bouncer Because they would stay together and they slept the whole night together So they were being friendly Yeah like starting to Yeah Another thing that Bouncer was new And another thing Toby was old So Andy was used to Bouncer And Bouncer and Toby And that s I think what Toby about It s Bouncer You know how the fence went to Bouncer They get a kinda middle something Yeah That s what I think When they started to get Toby showed Bouncer how to catch the ball that s when they started to become friends And the climax is when Andy he throw the rubber ball and told Bouncer to go and fetch it but he just sit there and then yeah Then Andy called Toby to go and show him how to pitch the ball Okay Oh almost part of the end is when the puppy that is Bouncer becomes crying and then Andy took the puppy to Toby Yeah in the beginning I was getting like selfish May I interrupt for a second so you guys it looks like you ve developed the beginning pretty well and you found examples right Have you talked about the ending yet and how he was at the end I see you re on the back page How does Toby change at the end Have you guys talked about that part yet What s his character trait at the end of the story We talked about the Okay so who was working on that part Was somebody working on that part Yeah was there a trait that you picked for him at the end When the little puppy Bouncer started crying and Andy took the little puppy Bouncer when Toby How did Toby change then How do we describe Toby then Happy Happy yeah can you give an example of now that he s happy He s happy why Because he just thinks anymore that Ohhh Can you come up with another reason maybe together if you guys can look for another example as to why at the end of the story Toby is happy Can you look and see if you can find one I think that Toby in the ending is kind Is kind Okay can you come up with an example and share it with them in the scene And then maybe you guys can come up with a consensus on one that you agree Or you can write two different things right You don t all have to write the same thing One of you can write he s kind and one of you can write he s happy as long as you have what as long as you have what Your reason Your reason absolutely So share that other example Share that other example too I think I ve got he s kind Maybe because he s going to be kind to Bouncer because he s still like a little puppy and he doesn t know how to do stuff I think Yeah in the end when he said for me at the end he was getting kind of happy because Andy told Bouncer to Andy told Toby to to get the yellow ball You know the yellow ball Yeah And Bouncer was kind of tired and everything because he s he s small and Toby he catched it and they were playing yeah and they were getting happy and Toby in the end at that part he was used to liking Bouncer now Mm hm At the climax At the climax it was when It was when Toby When Andy told Toby to show Bouncer how to fetch the ball and then started fetching the ball and then he started to play and Bouncer and Bouncer danced on his bed Bouncer tried Okay 
 Who came up with the definition for radiation Peter you had a good definition could you repeat that remind us I don t remember it exactly but it was something along the lines of anything with waves that move waves that are radiated I mean Didn t you say it was waves that are spread Yeah waves that are spread by something and they usually have energy with them Like the sun sends its radiation to the earth in the form of light heat UVA UVB rays Okay so with that understanding would you guys say that all radiation is harmful Not all Yes To a degree all of radiation is harmful But just it depends on how harmful But so then what is like when it s not harmful It s very very very Not almost It s almost negligible What types of waves that radiate or what types of radiation do you associate with being not harmful Radio waves Any others Jordan Microwaves Visible light Yeah visible light isn t really that harmful What about microwaves that s a good one What do you guys think about microwaves I thought they were dangerous but somebody told me that they weren t They re not really that harmful are they I mean You probably shouldn t stand in front of it Saying they re not that harmful They re not I mean I think probably like extended exposure to them would be bad but I think that could be the same with a lot of things The door shuts when you use the microwave too What about then where do they fall on the spectrum what makes you think they re not dangerous Or that they are Because they are longer than light waves They ve got longer wavelengths Which what does that mean They have lower frequencies They don t carry as much energy with them Lower frequencies Let me consult my chart Okay good idea Or can anyone help her What was your question Claire Oh I didn t have a question Oh okay What was the question Why is she looking at her chart Nope same We think they re not dangerous because they have a longer wavelength and a smaller frequency than light Light is Okay good so I think this is a good segue to the next question which is why are some electromagnetic waves considered dangerous to humans while others aren t Do you know what a segue is Okay Which ones have more energy than others Gamma rays and X rays and UVH rays Okay good Peter did you have something you wanted to add To what he just said Mm hmm Okay good and can you repeat that Sam Some electromagnetic waves are more dangerous because they have much more energy Okay good So ultimately what is that energy doing Why is that harmful to us Can stimulate cell growth The more energy it has the more like materials it can penetrate Like visible light wouldn t really cut through you but gamma rays could like travel through skin And X rays can What did you guys learn about perhaps in biology Cancer Well that it s when cells grow too fast the abnormal growth of cells keep reproducing and There s a mistake in the coding of the DNA and then everything just goes haywire and the cells like what Caleb said grow at abnormally fast rates and they just take over that area and spread Well yeah they stop functioning as normal cells and their sole function is to reproduce and to continue growing and then they eat portions of other cells Okay so what do electromagnetic waves have to do with this extra energy This dangerous energy Well wouldn t like Cho said they would like stimulate the growth and or is that not Why do they stimulate growth Because they have energy What does the energy do to stimulate it What were you going to say Ronnie Well I just said that they trigger they don t like stimulate I mean cell growth to an extent is necessary But they can trigger something dangerous like with I don t really have like the percent or anything but What else might control cell growth DNA Okay good yeah Lots of energy can Can energy alter DNA I feel like it can t Well isn t that what it s doing if it s triggering abnormal cell growth I don t know Is anyone in here have you taken or are you taking biology I took it last year I kind of remember what we talked about with cancer It s okay and you guys have actually come to a good conclusion that it does lie in the DNA and that you know certain types of radiation can cause mutations in DNA that affect the cell cycle So when we think about cancer a lot of times in light or electromagnetic waves a lot of times we think about skin cancer And we talked a bit about that yesterday We also probably notice skin variations among different people from different regions of the world So how does skin color variation how do you think it relates to the amount of UV radiation that a particular population receives You mean based on their race Just based on their geologic background Geographic background not geologic Well I mean people with darker skin tend to not get sunburned as much as somebody with really really pale skin I don t think that s true I think it s just that it doesn t show up as much like you can definitely still get sun damage No of course you can still get sunburned but I don t think it s like It s harder I think so I think it s just less noticeable Yeah I think it s just less noticeable I really don t think it has anything to do with Okay so you re getting the same amount good you re getting the same amount of radiation sure Is sunburning caused by like the amount of light we absorb our skin absorbs It s actually it s in their Grace and Lana s video About how What did we do On your presentation about sunburn How sunburn works I don t remember Okay so ultimately I guess I ll restate the question So how does skin color relate to the amount of UV radiation a certain population may receive We see a lot of variation so a lot of people often times say Oh why do people in in countries that are near the equator Why are they darker wouldn t that make them hotter Because we tend to think of dark colors as absorbing a lot of different wavelengths of light Is that true is that what s happening It seems kind of Wouldn t that make you sweat more then Which would be good if it was hot I guess sweat Sweat is just to release the heat on your body No but that s what I m saying like if you get hotter quicker then you would start sweating earlier which cools you down What is the pigment in skin that causes color variations Melanin Okay good alright So people who have darker skin do they have more or less They have more It s in eyes too right It s what causes eye color differences Maybe I m making that up but What do you think the purpose of the melanin is Is it to absorb Grace offered one theory what s another theory too there There are several different reasons What does it do to UV light What s different about people that live say in the equator regions like the and people who live up north They don t get sunburned if they live there I mean There s like nothing to Yeah exactly People who live in northern climates are much more likely to get sunburned because they re not exposed to that much sun or their relatives weren t And as they adapted they just passed on that trait of having fair skin But I don t know why Do you know Miss Roseborough Yeah I have an understanding yes And when I think about it I kind of think about the actual pigment itself and what it s doing and where it s located on the body What it may be serving to do Doesn t it synthesize vitamin D for us That would make sense Yeah that s vitamin D from sunlight I guess that s why Okay so people who have more melanin have live in the sun you know they have more exposure to the sun Why do they need that extra melanin To protect them Okay yeah so let s go with that to protect them From what From the radiation like I guess if you re out in the sun more you need more protection so like it s kind of like a built in sunblock What would it protect So it s on the surface right Protects the inner skin It protects the outer layer right Epidermis Yeah I feel like Ewan brought up something like this yesterday when we were talking Is that why they you have lighter on your hands Oh I think that s the thing about like gamma rays for example being more like that was one of the question because they have more ability to penetrate through skin and Okay so really what s happening is the melanin actually absorbs the wavelengths of light that would normally penetrate the skin How does it do that It just doesn t the energy is just sort of dissipated as heat and so You get the heat but not the radiation Right exactly so it doesn t go further into your body So darker people get less sunburned than fairer people because of that Well does it necessarily have to do with sunburn And they re less likely to get skin cancer Yeah I d say they re less likely to get skin cancer When you get tan are you getting more melanin in your skin Yeah what s happening when you get tan So shouldn t tanning make your skin stronger Well If it increases melanin I don t think it s necessarily increasing it Because the tan goes away Oh So it s like you have whatever your natural skin color is then that is determined how much Okay Okay so next misconception that a lot of people have or just something that I ve always wondered about I don t know if it s a misconception or not but I m thinking about colors that we associate with certain just everyday things So when I go into the bathroom when I go into the kitchen I see red and that indicates the faucet that I turn for hot water and blue for cold water Why do you think those colors were chosen and is that always true Because fire is red Water and ice is blue It s not really blue it s more clear White and blue flames are much hotter than red flames Yeah explain that I don t know I guess back a long time ago before they knew that The hottest part of the fire is at the top and if you think about a flame usually you see a little blue or white part at the bottom and then it s the red orange at the top Which is where it would be the hottest It s hottest at the top But there s at the top it would be starting to cool off as it gets away from At the peak it s the hottest But then the bunsen burner the hottest part is like Yeah the hottest part of the flame is the top You get a marshmallow you put it at the bottom No sir What color is at the top guys Red White Or orange Blue and white at the bottom It s an experiment Miss Rose let s do experiments on fire That s a good idea I think we should at this point Do you have bunsen burners in here No I don t have a gas source So let s just go back I even broke it down and I was thinking about well where did this come from I was thinking what wavelengths of light are being absorbed by the color red and what are being reflected by the color red And so is the color red actually hotter How could I relate that to temperature How do you even relate a color to temperature So just the color red what s it reflecting What s it absorbing What color does it reflect It reflects red And it absorbs green and blue Or cyan Right so going back to the what makes it that color its natural frequency what types of waves are causing it to change in temperature What s happening as a result of different white light say striking it and its actual reflection and absorption of different waves of light Would red or blue actually be hotter As a pigment Blue should be hotter because it has more energy it has the shorter wavelength and greater frequency Yeah Sam s right So with a pigment Think about a pigment first What about it just think about it Yeah so certain wavelengths of light are being absorbed and certain wavelengths of light are being reflected What does it mean when a pigment absorbs wavelengths of light What happens to the energy that is being absorbed It transfers to the medium Okay good I was going to say the pigment has the same frequency as those wavelengths so Probably right Okay good so it absorbs so let s think about blue again How could you apply that What wavelengths of light does it absorb Shorter wavelengths than red Well no blue absorbs red and green so this would be longer wavelengths and lower frequencies So red would absorb the blue Therefore it would absorb the higher frequency had more energy which means it would be hotter right What do you guys think Can you restate that Sorry because red absorbs blue and blue has a higher frequency the red would be absorbing the higher frequency which means it would be getting more energy from the higher frequency So red would be the hottest The man has a point I agree with Peter I agree with it too I agree with Peter Yeah that s sort of the conclusion I came to the only conclusion Then I started thinking more I was like well how does this apply to stars So if I see a star that gives off a 
 Consider what you read about organic lettuce and Rosie from Omnivore s Dilemma and from what you re reading do you feel it s worth the extra cost and effort to eat organic Yes So for some organics I believe it is worth it and others I don t Industrial organic I don t believe it s worth it because for the lettuce in the book Omnivore s Dilemma they said it takes about ten fossil fuel calories to make one calorie from lettuce and I don t believe that s energy efficient at all But other farms other industries or other organic farms like Polyface Farms they use all natural energy not a lot of fossil fuels go into it and I think it s more efficient So organic like that I believe is better but industrial organic I don t believe is better That s a good point I was wondering is somebody could expand on the difference between industrial organic and organic Phil if you want to pick someone Eli So normal organic food like what started the idea of organic food was completely different from organic food that you buy at Whole Foods nowadays Like what the people originally thought the concept of organic food thought of was like the local sustainable farm like Polyface Farms where it s completely energy efficient and they use all natural resources like grass and just stuff like that to feed their cows and other animals But industrial organic systems it s pretty much the same as normal industrial food system except they don t use antibiotics or pesticides to make their food They still have animal rights There s still animal cruelty and stuff inside the the factories and stuff like that Araceli I agree with Eli because when I read organic I thought organic was good But then basically it was the same thing Like the chickens they still got fed corn but they had an open door but they were so fat they couldn t go through Like why pay the extra money for something that s going to be exactly the same as the other thing I think it is worth buying organic food Because even though the animals are treated the same and even though it still wastes a lot of fossil fuel we save a lot of farmland from being put like pesticide and everything on it so we could have chemical free land And also we save our water system from being poisoned by the chemicals we use So it might cost a little bit more but it s worth it Matt In response to I guess Eli it s not exactly the same there are definitely the perks to the industrial organic system with the lack of chemicals and hormones But yes I can definitely agree that it s a very similar thing it doesn t solve all the problems with the industrial system I don t agree with what was just said that when you farm without pesticides it s better because in Omnivore s Dilemma even though they farm without pesticides they crowd the ground so much that it destroys the land So it s not necessarily better it just sounds better I just like Simone s point because I think that a lot of the problems are still there and even though it might be a little bit better without the pesticides I think it s still important to eat real organic food I think that would be the best Industrial organic is a step in the right direction but I don t think it s close enough to where we should be with our food system I agree with Molly that industrial organic foods on the face are both They re worth paying for because they re the food that we should be eating but in other ways they feed into other problems with pollution If you want the right type of food you have to create a food system that can sustain a country as large as the United States but still has healthy animals And animals that have evolved to eat only being fed that is at a cost low enough to feed everyone in the United States like we are fed now I was going to also ask a couple personal questions since I was talking to your mom about how does your eating habits change do you think now that you feel like you re more aware or She says that she always bought grass fed beef and I try to eat healthy but in the case of fast food of course I go and eat fast food But lately I ve been badgering her and asking her if she could get a grass fed steak I ve been waiting for that for a long time The corn fed steak that my dad gives me smells bad and it looks bad so Anyway There s nobody asking I don t think organic s really necessarily healthy for us because humans are still trying to figure out what vitamins we still need what essentials we still need Like people are still discovering that plants have certain essentials that we never knew we needed So how can we tell organic s good for us if we don t know what organic is different from what we get from normal food I thought Curt brought a good point up too which is the best organic is just straight from the farm to the buyers but it is a great point that Curt and Greg brings up which is that that way can t feed as much people as the industrial organic or just industrial food I completely agree with that It s implausible to try to make what they call beyond organic food at such a high amount because it really consumes a lot of land and a lot of energy We read in the Omnivore s Dilemma with the moving the chicken coops so much every day that s a lot of land for very little meat and honestly that would not be able to sustain the whole country Lisa So I kind of agree with what you re saying but it doesn t have to necessarily be a few big farms that are completely going organic If there s little farms all over the United States then meat can go to those people around there It might not happen all of a sudden but little by little people are going to learn that organic is better Whether it s more expensive or not it s healthier for us knowing that the animals When the animals are not fed on natural stuff that in turn is bad for us Ashley I agree with what everyone said and that the point that Paulina brought up about we re still trying to figure out what vitamins are what and what s good for us Because I feel like it s more better to spend even just a few more cents if organic food isn t that expensive and go to certain places A few more cents on the local home grown organic food because I used to buy meat from the What s it called The meat section The deli Deli yeah there you go And I used to buy meat there and I thought it was all fine you know whatever until I went to the doctor one day because I was getting really injured and she was like You re missing all these vitamins and she gave me all these vitamins to take And I didn t know that that was missing inside my food and then I go to the organic section of the supermarket and it s not even like vitamins that were missing in the meat it s vitamins that were missing in the drinks that can be found in organic food For example like the naked juice has these vitamins already included in there just because it s like naturally grown and organic So I was willing to spend the extra dollar for my health So I feel like if people realize how important it is for your health that scare will wake them up and they ll be able to spend the dollar Okay well I agree I think that it s worth the extra cost for organic because like in the book it said when we buy organic food we re voting with our forks and we re voting for the type of food we want And if we go organic then the producers will think that most of us want organic so they ll start growing more and selling more organic food so that it might become cheaper in the long run I personally don t really care Like if it s cheaper that s cool because if it has pesticides on it you can just wash it off And animal s rights are nice but they re going to be killed anyway It s like they re all going to die anyway They re going to die so Michael I like it And yeah I mean even though organic s good we still have a lot of cheap food that feeds a lot more people that have lower income So we might not be like the healthiest nation but at least we give an opportunity to feed every single person in the United States So I kind of like that They don t have to worry about paying high prices for food even though it s bad for my health And even if it is bad I could just exercise So I think it s a personal responsibility to watch what you eat So we should be open to that Even with the industrialized food system we re still not feeding everyone If you go to like the Appalachians and stuff like that you still have kids that are starving every day because their parents don t make enough money to buy even the cheap food So I think that it s not that we need to focus less on the cost of everything and just figure out a better way to produce food and grow it and to make sure that it gets where it needs to go I think we need to worry about cost later on and try and focus on a way to do that in the short term so that in the long term we can feed as many people as we need to Lisa I see how you brought up the Appalchians but my question to you is is it more important to worry about issues here where it effects us or would you find it more important to focus like worldwide Like you could focus on problems that people have outside but like wouldn t you focus on start here make sure that we have what we need first and then branch out I think that with that like with a lot of people who get stuff locally So if you re saying locally like are you talking like Chicago Don t you think it s better to start locally and then Like we get better locally and then we get better statewide and then we ll go on until everybody has enough money to do this or their food everyone can buy their food I think so but you also have to take into consideration that even if we do something in Illinois that doesn t guarantee that other states are going to adopt the same policies And I think if we focus on doing something for United States and worry less about the other countries even though politically it might not be the right thing to do worry less about the other countries at this time But I think we need to take a step back and focus on just fixing as much as we can on a whole and then going down into the smaller levels and seeing okay how can we make this better on a local level Chris I think that we can t really make it perfect like the way Polyface Farms is because of how the cities are laid out Because the cities are too big to have farms in reasonable reach of the people there So I think what we have to do is have this industrial organic which still is I mean a lot more worth it because it keeps the biodiversity in the soil and I read in the book they said something like that the size of the state of New Jersey was like a dead zone at the end of the Mississippi River and the Gulf from all the pesticides and fertilizers that flow down And that s problem that we should focus on Well I agree with Teresa that we should start only in the US because we can t just make a generalization that other countries are using corn and are eating unhealthy just as we are We only know that the US is eating unhealthy because according to Omnivore s Dilemma King Corn and Food Incorporated the problems are only occurring in the United States So if we want to solve this problem we should start from the origins because we started using corn massively creating problems and stuff not because of other countries Well maybe because we imported corn from Mexico and they dominated out other corn types so we started using corn But we should start focusing on more of what s the problem over here instead of other countries because we have to solve our own problems first before we become worried about other problems maybe Yeah I was going to say that it is worth it to spend the money in organic because even if it s just a little bit of farms here and there people seem to be willing to travel the extra mile just to get that healthy piece of food Like in Polyface Farms people came from hundreds of miles I think or 100 miles just to get their healthy chickens or the healthy food And with Jerry I wanted to say that Well nevermind Okay then So I remember Gabby said how we should be focusing on making as much food as possible for everyone in America and that s the issue we should be working on But that s really what the food industry does like making the most food possible They pretty much put everything else aside besides mass production They don t really care about animal rights or worker safety or anything like that They just put as much work as they can into making more food and like Gabby said people in America still can t afford this food that s cheaper than it s ever been in the past So it just shows that really we can not go back to just normal farms because there s no way just natural farms like Polyface could ever sustain a population as big as America Like we kind of dug ourselves into a hole Yeah Okay so what do you think we should do then If we ve dug ourselves If we ve dug ourselves into this hole even though if we re going to be producing less food that s better quality I agree that is better because then you re taking the animal rights into consideration the workers rights and everything But then either we have to figure out a way to change how people eat and so people are eating a bigger variety of food or somehow figure out a different way to be able to feed everyone Because at the end of the day either we re going to have a lot of people who die because we change this and we change it too fast and we re not ready to adapt to it or we can do it slowly and try and figure out ways so that everyone somehow survives Eli Okay well I think that we should really just follow the model of like France or some other country in Europe or something Because they have a way better People in France are so much healthier than people in America and they don t eat nearly as much food They still aren t starving most people in France aren t starving or anything So there are countries it s just not left them Okay I don t know if this makes sense but if they have like 20 000 chickens in one pen do they have to feed them corn Like what s wrong with mass production but making it a little healthier Why can t they just give them something else that s maybe not all corn maybe half corn or half corn to little corn And then metaphorically speaking this totally reminds me of Hitler and like how he took over all the people and made them work to death and everything and that s like what they re doing with the animals They re just working them to death and they have no rights or happiness whatsoever Deja I think the answer to your question is that most people just want money so they ll buy whatever s cheapest and pay low wages to people just so they can make a lot of money I think that s the answer to your question about why don t they just choose another food instead of corn I think it s because of money But also consider what about What about the industrial organic Doesn t that address this whole problem of how the chickens are fed Even though they re raised in coops They re still fed corn Molly Okay so I think that it s a really good idea that Matthew brought up a while ago that the industrial issue it can t really be solved by using beyond organic I think we ve moved on from that We can t really go back to beyond organic because we wouldn t be able to feed enough people And then just to Adam s point I don t think that we re not producing enough food I think the problem is that the people don t have enough money for the food So I think that producing more food wouldn t really help I was going to say everyone keeps talking about mass production and that view would feed everybody But if you think we actually waste a lot of food too That s actually important I think we saw a picture or something all of it gets thrown out every day or they have ads on it on TV If we re so worried about feeding everyone why don t we eat better ourselves and stop buying so much food we don t actually eat Well either whether you guys want to change it locally to outside or outside to inside I like the idea that you guys think about spreading the idea Whether it s taking France s ideas and taking it onto ourselves or just ourselves spreading it out Because so obnoxious they would go out to McDonald s my family and be like Do you know what that eats And then just start talking We re like Shut up don t tell me what it eats I m going to eat it And now my mom asks me she s like Is this good And then I read it I m like Yeah it has this and this and this And now she turns to me and like asks me should we buy this should we not So I think I have changed a little bit at least having been 
 So can you record two on that It s harder to write two Remember here you can use your number line if you need it to help you Do you want me to turn it So there s the two Can you try to write it I did it Awesome That looks like a two So was this awesome all right or super bad Super bad Super bad Why do you think it was super bad Because it s not heavy Because it s not heavy Okay Julia what s our second problem Ow The styrofoam ball The styrofoam ball Can you find the styrofoam ball Yes that one We can first we re gonna make This one is bigger How does it feel though Is it round It does We re gonna be answering questions over here Julia can you let make his prediction Which one did you pick That one You picked all right Why did you pick all right Because it s little How does it feel Feel it No it s not heavy What do you think Is there anything that you re wondering about that What s next What do you think All right again You think all right too Mark them all right You think awesome You think it s gonna go 15 or more Okay let s see Are you ready Can you pick up the tape and do it again Gonna get the tape You re supposed to do it again Because there s another space Yep we re gonna actually do it again after we do all of them one time Okay Put it this way Ivan s gonna put it in is everyone ready Oh wait you have to keep it upside down so it can push Okay Can you try it over Ivan are you ready Let s try one more time I m gonna put this cup right in front One more time Well feel it Is it heavy That s okay I m gonna be right back Has anything surprised you so far What happened The orange ball So what kind of push was it An awesome An awesome push So did that surprise you You didn t think it was gonna go so far I though it was gonna go like Is that where the tape went So you guys can pick up the tape Should we do the green ball The green ball Which ball so far A zero A zero And it didn t move at all Yes Why do you think it didn t move Because it s so tiny It s so tiny But does it weigh a lot No No it didn t Do you think that s why it didn t go far And it s so tiny And it doesn t have more mass Ahh I see So should we do this again Yeah The super bad is actually this one right here Oh it s so tiny So feel it How does it feel Let Luka feel it How does it feel So Jacob why don t you make your prediction From all right to super bad What do you think Sofia What did you put Why did you put all right So right there How far do you think it s gonna go What did you put Sofia Sofia picked Luka what do you think Which one do you think What s it gonna be Awesome all right or super bad Good pick all right So we re gonna do it down here on this one All right Are you ready Make your prediction And then we re gonna put it on the ground What do you think Awesome all right or super bad Who picked awesome Sofia right Do you guys have anything that you re Remember when we were I do remember when we were trying to What did we find out What is it What do you think for the second ball You think a rock is inside Maybe If they were rocks then they would be so hard That s true is it really hard A little A little bit hard What do you think is inside Can we find out We can open one of these probably Let s put it down first Everybody write it Jacob are you the recorder What are you The counselor Are you the starter Okay guys is everyone ready You know what We re gonna do it one more time so that it knocks over the cup We can move the tape now Sofia we need you to count Move the cup over How far did it go One two three four five six seven eight nine 10 Will you count again with me Ready One two three four five six seven eight nine 10 Jacob this went 10 Can you write 10 down No For the super bad it went 10 Yep It s super awesome So what do you think Where did it go Was it awesome all right or super bad Awesome All right It was all right Why was it all right And is 10 more or less than 15 Less than 15 So that s why it s all right Okay guys I m gonna go to the next group Now what you re gonna do is trial two You re gonna do every ball one more time Okay Yep We re gonna do it one more time Okay I will be right back How s it going over here Has anything surprised you What surprised you Which ball didn t push it very far Wait how far did it actually push So that means that the cup didn t move at all Why do you think the cup didn t move Because it s so light Which one moved the farthest so far Which ball The orange one Is the orange ball really light How does the orange one feel Like it has more mass Is there anything you guys are wondering about If they re bouncy Let s put this ball back Does that one bounce I wonder why not Okay so what are we putting next on your sheet What should you do Are you putting the rubber ball Yeah Are you guys all putting that you think it s gonna be an awesome push Ready Put tape here Alexandra are you the taper It s on the wrong side No she got it she did it So move the cup over Now Nicholas is gonna count One two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 Can you help write in 13 Yeah this one right here has a one and a three Can you try writing that It s gonna have one more It s gonna have one more So if the styrofoam ball went zero and the orange ball went 13 which one is more 13 How do you know that You just know that When you count does it come higher Yes it does Okay Ivan s ball is next We need to do a trial shoot of which one Okay You have a red Yeah mine What do you guys think about this ball It s awesome It s awesome Why is it awesome It s awesome because it s red and it s the Cardinals color Well I would love for you to come Should we see how far it goes All right let s check it It knocked the cup over Let s try one more time It knocked it over again We re gonna put the tape here Do you think that was farther than the rubber ball But when the ball goes farther Seven eight nine 10 11 What Can you find it on the number line Where s 11 Uh huh that s what it looks like Is 11 more or less than 13 Is it more than 13 or less Which one Is what More than Is more than 11 If you look on the number line So you re right 13 is more Yeah Yeah Okay you guys can start putting the balls away 
 What It s a dark color So what does that mean We think the sun might hit it or light might hit it faster so it might melt faster Keegan how are you going to figure out how much it weighs Maybe it will melt faster because the water What about that explain your thinking Because You ve stolen her even Now we got to count it One two No now you re taking them all Three we got to count four five six Here Seven eight nine 10 11 12 Freeze for just one second Let s switch and have the boys keep on You stopped at 20 Boys finish counting They stopped at 20 finish counting 21 22 23 24 But they re not counting they re just putting it in It s not working They re just putting it in in the same time So freeze gentlemen So how do you think you could fix that Put it back in You might want to try to remeasure Definitely want to Miss T look Guys we need to take a bunch of it out because it s not really getting weighed You might need to use something heavier Oh remember you re not supposed to touch that nob on the back That s not how you how would you figure out how to weigh it What happened What s going on Daniel Tell me what the problem is It has too much oh sorry It has too much water in it Yeah Well can we change that scientists No What can we change We can take out a lot It s too heavy It was reaching on that side Six halves This is heavier Wait say that again Brayden What did I just hear you say I said it s heavier This is heavier than the blocks so we put more in Oh Yeah we re going to put more in Oh way too much way too much Whoa look Uh uh Ms Teacher Ms T I think it s six and a half What is six and a half The measure Oh is that your predication that s your what That s my hypothesis Oh how are you going to find out if it s true What do we do Can you maybe explain to Teagan what she needs to do Just balance it They re like working on it There we go got it Got it Daniel what were you saying We were going to like We just figured out how much blocks it weighs Hang on it ll get there So what did you discover We discovered we had we discovered we had to take We had to take one two three four of the blocks out Five Five of the blocks out to make it weigh So how much does it weigh So let me count the blocks One two three four Do you want me to hold the balloon so it doesn t fall Five six seven eight nine ten How many does it weigh Okay I ll start wearing this I mean I ll start writing it No I got it What are you doing there Abigail Well I m weighing and it s not showing up yet What are you using that tool for What tool This tool To see how cold it is So did you already weigh it We have to hold it from the top Oh so do you think it s going to weigh more now that you taped that to it What s your prediction with that Do you have a prediction I have a prediction that it might be really cold And that s going to tell you that But have you weighed yours yet No And it s going to turn to ice So but should you keep that thermometer on it while you weigh it or do you think it ll change how much it weighs I think it will actually change how much it weighs Can you explain your thinking Because because the thermometer is heavy too and it would change how much One pound it was so we should probably get the thermometer One pound So we can so we can so we can weigh it and then we can put it back on My hypothesis is it s going to be 20 degrees My hypothesis is this is going to change it because it s only one pound Oh so what are you going to do to test that Weigh it Okay Put it here put it here Oh are you guys discussing What are you guys discussing Where we are going to put our balloons So first talk to me about your balloon Why did you choose this color Because it was a light color and we think it might melt faster We will think it will melt slower We think it will melt slower Why Because Because it s a light color The sun is attracted to the dark colors so that s why we picked pink So what are you doing right now Doing a hypothesis Oh can you explain what s your hypothesis Teagan It will be warm because we re going to put it next to the heater That s what I was going to say too And so what s your hypothesis How will that change the balloon Because maybe you said we re going to put it in the freezer and then when we take it out we ll put it in the heater and we think it ll melt faster Okay What about us It s almost in the middle take out one more Now I m going to count What were you guys just doing down there She was thinking about the weight What does that mean Like in the middle Okay so how will you figure out how much it weighs We need to take this out and we ll count them and then we ll write it on the paper 32 32 12 13 14 Brayden Brayden Hi Hayden Is there any group that s measuring the length of their s 28 29 30 31 32 Almost there 43 44 45 46 47 It s there it s there What does that mean So it means that they weigh the same thing Okay Now we have to count them Let s let Will only do it Two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 64 64 Teagan be working in your group 23 24 25 I measured my balloon by using tiles like tiles when I measured it Tiles What should we do now Mrs T My balloon is filled with matter Why do you say that Because everything is matter Well there s water inside the balloon so it s like solid and liquid Why is it solid and liquid What were you saying What were you saying No keep explaining your thinking I have a question One second Water is a liquid and pushes on the weight Oh so is that kind of tying in to your hypothesis Light turns into water solids and liquids My hypothesis is my hypothesis is if we like if we If we lose the like point it will not melt faster Why It s a darker color And when you think about it dark colors will melt faster on their own Is that cubes the has the cubes No that s the weight Pass it on Have you all measured yours yet Yes How d you measure it With the tape thingy Would you mind showing me what you decide to do My hypothesis is that it will melt faster because we re putting it by the sun Did you make a hypothesis by the length of it No Ours was six and a half inches How do you know Because we measured it with the measuring tape Can you show me how you did it Oh there s an extra one Will Did you say not to touch the balloon without the thermometer Now do we draw a picture of what it looks like right now These have bigger numbers you know So what are you thinking there Abigail I m thinking that not really But what were you saying there with the bigger numbers I didn t understand You held up the number line and you said those have bigger numbers I mean like you can see them very well and you also can tell 30 30 30 he should start now So how big is your balloon We got to start at one Oh why did you change it Julia from your first measurement Because we accidentally started from the 30 Oh And now we have it upside down Okay you got it It was it is move your finger for me It is Now let s send this back here Okay I think we should do my idea for taking that thermometer off Yeah Yeah I ll hold the thermometer I m trying to take it off My hypothesis is it s going to be warm but then not attracted to the light Cold water is in there Because sunlight can only make warmth Right
