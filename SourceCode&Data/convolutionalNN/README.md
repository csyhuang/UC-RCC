**[This code is adapted from "Implementing a CNN for Text Classification in Tensorflow" blog post.](http://www.wildml.com/2015/12/implementing-a-cnn-for-text-classification-in-tensorflow/)**

It is slightly simplified implementation of Kim's [Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882) paper in Tensorflow.
