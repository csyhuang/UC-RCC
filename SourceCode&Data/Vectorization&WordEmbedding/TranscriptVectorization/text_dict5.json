{"098": {"text": "  Please freeze for a moment. Gentlemen, what did you think about your performance? I wouldn't say \"terrible,\" but were you accurately on pitch, all of you?\n No.\n No. Like as soon as the ladies came in, you were like, \"Whoo,\" and then you forgot what you were singing. Okay? So, don't let them distract you. They're trying. They're trying to have this beautiful sound and pull you off. But hold firm, men. Hold firm to your position.  All right? Let's try it again. Here we go. \u266a Sing noel, sing noel, noel, noel \u266a Lock it in. \u266a Sing noel, sing noel, noel, noel \u266a Two parts. \u266a Sing noel, sing noel, noel, noel \u266a \u266a Sing noel, sing noel, noel, noel \u266a Together. \u266a Sing we all noel!\u266a The support! \u266a Sing we all noel!\u266a\n Two parts. \u266a Sing we all noel! Sing we all noel! \u266a Back to the beginning. \u266a Sing noel, sing noel, noel, noel \u266a End song. All right. If you were going to give yourself a grade, what would you give it, Alison? As a class.\n  Like out of A's and B's and C's?\n Yep.\n I would give an A-minus.\n Okay, and why the minus? What do you think we think need to improve?\n The pitch was kind of off at some parts.\n Okay. So there was maybe some pitch issues. What about energy level? It was okay, but this.... But one of the things about African music is it is something that is like felt in their soul. Okay. It is traditionally, when you listen, I mean, they are just letting it... You know, when we see any of the performances, or listen to any of the CDs we've listened to, it's just very gut-felt. I feel like you're, \"\u266a Sing noel, sing noel, noel, noel \u266a\" So, \"This is so pretty.\" Yes, we want, \"\u266a SING NOEL, SING NOEL, NOEL, NOEL. \u266a\" Especially on that, \"\u266a Sing we all noel. \u266a\" That's me. We're singing! It's like you're telling people, \"We are singing!\" Not, \"\u266a Sing, I think, we all noel. \u266a\" Okay? So let's make sure that we're right there on that. One more time. See if you can get a little more weight to your sound. I don't mean make it flat. I just mean with more confidence, more security, more support, Okay? Here we go. \u266a Sing noel, sing noel, noel, noel \u266a Awesome! \u266a Sing noel, sing noel, noel, noel \u266a Two part. \u266a Sing noel, sing noel, noel, noel \u266a \u266a Sing noel, sing noel, noel, noel \u266a Support this! \u266a Sing we all noel! Sing we all noel! \u266a \u266a Sing we all noel! Sing we all noel! \u266a \u266a Sing noel, sing noel, noel, noel \u266a Good. And stop there. So you get the idea. That was awesome! Did you hear the difference?\n  Yeah.\n Awesome. I love that you challenged yourselves. You pushed yourselves there. It's hot. Those notes are kind of high. I know that. And you just pushed right through it. So good job. Let's review the instrument parts we just got to touch on last time. So, I'm going to come here so we can do our body percussion. Real quick. We are going to start with our bass part. Ladies and gentlemen, we are not going to use these right now because traditional African music is by rote, meaning you learn it by hearing. You learn it by doing. If you are a visual learner, these are our music stands by the instruments, so this will help you. And you know, I want everyone to be successful, so you use the tools that will help you be successful. You be an independent learner where you decide. If this is what you need, grab a music stand. Okay? If you don't, you don't need it. Okay? So there are music stands in each of the instrument sections when you pick. Okay? So, basses first. Let's all kind of scoot over this way. So bass section first. We have, starting with your left hand,  \"\u266a Sing, oh sing, oh sing noel \u266a\n  \"\u266a Sing, oh sing, oh sing noel \u266a\n And you have that crossover.  \"\u266a Sing, oh sing, oh sing noel \u266a\n Everybody feel comfortable with that? Any questions? You look good. You look like you have it. All right. Then we have the xylophones. This one's a tricky one. So we have, for that part... Let me just double check on our words that we decided for last time. So, we have,  \"\u266a Sing noel, sing noel. Let's simply celebrate it. Sing noel. Sing noel. Let's simply celebrate it. \u266a\"\n   Sing noel. Sing noel.  Let's simply celebrate it. Sing noel. Sing noel.  Let's simply celebrate it. \u266a\n Okay? So the trickiest part is how many G's. All right. So remember, we have low C and high C, So you have, \"C, C, C. C, C, C.\" And there's four Gs over that syncopated rhythm. G, G, G, G, F, E, D. Okay? So it's kind of like, \"One, two, three, down the ladder you go.\" Okay? So let's try that.\n C, C, C. C, C, C. G, G, G, G, F, E, D. C, C, C. C, C, C. G, G, G, G, F, E, D.\n Got it? Got the idea? All right. Then we go on to the glockenspiels. And for that one, we can just clap that rhythm, because I think on the instruments it will be easier to see, to show, because they're so obviously a little, so it's not really like that. So here we go. It goes, \"\u266a Sing, oh, yes, sing noel, noel. \u266a\"\n \u266a Sing, oh, yes, sing noel, noel. Sing, oh, yes, sing noel, noel. \u266a\n Okay? Got the idea for that rhythm? So I will come over and help that section, and some of you may remember that from last time. Then we have our percussion section. Okay? We have first the conga drum. A real quick review on conga drum playing. Everything in you is going to want to tip it toward you. If we can kind of spin back here so I can show you. When you play a conga drum you scoot over this way a little bit. And scoot over that way. There we go. So, when you play conga drum, you actually are going to hold it in between your legs, and put your feet around the base, and you're going to tip it out from you. So that that way the sound can come out, but you also have the correct play style. Remember pat on the ends. when you're playing. And those are in... You can pat this on your lap as well. \u266a  \u266a Right now, practice on your fingers. Okay? So here's on this. Practice with a good technique, right now. Ready. Go. \u266a  \u266a\n     \u266a This is the part of the conga drum.\u266a \n All right. You've got the idea? And that goes over and over, each measure. Then we have the log drum. And the log drum... And again, the parts are right here on the stand if you need them. You're going to have... One side, you're going to play, \"Sing.\" So basically... \u266a  \u266a And it doesn't matter with those. \"Sing noel, sing noel, sing noel.\" Okay? So you can clap that real quick.\n  Sing noel, sing noel, sing noel, sing.\n Okay? See how it fits? Hello. Welcome.\n Thank you very much.\n All right. So. Next we are going to have this part, which is traditional African bell. And this one you have, \"Rest, rest, rest,  noel.\" Sorry, hi to low. So it's, \"Rest, rest, rest,  noel.  Rest, rest, rest,  noel, rest.\"  Can you snap it?  Noel. Rest, rest, rest,  noel. \"Rest, rest, rest,   noel. And you can try it. Rest, rest, rest. Hi and fast.  Noel. Rest. Get them up!   Noel. Rest, rest, rest,   noel. Yes. Ladies and gentleman, I'm always spot-checking to see if you have rhythmic accuracy when we're doing this. It's really important that I see that participation. Because then when we go to pick parts, I'm looking to see who has it. Yes, there's choice, but also to check you off on including this rhythm thing. Okay? So let's try it again. Ready. Go. Rest, rest, rest. \u266a  \u266a Rest, rest, rest. \u266a  \u266a Rest, rest, rest,  noel.  Rest, rest, rest,  noel. You got it. And then,  I love these shakers.  You are the pulse. You are the heartbeat and the foundation of this song. So it would really be nice if you could pulse with my pulse so we could all pulse together. So again, really important. We might add in some other, more African instruments. They're kind of loud, so we'll see if you can get the correct sound.  So what I'd like you to do now. Do you have any question? All right. If you really mastered the instrument that you got to start on last time, I would challenge you to maybe pick a different one. Okay? If you were still working on it, you're welcome to stay there. But without any payoffs, so just kind of selection, I would like you all to go and pick an instrument part. Remember we have glockenspiels, basses, xylophones, and percussion. So open? Two glockenspiels open, and a bunch of xylophones open. Who was there first? Who was there first between you and Ellen?\n  I was here.\n You were there? Okay. So if you want to join the glockenspiels, you can do that. You can go to xylophones. Oh, nobody's up to the challenge. \u266a  \u266a All right. Once you get there, you can start practicing.  \u266a  \u266a All right. Hold up, everybody! All right. Thank you. Since we're trying to add in some singing over the top of it eventually, if you have the green mallets, would you, especially for you guys, switch them out with the felt mallets instead? So here's a set. Well, you need those for that as well. So we have one. There should be another one in there.\n  Oh, here, right here.\n Nope, those are green. You don't want those.\n  Oh, here's another one, right here.\n Here, here you go, here's a set That's awesome. Thank you. Because that's just going to make it a lot softer, and not quite as angry sounding. All right. So, let's listen to each part so you can know what you're listening for. Remember, when you are playing in an ensemble like this, if you can't hear the other parts, what does that tell you?\n  You're playing too loud.\n Yes, you're playing too loud. And remember, again, texture is everything. We want to be able to pull out the different parts, so maybe at the end we can talk about different ways we can set up a form to highlight that. But for right now, let's make sure that we can keep it soft. Okay? It's not a competition. All right? No one's going to win. It's the whole class that we're trying to do this together. So if we hear bass part first. And let's go ahead and add at least shaker for right now, and then we'll build in one or two sections. One, two, ready, go. \u266a  \u266a Okay. Time out. So, you're listening for the beat. She's watching me instead of the basses, right? Because you're doing their work a little bit, and you need to keep it nice and steady. What happened, we ended up with three different tempos. Did you hear that? One, two, ready, go. \u266a  \u266a Okay. Pretty good. And then we started to kind of get off where the beginning of the patterns are. Okay. One thing that will help is adding the singing to it.

At the entrance, we post school community events and have some newspapers so that our readers can keep up with the current news and community happenings. At our situation desk we have a suggestion box, our series list, and magazines  and books to entice students as they check out. In our commercial seating area we have state book award nominees and winners, as well  as numerous magazines for you in the library for your checkout. For the teachers, I have a professional library with over 3,000 books, DVDs, manipulatives and kits, developed to support the curriculum. Fiction is concentrated on the right side of the library. The paperbacks, a student favorite, arranged by genre just like in retail stores. All of the series books are clearly labelled so students can quickly find the next book in a series. I give special consideration to my reluctant reader's needs if students interests were looking for fiction, or making sure we have quality literature for all reading levels. We have 13 desktop computers, and a mobile laptop lab with which students access the internet, numerous databases, Impact, and a variety of software. On the school library website, they find reviews,  blogs, links to resarch sites,  as well as book suggestions, trainers, and podcasts, many of which are created by the students. On the left-hand side of the library, the reference and the non-fiction sections are located. Our many biographies are housed on the non-fiction side of the center counter. I have many displays throughout the  library and around the school, but two of the most effective ways I encourage student interaction with literature is by display of their works such as book reviews, or projects, and by intermingling related materials to encourage further exploration of the topics. I keep the collection current and relevant through annual reading and by following  my collection development plan so I can offer my patrons  a fantastic collection with enthusiastic and professional service.\n ?\n . \n But we don't, we don't find our food and just like... \n The three little pig wolf thing? .\n .\n She counted all the way up. And she wants to know the lines or something.\n We're going to, now that you guys have most of your categories filled in, I would like for you to flip over the lab sheet that's in front of you. There are two reviews for this book. Compare what you have on your graphic organizer to what you find in the review. If you had mentioned that Bridge was a protagonist, or basically mention Bridge and give some description of Bridge, then that would be something that is in common with one of the reviews. If you find something in common, circle it on your graphic organizer. I would like for you to circle everything on your graphic organizer that you also see in the reviews. And again, you can work with your partner on this one. \n .\n . \n .\n  it talks about what they deserve and . \n 30 more seconds. That's okay, . Did you find that there were several things in common between the elements you looked  for and found in the story? and what you find in the review?\n  Yes.\n  The review has some additional items in it, doesn't it? There are a lot of people  with the same basic items. Anyway, I wanted to do a quick Venn-diagram up here, and compare and contrast. I want for each group, this group, I want each of the two of you to find one thing that you found that wasn't in the review. Or, one thing that was in the review that was not on your paper. Okay, . Okay, you guys, I want you to find, one for each of those groups, I want you to find one thing that was in common . So this is compare, this is contrast. Contrast, compare. Find one thing that was in common, and one thing that's different. Oh, okay, here's a sticky in the middle of the table, I want you to write it on the sticky. You guys  hard.   Awesome, step up here and tell  us what it is and where does it go. ?\n . Awesome, perfect. So all you guys came up with a . \n We did like don't count your chickens  before they hatch  and it was in our graphic organizer .\n Oh, okay, .\n .\n .\n Perfect, and that was .\n .,\n Good, perfect. Okay, so everybody here found something that they had that wasn't in the review, it was in their graphic organizer. . You guys, come on up. This table, everyone at this table is looking for something that was found in both their graphic organizer and in the review.\n We found .\n Super, .\n .\n Super, so that goes in the middle because it's in common with both of them. This group?\n .\n Perfect, they found both in the review and in their organizer that .\n .\n So that was a? What category ?\n .\n Oh, was that in common? Did you find it in the review also or was it...?\n .\n Just you guys found it? So where would it go? Excellent, excellent. That would go in the graphic organizer because it was something that wasn't in the review, so it would go over here, perfect. Okay, next?\n We found that the .\n Okay, so you found something that was only in the review that the, how the pigs disguised themselves. Where do we put that on that? Excellent, something that was only found in the review. Save the best for last. What'd you guys find?\n We found that the graphic organizer and the review, they both talked about  that related to  like the .\n The allusions in there, Wizard of Oz, Three Little Pigs, Excellent, that was . So we see an awful lot is in common with these. Sometimes, you guys find something that aren't in the reviews, the reviews sometimes had  something you didn't find. They are a little bit different. Not necessarily in your review cover every literary element there is. You won't necessarily tell them the five different types of literary devices that are used there, and that's okay. What you want to do with your review is tell some about the book, and give a substantiated opinion of the book. Why do ? What are the good features of this book? What are the weaknesses in the book that you read? Now there are other things that you may need in there, and I'll show where you can get some additional information. Let's bring this on down here. In the online catalog. Both of those computers are logged in over there. . Okay, look up. So far . So if you want to make a note of how many pages as a reminder to yourself, \"Oh yeah, that was a really long book\",  or \"Oh, that was a quick read.\" That would be something to kind of jog your memory there.

Why did people who were First and Second Class just get to come right on in and not have to go through examinations?\n Cause of the money.\n What about the money?\n Because they thought that they had-- they were perfect. They had no disease. They had lots of money, and thought they would work hard.\n So the stereotype is, what?\n That rich people are more-- can work harder, or have less chance of disease than the people in Steerage.\n Do you think that that stereotype is still true today? Or do you think it's not true anymore? It was just for First and Second Class passengers for Steerage passengers before emigrating?\n Well, it's kind of like this. It's not over-the-top, but it's just a little bit.\n What do you guys think about what Eric said?\n I agree with him.\n Why?\n It's not fair because First and Second Class usually are kings or royalty, and so if you're in Steerage, you're just a normal person. If you're in Steerage, it's not going to be fair. You have to go walk through that and--\n Well, First and Second Class Passengers they weren't necessarily royalty, they were just people who had a lot of money. People who had enough money to buy those tickets which they were really expensive. What do you guys think about what Eric said? That the stereotype today is still here, but not really? Just kind of back-and-forth?\n It's back-and-forth. They don't do the same thing anymore.\n Who's \"they\"? And what's the \"same thing\"?\n The American Embassy. The people that take care of the immigrants and everything, and all about them. They don't go to Ellis Island anymore.\n They don't go to Ellis Island anymore.\n You have to go on a plane, or you have to drive here.\n But do you think the stereotype, in general, that rich people are better or they don't have diseases, and they're just better than people who don't have a lot of money? Do you think we still have those stereotypes today? \n Sometimes.\n Sometimes? Have you seen it ever?\n No.\n No, but you just think it's still there?\n I haven't really seen it at all.\n Yeah, I agree with .\n Okay. You can start the next one. Hold on. Josh, did you have something else to add?\n Yeah. On TV shows, sometimes they have rich people in huge carriages with horses sometimes.\n And they're usually pretty snotty.\n And how do you know they're snotty?\n They're always like, \"Don't touch that! \"It's going to fall and you're going to pay for that!\"\n Oh, okay. So you do see in TV sometimes?\n Yeah.\n All right.\n Do you think immigrants were treated fairly at Ellis Island? Why or why not?\n I don't think they were treated very fairly, because they had to go through .\n I agree with Jacob because sometimes people just sent them back at Ellis Island, but some doctors at least tried to keep us here to help us be better until we got to stay in America.\n Yeah, and that was good that the doctors are supposed to check them and see if they were okay.\n Some of the doctors, two people could have the same diseases, but both the doctors-- one doctor could send one person home, and one person could stay at Ellis Island which is unfair.\n Possibly because of their religion or the way-- their language?\n I think they were mostly--\n I think they were mostly, yeah.\n So they were mostly treated well, but sometimes not?\n Sometimes not.\n Yeah.\n The doctors or the inspectors might think that one person can stay because of their religion or their language and others might have to be sent back.\n And remember the book that we read? It kind of said that-- the cousin, he had to be sent back to-- well, he almost had to be sent back to his country because--\n To Russia.\n Yeah, to Russia, because he had a scratch and they thought it was infected. His father was trying to tell him, but they didn't listen.\n Yeah. He didn't.\n  I think they should have translators with all of them, so then it would make it fair.\n That spoke English, and that language.\n That language. So they can understand things.\n So I would say, mostly.\n Yeah. Mostly.\n So should we check them both off?\n I think we should check off the first one.\n  If they were sick or something, or if they needed food, they had places where they could get food. Or if they were sick and had to go to the hospital, like Sophia said. So I'm in the middle. Kind of. Because sometimes, they were treated badly.\n I agree with Josh because if they were sick, they would probably be treated less fairly because they were sick and had their diseases. Like, \"Oh! Get away from me, because you're going to spread that disease to everybody. It's going to be an epidemic.\"\n I want to add, if they were sick, they could have been contagious, and there were a lot of people at Ellis Island so they might have--\n Usually if they were at a hospital, they were curing curable diseases, because if they couldn't cure it-- they didn't have a medicine or anything to cure that, they got sent back.\n Yeah, I agree with Eric and Sophia...\n Go ahead. Were you going to say something?\n I was going to say, if we all agree on this...\n So your general feeling here is: were they treated fairly at Ellis Island?\n They weren't treated not very fairly. Like they were treated half the fair that they should have been, but they weren't treated really good.\n They were fed very well, and all their needs were there, but they weren't treated very good like if you were on an airplane in First Class.\n It's kind of like--\n I would like to add, they were treated way better in Ellis Island because on the ship, in Steerage, they didn't have good food. They couldn't really bathe, and it was all crowded. They didn't really have a good place to sleep, but in Ellis Island, they actually had okay food. They weren't treated like .\n Do you think that it was fair that they each had to have $20 on them in order to stay?\n Yeah.\n Sort of. Sort of.\n What I think is they need to take care of themselves and America is actually bringing lots of them over here. America just could say, \"Stop. No more immigrants, at all,\" but they've been letting people in. A lot of people in, and they've been very generous by giving them food, and letting them live here in this wonderful country. So they've provided enough.\n I have something-- I have two things to say. I agree with Sophia because-- I sort of agree with Sophia because if they didn't have $20, they wouldn't have much to live, and the government is not really responsible for the immigrants. They're responsible for themselves. They're on their own, and I would like to say is that, going back to Sophia's . It said that-- then they were fed well, and that they were...\n All wanted to get to America, and even if some of them had money, how do you know that they didn't have a disease or something? How do you know if they didn't have lice or something?\n I kind of agree with you, because if they paid more, I think they shouldn't get a lot, a lot more, but I think they should get a little bit more, but they still should go to Ellis Island.\n Yeah.\n Sometimes they did have doctors who came on the ships, and kind of gave the medical exams to First and Second Class Passengers to make sure they didn't have any diseases. And then if their medical exams checked out fine, then they could skip everything else. So they didn't have to get asked all those questions, and they didn't have to wait in all those long lines, and things like that. So what do you think about that?\n I think it's still unfair that they didn't have to wait in long lines just because they were already examined on the boat.\n I think instead of Ellis Island, they should have checked them before they got on the boat, for everyone.\n Yeah. I agree with you.\n I think they got all seasick. Think that's where they all got sick?\n Yeah.\n Like in the Steerage. Some of them got sick because they were in Steerage, and then when they got to Ellis Island, they had to get sent back.\n The reason why some of them got sick, was because they didn't have fresh air, and so they couldn't breathe that well.\n Stuffy in Steerage.\n I think all doctors should have been actually fair instead of sending some immigrants back just because they don't like them, for their religion and stuff.\n Could doctors send people back because they didn't like their religion? Doctors could send people back, why? Doctors couldn't send people back, but they would mark letters on your back. Why could they mark letters on your back?\n Because they probably thought-- they probably saw something different when it was actually a scratch.\n So, just if you were hurt, and then they had to go through further medical exams to see, but doctors couldn't just say, \"I don't like you! You have to go back!\" They were just examining you to make sure you didn't have a contagious disease that could get other people sick.\n When we were reading, they said something about the doctors-- where they didn't have any diseases or anything, but they'd still send them back.\n And you read that in the book?\n We were reading one of the things.\n Oh, and why would they send them back? Why would they get sent back, by the legal inspectors and other people?\n Sometimes, it was like there were random reasons they sent them.\n Just because?\n Yeah.\n That's not fair? That's what you're saying?\n Yeah.\n I'd also change the part where they had to-- why did they have to mark stuff on their own clothes?\n Yeah.\n I mean they should have given a sheet or something.\n Or something. Because, what if that's the only thing they had? You know?\n I think they should mark on their skin, or something so then you could just wash it off.\n Like a marker or something?\n No, I don't think they should do it on the skin, because then if there was a water fountain, they could just wash it off and say, \"I'm in this line.\" Right?\n True.\n  They could. They could do that. We all agree they should do something other than your own clothes.\n They should give you a sheet of paper and--\n You could rip it apart. \n I think that they way they did it, for example, that guy in the book did his jacket inside-out. They should have been kind of more smart about what they gave them. Because someone could just say, \"Take this jacket inside-out,\" and then go into the other line.\n Or he could just put his jacket on tomorrow.\n Yeah. \"Oh, I don't have a jacket.\"\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n If we didn't have Ellis Island, not as many immigrants would be here, probably, because it'd be a lot harder. And Ellis Island, they fed you food. It was good. I like it.\n I agree with Josh because they gave you food and water, a place to sleep. They built stuff and made kinder-cares, and made stuff with the little kids and stuff for the grown-ups. The people that were there at Ellis Island didn't even have to pay for any of that. That was all for free. I mean, imagine that happening to us right now? That will never happen.\n I definitely agree with Sophia because if you just come to Ellis Island, and they just give you potato soup every meal, it's kind of like they don't get a good impression of America. I think they try to give a good impression for the immigrants on America, from giving them good food, and a good way to start their time in America. and then they realize how complicated it is.\n Yeah.\n According to everyone, I kind of agree. It was good, I think.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 213 GEN MC 213edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.266643], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW05"]}, "099": {"text": "  So how is that energy?\n  Different things like jules. Which are increments, which are similar. \n  kilowatts hours and BCU\n  Okay.\n  You could also measure it with a thermometer, if it's kinetic energy sometimes\n  Okay.\n  I have an cubic feet, tons, and gallons, too.\n  That's mass. And volume\n  Oh, cause it was like... \n  Hold on. \n  Totally different thing\n  I don't remember \n  While she's looking at that, what are some cons of nuclear energy that most people are concerned about?\n  Well, there are no  no explosions. That's a totally different process with nuclear bombs and nuclear power.\n  Oh, I have...\n  And it states, in lots of articles, about nuclear waste, that it produces very little waste. At all.\n  Well I have a cubic feet, it's for like, natural gas. Tons is measured for coal. Kilowatts hours is for electricity.\n  It doesn't  pollute the air. You could inject the water back into the earth to reuse it. Like you could put the water back in and keep reusing it. And then, the disadvantages for geothermal energy is, the gasses that are released smell bad and efficiency is only 15%, which isn't, it's not that great. And there's a limitation of it. You can't just like keep reusing it and reusing it.\n  I think that would  be like a possibility for a scenario, but like, we don't know if it's warm enough to be able to do that.\n  Yeah, if there  was a good spot around our area, it might be good but--\n  How would you know if your area was a good spot?\n  I don't know. They would have to do tests and stuff\n  Plus, I don't know that people would want it in their backyard.\n  It's hard because, Cranberry, if we're thinking of where those people, well, like a civilized area. People really don't want something--\n  That smells bad.\n  Yeah, that. They don't want any disruption.\n  And where are you most likely going to see geothermal energy come from? There are--\n  Inside of the earth.\n  Right, but it's inside of the earth, but it comes out in what ways?\n  In geysers.\n  In geysers, or what else?\n  I'm not sure.\n  Volcanoes.\n  Oh.\n  Yeah, so, who, that's definitely something. You don't have volcanoes everywhere either.\n  Yeah.\n  Right? And you definitely wouldn't want that in your backyard.\n  And sometimes, if there would be a good area, maybe the state, or the country, would buy the property to like put it there, because it's a good spot. Sometimes they do that for like mining and stuff. They like buy the property.\n  Okay, Okay. \n  I had hydro-electric. And some of the pros that is, it doesn't pollute at all. And the actual running of the power plant is really cheap. And then it's really reliable. So, say there was a big power-outage in the area, the hydro-electric power plant could get that running again. But, it's run by building dams in rivers and they're extremely expensive to build, which can be fixed by partnering up with someone else who needs that. A different, a business or something. But it can also cause flooding upstream for the animals, and people, and houses.\n  I have a question for you. Do you have to have like a big river or could you use like a little creek like we have around here?\n  I don't think you could necessarily use the creek.\n  The Connoquenessing?\n  Yeah, but, yeah you have to have like a big river. and it has to be fairly out of the way.\n  Would it like cause flooding?\n  Yeah, you couldn't have any houses really upstream, because could--they'd flood.\n  And for example, your science book says that the Hoover Dam, which is on the Colorado River, it created a waterfall of 400 feet, which is more than twice as high as the Niagara Falls. So you're talking about a river that you would have to be able to create that drop, because the water creates the kinetic energy. Am I saying that right?\n  Yeah.\n  And that's what causes the electricity.\n  Correct.\n  So, if you could create something like that with the three rivers we have here, that might, that might work.\n  And again the whole--\n  Yeah, the three rivers, that could do it, because there's a bunch of big rivers in Pittsburgh.\n Yeah.\n  Yeah, but if you build that up, wouldn't that flood?\n  Well, not in the middle of the city, you could maybe do it like out of the city, cause the rivers aren't just like in the city, they go out.\n  And also, if you have a good area, flooding wouldn't matter so much, if you pick the right area. Which I mean, I guess, the whole thing...  So definitely not in Cranberry, here. Where we live.\n  Well we get a  lot of rain around here, so, I'm just... like flooding would be like a problem.\n  Yeah.\n  We're sort  of in a drought right now, there's not been a big rain for a long time.\n  Does it harm the  animals that are in the river?\n  It's better for  farmers because down the streams the water is deeper and there's more fish and stuff, but there's less... plants and stuff. Like upstream it floods the animals and homes, and so it doesn't really hurt too much down stream. I guess it depends, because the farmers need deeper waters, but not if there's less life in it. Because that's what they're trying to achieve. \n  Rachel tell us about yours\n  My energy is fossil fuels. The pros were that it's the most effiecent of most of the energy sources we can use. It's easy to find if you know, in the general area, of where it's at. It makes up half, or more, of our energy, in the United States. The cons are that it's non-renewable. There's a limited supply. It makes a lot of pollution when it's mined. It's expensive to transport. It harms aquatic life with pollution. It takes millions of years to form.\n  That's something I didn't know about fossil fuels, that it takes a very long time to develop.\n  It has to be, like, compacted.\n  Uh-huh.\n  So maybe the big plant, it might be able to, not might be able, it would probably run out fast, if we started using it a lot, so there wouldn't be a point in making this huge plant, and then it just run out.\n  Yeah.\n  So it might be  something people would use more often in the future. Just little by little, like just for little things. What do you mainly use it for? Like energy, but like...\n  What falls under the umbrella of fossil fuels?\n  Coals and oils.\n  And natural gas.\n  Yeah.\n  Yeah.\n  And you said it   when you mine it, so we would have to transport it here. There's so many people that live here that wouldn't want that.\n  Isn't that what  happened in Mexico? What's that called? The Gulf of Mexico, yeah. Weren't they mining for fossil fuels, like oil?\n  Oil, yeah.\n  And that happens,  so that's like a natural disaster. And that's happened a bunch of times, so it's not that safe. \n  So for our scenario, what do you think would be the best two?\n  Maybe nuclear  around here, out of the way a little so it wouldn't create any huge explosions. \n  So thermal energy  transfers into electrical energy\n  So it's kind  of like biomass, cause they both, you burn both of them, except yours you use--\n  Mine's not renewable\n  Yeah, yours,  you use like uhm... What's it called?\n  Like plants?\n  Fossilized  plants and stuff. And for biomass you just use waste or woods scraps and stuff like that.\n  Actually, isn't the, isn't the fossilized, or fossil fuels, or whatever, don't they keep on making them?\n  Yeah, fossilized,  yeah, but it can't, it takes so long to make them, because you need all the pressure and the decomposing, like plants and animals, that once it runs out, it's going to take a while for us to get more.\n  Like thousands of years, it takes to replenish.\n  Yeah. \n  It takes a long time.\n  Yeah, it takes a very long time, for sure.\n  So I think,  Keeton, I don't think yours would be the best for our community to use.\n  It's running out anyway, yeah, so.\n  How much pollution does it cause?\n  A lot.\n  Why does the world  just use it, if it's running out?\n  Why waste it?\n  We talked about the efficiency. What's the efficiency cost of fossil fuels?\n  I wasn't sure. I couldn't find the exact-- Uh, 38 to 47%.\n  That's actually really good. cause like biomass was only 22 to 30 or something.\n  So that may have something to do with what your decision is, right? The efficiency of the energy.\n  I think so.\n  I just . You should save some of it. You don't need to save it but it's not that good of an idea, to rely on this energy source that's not going to last forever.\n  That's why I say,  you could also use that as a backup plan, because if we use something that's renewable, like Katelyn's, or something, but something like a disaster happens that could always be our, just our fall back. That we know we could use that if we have to. Just like an emergency generator. It's like, you know it's there, if you need it, you can use it, and it can last for a little bit.\n  Since it  is running out, would you guys say that it would be better for us to use it now or save it in case--\n  Oh, definitely save it.\n  Save it.\n  I say save it, too.\n  Now I actually  think save it, because--\n  I think probably save it.\n  I would say to  save it because if something would happen and then you would need to use that specific type then you'll be able to go back to it, but if you use it all, then you couldn't go back to it.\n  So, what are you all proposing as your primary energy source?\n  Biomass.\n  Okay.\n  Cause it doesn't cause that much pollution.\n  And then they  harness that pollution like Katelyn said. They capture it and then they use it for different things, like growing trees or--\n  Cause the  only thing that, the only pollution that really comes from it is carbon dioxide. And they have a way of capturing the carbon dioxide and using it to fabricate metal and create paper and use it in greenhouses and stuff.\n  Wow, interesting.\n  Yeah, I  thought that was pretty good.\n  So I think Katelyn's definitely provides the most for the community, definitely out of all.\n  Yeah, I   ...have high effiecency rates so you'll be able to get like a lot of usable energy out of it.\n  Yeah.\n   ...the Colorado River, isn't actually renewable energy's that good of an efficiency rating.\n  Actually, actually the... the hydro-electric energy is nearly 95% efficient.\n  Wow.\n  Once you build it,  since tidal doesn't use any fuel either It's just once you built it, but the down side on building is it costs so much. So, I don't understand why people would want to use that amount of money whenever because you could use that on different things. You could do it to create more biomass. Like if you wanna try to look up ways to make that fossil, plant roots, or plants, just, try to find research to make that happen more quickly. speed up the process, so it wouldn't be a non-renewable resource like fossil fuels or anything.\n  There's no, they said, the small streams and like rivers and stuff like that, they only create like a small amount of energy, and so we can't really do that in Silicone Valley... \n  What about the three rivers in Pittsburgh? Could we not somehow harness that?\n  We were talking about that.\n  I was like  talking about redirecting the river.\n  Redirecting the river.\n  Just making one big one.\n  Yeah.\n  I think that we  would be able to use the three rivers in Pittsburgh, because they're all pretty big rivers, so if we just put like one dam in there, and then we harness the energy from all three, I think that we could get a lot of energy from it.\n  I don't think it'd  be enough energy, like to completely rely on it. I think that we'd still have to use other resources, to still create energy because I know the title, it only creates 10 hours of energy a day, but I don't know if that means, like, an hour of that energy runs like a power plant. It didn't exactly say how much energy is used to do one thing. So, I don't, I don't think that'd be a good idea, to completely rely on that, and put it in the three rivers.\n  And doesn't then, the, with the title energy, too, there has to be a difference in the--\n  The low and high\n  Difference in the low and the high.\n  Yeah, three meters of low and high.\n  Yeah, so where did you, find out where in the world there is that difference?\n  Yeah. They  said the biggest title... it was in France or something. But we don't have any in the United States because we don't have an area that we can put it in that has that big of a difference.\n  Oh, wow.\n  So there's none used in the United States, and I don't think we could use that, then.\n  Well, what you were  saying before about how, like, each energy source, we basically have to fall back on another one.\n  Yeah.\n  Because none  of them we could completely rely on, to supply all of our energy. I think that we would definitely need at least two choices.\n  At least two. And if we had to pick two, I would pick biomass and then your nuclear because you said a little amount takes it a long way.\n  Yeah, like  you only need a little bit, and it can produce a lot of energy. And the efficiency rating's pretty high. It's like 35%, so, yeah.\n  Wow, that is pretty high.\n  Remember you  said it was like really hazardous?\n  Yeah, it doesn't produce a lot of air pollution, or greenhouse gases, but if like one small accident is made, then it can cause like a really big disaster, which would be bad for a community of people, since there are so many people in it.\n  I think that--\n  Katelyn and  Kelsey were talking about like  different kinds of energy sources, and according to issels, uh, issues...\n", "filename": ["Copy of 099 ELA EA 099 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0709284], "annotations": [["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW08"]}, "090": {"text": "  Plug in two. You got it?\n  We got it.\n All right. First question is... Once energy is used up, it's gone for good. Talk to your partner, no! Let's try that one more time folks, eyes up here. What was the rule on the darts?\n The rule is don't do anything until you say so.\n Thank you. Don't act until I say so. Go! \n Yeah.\n There could be a little bit left of potential. Is that what you mean?\n Yeah. Well, . \n All right. On three. I'm going to need eyes up here, please. One, two, th-- Don't flip your card until I tell you to. I shouldn't be able to tell what your card is. It should be much more secret. They're colored, guys, I can tell what they are. Okay! Here we go, on three, hold up your card please. One, two, three! Okay. We've got mostly disagrees. And then we have very one confident... Oh, we disagree. So here's what we're going to do. Put your cards down. I'm calling on Mark first. So where should we be looking?\n  Mark.\n At Mark.\n Okay. Okay. So I strongly disagree, because say... So you know you... when you... You know how you eat food, you get fuel in your body and you have energy and you go out running. And then you're out of energy, you're tired, you go to bed, you wake up the next morning, it comes back. You eat more food and it comes back.\n Okay. So you're getting it from a different source.\n Yeah.\n Okay, but that energy you have originally. So that initial energy that you have, and then you ran. Does it go away? Yeah, you have plenty more, but does that original energy go away?\n No.\n Where does it go? Because you still don't have it, right? You have to eat more food. This is supposed to be challenging. Great job. Who has another idea? Or who can tell me where does it go? It's awfully quiet. Awfully quiet. What do you got?\n I don't think it literally... Well, I don't think it goes anywhere. You just... It just keeps making more.\n It makes more. So the energy I burnt, right? So I'm running, and I'm running, and I'm running. Where does it go?\n Out.\n Out where?\n To the air.\n To the air, in what form?\n Breath.\n Now this is tricky. This is where it gets tricky. Breath is made of what?\n Vapor.\n Carbon dioxide.\n Water and carbon dioxide. And we call that matter. We call that stuff. Is stuff and energy the same thing?\n  No.\n No, and this is really a tricky idea in Science. So we're going to keep working with you on that. So where does the energy go?\n Out into sweat.\n Out into... Now, okay, sweat is?\n Stuff.\n It's stuff, right? But where... So where does the energy go? Does anybody want to change their answer? And say, once it's used up, it's used up for good? Anybody? Some people I think... Now Tatum what do you think?\n I think that when you run, it's... Some of the energy go into the ground.\n How many people agree with Tatum? That some of that energy is going to go to the ground?\n Oh yeah.\n  Yeah.\n Okay. In what form does it go to the ground?\n In static stuff.\n What's that? I think you said static stuff. Is that what you say?\n Yeah.\n Okay, so static stuff is... Now this gets really tricky because now we're getting into electrons. But you're thinking about the rubbing, kind of thinking. Is that what you're thinking? How it rubs? And then you shock people? Okay. So that can happen. That's a little more complicated so I'm going to put that on hold for now. But what... So if I'm running, and that energy's going into the ground, somebody said that. Who said that?\n  Tatum.\n Tatum. Okay. So Tatum said the energy is going into the ground. In what form is it going into the ground? Yeah.\n Energy transfer.\n It is an energy transfer, right? This is going from my foot to the ground. What form is it in? Do you guys know what I mean when I say form?\n  Yeah.\n Yeah. We talked about kinetic, and potential, and heat, and what else we talked about? Elastic, and--\n Light.\n Gravitational, and light, and chemical.\n Sound.\n Heat, sound. Ooh, there's just hey, is any of that sound energy?\n No.\n No?\n Maybe it could be sound energy.\n Yes! Sound! Because you're... You're stepping hard. You're...\n Okay, so if I'm running, I'm probably going to produce some sound. Anything else that could go in there? Jason?\n Huh?\n Okay, I think that as you step on... You'll actually transform some potential energy to the ground because once you step on, you all react to gravity to the ground.\n So gravity's pushing down--, now remember what gravitational energy is, is how far it is away from the ground, right? So how much room it has to fall basically. So would there be... If I go like this, would there be any gravitational energy there?\n Wouldn't there be if you raise your foot?\n Now it's got gravitational.\n Here's what we need, I'm really doing something to say... But here's what I want you to think about this one... Actually, let's do this one more time. I want you to re-vote on this. Once energy is used up, it's gone for good. Talk to each other for 10 seconds. \n You're thinking it's going someplace else.\n I don't know where but I don't think it just disappears for good. I think it's going somewhere.\n That it's somewhere but just not sure where.\n Yeah.\n All right folks, we're going to re-vote on three. One, two, three. All right, put your cards down for just a second. Here's what Henry just said, and I want you to raise your hand if you agree with Henry. And we're going to talk about, again guys, we're not getting answers to all these questions today, we will at some point. I promise. We're going to do it in the formal labs but not before I'm through telling you. Henry, tell me what you just said.\n I think that it's not gone for good. I'm not sure where it goes but I think it doesn't just leave. It's still somewhere but I don't know where.\n How many of you agree with Henry? That you think that it's somewhere but you're just not sure where?\n I don't know where though.\n All right. Do you know what form?\n No.\n No. Anybody else? Know where?\n But wait. Doesn't it just transform?\n It can transform into something else but then my question for you would be...\n  What?\n What kind of energy is it? All right, but here's what we're going to do, we're going to move on to the next one. If a person is pushing a box, the person has energy, but the box does not otherwise it would help out. Ready, set, go. \n What's the evidence that the box has energy? What form of energy is that, that's moving?\n I don't know.\n Well, it's kineck, kineck...\n One more try.\n Kinetic.\n Okay. \n Because it's currently in motion.\n Yeah.\n Okay. All right. So now here's what I want... We're going do a challenge question. What about the person? What kind of energy does the person have, who's pushing it?\n That... I don't know.\n You guys all have it? Okay, here we go! Eyes over here please. Are we a little bit on balancing in agreement? All right, here we go. A person is pushing a box, the person has energy but the box does not, otherwise, it would help out. On three, hold up your cards, please. One, two, three. So what you're saying then is you all think the box does have energy, am I correct?\n  Yeah.\n Okay. Chloe tell me why... What is your evidence, that the box has energy?\n I think it has energy because when you're pushing it, it has a friction with whatever you're pushing it.\n How many of you agree that there's friction there? Because it's rubbing against what?\n  The ground.\n It's rubbing against the ground. There could be some rubbing against you, but most likely it's going to be rubbing against ground. But here's my question, what is your evidence that it has energy? It does have friction, and now it gives you some sort of indication that it's doing what?\n  Moving.\n It's moving. What do we call that, something's moving? What kind of energy does that? Just shout it.\n  Kinetic.\n Kinetic. So it has kinetic energy. So here's my next question, so does anybody disagree? The box does not have kinetic energy? Tate?\n I didn't believe it. I thought it was transferred. I thought that it was energy transfer.\n  Yeah.\n Okay. So you think energy's being transferred from the person to the box.\n Yeah.\n Okay, but the question is still, does the box have energy? Even if I'm transferring it there? Does it have energy while it's moving?\n Yeah.\n Well, do you mean before the person?\n I mean while I'm moving it. I'm in the process of pushing the box. Does the box have energy?\n Yeah, but don't you think part of it, would be from you, and part of it--\n I think all of it is from you.\n Oh.\n But does it still have energy?\n Yeah.\n Yeah, it does. So what's your proof? Chloe just said it. What's your proof that the box has energy?\n  Friction.\n It's moving.\n That it's moving. Okay, now the friction is proof that's it's moving, perhaps. But you also see it moving, that would be the proof that it's moving. Okay, so here's my other question, I'm going to make this point, this is too easy for you. We're going to make this more challenging. What about the person pushing the box? So here is me, this is how I push a box. So if I'm pushing the box, what kind of energy do I have? Think about it. Jack, what do you think?\n Kinetic.\n How many of you agree with Jack, that I have kinetic energy? How many of you think there's something else going on there as well?\n No.\n So I have... I can only have kinetic energy, right? Because I am... ?\n  Moving. Pushing.\n Because I am moving and I'm pushing. Okay. What other kind of energy must I have?\n I have to say something else, like it's kind of helping to  and what disagrees. Yesterday, you told us the classic pool...\n You're talking about energy transfer? You guys know what she's talking about? We're talking about the pool and handle.\n Yeah. I think of it kind of the same thing only the pool hall has some of the  because you have the stick in your hand, and you have the energy, potential energy and then you start moving it, and then it's kinetic and it goes through the stick, and through the ball, and it moves.\n So you're saying that I have some form of potential energy as well?\n Yeah, before you start. And then .\n In what form is that potential energy? Because I think Emily was about to say this, too. Think about this guys. Where am I getting my energy from? Is it gravitational?\n  No.\n Muscles.\n Okay, so I've got my muscles, I've got my body. But where's that energy coming from?\n Food.\n Which is a form of what, Marcus?\n Fuel.\n Which is a form of what?\n Potential!\n Time out. We're asking Marcus. Marcus, what form of potential energy is fuel?\n Um.\n This is hard. Did you want a lifeline?\n Yeah.\n Anika, can you help him out.\n Chemical.\n Chemical, right? Make sense?\n  Yes.\n Okay. All right, we're going on to the next slide. Are you ready?\n  Yeah.\n Woo hoo hoo. Okay, here we go. Now, goodness, gracious. Okay, this is a hard one. Cold moves faster than heat. Ready, set, go. \n And but also I remember my mom on hot days, she's like, \"Don't go upstairs because it's hotter.\" Heat rises.\n So is it, is it move... So your evidence that it's moving faster is that it goes up.\n Yeah, and also when you put it in hot, hot water, it's looser because...\n Okay, so you're saying if cold moved faster it would go up as well?\n  Yeah.\n Faster than heat? Okay. How about moving in other directions other than up? Is there... Do you have any... ?\n Wind!\n Okay, so that would... So does one move faster than the other?  Tatum, what do you think? All right. Think about it.  All right, here we go.  Okay, here we go. So on three, hold up your answers please. One, two, three. We've got strongly agrees. We've got an in between. We've got an ooh, we've got a strongly agree. And we've got a couple in-betweens. All right. We're mostly in orange land, we've got one green. So here we go? You ready?\n  Yeah.\n And stand together, you're going to back them up.\n Yeah. So, okay, so we agree that. . .\n Are you sure?\n No. Just kidding.\n Because I think the answer you just gave me was certain. So you're a strongly disagree. Okay.\n Well, I read it wrong. I thought it said heat... Yeah, I thought it said heat moves faster than cold.\n Okay, so tell me why you strongly disagree then, Tim?\n Well, because there's just as  heat rises. So it has to be lighter to move.\n And so it must be moving faster?\n Yeah.\n How many of you agreed with this... How many of you thought about this whole heat rising thing? Interesting. And how many of you... Nope, you guys, it never crossed your mind. Okay. Let's hop to another... Tatum, do have anything else to add to that?\n No.\n What is your evidence that cold moves slower? Because he was just saying heat was rising, do you have any evidence that cold would move slower? Let's see, Alex, what do you think?\n Well, because when we did that investigation and stuff on molecules, they move faster when they're hot.\n The coke can.\n Yeah, the coke can investigation.\n Okay, so I'm going to ask them for specific evidence. So what was your specific evidence in the coke can, the hot molec- that they were moving faster?\n Well, there was steam coming out of it, and then in the solid, everything's... Molecules in solids are super slow. And then as they move on to liquid then gas, they move faster.\n Okay.\n And then you need heat to make liquid into gas.\n How many of you think that this whole molecules moving faster in a gaseous state proves that heat moves faster than cold? How many of you are kind of stuck on this idea of cold? So let me ask you a question, and I want you to think about it for 10 seconds, then we might move on, let's see. What is cold? Not looking for examples of things that are cold but what is cold? What is the idea of cold or coldness? Okay, think about it for a second. Ellie, what is cold?\n Well, it's like... It could be water that's frozen in... I was thinking that heat moves faster than, than cold because if something was frozen, the molecules wouldn't be moving that fast because if they were they could try to push out on that.\n Oh, then it might be .\n Okay, so she gave me an example of what is cold. But is coldness? So what, what does that even mean? What does that even mean? Anna.\n Shivering.\n What's that?\n Shivering.\n Okay, shivering is because you are cold. What is coldness? Okay... \n I think it's when the temperature is really low and everything's kind of darkness, when you think of the sun warm, it's really warm, when you have the sun. But it's when you think of something cold, it's... sometimes.\n Okay, I want... You guys are giving me some really good examples of what cold is. Here's what I want to think about... Okay, how to phrase this... Is there a such thing as cold? And if so, how would you define it?\n It's a hard question!\n Oh!\n You got to answer! Get ready to answer! Get ready, and do one quick response and then we're going to put it aside for now, and we're going to move on. Come on, Hunter.\n No, because it's just heat that's a... That's just water that can be heated or .\n Heat, heat is cold. Heat is that.\n Yeah, it's like...\n Heat, that's cold.\n Yeah.\n Oh.\n So it's all just kind of a scale? Like you got hot over here and cold over here, and you're talking about there's less heat over here than there is here?\n Heat has cold molecules.\n Heat has colder?\n All right. So here's what we're going to do, we're going to talk more about this later. We're going to move on to the next question for now.

What would you do in that situation? Would you try to get money?\n Isn't this kind of different because we're all girls?\n Yeah, but...\n If it was a boy, and he was the one who didn't have money...\n Do you feel like the chapters that we read, do you feel like you could tell what Pip was going to be doing?\n Kind of. You could tell that he was becoming more stuck-up; wants to change himself and not be around the poor people.\n Are you doing the discussion director? Did you do any questions in regards to his-- did you have any direct questions with regards to the text?\n Yeah. One of them was like how did Pip change from the beginning of the book to where he's at now, like his character and basically how he acted.\n What was the question I missed, Brianna, where you said about the girls? I didn't hear the question. I just heard your response.\n His was, in Chapter 29, when he is becoming part of her marriage, he was just like, how would you feel or whatever. None of us really had an answer because the situation is different, like it's different for the guys... She's the one who's like the rich girl.\n Who's the recording one?\n So, on page 128, paragraph two, that's where Herbert tells Miss Havisham's story. That's important because it kind of explains why she is the way that she is. He explains that you meet Miss Pocket, and then she's kind of like- he kind of explains why she's kind of crazy.\n All right. Chapter 8 was interesting because he was home from war and in the camp. He started to treat people. He treated them like they were all heroes.\n And he shared the cigarettes with him one time.\n He shared the cigarettes with them and was even .\n When he was amongst the Russians, he didn't care. They were struggling to survive. He felt sorry for them, which as a connector, I've connected it to- I don't know if you guys have seen \"Tears of the Sun.\"\n I have.\n And \"Avatar.\" In \"Tears of the Sun,\" he wanted to go and try to rescue people, but he got stuck behind enemy lines , like they're struggling people too trying to gain their freedom. And then same thing in \"Avatar.\" Paul kind of reminded me of how he was behind and he was with the Russians, but he thought that they weren't as bad as he- the military was the only bad part about them. Civilians, he felt sorry for them, that they had to go through all this. They were being killed. Their people were being killed. And they were actually just regular people trying to make it. Everybody was dying because they used all this stuff in the military and they weren't caring about the civilians. \n The prisoners?\n They were .\n They had to trade whatever they had to get like a couple supplies to the refugees.\n He started to wonder like why are people higher up, people he'd never met forcing them .\n Yeah. \n So, then this whole section made me think about that. So, I thought that could be like the controversial part to talk about. This whole section...\n Which whole section?\n The one you were just talking about.\n They're talking about magic.\n Yeah. They're talking about the magic and being invisible and then he  and scares them away.\n It really showed a struggle between Antonio internally with religions.\n Yeah.\n In one he had keys and then in the other one it was totally crazy.\n Yeah.\n That's my next section, is that dream. I think it's page 119. That whole dream is really important because it's like, it kind of highlights what I just said about how he might be the next  person or whatever. He goes to this dream and it's kind of the same thing he's been facing through the whole book- his mom's side versus his dad's side. And Ultima kind of comes out and is like, \"Well, you are both. You have to find a happy medium.\" It's all within the world of his dreams. And then page 139...\n One part that I thought was really, really important was his brother at the brothel.\n These two chapters, I think they're kind of jam-packed. I just kind of picked stuff that would be good to talk about. And then page 139, paragraph three, they're talking about how the group can be buried in the casket of time. I just felt that was informative and something that we should look at. Just pretty much the whole funeral.\n The funeral was good styling.\n Like, I don't know, these four chapters...\n There was no part where you didn't .\n It's like, read these four chapters.\n Exactly.\n After I read the chapter, I wrote some questions down. The first one is what did the contrast between the golden carp and the black bass- how the golden carp made the black bass jump. And his missing of the bass symbolizes maybe like a win for Abel...\n The golden carp story was just very interesting.\n The whole controversy is that he's Catholic, but part of him really wants to believe in this whole...\n It's not like he wasn't interested in it, but he still didn't believe. But then he still respected the story itself and the respect of the carp.\n It made me feel like the golden carp would bring it up. Could Antonio... \n It made me feel that Antonio's struggle between his mother's beliefs and his father's, how his father was like, on the corpse-strewn shore.\n I remember there was something like when you're in the ocean, it's the same water-\n It's like Ultima came in.\n She was like, \"You don't pick one. You're both. That's it.\"\n You can't just choose one path.\n You should be a priest cowboy.\n I think the way it was portrayed was like because of the way he was brought up, it was kind of showing the negative. \n She's brought up. She's not there, but she's brought up too much.\n I feel like she's a goal though, to be like be some kind of spirit type thing.\n He hopes that she's like someone who's not fake.\n So, I guess he's trying to like make things work with everyone else and see, like, what his relationship with other people and to finally be able to call a .\n I feel like he compares all of his relationships to her. He has that standard.\n Didn't he point out like all the flaws of her? \n That was just creepy. I was just like, \"Poor guy,\" to have all of these weird, awkward dreams.\n I'm going to say foreshadowing. I'm sticking by that and saying Ultima's going to die and he's going to be the new... I'm sticking by that, and that's foreshadowing.\n Look at you go.\n All of those things are foreshadowing or are they just predicting something that happened in the past?\n Most of them. Well, I think the one where, remember where he went into a brothel in the one dream? Right. Exactly. So, I think that most of the dreams are foreshadowing.\n They're not showing directly what happens, but hints.\n Basically I'm a beast.\n We don't even have to read the rest of the book because I just gave it to you.\n Because we know what's happening.\n I said also, in chapter 14, the bad dream, what do you make of it? Is he seeing the sinners as deserters that all witches are being spun out and that he needs to step forward? Or does the golden carp have like stronger power? What do you think it symbolizes?\n I think there are good witches and there are bad witches. The bad witches are the ones that should be, like... \n That's Antonio's issue as well. I think he's kind of figured out that there's something different about Ultima. I think he's kind of figured out that- he's kind of just like, \"Oh, they're evil and she's good. If she's a witch, then she's evil.\" So, it's kind of this contrast of can a witch be good? It's kind of like the question of what he wants to believe versus...\n It kind of relates to the Civil War and the Africans and their personal stuff. It kind of relates to that. The white people, they didn't want to believe that they're intelligent and they're friends. He doesn't want to believe that a witch can be good because he's been told otherwise.\n And he's a Catholic and witches are evil.\n I think that the golden carp symbolizes perhaps the rebirth.\n I think the two most important themes, symbol figures are the owl and the carp. \n", "filename": ["Copy of 022 ELAAYA022.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0357943], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW08", "TW11"]}, "093": {"text": "  Dakota didn't want to bring his... because it's all broken.\n  Well we can still look at it.

Will you still be able to tell us about it?\n He said that it exploded.\n Please don't break it any more. Are you going to be able to talk about it still? You can tell us what was on it. Okay, put it down, Addy, or it's going to break. Okay. So you guys, you did... Your small group was Washoe, and you're going to present to the whole group next week or the next week after.\n The whole group?\n The whole classroom.\n Okay.\n Okay. So what I need you to do for a little bit is talk between yourselves about what you found. And the four things that I want you to make sure somebody knows something about: food, shelter, clothing, and location. But if you found something else you want to talk about, go ahead. So anybody, chime in.\n Okay. I think I know where they're located.\n Can you tell us?\n South Lake Tahoe.\n  I know what they ate.\n In your strong voice though.\n They ate onions. They ate wild potatoes, wild carrots...\n I think a little bit...\n Wild mustard, sunflower seeds, wild carrots, wild potatoes, wild strawberries, raspberries, wild gooseberries, wild rosehips, wild rhubarb, pine nuts, and they used...\n Sweet potatoes, wild turnips, wild spinach... seeds...\n Okay. Do you think we're good on food?\n  Yeah.\n Okay.\n I think Olivia got the part.\n Well, we'll talk about that after. So we have location...\n Shelter.\n Go ahead. Okay. Who's going to go next?\n  I have they used sticks and leaves to build their homes.\n Okay. What do you have your information on?\n I have clothing. They used rabbit skins, buckskins, and plants.\n Okay. And I'm sorry, Coleman. What did you say?\n They used sticks and leaves to build their homes.\n Okay. So you got those four covered. Any fun facts you guys found? Dakota, what did you find out? Give us one fun fact.\n  In 1859 the Washoe... Wait.\n Let Dakota, guys. Remember, we're trying to be good listeners.\n In 18...\n Go ahead, sweetie.\n In 1859 the Washoe had about 90 people  times.\n Aw.\n No, no, not 90, 900.\n Can I see what you wrote? They had 90,000, or?\n Nine hundred.\n Nine hundred, and now they only have 300?\n No, let's see. The population. Well I got it off the computer.\n Yeah, I got 1500.\n In 1855 the Washoe numbered about 900. But are now reduced to about a third of that number.\n What that the same fact you had, Dakota?\n Yeah.\n Yeah, very good. Thank you, Dakota.\n I got in 2007, there was 1500. But I got it off the computer too and it said that.\n Well, you know the computer is not always...\n I got the latest.\n What kind of data did you get? Like demographic? Or where did you get yours from?\n I got it from Google.\n Well guys, 300 was what yours said, Dakota? And yours said 1500?\n Yeah.\n Are you sure yours wasn't 1500 from before? And now it's 300?\n Well it said in 2007.\n Okay.\n On here, on my brain copy.\n Okay. We might need to look at that some more, you guys. We'll look into that before we report on that. But that would be a fun fact anyway. Joe, did you tell us anything?\n  Yeah. I have another fun fact.\n Okay.\n A fun fact. Their houses are called Gadus.\n Gadus, okay. Okay. Now who hasn't had a turn, guys? All of you got your hands up. Let's include our little friend, Addy. Okay.\n  They made baskets.\n Any good baskets?\n Mostly Dot So La Lee.\n Most famous one.\n She was famous for making baskets.\n What was she famous for, Olivia?\n  She was the... She made the most baskets than other Washoe people, the other Indians.\n And why was she more famous than all the other Indians?\n I don't know that, but I think she was like a really good basket-maker.\n You think she was a good... Can you scoot over?\n I can, yeah.\n Okay. Did you guys get to see any of the samples of the baskets?\n  Yes.\n Did you know that they're in very... Oh, you have a picture? Awesome. These are actually Dot So La Lee's baskets?\n Mm-hmm.\n Okay. So the thing, if you every get to see one of Dot So La Lee's baskets, they're woven so tight, you could carry water in them. And we talked about symmetry today in math. They're perfectly symmetrical. Yes, they're woven so tight that you can put water in them.\n And even Dot So La Lee had like 2000.\n You what?\n She had made that many baskets.\n She made how many?\n A lot.\n Two thousand.\n Two hundred and something.\n Wow. It would be nice to have one of those now, huh?\n Yeah. But they're like... You can't even buy them.\n You cannot buy them, huh?\n They're like in a museum.\n They're in museums, but I think some people do have a private collection of them.\n Really?\n Maybe one or two, yeah. They're not like our petroglyphs that we're going to talk about. Can you have a petroglyph in your private collection?\n  No.\n Those you can't have. Okay. So you guys, let's see, who wants to be the writer? Do you have a pencil? Grab that pencil. Would you write your tribal name up here? You guys are Washoe. And then go around, Addy, and find out. Write the name of the person next to the food, the shelter, and that's what you're going to kind of be responsible for. Let's get Addy... And you can go around and ask each person, or you can say, \"Who wants to do food?\" W-A-S-H-O-E.\n I'll do fun facts.\n I'll do shelter.\n I'll do fun facts.\n No, I'll do shelter.\n Okay. How are we going to decide?\n Joe should do the clothing.\n Joe should do clothing.\n Is that okay with you?\n Do you think I should tell you the name of the...\n Hold on. We're not doing these. We'll do that later. Thank you, Olivia. Olivia volunteered for food. Joe, do you really want to do clothing?\n  I was either going to do clothing or language, because I found a whole thing for...\n Everybody can do a fun fact too.\n But I was going to do a fun facts.\n We need somebody to do food and location.\n Okay. I'll do location.\n Shelter.\n Shelter and location.\n I got... I'll get shelter.\n Good. Thank you, Coleman. And then, I know you guys want to do fun facts too, so everybody can do a fun fact.\n L-E, and then M-A-N.\n C-O-L-E-M-A-N.\n L-E.\n L-E-M-A-N. Okay. Now we just have location left.\n But what's Dakota doing?\n What do you want to do?\n How about me and Dakota will do location together?\n Does that work? Okay.\n That's who's going to do the fun fact.\n Everyone can do a fun fact. So write, \"Thomas/Dakota\" for location. No, don't worry about fun facts. Everybody has got a fun fact right there. So if both of you are doing it, it's got to be super duper. \n Okay, so, we're going to look up if they lived in Washoe. They probably did. \n Did you have their names down, Addy?\n It's like, Washoe people... \n Where are you guys going to find the information, Dakota?\n And Dakota.\n D-A-K-O-T-A.\n Better... You guys, what did we find out about Google? Maybe you want to find two. If you have two things and they don't say the same thing, you might want to check another one.\n There's a lot of maps on Google.\n There's a lot of maps on Google?\n Yeah.\n We're going to go... We're going to go on maps and look where...\n Okay. Thanks. I'm going to take that so when you... Okay. So next week or the week after, you guys are going to do a whole group, class presentation on your tribe. And you're welcome to bring pictures, or artifacts, or like pieces of whatever, if you want to do that. You can bring a basket. Obviously, it's not going to be a Dot So La Lee.\n Can I bring a arrowhead?\n Did your tribe have arrowheads?\n Yeah.\n Okay. Now, looking in front of you, you guys, for our art project we did something. What is this called. Who knows? Olivia? I like how you raised your hand.\n The petrograph.\n Louder. Petro...\n The petrograph.\n Petroglyphs. And what is a petroglyph? You're going to break yours, Thomas. Addy, what's a petroglyph?\n It's a carving in a rock.\n A carving in a rock. Did your tribe make petroglyphs?\n We don't know.\n Why don't you know?\n 'Cuz they put things like right down. They made it. They just moved. They just carved it in and nobody really knows, unless there's someone from that tribe who made it and passed it down, generation to generation.\n Yes. Very good. What were you going to say?\n You know when we were looking on that website? We were looking on that website ...and one said, \"Washoe.\"\n Okay. Yes. So some of them they attri... They say that they did it, but we don't know who did what petroglyphs. But in our state, can we narrow it down to one of four tribes probably? And maybe, if they found petroglyphs where your location was, you could say those were Shoshone petroglyphs? Would that work?\n We're Washoe.\n Washoe. I'm sorry. All right. So who wants to share theirs first? So what you're going to do is you're going to share it, and show the whole group, and tell us what yours meant to you. Okay?\n Okay.\n Addy, you want to call on somebody? Since everybody is dying to talk. Who's going first?\n Coleman.\n Coleman, can we see yours? Okay. I want to zoom in on it. Hold it up a little bit, because I got it up. Okay. What does yours mean to you?\n It means that it's night, and there's some stars, and there's a duck. And then there's a canoe on the water. And there is a lot of meat and camping.\n Camping. Okay. Anybody else want to go?\n Pass it around.\n Joseph. Oh, don't pass it around. We don't want to break it. We're going to stick them on wood or something. Oh, let me get a picture. Oh, I'm zooming in. Up higher, Joe, because I've got this on a tripod. Okay. All right.\n Mine is we're going to drink some water from a river with fish in it and a duck on top. And there's a snake trying to eat the duck. There's an eagle. It's daytime and the skies are clear.\n Oh Addy, you're calling on people. Thank you. Okay. Addy, sit back a little bit so we can see Miss Olivia.\n ...random things, but I think I know what it is. It means they're hunting buffalo at night. And then the daytime came and it's all rainbow. And we caught some fish. That's it.\n Okay. Good. Who wants to go now? Thomas. Nice.\n So there's a camp and there's a little hill behind the camp. And there's people in war, and there's a snake. And then, one person is not in war. He's just trying to shoot a duck.

Mine kind of blew...\n What happened to yours, honey?\n It like kind of didn't turn out so well. It like blew up in pieces.\n Can you tell us what it was before it blew up in pieces?\n Well it was like, I don't know.\n Did you have like hunting symbols, or anything?\n No.\n He just did like squares.\n I drew lines because I...  I remember I didn't really know what to write.\n You didn't know what to write? Okay. That's all right. But if you could do it again, what would you do? What would it mean to you?\n I'd probably make up a war thing.\n A war thing? Okay.\n It's more war, except hunt.\n Hunting? Oh, okay. Did you go, Miss Addy? Okay.\n Humans were hunting for humans. That's what's on mine.\n Okay. Addy, I would wait until everybody was listening. Thank you.\n I can't show your...\n Okay. Just show the other children.\n It's a sunny day.

It says how does the ?\n Skip predictions. Move on. Yeah. Olympic athletes--how does your data compare to Olympic athletes? How does your data compare to the class average?  Yeah?\n Do we do the predictions? \n It does help to have somebody look at it with you. Sometimes it's not as obvious as you think. Scott, we're going to stay on task, right? Good.  We're not doing predictions, right?\n No.\n So, take a look at patterns. What you want to do for this question is look at patterns. Do you see any patterns there? Okay, good. It's not necessarily worse, by the way. It's definitely different. It's worse, Skye, if you're like dead. If we're talking about heart rate and yours is worse... So, we still have a little bit to learn how that affects you if you are inactive or not.\n \n So, let's look at the pattern, there. You see that? That's kind of what I was thinking. You just missed that one. Again, one of the things we can talk about then is data collection. Exactly. Come on, let's go.\n It's not the same numbers. It's the same pattern.\n Right. Good. Any patterns that you guys are seeing back there?\n Yeah.\n A little bit? What might that be? This is science, be more specific. Are there any patterns for number four? You guys skipped it? It's okay. Yeah. Four. You don't have to do predictions. You compare to athletes. Don't do it for predictions, but do it for your class data and athletes.  Okay. Now, that's a perfect, simple question. Now we take that information and put it into number six. Hopefully you're going to make the mental jump that we need here. What does heart rate have to do with homeostasis? If we challenged our body with a little bit of exercise, you know how heart rates work, now the question is why. How does that keep us alive? There you go. Good. How much more time do we need?  Did you get this one right? If you guys did then you understand the process, hands down congratulations. Make sure you share your answers. Make it quick, I don't want people in and out. We good? How about a drink? Here you go. We got it. It's good. No, I've got it covered, okay? Two more minutes remain in your seats. Number six--there you go. You're good. Good job, Scott. You're very subtle and very helpful. Thank you. Remember, we've got a mic that's on there. All right, got two more. Thirty more seconds, right? Then you're back in your own seats. If you can do six, you're the best. Ten seconds or so. Get in your own seats for the next ten seconds.  Two things are going to happen--we're going to start off with simple answers, then we're going build upon them and then hopefully we'll get to the more creative ones at the end. This class, we have enough time to do that. So, let's do that right off the bat. Question one. Daryl, can you read it or would you prefer to have somebody else read it?\n I can read it.\n Okay. Good.\n \"What is the hypothesis being tested?\"\n Okay. So, let's talk about it. In our experiment, we were looking to get something measured. What is a valid hypothesis for this experiment? Scott we've got and then Alicia. Alicia, let's go.\n How does exercise affect your heart rate?\n Good. Now, that's a step in the right direction. The hypothesis has got to include the concept-- Alicia and anybody in her group want to help her out--it's got to include the concept of homeostasis. So, can we do that? Can we tale a look at our aim, a look at our model hypothesis--how does exercise affect heart rate? That's a good start. Anybody else have something else different that would support our understanding of homeostasis? You're yawning. You okay? All right. Let's sit up. Thank you. Little bit more. Good. Good. Like you're playing third base, okay Matt? Good. Let's sit back now. There you go. Got it. Anybody else? Go ahead.\n If we do exercise then our heart rate will change.\n Okay. So, that's kind of what Alicia said. Go ahead.\n It should keep going up and then when you're not, it goes down.\n Again, a great, great hypothesis if we were at a third or fourth grade level, that's something we want to do. But we're not at third or fourth grade. It's a tenth grade class here. I want you to get out of your seventh grade minds and add this concept of regulation. You want to try?\n How does homeostasis affect your heart rate?\n \"How does homeostasis affect your heart rate?\" Think about that, okay? You want to reword that? Which causes which?\n Oh, how does your heart rate affect homeostasis?\n Good. But now we've got to remember. We combined exercise in this. Kevin?\n How does your heart rate change to meet the needs of your muscles and cells in the body?\n You didn't use the word \"homeostasis,\" but, \"How does your heart change to meet the needs of your cells and your heart in your body?\" Excellent. I don't need you to write that. I just need you to understand that's the direction we're going. You want to try now?\n I had almost the same thing. I put, \"Heart rate changing throughout exercise to the needs of homeostasis.\"\n Homeostasis. Now you guys are closer on it. So, this is about how does your body adapt itself, even when stress with exercise to maintain balance, to maintain homeostasis. In the beginning of this unit, you guys remember I had the balance board up here? How many of you got on it? I forget. One person? Two people? That's it? Three people? Do you remember how hard that was to do? Did we throw things at the people?\n Yeah.\n Was that easier or harder to stay balanced when that was happening?\n Harder.\n No, I thought it was like easier.\n What's the room for error? How easy is it for one of the sides to touch or how not easy is it?\n It's very easy.\n Same with homeostasis. That margin of error--we're in a small range here. If I take your temperature, Dustin, and it's healthy?\n Not healthy?\n Okay. 98.6?\n No.\n But what if you're 102? What if you're that tell you? You want to try? So, 98.6 is normal. But what if somebody takes your temperature and you're at 100 degrees or\n It's not normal.\n You want to give me a word for that?\n Sick?\n You would be sick. You'd have a fever. Something would be wrong with you. You would be not normal, right? Good. That's a small number. 98.6 and if you have 101, you've got to see a doctor or something. You've got to get rest. You've got to get medicine. You've got to do something to help your body heal. All right. Number one, done. Number two and three--Daryl, you did a good job reading the first one. Richie, can I ask you to read the second one?\n Sure. What are the controls in the experiment?\n Okay. So, controls--another word for controls anybody, real quick?\n Independent variables?\n No. Not at all. Constants. Things that don't change. So, above the word \"controls, \" can you guys write the word \"constants?\" Things that stay the same. So, Savannah, good, good opportunity for you to learn, okay? So, when we say controls, we're talking about the exact opposite of a variable, which is a thing that changes. Everything stays the same or constant. What are some the examples of the constants that you have in this experiment, the controls? Go ahead.\n The three categories?\n The three categories. We mentioned everybody in the same three categories. Okay. Go ahead.\n The amount of time you're giving us.\n And how much time was that? Do you remember?\n Two minutes?\n Two minutes, two minutes, two minutes. The amount of time was the same.\n The temperature?\n Temperature in the... ?\n Stairway.\n Good. Because if you were going to talk about your own temperature, actually that changes. Again, that's a whole other topic about homeostasis, that when we exercise, we start sweating, right? So, you're talking about the temperature in the exact place. Okay. Anybody else? Go ahead.\n Where we exercise and then the height of the stairs, like if one stair was higher than the other, then it would be harder.\n Right. All the steps are the same. Now, here's a control one kid said in my last class and the other kids disagreed with him. He said the exercise was the control, that we all did the same thing.\n No.\n Do you remember what we did? We walked the stairs. Did we all walk the stairs the same way?\n No.\n Well, some of you kids hustled, right? Like two minutes, you were like bunnies, like gerbils on the stairway. You were just going crazy. Others were just walking and it was okay. Good. Let's move on. Three, independent and dependent variables. That would be helpful. Thank you for your hand up. We only need one answer of the two and somebody else will give the other one. So, dependent or independent, whatever you want.\n Heart rate is the dependent variable upstairs.\n Okay, one second. One second. So, tell me a little bit more, though, Daryl. Is it heart rate and how do we measure the heart rate? Take a look at your graph. Your dependent variable is going to be very well described on your graph. Help me out. Go ahead. Okay. You're looking at it. Somebody want to help him out? What is the dependent variable of this? He's close, but he's not close enough to be right. Savannah?\n Number of heart beats per minute?\n Per minute. You had to have the per minute on that, okay? That's the standard that we use in science. Independent variable--Kelsey, would you like to try?\n I'm not sure I know it.\n Okay. That's okay. What did we introduce in this experiment to affect our heart rate to see if we could stay balanced?\n Exercise?\n Bingo. So, your independent variable?\n Exercise.\n Exercise. Two minutes of exercise is what we did. Very good. Your back group, you have another one or it's all up here? Okay. Four, how does your data compare to the Olympic athletes? How does your personal data compare to the class? Now, remember, we're scientists. So, you just can't say, \"It went up and then it went down,\" or whatever. You can say that, but it's got to be justified with some sort of specific numbers. Richie had his hand up first, okay Justine? Okay. Go ahead.\n My heart rate predictions were very low because I didn't have any idea and then my actual heart rate was higher than the Olympic athletes because they're used to running a lot.\n Okay. Here's a good example of what I'm talking about. First of all, what you did with predictions is great. We didn't actually have to even do that one for this question, but that's great. Richie, when you say they were higher, what do you mean? Your resting rate was higher? Your post exercise rate was higher? Your recovery rate was higher?\n All of them.\n Okay. You've got to include them in your answer. You have to include that in your answer. You've got to be specific. Go ahead, Matt. Margaret, you're next, okay? Yeah. Go ahead.\n My prediction, I had low numbers, but after doing the experiment, only one of my numbers was lower than the Olympic athletes.\n Okay. So, again, what was that one number?\n Post-exercise.\n Post-exercise was lower. Wow. That's rare, by the way. Did you see the class data compared to you, then? We weren't supposed to do the prediction, but I'm getting so many hits here. How many of you to a look at your prediction compared to other people? Quite a few people. You guys when you were doing this, you asked me, \"What's the normal range?\" And I didn't tell you. I wonder what you would say your prediction is after I gave you a range. I purposely didn't just to let you see, just like you said, \"Mine was off because I didn't know any better.\" Good. All right. Five--super important question here--oh, I'm so sorry, does anyone else want to contribute to the Olympic athletes? I'm so sorry. Go ahead.\n My actual heart rate was higher than the Olympic athletes, but for the exercise one, it was only seven heart beats lower.\n Okay. So, what does that mean to you? How close to an Olympic athlete are you is what I'm asking.\n I guess it could be exercise. Like with the Olympic athletes, I know it wouldn't be like anything for them. For me to be like that far off is kind of like impressive.\n Right. And how would you know that? Didn't you say you had like a cousin who...\n Does crew.\n Does crew at the Olympic level or just does crew?\n She does crew at an Olympic level.\n Wow, a premiere athlete, then. Fantastic.\n What's crew?\n Crew is when you row a shell or row a boat. There's singles, doubles and quads.\n Oh yeah.\n Fantastic. Anybody else before we move on? Christina and then Scott.\n I noticed that we're just like, like I realized we're all, like, the same because when the Olympic athletes went up, class average went up and ours went up, so I noticed it was the same pattern, just like depending on what we were doing it was different than the Olympics and all that stuff.\n That's the big picture I want everybody to see here. Take a look at your graphs one more time. Do you agree with what Christina just said? Forget about your prediction number. Did you see that there's a pattern here? No matter who you are as an individual in this class or as a class average or as Olympic athletes, when we exposed our body to exercise, what happened in all cases?\n It went up.\n So, we would say it increased. Okay. What happened when we rested, post-exercise? Yes?\n It decreased.\n It decreased. Right. So, there is a general pattern. Excellent job, Christina. Go ahead, Scott. Make it quick.\n I had the same thing as her.\n Okay. Good. All right. Key question--if we can answer six, we've got this lesson down pat. When muscles are active, cells use nutrients and oxygen at a higher rate and produce waste, chemicals and heat more rapidly. What does heart rate, how does heart rate demonstrate regulation/homeostasis in the body? I've got three hands up. I didn't see the order. I'm sorry. So, I'm going to go four or five hands up. I got one, maybe two, I don't know, Gabby, three, go ahead. Richie, if someone leaves something out, it's yours.\n When you're exercising, like, you're using more nutrients and oxygen so the blood has to carry more nutrients at a faster rate so your muscles get it. It does that to maintain homeostasis. So, it's, like, using it constantly.\n Okay. Daryl? She did a good job. I'm going to change the question for you. What if your body didn't do that? What if you're running up and down the stairs, Daryl, and your heart rate didn't increase?\n It would have a hard time maintaining homeostasis.\n Okay. Excellent. And what would happen? What do you think?\n You'd be dehydrated and wouldn't sweat or anything.\n Well, I don't know if you'd be dehydrated.\n You wouldn't get as much oxygen because it wouldn't be working as fast and you wouldn't be like... So, it might get stuck in there while you're running up and down...\n", "filename": ["Copy of 094 SCIEA094.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.0977151], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW05", "TW06", "TW07", "TW09", "TW18", "TW19"]}, "096": {"text": " Welcome to our kindergarten classroom.

You guys were all talking about the big problem--the calf is stuck in the mud. Help me write that in the problem box. Here we go.\n  The calf is stuck in the mud.\n That's our problem. The calf is stuck in the mud. Let's see what effect this problem is having on the characters in the story. Let's see how they're feeling now. It tells me where to stop to ask you guys questions. \"'Call Fire Chief Douglas and the fire truck!' the farmer shouted. 'They can save our little calf. ' But the sight of the big red fire truck startled the little calf into the mud even deeper. The farmer was fit to be tied. If the farm hands and the big tractor and even Fire Chief Douglas and his fire truck couldn't save the little calf, who could?\" Oh my goodness. Look at everybody. What effect is this problem having on the calf and the farmer and the community? How is everybody feeling? I like Amir's raised hand. How is everybody feeling, Amir?\n They feel sad.\n Sad. I heard you say another good word that started with W...\n Worried.\n Worried. They're sad. They're worried. How else are they feeling? Sad, worried.\n Scared.\n Scared. Scary--what if they can't get her out?\n Scary.\n  ...call a lot of people.\n Yeah. They're in panic mode. They're trying to call everyone. They're panicked. Frightened.\n Afraid.\n Afraid.\n Worried.\n Worried. So, so worried. So, so worried.\n They might call the other tractor.\n The big tractor can't get her out. He already tried. Wait, Kanye, were you talking about the other tractor?\n The red one.\n Oh, they might call Otis. Maybe Otis could help. That might be a good solution to the problem. Let's see what they do. Let's find out. \"Suddenly the little calf's ears perked up. Over the hum of the growling crowd, there came a faint sound in the distance. A soft, rhythmic purr, 'Put, put, puttity, chuck.

He turned and he headed straight for Mud Pond.\" \"Otis put-puffed down the rolling hill and pulled right up next to the muddy waters' edge. The calf heard her friend's puttering purr and bawled. It was almost like, Hello!\u201d She's crying out to Otis. Yeah. She bawled. \"To the sound of his gentle chuck and to the amazement of all the people in the crowd, Otis slowly began to circle the pond. He circled and he circled and the little calf turned and turned, never taking her eye off her friend.\" It looks like they might be solving their problem. \"With each ring Otis made around Mud Pond, the muddy grip loosened until the calf was able to stumble out of the pond on her own. The two friends had found each other again.\" It looks like we found a solution to our problem. Talk to your partner about how they found a solution. How did they solve their problem? \n I heard a lot of good discussion. How did they solve their problem? You guys, I heard everybody talking about it. So, Jabrielle, how did they solve their problem? What was the solution? Who came and got her out of the mud? I heard you tell Isaiah.\n Otis.\n Otis. Ramaya, how did Otis get her out of the mud just like Jabrielle said?\n He rided around the mud...\n Oh, I don't know if you can hear Ramaya. She said Otis rode around Mud Pond and got the calf out of the mud. Help me write that.\n  Otis rode around Mud Pond.\n It was called Mud Pond. Otis rode around Mud Pond.\n  And he got the calf out of the mud.\n That's the solution. Now how is everybody feeling? What effect is this having? How do they feel now that they have their problem solved? Nijyah?\n Excited.\n Excited. Miami? Happy? Sherod.\n Glad.\n Glad. Edward? Yeah. They're feeling great. They're reunited. Their family is back together. Zion? How do you feel when you solve your problem? They are a little exhausted, aren't they? That was a lot of work. Ismail? They're feeling okay. They're feeling relieved. Relieved. Wow. Great job. Let's see how the story ends. Readers, you are really doing a great job paying attention to the problem and the solution of the story. It's really helping us comprehend the story better. We're understanding it really well. \"Otis led the calf right down the dusty road toward the village and everyone threw flowers as they went, following them into town. It looked like a happy parade. No one needed a fancy-- No one needed a fancy blue ribbon to tell them that the calf was a special calf.\" \"Otis was a special tractor. And the two of them were special friends. From that day on, the farmer discovered that with Otis' puttering purr beside the chicken coop, his chickens laid more eggs. At milking time, with Otis' gentle chuck nearby, his cow produced more milk. And on occasion, Otis even got to join the farmer and the big yellow tractor out in the fields. But often, at the end of the day, Otis would just sit with his friend under the apple tree and watch the farmer he loved.\"\n", "filename": ["Copy of 096 LRLAEMC096.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.221763], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["Together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Together"], ["NaN"], ["Together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW05", "TW06", "TW06s", "TW13", "TW18", "TW24", "TW24TW06"]}, "010": {"text": " All right, so we're going to need someone from all the groups to kind of summarize for us.\n Grace?\n Guys, raise your hands. \n So I figured... okay, you guys should .

And you can take your jacket off, and I'm still going to call your color, if it's your color, red. Give me a job that you think might be a non-traditional career. One for a woman. What did you... I mean, you can use the video as an example. You want to think about it?\n Construction worker.\n A construction worker as a woman. My color's red. Yes, sir.\n For a woman or a male?\n It could be for a male or female. Or you can, it doesn't even matter. Skyler.\n For a girl, maybe a football coach.\n For a female, definitely a football coach. If you guys watch Glee,  you see the football coach is a male, a female. And so, yeah. But now, Sakwan, we're going to go with you last, and then I'm going to go to group three.\n Um... for a male, probably a teacher?\n A male as a teacher. Exactly. So let's have Grace... not Grace.\n Alex.\n Alex.\n Mallory. Mallory, do you have a V under your name?\n Yes.\n You're from group three? So let's, let me read yours, and you guys answer. You can stay there. Let me read it, and you guys answer. So group three was, using what you have learned about non-traditional careers, what would you say to someone when they say that a boy can't do a job, or a girl can't? And I will just let you guys read.\n I would say that it doesn't matter if you're a male or a female, as long as you like your job and you can do your job well. Nobody can tell you that you can't do something just because you're a boy or a girl.\n Good. Does anybody disagree with that one? No? Does anybody agree with that statement? Okay. All right. Sakwan, come up, do, you guys are going to do number four, and we're going to move to the next activity.\n Our question is, what plans do we have for being successful in schoolwork? We wrote, do your homework, follow directions, paying attention, being respectful, good grades and not shouting loud. And the  oh yeah. And don't have some, like, yelling or, like, stealing things, like...\n Report cards.\n Yeah, but, no.\n \n Yes.\n Well, we did a couple, like, . Writing is a little challenging. Reading, easy, some books.\n Okay. So they went with the idea of, you know, not too easy, not too hard. Good. Thank you. Now what we're going to do now is we're going to do some research on non-traditional careers. Now, some of you will be where the purple papers are. Some of you will be where the white ones are. And it's just so that you guys will be able to talk about this later and say, okay, this is what I experienced on a policy job, and this is what I experienced on the other one. So everybody point your attention to the front, and I'm going to go through one of the worksheets with you. I'm going to go through the harder worksheet with you, okay? Just point your attention to the front. And I'm going to go through this one with you, because this one is the hardest one, and then all the other ones are the easier ones. Okay, the worksheet that we're going to do today is going to tie in what you guys talked about with careers, subjects. When do you all get report cards?\n We got it yesterday.\n You got them yesterday. What I want you to do is I want you to think about your report card, your favorite subject, whether it be English, math, science, social studies, whether it be PE, art, whatever it is, and I want you to pick from this site. You see this site? It says www.bls.gov/k12/, okay? I want you to pick from that site your, what subject you did the best in, or what your best interest is. There are some of you, I know somebody here likes nature. They will pick nature, and in that job, if it's a boy, he's going to pick a job that he thinks mostly females have. Who thinks they can give me an idea of what job mostly females have? Molly?\n Maybe a veterinarian.\n A veterinarian. Most veterinarians I've seen have been female. So I would go there. And if I was a boy, I would read through this sheet. On this sheet, it has some questions. It says how to get ready. You'll find that tab, and you'll give me a summary of how they get ready for this job. It says what is this job like. You read that, and you'll give me a one or two sentence summary of what the job is like. And it says, are there other jobs like this? That's to the bottom. And you can write those jobs down. Another one says, what about the future? And you'll write a one or two minute summary of that section. Also, we have some reflection questions at the bottom of this worksheet, and the reflection question is, one is, what did I learn about careers? The other one is what's a non-traditional career, and the last one is what did I learn about myself? So make sure you answer all those questions in the worksheet. Now, if I was a girl and I went to nature, what job do you think I would pick Alea? What job do you think most boys have that's over here for nature?\n Zookeeper?\n Maybe a zookeeper. So the object of this is to do research in the area that you find most interesting. Is this what I have to be when I grow up, Mr. Nealy? No. You just have to do research in that area. So the big important part is to have research done in that area, just so that you can explore different jobs. And I think, was it group three that had that question?\n Yeah.\n Group four that had the question about what would you tell somebody? Who had that question?\n Us.\n Group three had that question, and I think you guys gave a pretty convincing argument. Okay, I'm going to tell you who's going to sit at the purple stations. If you're sitting at a purple station, you're going to click yes, you want sound. And your worksheet is already there. And I want us to compare and contrast the different information you get from the two worksheets. Okay, purple station. Skyler, go to a purple station.

That's exactly right. How about within your body? What's something that your body can tell you that you're in that target heart rate range? Yes young lady.\n  Um, the way you breath and how you're feeling.\n Okay good, your breathing, your feeling, some of you want to come in here and work out and then talk about how that your legs startin' to hurt and your thighs are startin' to be sore. All those things are physical ways that your body's sayin', \"Hey, I'm doin' a good job \"in this workout, I'm within my target heart rate range.\" When we do this today, I want you to kind of take a mental picture. Let, take a mental picture of, \"This is how my body feels \"when I'm in my target heart rate range.\" Whether your lower end or higher end, take a mental picture so that when you're out walking or, not walking, but when you're out running or playing soccer or playing basketball or things like that, you can kind of have an idea how you're feelin' with those, with those things, and you can know whether you're close to being in your target heart rate range. Now, one of the last things is, is we filled out that family health history that each of you has there and some of you had some different things on that health history, from heart disease, to high blood pressure, those types of things. The cardio workout that we're doin' today, what areas is that gonna positively impact on that family health history for you? Who knows that? What are some of those areas? Okay, Let's get you there Amy.\n  It'll help prevent heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes.\n Okay, the heart disease, that's exactly right. Good cardio, high blood pressure, it's gonna bring the blood pressure down. Also, diabetes. Along with high blood pressure, you got high cholesterol. All of those areas, cardio, is going to positively impact those areas. Okay? The, yes?\n  What do I need to lose weight?\n Okay, to lose weight. That's a question I get a lot of time. If you want to lose weight, ideally, you want to be in the upper end of your target heart rate range, or about 80%, however, you do actually at about you do burn more cal, fat calories at about 60%, but you're gonna burn more calories at 80% because it's a more intense workout, okay? So really, ideally, you'd want to be within your target heart rate range. Typically, up towards the higher end will be a little better because, if you're gonna be able to burn a few more calories than at the lower end. Okay? Any other questions on anything? All right, we're gonna get started here. You've already got your target heart rates, there. I want you to look here, and I want you to send that text to this poll everywhere to where your target heart rate zone is. What is your zone? And we'll notice this, most of you, you know, we've all figured it out. You'll notice percentage wise where most of you are gonna stand, or where most of you are gonna be in the chart. We start all the way down at 100, go all the way up to above 176. You'll start to see, that, that most likely that 151 to 175, that's gonna be our biggest area here that we're gonna fall into. You can see right there, we're at 75%, So most of you in here, where's our target heart rate range? In between?\n  Between 151 and 175.\n There you go, between 151 and 175. That is right on the money for young adults your age. If you're at that 176 or higher, that's not a problem, but that is an area where, you know, anything over about 185 or so, then it just means that you've got to bring your heart rate up a little bit higher compared to most people. So most people though, again, are gonna be in that 151 to 175. That's a good job. Okay, go ahead and go to your machines here. Lay your clip boards off to the side. If you want to listen to your ipod or to your music, you can, only one ear phone though, only one ear piece. Make sure you put your cell phones up in the cubby there, we'll do something with those a little bit later. And where we're gonna start with here is we're gonna start together. We're gonna start with a two minute workout. On this workout, two minute warm-up. All we're gonna do is get warmed up. You need to be out on the bike, somewhere around 40 rpms. Ellipticals, about the same thing, 35 to 40 rpms. On the treadmills, around three speed will be a good, good place to start with. Is everybody good, we ready to go?\n  Yes. Are we good back there? You all set? Okay, all right, here we go. Startin' on two minutes. And start. All right so make sure that we got those magnets on there. Bump that up to about three or so. Just to get warmed up.  This is just gonna get your heart rate up a little bit. Now at the end of this warm up, we're gonna check where your heart rate is, we're gonna check that and you'll notice it will be a little bit elevated compared to, compared to, you know, what it was for a resting heart rate. You most likely will not be though, in your target heart rate zone, right here after this warm up.  About halfway through. Good job. Anytime you work folks, you should always do a warm up. Now we've already stretched and done some, a little bit of jogging down there in the gym before we came up here. So you've got some warm up but anytime you go to a fitness room, you want to make sure that you do a little bit of warm up. Don't jump right in to it. You're gonna have a tendency to pull some muscles and have a lot more soreness and injury risk, for you. Good job, everybody doin' good?\n  Yes.\n As we do this, I'm gonna come along and ask you where you are on your RPE chart periodically, 'Cause I want to know how your body's feeling. Just kind of look at that and gauge where ever you are. Okay? Let's go ahead and get a heart rate check, here. Real quick, put your hands on the sensors, let's get that heart rate checked. As soon as you get that heart rate check, go ahead and stop your machine, hop off and we're gonna record that under heart rate one, real quick, under the warm up. Okay, stop your machine there. Record that heart rate.  As soon as we get this, go ahead lay those back off to the side, we're gonna hop back over here and we're gonna start goin' through the workout. Now the workout's gonna be 10 minutes. Again, bikes, you outta be pumpin' out about 80 to 85, of your RPMs there. Ellipticals, probably somewhere between 70 and 75. We really want to try to push this so at the five minute mark you're within that target heart rate zone. Anybody right now in their target heart rate zone?\n  No.\n No? A little bit elevated from the resting though?\n  Yes.\n Okay, all right. Let's go ahead and start.  At the five minute mark, we will check it again and we will check that heart rate, what your heart rate is. We won't get off the machines again until the work out's over.  Caroline?\n  Now again, on your own, once we get into this a couple minutes, on your own, if you want to kind of gauge where you are and check those sensors, you're more than welcome to do that. You just don't want to do it the whole time you're working out, and that'll kind of give you an idea where you're standing. If you need, if you're below your lower end of that target heart rate, go ahead and bump up the resistance a little bit, if that's the case, as we continue on through this.\n  Are you all doin' good? Where are we on the chart? At 3? That's good.  You all could do this for an hour, huh? There you go.  How you doin' over there? Where are you on your chart?\n Two.\n That's good.\n Three.\n Three.\n Two.\n I'd say around two.\n Two.\n Two. Ladies, how we doin' over here? How you feelin' on your chart?\n  Three.\n Three?\n Yeah.\n You good, Russell?\n Yeah.\n Okay. Andy, how you feelin? Where are you, on your chart? About four? How do you feel, good? Where are you on your chart? Doin' good. Most of you, you're all about a two, three, four range right now. Now we're just getting to the start of the work out, but here in a few minutes, that's probably gonna change. Might be changing right now. Probably startin' to feel a little bit of fatigue, breathing's becoming a little bit more difficult. We're gonna do a heart rate check in two minutes. Again, remember, I want you, mental picture in your mind, \"How is my body feeling when I'm in \"that target heart rate range?\" Doing a good job, good job.  Okay we got one more minute and we're gonna get a heart rate check, here.\n  If you're feelin' like your in that 4 to 6 range, you might be able to go ahead and up your, up your intensity just a little bit there, up your speed maybe, up your resistance a little bit. Russell, did you forget to put your phone on vibrate?\n Yeah.\n That's all right, buddy. Just don't mess with it while you're on the bike, okay? I mean while you're on the treadmill.\n Okay.\n Okay, hard to do, hard to do anything with a phone while you're running. All right, let's go ahead and get a heart rate check here. Get a quick check. Remember what this number is. This is gonna be heart rate number two on your chart. We want to be within that range now. If you're not, we need to up your resistance. If you're at the lower end, I want to try to get on up towards the higher end, about that 80% mark. So if that's the case, bump your speed a little bit, up your resistance if you need to. We're gonna get one more check here in about four and a half minutes. \n About 65, I'm in my range.\n Nice, nice.  Where are you on your RPE chart?\n Uh, about four.\n About four? Four or five?  Hey, anytime, you know if you're saying, \"God, I just can't get my heart rate up there,\" if you're on the treadmill, increase that elevation a little bit. Elliptical, if you increase the resistance, then you'll start to feel it. How's Callie back here? She's startin' to get it right now, aren't ya?  How are you all on your chart? Five or six? Where are you all on your chart?\n  Five.\n  Five?\n  Six.\n  Where are you guys on your chart?\n  probably around four.\n Ladies how we doin'? Where are you on your chart?\n  About six.\n  Six?\n  Yes.\n  How are you, Russell?\n  Six, seven.\n How about you?\n  Six.\n  Six?\n  Dale, where are you?\n  Three, four.\n  Three, four? You need to increase your resistance, I mean your elevation a little bit. How about you?\n  Four?\n Four.\n Most of you are comin' up on that chart. Comin' up! Okay, we're gettin' ready to do another check here. Good. A couple more minutes here. Everybody doing okay?\n  Yup.\n Are you startin' to feel some of the signs we talked about, fatigue in the legs?\n  Yes.\n I know it's hard to talk right now. A little more difficult breathing.\n  Startin' to feel it a little bit more now, aren't you?\n  yeah, a little bit. \n  How's it going back here? My legs are like rubber . So now you know, you just got increase that resistance a little bit and keep it at the same RPMs.\n One mile, Kyle.\n  Okay, in thirty seconds here, we're gonna get a heart rate check. Then we're going into the cool down. You really push it right here. You're about to jump off the elliptical, aren't you? Good. Okay, let's get a heart rate check here. Heart rate check. Grab those sensors. Remember this number. When you get this number, when you've got this, go ahead and bring your speed on down.  We're goin' into the cool down phase. Make sure you remember what that number was.\n  What was your heart rate?\n  Uh, 170.\n  I'm about 169. \n  In your cool down phase now. There you go, good good. Did we get in there, in your range, in your range? Everybody in your range? Great, good job. Did you stay in heart rate range? Good. Now did anybody on that RPE chart ever feel like you got up to about an eight or a nine?\n  Yes.\n  You did?\n  Yes. Up there? All right. Did ya'll get in your range?\n  Yup.\n  Did you get within your range? Was ya'll on your upper end or towards the lower end?\n  Upper end.\n Tried to go up. How about you guys? Did you get in your range there?\n  Yeah.\n  Yeah. Now, here in about 45 more seconds, we're gonna get our last check here, on the cool down. You'll notice how quickly as you do this, you'll be able to tell a major difference from the last check that you did during the workout, and even after this two minute cool down here, the difference  between where that heart rate drops to. Are ya'll okay? Okay, let's go ahead and get that last heart rate check.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 128 PE EAYA 128edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.179052], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Amy"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["teacher"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["Russell"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["teacher"], ["Dale"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["teacher", "teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW05", "TW16"]}, "131": {"text": "  Inner circle number two. Again, this was a question that was asked in a multitude of ways and this is where we're going with this: Why did the accident happen? The accident of May 10th, 1996. Why did it happen? Any questions?\n \n Yes, the May 10th, 1996, thank you for clarifying, where everybody died, well not everybody, but a lot of people died. Why did it happen?\n  Because...  \n Okay, so, I think the reason the accident happened was maybe those people just weren't prepared for for the climb. They thought it was going to be they're just going to go up with a guide and some other people they were just going to go to the top and come back down and it was gonna be an easy thing and they didn't expect the challenges that they were going to face.\n  I agree. They probably thought it was gonna be a walk in the park. Turns out that they weren't ready and it was no cake walk and it turned out that some of them it was their last day on the mountain.\n  You were talking about they weren't prepared and all that. But they also said that the guide had never been through a storm like that and that that wasn't normal. And I was kind of taken aback by that, because I was like, if there's a guide who's going to be guiding me on a life-threatening thing I would want them to be, seasoned trainer you know...\n  Exactly, I would think the same thing. That the guide should be prepared for that kind of storm unlike how he was and it turned out fatally for the rest of the crew.\n  I agree with all of you, but during reading the article, Krakauer also mentioned that he said that it wasn't really anyone's fault... because people were so... not in their right minds. They were tired and injuries and how thin the air was, they couldn't breath very well So when they looked at the sky and saw the storm coming,  they didn't expect it to be as bas as it was, so nobody could really prevent it. Anything to add to that? \n I agree, and I think that they were just having so much fun that they weren't really paying attention. \n  I think that they would've all been prepared if they had been watching the clouds...  \n  I know you mentioned the clouds but why weren't they watching them? Why do you think they weren't watching them?\n  ...they didn't think that they were actually serious enough to actually \n  I agree with Matt, that they were so... they wanted to get to the top so much they weren't too worried about looking at the clouds, 'Oh okay, we can make it back up and  make it back down, maybe before.' Not expecting  trouble along the way. \n  Yeah I agree. I think that they weren't really prepared. They were too wrapped up in what was going on to think  about the downfall and what was happening. They're tired and probably weak, they didn't have safe... they weren't really all there to think  about what are the consequences of this and what would happen. Like the guide, if it were me,   I would have made sure they had this... that you're  gonna help me out more than not really being able to.\n  Anything you wanna say, Krystin?\n  Well, I said that this quote at the top it says that, \"Ambition has a steep price.\" And I think part of like how you guys were talking about how like the guides weren't too prepared and weren't qualified but, I think that, well and the author mentions this too, that climbing this mountian is... it's taking a risk and your ambition for going up this mountain already when  you're putting your life on the line, there's nothing really anybody can do to tell you the qualifications that you have to have to survive, it's just basically putting your life to chance, and so... that's what I really got  out of it... what do you think?\n  I agree, I think that , then  not as many people would've died. They should just listen  to what they're told and and not risk their lives  to do something that .\n  I agree with that No, but I think that what Krystin said makes a lot of sense that people were just too tired and \n  I agree but I think it's understandable because just the thought of climbing the biggest mountain in the world is extremely... cool. and I would definitely want to go up there soon as possible, and not worry about the weather, like go all in or don't go at all\n  I agree with   lost or injured I mean but I'm like half way there  go ahead and accomplish what I set out to do and I think that  would've caused anybody to not really notice the weather and the risks involved in what we're doing. \n  I agree with what Ellie said a little while ago heard they should have turned around, but they probably thought that this was going to be probably what could have been a once in a lifetime chance to be at Mount Everest I mean it says that they caught about  safely but they should have have taken it more serious and not kept going risking their life... \n  One thing I noticed is that they relied a lot on each other but they didn't go back and check themselves and I didn't understand why they didn't go back and and like, when the one guy says, \"there's no oxygen here, there's no full tanks.\" Why didn't they go back and check that themselves? I mean I would trust that person but yet again, if my life on the line. I would be checking it. Does anyone else think the same way? \n  If my life were at risk, I wouldn't be relying too much on other\n  If my life were at risk, I wouldn't be relying too much on other people. I'd be a little weary about something like that.\n  I don't so much disagree but I came up with something a little bit different. I didn't really think that people relied on each other that much at all. Who knows if all the deaths that happened could have been prevented but people were too tired or too injured or, there was always something and everybody was more concerned about getting themselves down the mountain. In a way I would say that it was selfish mission but in another way... I mean if it was my own life, I would be out for myself rather than trying to help somebody else and I think we saw that, at least I saw that a lot happen throughout the story. It's a choice between am I going to help that person and risk my life and they might not really pull through this, does it matter? Or am I going to get down this mountain and survive?\n  Some people were relying on others, like at the end, someone was trying to help  was trying to help , he tried to help her down,  she grabbed his arm, and he tried to pull her down. But she just let go and died. \n  I agree with Erin too. I mean I think that right now wouldn't be able to. You would think about yourself more. Whenever you're out there and and you're with the same people for that long of a time, and you're doing the same thing, that you become  sort of closer... They would mean more to you then than they do right now. You'd be more willing to sacrifice something, to survive, to help them give them another chance to get out alive too. \n That's definitely shown at the end of the article when he's  talking about how he can't live a day without thinking about the lives of those people that he was so close to that were lost  and how he couldn't even come to grips with their deaths for a very long time.\n  I agree with Erin, I think there was a lot of, at the end, I think he was talking about the  there  was a lot of blame involved and why couldn't we prevent this, and it brings me back to what you guys said, I think they really wanted to help each other and I think that they wanted to do something but there was nothing that could be done in some cases. I thought it was kind of sad actually dealing with that kind of grief where you couldn't prevent someone's terrible death. \n  Tyler, what do you think about this? Like did he grieve, or even just the fact that... who they were  relying on.\n  Well, what strikes me   \n  All right, outer circle, what'd you notice? What'd you notice?\n  I noticed that people were   and books and just kind of in inner circle and I felt  that that really helped them to get the instructions.\n  Okay. Blake, what did you notice?\n I just thought that it was more and more, like Erin really led the conversation and Krystin really led the conversation and I think that those were like the two main ones, but like Levi and  Elliot and Alex, they all also communicated a lot but there wasn't just one person who was talking. \n  Okay, so there were definitely two leaders, but there were other people that were contributing as they went along. Okay, good. Anthony.\n  There were some well-developed conversations.\n  Well-developed conversations, what do you mean by that?\n Like Erin would say something and someone would build on it, then someone else would and then another topic and new questions and another topic. \n  Yeah, did you notice- what was the question  they started with?\n  Yeah, we got a little off-topic.\n  No you didn't. What, what was the question  you started with? What caused the disaster? And then you went into something totally different but, did you have good conversation about that? Absolutely! You guys really started focusing in on that life and death and relying on somebody else for your own life. Okay, I really like how-- I mean it wasn't like you were talking about cookies and then all of a sudden you were talking about climbing Mount Everest. It was definitely very connected to what you were saying. Dorothy, what'd you notice?\n I noticed the conversation just kept going and it didn't stop or anything it just kept going from one thing to another.\n  Right it kept bouncing from one thing to another. You could see, like steam coming out of your ears, they were all impulsive. Blake?\n I thought that also, remember Erin said, \"you're relying on someone,\" and Krystin's like, \"well I don't agree.\" backed up Erin and other people backed up Krystin and there was people who didn't \n  Yeah. Is it okay to disagree with the people that are sitting around you? Absolutely! But you need to do it respectfully. Like Krystin did. Krystin said, \"I don't exactly agree with you Erin.\"\" then she proceeded to say, 'Why?'  And Levi was over here, he was nodding his head and shaking, 'yeah.' All right, great.\n  I thought they did a good job of not having any dramatic pauses, they always had something, someone would pass on to someone else \n  They paused occasionally but it was not pregnated pauses. You guys ever heard that before? It wasn't a pregnant pause, it wasn't a big spacey gap, okay, Anthony?\n  Pretty much everyone talked\n  Pretty much everyone talked. Yeah, pretty much.\n \n  Yeah, did you notice that? They built on to what other people were saying, okay? They agreed, I still heard I agree a lot; but then they told us why they agree with what they said. All right? Anything else you guys noticed? Yes?\n I think that we looked at our  more, because they  had wider subject that they talked about. Eventually it became narrowed down that is was kind of like you have to look for specific details. It wasn't the whole story, it was more like a paragraph or two and so you need specifics to deal with that.\n  All right. Anything else?\n", "filename": ["Copy of 131 ELA AYA 131.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.15289], "annotations": [["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible", "inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Krystin"], ["inaudible", "inaudible"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible", "inaudible"], ["inaudible", "inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible", "inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["Instructor"], ["inaudible", "inaudible"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["Anthony"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["inaudible"], ["Instructor"], ["inaudible"], ["Instructor"], ["Anthony"], ["Instructor"], ["inaudible"], ["Instructor"], ["inaudible"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW08", "TW15", "TW24TW08"]}, "137": {"text": "  At the end of class, I want you to be able to explain how to swing the bat faster so the ball will travel further. Because the faster the bat goes, the further the ball's gonna go. And there's three things that we're going to do to make the bat swing faster. Okay, we're going to hold the bat at the end to make it longer. We're gonna hold the end to make it longer. A longer bat means a faster bat. We're gonna use more body parts or muscle when we swing and we're gonna apply more time to our swing by stepping into the swing. And we're learning to bat so that we can play more and more fun games in order to stay healthy. Because there's lots of fun batting games you can play with your friends here at school and outside of school that will help you have a healthy heart and muscles. And we're gonna do four different things today. I'm gonna ask you to talk to a partner, I'm gonna do a little experiment, we're gonna play spotlight tag, and then we're gonna have some personal practice. And I've created a little healthy a little helping worksheet for you that shows you what it looks like. Now all these things will help you know and help you be able to explain how to swing the bat faster. I want you to turn to a partner and tell them as many things, of as many games that you can that use swinging a bat or an impement. Go ahead. \n  Hey everybody, let me  get your attention. If I pull your stick, I want you to tell us a game or an activity that you can do that requires using a bat or an implement to hit a ball or something. We're green? No, we're red. Jeremiah, where's Jeremiah? Yes?\n  Softball.\n  Softball, very good. Raquel, where's Raquel? What, Raquel? Game or something you can play.\n  \n  Do we use a bat to play soccer?\n  No.\n  No. How about...Stephanie? Baseball? Who said golf, what about golf? What about ping pong? Do you know what ping pong is?  Yeah! So all of these activities are things that we can play once we learn how to swing a bat. Now, we're gonna go around the blue house, and you're gonna sit on the red dot until I say go, and I'm gonna do a little experiment to show you how these things can make the ball go further. I would like you to walk, please be careful. Go. \n  Okay, thank you for sitting. Now over there I said the longer the bat, the faster it goes. The faster the bat, the further the ball goes. So I'm gonna show you what I mean. Is this a very long bat?\n  No.\n  No, so I'm gonna swing and see how far it goes. \n  Did it go very far?\n  No.\n  Now I'm gonna make that longer. Who thinks it's gonna go further? Let's see if it goes further.  \n  It went a little bit further, huh?\n  Yes.\n  Now, by holding the bat at the end it'll make it longer and it'll go further. Now another way we make the bat go faster is by using more body parts and muscles. So I'm only gonna use a couple muscles here to swing the bat. You think this will this go very far?\n  Yeah.\n  Yeah? Okay, let's see.\n  No.\n  I didn't use a lot of muscle. Now I'm gonna use lots of muscles on this step, and I'm gonna twist,  see how far it goes. \n  Do it again, do a lot of muscle.\n  Anyone know of any other way we can make the bat go faster? Hit from the bottom?  I had it written over there. Does anyone else remember? I want to make my bat longer, I want to use lots of muscles, and.... Alex?\n  .\n  That's how we use lots of muscles. I want to swing the bat for as long as I can in order to generate speed. Now, if I start my bat right here and I swing it, do I have lots of time to hit the ball?\n  No.\n  Do you think it'll go far? Let's see what happens. \n  Now, if I start way back  here, do you think I'll have more time?\n  Yeah.\n  You think it'll go further?\n  Yeah.\n  All right, let's see. \n  So, raise your hand if  you want to hit the ball far? Hitting the ball far will help you be successful, and if you're successful, you're going to have a good time. But today we're going to learn different  ways to hit the ball further by making our bat go fast.\n  Don't swing; please tell me.\n  \n  It makes the bat go faster. Why does the bat go faster?\n  .\n  The bat goes faster, the ball goes faster. But what makes the bat go faster, because it's short or long?\n  \n  Long. Longer bat means faster. Okay, rotate! Rotate! \n Dominant hand on top. Step, twist. We're practicing what grip is the best. \n  How'd that one go?  Fernanda, what grip are you using?\n  Mr. Holden, can I go to the bathroom?\n  Hurry. \n  Excellent twisting, Derek, excellent twisting! \n  What number are you going to read it? \n  Try this one: hold  your bat with your hands apart. Put your left hand on top. I mean your right hand on the top. Left hand at the bottom. Spread your hands apart like this. Now try it again. How did that go? Is that one good? You think so? Now hold it at the end, see what happens. It's right here. \n  Now hold your hands, put your right hand on the top. Right hand on the top, your right hand on top.  All right, Fernanda. Big step, let's see it. Big step, twist your whole body. Get your bat back, there you go. Try it again. Did the ball go further that time?  \n Okay, sit behind your  little cone and answer  the question on your card. Alright, now read it out loud for me.   Which grip do you think makes the bat swing fastest? Holding it at the end? Remember when we talked about how long the bat is? A longer bat can travel faster or slower?\n  \n  Faster, so when you hold it  at the end it makes it longer, and then you can swing it faster, and then the ball goes further. Is that what happened?\n  Yeah.\n  All right, rotate. \n  Alright, are you going to twist or not twist? \n  Back foot, step. Put your weight on your front foot. \n  Alright, so pretend your feet  are stuck in mud, so you can't move them.\n  So we've been learning all the different ways we can make the bat go faster so that we can hit the ball far, because when we hit the ball far, our game and when we're batting is more enjoyable. We've practiced, we've talked about, and we've discussed three different ways to make the bat go faster so that the ball will travel further. When we're batting, okay? I have a sentence frame for you, it says: \"I can blank to make the bat go faster \"so the ball will go further.\" Okay, you're in your batting team groups right now. When I say go, I want you to use this sentence frame and discuss the three different ways you can make the bat go faster so the ball will travel further. And then I'm gonna pull our sticks, and you'll get to share with the entire class how you think you can make the bat go faster. So now is your time to use all of the intelligence and brains of your group to figure out your three answers. Are there any questions?\n  No.\n  Okay, I'm gonna give you about two minutes. Use the sentence frame, discuss with your group. Go ahead.  Alright, how is your group doing? Jesse, you getting to share? I might pick your stick. Talk with Alex. What are we coming up with Jeremiah? How are we gonna make the bat go faster? Do you remember?\n Okay, how about Alex. Why do we twist, Alex? Alex, why do we twist? Alex, sit up, please. When we twist, we use more what?\n  Muscles!\n  What color were we? Black or green?\n  Red!\n  Oh, we were red? Okay second grade, eyes on me, please. Sit down on a number. You've had a nice opportunity to talk with your group to figure out the three ways we can make the bat go faster. If I pick your name, please stand up, speak nice and loud and use the sentence frame, and tell us one way we can make the bat go faster. Let's see here... Jonathan. All right, Jonathan, stand up buddy. Jonathan, use the sentence frame, \"I can.\"\n  \n  I can hold the bat at the end to make the bat go faster so the ball will go further. Good answer, give him a round of applause.  When we have a longer bat, it generates more speed, and more speed with the bat makes the ball go further. Now there are two other ways you can make the bat go faster.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 137 PE EMC 137 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.112686], "annotations": [["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Jeremiah"], ["Teacher"], ["Raquel"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher", "Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Alex"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher", "Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Jonathan"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW05", "TW06", "TW11", "TW13", "TW17", "TW18", "TW20", "TW21", "TW24TW06"]}, "135": {"text": "  Well, you know what, especially after Mrs. Bennett taught you the three things she wanted you to do in reading by having you look around the room, and skip around the room, and flip on the carpet, we thought, \"Oh boy, that Nathan really \"needs to do something hands-on.\" And I know from you being in Reading Recovery that when you heard a book twice you practically knew it. I mean, you knew the story. You could go somewhere and tell it, right?\n  Yep.\n  When you read the book is it easy for you to retell it? What is it like to retell a story that you just read?\n  Not so easy for me,  'cause I had to pick up a book, look at it for a minute and then I pop it and then I know it.\n  Okay, if I read a  story to you would you be able to go tell it to someone else?\n  Yes.\n  Okay.\n  But right next to me.\n  Okay.\n  Okay.\n  All right, well these  are the things we're gonna practice. And because we don't want to leave out the visual style of learning because it's also an important way to get information, we're gonna focus on the auditory and the kinestetic, the hearing and the hands-on type learning, and we're also gonna include some visual so that it will strengthen that part for you. But we wanna make sure we're getting you where your strength is. Because you are fantastic at listening and doing hands-on activities. Oh, you have a plan in your mind about what kind of castle you're gonna build?\n  It's not a castle. It's gonna be like when I see that in movies. Like a tower like where the Egypt, Egyptites.\n  The Egyptians?\n  Yeah.\n  Like a pyramid?\n  Yeah.\n  Okay, cool. All right. Would you like some extra things, like maybe some games or some extra things you can do to help you remember in class?\n  Yeah because my teacher she gives us free games, like learning games, in our math book. There's math games and you have to put your thing on it and you have to guess who much it is. And if you get it right you stay on there.\n  Okay, cool. Well I want to add some games like that that you're gonna-- And we're gonna add some things that you can do to help you remember directions in class and remember what Miss Smithson has asked you to do. 'Cause one of the things that I've noticed is that when Miss Smithson gives you two or three directions, you'll start one and then you forget what the other ones are. And you're like, \"Ugh, what do I do now?\"\n  Yeah because my  brain it has so much stuff and because if I get more it kind of breaks the other stuff.\n  And you know, I wasn't gonna talk about this yet but by you saying that, your brain has so much stuff, I wanted to remind you about, do you know what good listening looks like?\n  Uh, huh.\n  What do good listeners look like?\n  Their hands are crisscrossed with their hands in their lap and wherever the teacher goes they keep their eyes on 'em.\n  Okay, and then if you have a comment, if I say, \"Would anyone like to ask a question \"or make a comment about what we're learning?\" Let's say I just taught you about Clemson Football.\n  Or I like hockey. That's my favorite.\n  Okay, let's say we were learning about hockey. The equipment used in hockey, okay? So if I asked you to either ask me a question or make a comment about what we're learning, would you tell me the names of some of the hockey equipment that you know of? Or would you ask me a question about a piece of hockey equipment that you've seen but you don't know what it's called? Or would you tell me a story about how you really like hockey?\n  Hmmm, how I really like hockey.\n  I knew you'd say that! You always do that! You remember one of things that Miss McGinnis taught you in Reading Recovery? And one of the strengths, this is what I love about you, one of the things that a lot of people have trouble with when they're reading is that they can't relate what they're reading to themselves or to their lives. You are absolutely fantastic with that. Fantastic.\n  If there's a story of a dog and I have a dog and my dog did the same thing.\n  Right. So since you're so good at that, though, sometimes I think that that is one of the things that gets your mind off on... on... \"Hey my dog did that.\" Instead of on exactly what your teacher's wanting you to do. So one of the things about being a really good listener is to remember what comments, and what statements and what questions are necessary for what you're learning. And which comments and questions should wait for later, even though they're zinging around in your head, okay? So if I'm doing a whole class lesson about different colored fur on dogs and I say, \"Can anyone think of a color \"that a dog's fur might be?\" What would be a comment you could make?\n  Black and brown 'cause that's what my dog is made out of.\n  Okay, black and brown. All right, let's say somebody says blonde, somebody else says white and then somebody raises their hand and they say, \"Well, I don't know what all colors dogs can be \"but my dog Sandy is really pretty.\" Is that a comment that is necessary for what we're talking about?\n  No.\n  Okay, so that's one of the things that you can practice. And I love your stories and I know Miss Smithson does, too. And you have a lot of kids and grownups in this school that feel really close to you and we feel like we have a good relationship with you because you do share things about yourself.\n  Yeah, but I only do that at the beginning of the day, the end of the day and at writing. 'Cause I write down the things in writing.\n  Good, well then I'm glad Miss Smithson is also working on this with you because as much as I want to know about you I don't want it to distract you from what it is you're supposed to be thinking about. Okay?\n  Okay.\n  Three more blocks. Okay, let's talk about some of the things that we're gonna put in place for you, okay? A couple of 'em I'm pretty excited about, okay? We're gonna work on your memory with reading and in general with classwork so that when someone tells Nathan what to do, Nathan's gonna be able to remember it. Instead of getting distracted and thinking, \"Huh. \"I have no idea what I'm supposed to do next.\"\n  Yeah because in my class there's some kids, Zachary and Brody and the two new kids, they're talking in the back.\n  And that's can be very distracting, can't it? Okay, do you know how to focus? Do you know how to tune people out? What do you do when you're distracted in the classroom?\n  I just turn around and go like this.\n  Okay, do you think you know how to tune people out without having to tell them to stop? What if you knew they were gonna talk no matter what but you still needed to listen? Could you?\n  I could do this to block their sound.\n  Okay, you could. That kinda reminds me of the bat we were talking about for some reason. It's kinda like you're directing your hearing at one place.\n  And sometimes I push it to what I'm hearing at. So then when I do that in my mouth I can hear it more good without noises from the construction site that's near our house. I can focus on it.\n  Okay, I think that's fantastic what you've just said. You make a conscious effort to focus on what you're trying to hear. That what I want you to do when you notice that other people are talking behind you. Instead of worrying about what they're doing, I want you to focus on what you need to be hearing. I want you to stop and think, \"I'm not gonna listen to them, \"I'm gonna listen to Miss Smithson.\" Okay? And see if that helps. Just like you strain to hear the construction noises, okay? All right, we're gonna do some fun things with you that I think you're gonna like. First of all, I know you love video games. So one of the things that we've tried before that doesn't seem to be working very well is Odyssey. And I know that when you get on Odyssey you like to choose the math games over the reading games. Probably just--Why do you choose math over reading?\n  'Cause I wanna get  more math so then I can just focus on reading 'cause if I'm really smart at math I can just drop it so I know everything.\n  I know sweetheart. It's a lot more fun to do something that you're really good at. So we're gonna change up your computer program. Instead of having you work on Odyssey during the day, instead of Odyssey you're gonna work on a new program called Earobics. And it's supposed to be super helpful with your reading skills. And Mrs. Price, the speech teacher whose office is across the hall, she said it is really fun and that she knew kids at Griggs Road that did it and they loved it, okay? So we're gonna try Earobics. So we're gonna keep a computer game for you but we're gonna try one that hopefully is gonna work better to help your reading skills come up instead of Odyssey. Okay? All right. The next thing we're gonna do is we're gonna give you a little tape recorder. Have you ever had a tape recorder?\n  No and I haven't even seen one.\n  I know, a lot of people don't use tape recorders anymore. Most people can record things on their phone and all kinds of gadgets.\n  Well I had when I  was little I had this little thing and it had a recorder. When I would sing a song into the microphone I could record it and then play it to my friends.\n  Okay, well we're gonna do something like that. We're gonna have you, if Mrs. Smithson is giving directions and then you guys are getting ready to do an assignment or group work or whatever it is she wants you to do, she's gonna come over and she's gonna give the directions to you. You get to press record on your tape recorder and say the directions yourself into the tape recorder. Then you get to stop it and play it back and hear yourself saying the directions. Okay? Unless you need them, we're gonna have you put the little tape recorder away so that it doesn't bother you. Like maybe in a pocket behind your seat or something. And then only if you get stuck and you think, \"Hmm, what did Miss Smithson want me to do?\" can you get out that recorder and listen.\n  Yeah or I can have it recording beside me so I could record everything and if I still remember it, like it's so easy I can remember it, I can just erase it.\n  Okay. But I think the actual act of hearing it whole group with the rest of the kids in your room, hearing it with just Miss Smithson telling it you, saying it again yourself and then hearing what you said, that may be all you need. You may not have to listen to it again. I think just making sure you're really concentrating on what the directions are is gonna be a really good thing for ya. Okay, also, oop. I gotta get something from over here. Okay. One of the other things we might do is maybe Miss Smithson might tell you something, like give you a direction, and she's gonna whisper it in your ear and then you have to whisper it to the person beside you. And they're gonna whisper it to the person beside them and it's gonna go around the table until it gets back to you. How many of you all sit at one group?\n  Five or six. I think it's gonna be five 'cause we got two more kids.\n  Okay, so sometimes Miss Smithson might say, \"Get out your pencil, get out your math book \"and turn to page 50.\" Okay? So then you have to whisper that into the ear of the person beside you. What would you say?\n  \"Get out your pencil and get out your math book \"and turn to page 50.\"\n Okay and then that person would have to whisper it to them. Then it's gonna come all the way around and then the last person's gonna say, \"Get out your pencil, get out your math book \"and turn to page 60.\" Is that right?\n  I'll just turn back to 'em and say, \"It's 50.\"\n  It's 50. Okay, okay. That's another way we might make sure that we understand the directions before we get started.\n  Sometimes my teacher she just writes it on--\n", "filename": ["Copy of 135 SC ECYA 135 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.110302], "annotations": [["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["NaN"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW10", "TW13"]}, "134": {"text": "  Are you gonna have any angles in there that add to 90? No, so you won't have any complementary to worry about.\n  Is that supplementary, though?\n  You will have supplementary. Right. You're not gonna have to worry about the outside. You're just gonna look at your inside. When you measure your angles you'll be able to see supplementary.\n  Yeah.\n  Then kinda go back to those parallel lines cut by a transversal rules to explain why. \n  We're supposed to draw a line?\n  Well I want you to see what's congruent sides. Now, you dont have to measure all your sides because have these, so you've got the same colors, so they're all the same. You're don't have to do angles. Kinda figure out, OK... So they're all 90 degrees. One of yours looks 90. So you know they're 90s. So you got, for the outside of your figure, you got some a little bit easier work.\n  Yeah\n  OK, so you need to explain why things are 90, and what are congruent. And then, you're gonna get a lot more new stuff when you redraw and draw your diagonals in there. Then you'll actually have to measure your diagonals and your angles. So you know a lot about a square to start with.\n  Yeah the equal sides have to be congruent, and certain sides, so write that?\n  Then measure those  angles and segments and see if you can't find some more rules that go with a square.\n  Oh, OK.\n  So yes, your first set of rules for the first page, from here, you know a lot. You know that any point and what they are. You know you have equal sides. Then you don't have to measure these sides because you used the same color. So you can explain it using the colors. So you got a lot you know from the first part. But then when you draw your diagonals here, you're gonna have to measure your pieces. See what happens to these angles. See what happens to these diagonals. And then see if you can't come up with some rules. You're main part here, you know a lot. But now when we do this, this will some of the new.\n  OK.\n  Square is the last  one that we teach. So you will be the last group up there, today. Right, we're trying to get these rules today. You can kinda build upon them so when you hear what these other groups are doing when you get up there.\n  Yeah.\n  There's just three of you.  \n  OK.\n  How you doing?\n  Good.\n  What do you notice  about some of these? Corresponding is what I got here, down here. These are supplementary. Supplementary because they're what type of angles? Help him respond. Well there are options, focus on one. If we were to look at... If I was continuing these lines here they're gonna be same side interior. Obviously yes, so they're not quite supplementary. So you might need to go back and do it again. Sammy knows they need to be supplementary. Same side interior. Somehow your measurements didn't get there. So go back and try to remeasure. You realize you wrote the error. That's good, so you're using some of that previous knowledge and realizing your error. Yeah, so you need what we did on that worksheet the other day. When you measured between 110 and 120 you read the wrong way. You read 122 when it's going this way it's 118. So what you did is you read this way, when you're going this way. You said 122, when it's between 120 and 110. At least your teammates knew that we needed supplementary and worked it.\n  You said it was only off by one degree.\n  Any amount... Then again, to then explain your rules now, what's congruent, what's supplementary, and then explain why, like you were saying same side interior, that's what you'll have. \n  Yes?\n  Do you have Chester Marlin?\n  Yes I do.\n  Please send  him to the office.\n  OK. \n  What you did was perfect.\n  Because they're same side interior.\n  So you would say this...\n  Would you say equal angle one and angle four?\n  That'd be fine,  because you can go ahead and when you're teaching it you can label those angles, and that would be a really good way to do it.\n  So it's like, angle one and angle four are same side interior?\n  Same side interior, so that has to equal 180. OK, bisectors are gonna come when you cut diagonals in there. Your second page, when you redraw the figure. You're gonna draw the diagonals, you're gonna see your diagonals cut each other, you're gonna see if your diagonals cut your angles in half. I'll be to Ashley then at Brandon's group in just a minute. So make sure your congruent sides. You don't have to measure your sides if you use your colors, you can use colors to explain it. So yeah, you're exactly on the right track. Here we're just gonna draw the same figure, draw those diagonals in there, and then we got a little bit-- some more things. You might see bisectors, you might not. Some figures you do and some you don't. All right. OK, it's up to you. I love the way you put your letters there. So you're getting really good with your letters. You can say... Since you only have one angle at each letter, you can say angle J or angle H, however you want to do that.\n  Could we just put supplementary, and draw a little diagonal like that?\n  That'd be fine. Actually, do all these, and you've got your congruent and your angles, then you're gonna redraw the same thing over here, put your diagonals in and measure again. When you put diagonals in, you might see some that bisect the angles, or bisect segments. You might not, but that's what you're looking for.\n  So this is gonna be... \n  Well, the diagonals... We're not gonna draw one of them.\n  Oh, we're not?\n  No, we're just gonna look at our diagonals. Otherwise you're breaking it into two other figures. And that's a possibility, but you don't have to. I love the way that you've lettered it, here. You're using those correct terms, that'll be really good as you go up there. All right, Brandon.\n  What all did we mess up so far?\n  Let's see. Well it's a four sided figure. What should a four sided figure add up to?\n  360.\n  360. Does it?\n  No, it's a little more than 360.\n  So you might need to change things a little bit, to remeasure it, and one of your rules could be you know that they have to add to 360. There's some that I see really right away that's good.\n  It's like 370.\n  OK, so you're gonna try to make it work. You know you need to make it work. You know it's gotta be 360 so measure it a little bit better.\n  Can we just add one here and add two there?\n  Well go ahead and look to see what your actual angles are. But one good thing you see, you see that these angles are the same, which is something you're supposed to come up with, which is good. Now if I was giving this, when you're up there explaining it, you need a way to explain, and I know you said that the two obtuse angles are congruent, and in your picture that's good. But sometimes, let's think for a minute, If I gave you... Write them out. Yeah it may always be the obtuse angle. So here, yeah, that's what I was thinking. If you were to do it this way, the angles that are congruent aren't necessarily the obtuse ones. So what you've found is good, but in your picture it is the obtuse ones, but if you can see as you move that, it doesn't have to be the obtuse ones. Let's look at a way we can describe. You're saying that these two angles are congruent, which is correct, so instead of saying obtuse, how can I explain that these two and not those two. What's the difference between these two angles and those two angles?\n  They're 45 degrees?\n  Well it didn't have to be. It could be 45, it looks 45, if I was to do this it's not.\n  It's the short side's angles.\n  It's where your short sides meet your long sides. So the angles with the non-congruent sides. Or the short sides meet the long angles, that would be perfect. That would be a little better to explain it. And even when you're up there explaining, a good thing to do would be to move your figure to show how it didn't have to be... And normally it's the bigger angles, but it doesn't have to be.\n  Draw diagonals?\n  That's right,  and you're gonna look for all the angles again. When you draw your diagonals, a lot of times you're gonna see bisectors, like segments might bisect each other, they might bisect angles, they might or they might not. So that's what you're looking for when you do that. And then you're gonna kind of come up to...\n  We just draw them like this?\n  Just like that, that's right. Then you'll measure all of those angles, and all of those segments. We won't be able to use the color to show congruent when we draw the diagonals on the inside, because you won't have a piece that matches correctly for your diagonals, so you'll actually have to measure that part with a ruler. But again, you're not as much concerned with the measurement as bisecting it or something else. So that's what you'll do. All right, I'll be right back. Yes?\n  So are we supposed to do this?\n  You don't need the angles that are out there. I mean, you could, but it's not necessary. What should, of course, our figure add up to?\n  The angles inside?\n  Uh huh.\n  360?\n  360. So make sure yours do.\n  What if they don't?\n  So I think, if I was to  look at your measurements, here...\n  I know what I did, I messed up, I wrote these...\n  Good, perfect, that's what I was gonna get to, you read the wrong one and didn't notice. All right, I'll be right back.  How are you doing? So you want to make some general rules.\n  So the top and the bottom sides have to be parallel.\n  I wouldn't really want  to use the words top and bottom, because what if you turn it this way?\n  Yeah, well, A and B sides.\n  Yeah, so you're gonna do that. So you've got your pieces. What do you notice about your angles? You've got the angles that are equal, but what if I was looking for supplementary? Do you have any supplementary angles?\n  A and D ?\n  A and D, so you say A and D are supplementary, what makes them supplementary? What rule do we already know that was why they're supplementary?\n  They add up to 180.\n  Right, they add up to 180, but...\n  Are they same side interior angles?\n  Same side interior angles. So you can say they're 180 because they're same side interior angles. Then what you're gonna do, you're gonna go to this page, you're gonna draw your figure again, but you've got to draw your diagonals, and measure the things. When you draw the diagonals, what you're really looking for is to see, is there anything that cuts in half? Do you bisect any angles or bisect any segments? Some figures do, some figures don't. But that's what you're looking for. So you're gonna redraw it, draw your diagonals, then measure, you'll have more angles to measure. You're actually gonna have to measure your segments because your little angle legs won't match your diagonals correctly. You're gonna have to actually do the measurements. and see. See if the segments are bisected, see if the angles are bisected. That's kind of what you're gonna come up with. It may be, it may not be. Some of the figures do and some don't. OK?\n  I think I understand that.\n  We draw from angles to angles?\n  Yeah, from vertex to vertex, that's right. So make an X in the middle. All right, you're good. Yes?\n  I think we have about everything, and then I think we have the other vertex... Angle bisectors, they bisect the angle number five. All the triangles are isosceles.\n  Wow, that's good, I didn't think you'd get that.  I'm impressed.\n  He did it.\n  Good job.\n  And then, diagonals make a perpendicular.\n  Perfect, what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna give you another sheet, make a bigger square...\n", "filename": ["Copy of 134 MATH AYA 134 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.0452576], "annotations": [["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW05", "TW09", "TW15", "TW22", "TW23", "TW24", "TW24TW17"]}, "218": {"text": " This is a classroom where I push in for language arts.

When we get to a word that tricks us, Put the book flat, Sarah, please We want to go back, and reread, and check and make sure it makes sense. Okay, here's something else I want us to do today with this book, Rascal. I want us to think about what happened in the story today. And we're going to do it this way. I want all eyes up here. We're gonna use this wipe board.\n It's a big wipe board.\n It is, and you have a little one. And you will probably get a chance to use it, too. But first, I'm gonna write on the big one. Okay. The first word up here, Jesus, I'm gonna ask you to help me read it. I'm gonna chunk it because you know the first part of this word\n [Child} Some. Okay, Jesus is gonna help us. Okay, Jesus, go ahead and help me read this word.\n  Some.\n Can you try...\n  body\n Somebody, good job. You see how he broke that into chunks? Do you see that, Jane? Somebody. Let's think about the story. Hands down. I want you to think about the question before you put your hand up. Somebody. Somebody's in the story. Who is the somebody? Who is this story mostly about? Kelly's gonna help us. Kelly, who's this story mostly about? Put your hand down, Sarah.\n  I think is  Josie's taking Rascal to the vet.\n You're right. Josie's taking Rascal to the vet. So who are we talking about in the story? Are we talking mostly about Rascal, or are we talking mostly about the vet? Hands down, let her think. She'll ask for help if she needs it. Who do you think the story's mostly about?\n  Um, Rascal.\n Rascal, I agree. Thumbs up if you agree. Thumbs up if you agree. Sarah, do you agree? I agree, do you agree? You do, I see a thumbs up. Okay? So what did you want to say about the title of the story?\n  Maybe the story was mostly about Rascal because the title.\n Jackie, did you hear what Sarah said? She said, that's some good thinking, Sarah. She said she also knew it was mostly about Rascal because the title was in it. I knew it was mostly about Rascal because I read the story and they talked about Rascal a lot in the story. Rascal. Rascal Okay. Rascal's in the story. Alright. Rascal, now, there's a problem. At the very beginning of the story, and I'm gonna go back in the book and look and see what it is. Sarah, what's a problem in the very beginning of the story?\n  I read the words and it said he didn't want to go in the door to see the vet.\n He didn't want to go to the vet. Why do you think he didn't want to go to the vet, Jackie? How come? Why do you think Rascal didn't want to go to the doctor? Let's listen to what Jackie says.\n  'Cause he's scared.\n He's scared. How did you know that he's scared, Jackie? I agree. How did you know that? \n Because the picture shows he's looking like he's upset or sad. And I like how Sarah said she read in the story, Eddie, she read that he didn't want to go to the vet. Turn the page. I see other things happening. I'm gonna ask you about that in a minute. Okay, so somebody is Rascal. And Rascal, the problem is, he didn't want to go, Rascal didn't want you know what, Kelly, come up here and help me write. 'Cause you can write the rest of what I'm gonna write. Come up here. Didn't, Oh, I'm gonna do the want part. Didn't want. Rereading helps me think about what I want to write. Rascal didn't want what? To go. Can you write to go? Don't forget to space. Rascal didn't want to go to, let's have a bigger space. Rascal didn't want to go to the I like how you're all looking to see. You're good, that's fine. Just keep going. Good, thank you. Rascal didn't want to go to the Who wants to try vet? Sarah you want to try? That's a word we haven't written before. But I know that she can think about the sounds in it, and I bet you she can do it. Good job. Thank you, Sarah. Okay. Rascal didn't want to go to the vet. But, but what? Eddie, but what? He didn't want to go?\n  But He went and he was scaring the animals. Oh my goodness. Rascal didn't want to go to the vet, but he went anyway and scared the animals. Hold on a minute, Jane, 'cause I know you're gonna help me. But he went anyway. Hold on one second, then you can tell me. and scared, should we say, I'm thinking about how this should sound, I'm thinking about what happened in the story. but he went anyway and scared the other animals, or other animals, or the animals? He did scare cats, who else did he scare?\n  the mouse.\n Can I have a quiet hand for someone else? He scared the cat, the mouse. Jackie, who else did he We can always, let Jackie help. Let Jackie help, let's look. Jackie, let's go back and look. And you're looking at the pictures. Jackie's gonna help us. Jackie, I see the cat that Jane said. What other animal do you see in the picture that he scared?\n the parrot and the rabbit. Oh, okay, the parrot and the rabbit. Okay, he went anyway and scared a rabbit, I'm gonna put this mark here 'cause I have a couple things I'm saying. a cat and I don't have room here, so I need to erase this word, so I have room to keep writing. He went anyway and scared a rabbit, a cat, and what's the last thing I need to say, Kelly? And, a what?\n  Parrot.\n Parrot.\n  And I wanted to say\n Okay, what did you want to say?\n  I want to say that I really know about these, I know their names, they call commas.\n You're right., thank you. Kelly helped me because I didn't say what these were called. She reminded us that those are called commas. Thank you, Kelly. Okay, one moment, Jane. I want us to think about the story, and I want us to think about what's happening. Rascal didn't want to go to the vet, but he went anyway and scared a rabbit, a cat, and a parrot. So we have a big problem.\n  we need to find a solution.\n We need to find a solution. What is our solution to the problem? Sarah? Can you sit on your bottom so you don't fall and hurt yourself?\n  my solution is that at the end of the story, right here, he goes in to the vet, so he doesn't scare the other animals.\n  Okay, I like how all of you went back to check the solution, and you went back in the story to help you understand what happened. Jane, I like what Sarah said, and I'm thinking about how I can write that. Sarah was looking at this page, and she saw how he went into the vet, and now he won't scare the other animals. Okay.\n  Can I read this page? Yes, and in fact, Jane wants to read it, and she's gonna, I want all of us to read it with our eyes, because I want us to listen to how that sounds with those dark parts the author said. Go ahead, Jane, are you ready?  I love how that sounded, and I saw you were practicing that, too, Kelly. Let's all practice that to ourselves. The big dog growled, grrrrr. Rascal ran. Jesus, how did she know, How did Jane know to say Rascal ran? How did she know to read it like that?\n  The author wrote it in dark and big.\n He wrote it in dark and big, he sure did. And he said something else, Eddie, that I want you to look at. He wrote it dark and big, and what else did he put there at the end? Remember what that mark's called? It's a big, fancy long word. That's okay, Sarah's gonna help us. This mark, right here, Eddie, is what we're talking about.\n  Comma?\n Nope, but it looks\n  Somebody that's talking.\n Yes, and when they're loud, go ahead, Sarah.\n An exclamation mark.\n Yeah. That word is a very long word and it's new to us Eddie, so we're learning it. Do you wanna try and say it after me? Exclamation mark, yeah. That shows they're excited\n You mean this?\n Yeah.\n Oh, I though you were this.\n Oh, well, no wonder, I was tricking you by accident, I'm so sorry, Eddie. Yes, I was talking about the exclamation mark. Okay, Rascal didn't want to go to the vet, but he went anyway and scared a rabbit, a cat, and a parrot. And so the end of the story should say, that, it's a solution, Sarah was\n He ran into the vet.\n What made him? Why did he run?\n Because he was scared.\n Of what?\n the dog.\n Jesus, did you hear what Sarah said? So let's think about that. But, but he saw a what?\n  Big dog.\n Come over here and help me write. Me and Jesus are gonna write this together. Come on over here, Jesus. Lemme move this out of your way, I'm sorry. Okay, go over here. And turn around so everyone can read, come over by me. But he, you can write the word, he. Go ahead. Write it under here. Thank you. Now I'm gonna help you, give me the marker? Jackie, I need you to look over here, so you can help us if we need it. Go stand over here for a second. But he, oops, he saw, you go ahead a a what? He saw a what? Jackie, he saw a what?\n  A big dog.\n A big dog. And those are words you know, go ahead. Now come down here so we don't go too far up. Dog. Oops, something's tricking you. Go ahead and turn that around. Thank you, go ahead, give me the marker back. Thank you. Hold on. But he saw a big dog and, what happened? What happened, Sarah?\n  He\n  Yeah?\n  ran.\n  And he ran. Okay, come over and help me write that then, please. Come on over, over here. And he ran. Good. Go ahead and sit down. and he ran, where?\n  Into the vet. Okay, I'm gonna just finish this. And he ran in Into is easy because you know both of those parts. And he ran into the into the vet? Or into the vet's? What's that place? Let's put that, office or room. Let's put room. But both of those are good choices.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 218 LRLA EMC 218edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.112497], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Jesus"], ["NaN"], ["Jesus"], ["NaN"], ["Kelly"], ["NaN"], ["Kelly"], ["NaN"], ["Child"], ["NaN"], ["Sarah"], ["NaN"], ["Jackie"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Eddie"], ["Child"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Child"], ["NaN"], ["Kelly"], ["NaN"], ["Kelly"], ["NaN"], ["Child"], ["NaN"], ["Child"], ["Teacher"], ["Jane"], ["Jesus"], ["NaN"], ["Eddie"], ["NaN"], ["Eddie"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Jesus"], ["NaN"], ["Jackie"], ["NaN"], ["Sarah"], ["Teacher"], ["Sarah"], ["Teacher"], ["Sarah"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW06", "TW08", "TW09", "TW13", "TW15"]}, "198": {"text": " That they need to make some sort of a change.\n  Like the turning point?\n Like there's a turning point. There's some kind of change that needs to occur. Do you guys think that most people take that opportunity and then change?\n  No.\n I think some no. In Fahrenheit 451, how some people were assuming that Mildred already knew, but she just didn't want to not like accept it  but not be part of it. She didn't want to be part of the change, she just wanted to be in tune with society.\n She never gave herself an opportunity to have any kind of turning point. \n Even when she had the opportunity, she didn't.\n Right.\n  I think emotion plays a big role in that, too, because Faber let fear get in the way of him doing something, so he basically created that little earpiece thing, so that somebody else could do it for him, and he could watch over somebody that's actually doing it.\n  Another person who's carrying the shoes to go through the turning point is Beatty, because although he had all of the knowledge, much more knowledge than Montag had about society and everything, he chose not to go against it because he believed that if he does it, then what's the point, if he's not going to gain anything out of it.\n  Do you think also because he has all that knowledge, he wants to use it to have power? Since he knows all that, he wants to manipulate, keep them in control, keep them in check and stuff.\n  No, I don't think it's that he wants power, I mean, it's that he's seen the bad side of things, and, like all humans, you don't like to go through something when it has lots of negativity in it. With education, he knows it's good because it helps you think outside of the box, and everything, but it's bad also because then you have two countering opinions on everything. Then you realize that there's genocides, there's slavery, there's wars, there's too much negativity.\n  The government also doesn't want that because it probably gives them ideas of where to go. The more information they know, the more possible ways they can use it against them.\n  I like what you said about the government doing that kind of stuff, because I guess they see it as a way of knowledge makes people--\n  Vulnerable.\n  Vulnerable. It's like if the people were the government's subordinates, so it's not the government's people who they're protecting, it's pretty much who they're in control of.\n  I kind of want to share my opinion on the turning point thing, like in Harrison, and bridge around again. You get to see the emotion, or what George has to go through, but yet he doesn't do anything about it; Harrison does. It says right here, \"His thoughts fled and panicked like bandits from a burglar alarm.\" It's showing you what he has to go through for his thoughts to be taken out of his head, or whatever but Harrison is the one doing the actions. He's the one that wants to go against the government, and George isn't.\n  So, do you think their relationship and the correlation of George and Harrison is just like Montag and Faber's, where Faber doesn't want to do anything, because he didn't want to go to jail in the South? George doesn't want to go to jail because he doesn't want to lighten his own way because he would get, what was it, seven years?\n  Yeah.\n For each sled that he takes out. And Harrison is actually doing stuff. And Montag isn't doing stuff. So, do you think that you need that person, the one behind the scenes doing the stuff, and then a person that's actually doing it, or do you just mean people that actually already in action to a bill?\n I think that you need people who are  I think that you need people who are  but I think that it's easier to  so I think that way is better. So you don't get in trouble  \n  I think the people that have , the people in the front lines are always useful. They are easier to camoflauge  They are the ones with the real plans. These people in the front don't usually come up with them.\n Yeah, but you have the plans and then you don't do it. but what does it matter that you have the plan and you don't know how to use it?\n Well, not every body's that brave. \n That's why you need to...\n  I think people need the support system, like Faber was Montag's support system.\n He had a plan   \n  Don't let him tell you he sees, walk away, walk away. \n  I guess, here's my question. So, in looking at our essay question for our final exam tomorrow, I want you to think... our question is, to what extent should citizens comply with unfair laws, right, created by government? I know I'm asking you to respond with to what extent, should citizens comply with these unfair laws? But we're also talking about so who should act, right? So who should be the one to act out, to lead, to go against the government? Because we're looking at characters who possess the capacity to act out. We're looking at people who have knowledge, who have strength, who are talented. But they're not leaders. And we're also looking at people who may not have those qualities, they have the potential to have those qualities, but need a little bit of encouragement and a little bit of a push. So when we say to what extent should citizens comply, do you guys think that citizens applies to everybody? Or is it limited to a group of people who are willing to make those sacrifices? Do you even think that's fair that it's a small group of people who make the sacrifice for the whole? I want you to think about any types of current or historical events where we've seen a group of people, whether it is a whole group, or just a couple of people who take charge, who lead and impact change. Are there any examples that you can connect to that? Do you think that that's even fair for everyone to benefit from the sacrifice of a small group of people?\n  I see it as a way... every time there's a change, or a law, or something that affects a certain group of people, it's never really based on the whole group of people. Like all citizens. It's more of a target, and when a certain group is attacked or targeted, it makes others not really... I don't want to say care, but it doesn't really matter to them because they're not the ones that are experiencing the negativity of that. Or, yeah... it's just basically it's that group of people who have to, I guess, express their ideas and it may be scary for some people to go along with it and actually carry out what they think is right, but I think it's necessary for a unit. You probably need that one person who spreads the message, and then I think it is very important for other groups of people to go along with it because you never know when it's going to be your turn.\n  So, here's my question because on your AP exam, on your final exam, for your argumentative essays, you have to be able to generate your own examples. So, I know Omar you've got a very clear idea, but does any body have a historical reference or a current event that we can tie that idea to something specific, and that's what you can discuss. Let's see if we have any ideas here about historical or current events that we could really provide as really concrete examples that we could look at because you want to get specific. You want to say, \"hey, let's look at this specific example, where this actually happened.\" Any thoughts on that?\n  Anything with slavery, with Frederick Douglass and the abolitionists in the north. They really felt the need that slavery was needing to be abolished and I guess that's where civil disobedience comes from, is the abolishment of slavery. Well, the need to abolish slavery. That it really wasn't really blacks or Africans, or whatever you called them back then. Wanting to be set free was people that weren't even affected by slavery that wanted them to be set free. And I think that's more important, and more appeals to your emotion because these people have no tie to slavery. They're not benefiting, they're not getting negative from it, so it's like you really think that it's wrong when someone else is not affected by the situation. It's saying that it's wrong.\n  I want to connect to what you just said about to the idea of the mental slavery that's going on right now because I guess maybe not a lot of you are aware, but there's... I don't know if you guys heard something about the green eye? That recently... that's in the past. And I think that's very important because that affects me in a way because many people wanna go to college but I guess the idea of going to college and getting your degree, but then not excelling in what you are supposed to be excelling in. That kind of stops them and discourages them from... to keep going. So I guess that idea is... I don't know, it's kind of opressive because they're trying to maintain you in that little... it's just marginalizing you and yeah, I think it needs more support.\n  So I want you to think about that example because there were a lot of protests, right? People were really protesting that, and there were a lot of these laws that people were standing against, right? And when we look at the questions, to what extent should we comply with unfair laws? If that is an unfair piece of legislation, to what extent do you then choose to protest? How far would you be willing to take it? Because we talked about this, this line between pushing your protest and your form of rebellion. Like look at Harrison, right? Dancing on stage as a ballerina. Doesn't really seem all that tough, right? But, for him, he was taking a big stance, right? Not about borderline violence, right? I want you to look at what Thoreau did. He didn't pay his taxes. He wanted to go to jail. He was happy there. He was like, \"don't bail me out.\" Had nothing to do with violence, right? You hear a lot of people protesting, you know. Issues regarding the DREAM Act, but to what extent should they comply with the laws? Do you use violence? Do you even take it there? Do you use more creative forms of protesting? I want you to consider how far do you take it? How far do you show your protest? What is acceptable, and where do you draw the line?  Good reaction, lots of reaction. Let's hear from people we haven't heard from. I want you to go back and think about your goals that you set. I'm hoping those of you that are a little bit quieter in our discussions, chose goals that might push you to speak up. So let's hear from a few folks that we haven't heard from yet and share the air time. Any volunteer? Jesus, what do you think?\n  Like Omar said, like the DREAM Act, has an ill affect on a lot of people. It doesn't really affect me, but I know a lot of friends that it is affecting. It's not really fair that it really didn't pass, but when we want to try to push something, like Julian said for slavery, it didn't really take... it took such a long time for them to really get the rights. There was the abolishment, there was Frederick Douglass during that time. But as time went, then came Martin Luther King, who was the center person who started the really big move for African Americans to realize their own rights. He lead the protests, marches... if you gather groups of people over time... if you speak up with your voice people will hear. Even people like African Americans, they came and rallied to listen to the idea that everyone being equal. There should be rights and everyone... no matter what color you are. So for Latinos like us, for the , it's such a short time because we just started also trying to pass our rights, but the dream that was once dead, but even though it didn't pass, people should not be put down, like, \"Aw, it didn't pass.\" So they'll just forget you got to stand back right up and get more people and to continue to pass on for your rights, cause if we stay together, anything can happen... If we stay together as one, something will happen.\n  I am hearing two things and we'll get back to Stephanie really quickly I think she's just itching to get in this conversation. I'm hearing two things. One, that it takes a collective group effort. It's not just one person, but it needs to be many people involved. As many people involved And I'm also hearing that it takes a lot of time. So those are a couple of factors that play in to going against unfair laws.\n  That's kind of like right now, that it's kind of more modern because .\n  You think so?\n  no, no, no.\n  I want you take this idea that Omar brought, this idea of mental slavery of oppression, of our intellect, our intelligence. Is that something that you think is just recent? Is that something that's been happening over time? I want you to think about that and see... we might isolate one part of the problem, but I want you to think on a broader scale. Is it really just one isolated event, or is this one in a stream of events? Stephanie, you had something that you were...\n  Yeah, all of them were in the governement, and I was thinking of the movie, \"Milk\". How they have to fight for the rights for equality for homosexuals and what he does is he runs for office in California, and to be heard, which is kind of like civil disobedience in a way. But he does it in a bigger way for them to be heard. One part in the movie that I'll always remember, is when a guy in a wheelchair calls him to tell him that he's gay and all of that. But he just hangs up, but yet he does it for him, most likely because he wants people like that to be heard. And that's kind of what my connection is.\n  I think another historical event besides the slavery and what  you just said is the nine eleven. I think it's the short-term one. It took actually really quick...  the terrorists going up there. It just took one simple idea to tell them, \"Oh, let's just go...\"\n", "filename": ["Copy of 198 ELA AYA 198edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0627699], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW07", "TW08", "TW14", "TW24", "TW24TW07", "TW24TW08"]}, "014 ": {"text": "  Clipart. Okay. You show me ... well, if we wanted to insert a Clipart picture, where do you think would be the best place to go? Click on insert. And then where is Clipart? Here you go. And I bet you we're going to find some really cool spider pictures. Click on spi-- type in spiders and see what you come up with. Hold on, I'll be right over. Yes. Wow, look at all those spiders. You have tons. Oh, your project's gonna be neat 'cause you have all kinds of neat pictures.\n Um... I think something in our computer is off.\n Okay. Let's turn this off. These computers sometimes get a little fussy and it's making bad choices.\n When I get 'em, I just keep pressing enter.\n Well, it's sort of like hitting an elevator button. But you can't really make it go any faster, but you feel a little better about click, click, click, click, click. So, go ahead and look over here. Hopefully that will come up a little faster. Sometimes it just is a little slow. Start with... there you go. You know what to do.\n Okay, there's a big picture.\n That's a huge picture. That's a neat spider. I think that'll be a neat one for your... for your project. Yeah.\n Okay. Um well, when we... when we clicked on the... uh... and it asked if we wanna include pictures from all the ones before...\n Yeah. We did want to do that.\n We did? And we clicked no.\n Okay. So that's probably why. Okay. So let's go onto Clipart office online and you're going to be able to find some really neat pictures here, too. This is the same thing. Type in squirrel. Let's see what we find. Make sure you spell it correctly.\n Q-U-I-R-R-E.\n It's a hard word.\n I-R-R-E.\n And then the color.\n Can I put S?\n Doesn't matter.\n Hit scroll or anything.\n Okay.

You need to accept the service agreement and you'll have to do it again. Yes. Okay. Now, click on your scroll and add it to your clipboard.\n Three times.\n I... I know. Did you copy it to the clipboard? Did you click on it? Okay. Then go back to PowerPoint. Let's see if it works.\n Uh.\n You know how to copy and paste things, so go ahead and paste it in there.\n  Yay.\n He'll move, but not right now. When you go to... make him a little bigger, though, I would say.\n Make him fat.\n Now, you can check to see how he's doing. If you wanna go to your slideshow... and from the beginning and see if he'll move for you. There he goes.\n  Yay.\n See? Now you know he worked.\n Yay.\n Good job.\n, We are entertaining using second person stories. Last time we were together, we started a story here today called Aliens in the Library. You saw that I put my name up here on the line, and it says Aliens in the Library. The introduction page is the part where I underlined those 'you's. Did you notice how these 'you's are underlined over and over again? The reason is because we don't typically write like this. This is kind of unfamiliar for us. We had fun making the beginning of this story. We only wrote half of the story using this graphic organizer. Do we remember why we only wrote half of the story? Why did we only write this side of the story?\n Because that was, like the one story \n Right. There are two main things that you can choose from. If you look up here at the board, everybody should be looking up here, you can see that there are two choices for each one. You have your introduction and you have your two choices. We only did this half of the story, so right now we're going to hide the other half because we're not even thinking about it yet. So the story was that you're in the library, you hear a noise like, what did we say, rats in a blender? And so you go out to investigate what the story was. Now, that's the coolest part about this project guys. The reason we are making our own stories rather than me grabbing the book from a shelf and copying it on here is because we want to use information in our own way. What's that called when you take someone else's information and put it on a piece of paper? What's that called? Who can remember what that's called? What's that called?\n Copyright infringement.\n Copyright infringement, or there's another big 'p' word, too, that we talked about. That's a tough one, do you remember what that one is?\n Plagiarism.\n Plagiarism. And if you take a story of someone else's and stick it on there, it's a problem. And so, when you have a story in your mind you want to make sure that it is your story and your story alone. The best way for me to describe this is, right now for reading team we designed our own t-shirts for a t-shirt contest. Maybe your t-shirt isn't the winning entry, and the team doesn't make your shirt on their shirt. But you go to the competition, and another team from another school district has your shirt design on the front of it. How would you feel about that? How would you feel if someone took your idea and walked around with your shirt on? Your idea, that you came up with your in your own brain? How would that make you feel?\n Kind of angry.\n It would make me feel angry. How about you?\n Sad.\n Sad is another really good word for it. I would be furious, if we used our exciting words for our writing. But I would also be really disappointed. Maybe kind of flattered that someone liked my idea so much they put it on their own shirt, but it's the same thing. Is it wrong to steal someone's bicycle?\n Yes.\n You think it's wrong. Why is it wrong to steal someone's bicycle?\n Because that was just like stealing. You steal without even asking.\n Right. And that would hurt someone's feelings and it's illegal. Is it wrong to steal someone's pencil? Is it wrong to steal someone's pencil? Is it wrong to steal someone's pencil? Why is wrong to steal someone's pencil?\n Because it's their property.\n Because it's their property and it's not yours. So stealing someone's ideas is the same idea. So when you go to write your stories, boys and girls, and the reason we're writing our own stories is because we're making this our own. We're making this our own design. And I think that's really important for us to remember, because the more that you use your own ideas, the better it is for you. You have all these ideas in your heads, and I know you all have wonderful creativity, so we're writing our own stories. We're not taking the story of a TV show you saw last night like SpongeBob and you're not making a SpongeBob story. I want this to be your own idea. So we have Aliens in the Library, and we have our half here. You're a librarian, you hear a strange noise, it sounds like  screeching rats in a blender, what should you do? We decided our two choices were open the door or hide under your desk. If you open the door, you see the cutest little alien standing in the doorway. I think we had a majority of people here, I don't know if everyone here likes the cutest little alien idea, but this is our story and we're sticking with it. It has a big pink bow in her hair, antennae, and a pink polka dot dress. What do you do? You could either invite her in or slam the door in fright. You invite her in. She, surprisingly, speaks your language. She explains that her name is Lott and she became stranded when her spacecraft crashed. She asks if she can come home with you. What do you do? You have two choices here. You can either take her home or find another place for her to stay. Lott is a great house guest, she even helps with the dishes. You're glad you decided to take a chance on making a new intergalactic friend. You guys have seen this before. We made this story, and I'm not going to go over this story again and again, but I wanted to review with you what we talked about because over here, I'm going to show you what the final product is going to look like. This is what the story is going to be made. We did PowerPoint together. You're familiar with PowerPoint. We've done dozens of PowerPoints by now, at least. And so, on our screen here I'm going to open up my document that I made while you were gone, and it is what the PowerPoint is going to look like when you're finished. It is a choose your own adventure PowerPoint. And this is showing that you've mastered the skill of being able to use PowerPoint. You need to show me that you understand how to use this. This is kind of like our, I would say our final exam for PowerPoint so we know we can move onto the next thing, or the next project, the next exciting idea that we're going to do. So while this is loading, you're going to see that there are hyperlinks, and we're going to work on those as well, which will take you to different parts of your document. So up here we have Aliens in the Library by Mrs. Albright. I chose pictures that are graphics from PowerPoint, or from Clipart. The reason I did that is because we own those. I did not take them from the internet and drag them here. What happens if you take them from the internet and drag them here? They're someone else's ideas, remember? They're someone else's pictures. Yes.\n You have to put the date and you have the put the website. We have to, what do we call it? Cite those. But we're not even going to do the citation because this is more about the writing of the project. So we're going to do that instead. My Aliens in the Library. I'm going to show you the start of this, and then you're going to go start writing your own story. So here's my Aliens in the Library story. Now, the best one from this class, the one that we find, or two, that we like the best, we're going to put on my website so the younger students can access these from home, which I think is a really great idea. These are not going to be graphic or bloody. You can have some things happen, but you can't have guts falling out and eyeballs popping out of heads. Okay? Because this is for a young... you have to remember your audience. This is for first and second graders to use in the library when they come. So we are not going to make a big, bloody, messy, gory story. Okay? We're going to make cute little alien stories, apparently. This is what we made last time together... All right. You are a librarian. You stay late one night working on your computer and you hear strange noises coming from the hallway. It sounds like rats in a blender. What should you do? We chose to do open the door. So when I click on the button that says open the door, it should take me to that page. Ta-da. You open a door and you see the cutest little alien standing in the doorway. She has a big pink bow in her hair and antennae, and a purple polka dot dress. What do you do next? We're going to invite her in. If we invite her in, she actually speaks your language. She explains that her name is Lott and she became stranded on Earth when her spaceship crashed. She asks if she can come home with you. What do you do? I want to see what you guys pick for this one. Who wants to pick one? Who wants to pick a direction? What are we going to do, take her home or find her another place to stay?\n Find her another place.\n Find her another place? Let's see what we decided for that part of the story. You hear her shuffle down the hallway. You may have missed the chance of a lifetime to meet an alien, but at least you are safe. The end. Now notice my ends always go back to the beginning. So this is PowerPoint, that you're familiar with, used in a different way. Are there any questions about what we did here? Yes.\n How do you get the green buttons?\n That's what we're going to talk about, and that's a new part of the skill that we're working on, but right now, we're going to just be making these. I'm handing out these. You're going to be in your groups and we're going to start writing our stories. After you're checked and over there, you'll make your PowerPoints, and I'll help you with your hyperlinks individually in your tables.\n Does it...\n I'm sorry, she's talking.\n Does it have to be Aliens in the Library?\n No, no. No, no, no. That's a great question. It can be anything you want. Any kind of story that you're interested in. As long as it is not ...\n Bloody or gory.\n Bloody or gory or ...\n Violent.\n Violent, or, what's the other thing that we just talked about?\n Inappropriate.\n Inappropriate or guts, you guys are really stuck on the guts.\n Copyright.\n Copyrighted by somebody else. I wanted to show you a couple other ones that you can choose when you come for book exchange. One of them looks like this. This is actually a non-fiction choose your own adventure about George Washington crossing the Delaware, and it's about you changing history which I think is a really neat idea. If you're not much of a reader, but you still wanted to read some books, this one is very similar to actually, what we're making here in PowerPoint. It has graphics, it's called a graphic novel, and there are different pieces that look almost like comic books. I have several of these also. I have the newer versions of the old ones that I showed you and read out loud. The ones from 1986, remember I told you how I liked them when I was a kid, a few years ago? This one just has new covers on it, so if you're looking for those. And then this last one, this is a brand new series that I'm hoping to get more on, it's called The Golden Path and it's the same idea, just different characters and a different set of authors that made those. So if you're looking for a choose your own adventure story, and you go to type it in the library catalog, you can type in choose your own adventure. The problem with that is you need to know how to spell adventure.\n A-D-V-E-N-T-U-R-E.\n That's exactly right. Thanks, I wasn't even expecting that. The other thing to remember when we're keeping in mind, I'm going to be coming around to help you with your PowerPoints. Remember, we have to use that rubric, that rubric. Show me that you know what I'm talking about. Which rubric am I talking about? Show me. Show me your papers. Yes. This is the one that you need to do. Also, you can put that down. This other one that I want you to remember, the other thing to keep in mind, is we color coded these and we numbered them. The slides need to go in the order that you need it to be. This is a review of PowerPoint, so this shouldn't be anything new that you haven't seen before. This is kind of our graduation project for PowerPoint so that we can move on to the next project, next time. So we're working with PowerPoint. Who remembers how to insert a text box? What were the directions? We went over this before, and we went over it a couple different times. How do we insert a text box?\n You go to insert, you go over under the text box, click on it, and then you'll drag it and there it is.\n There it is. And how do you make it change color? Does anyone remember how we make it change color? How do we make it change color? We're on insert and text box. And make sure you make one down here. Yep. And then you can type in it, and then you do what with it? That's not wanting to cooperate is it? That's okay. Let's work on this one together. If you click on text box, you make the text box and you start typing in it. Who remembers how we change the color of the text box? That's what we're going to need to be able to do for our buttons and our hyperlinks that we talked about. Who remembers?\n You double-click on the box and it will show up...\n Right. You double click on the box, or sometimes even triple click until you get those three a's at the top, then you can change your color. I'll be around to help you. Are there any questions about this right now? Anyone have anything that they want to talk about before we get started. Every slide has to have a picture. What happens if you do not have a picture that you like from Clipart? What do you do? I want you, I'm encouraging you to use Clipart because it's something that's already there and we don't have to worry about where the source came from. But what do we do if you want to find a different picture somewhere else? What do we do?\n Find your picture.\n You can find your picture under Google images. Then what do we do?\n Then you copy it and then you put it back, and then we copy the source.\n You have to have the source. Very good. Very, very good. Okay. If you would like to have a whole separate slide with sources, you can do that. And we've done that before.\n And the date.\n And the date is very important. I'm glad that you remembered that. Okay, so I'll be around to help you, go ahead and get started back again on your project. Make sure the slides are in order. Do you want to format your designs? You go under design, you two can agree on a color scheme. Do you like that one? That's good. Let's look back at your thing. Let me see which one was number two. That was number three. Click on number two. And it should be, exactly, boys, look at how you did that. You put the words at the top, now I did check the word vial on yours and it's spelled wrong. V-I-A-L. Maybe my writing is hard to read. And then you have the two text boxes here at the bottom. If something gets stuck, can I have you guys be the experts and go over and help them?\n Sure.\n Okay, great. Thanks. Yes.\n Can you help us?\n Sure. What's the problem?\n We can get \n Well this one we want to get rid of. Remember, when you go to do the insert and you insert a new slide, you want to make sure that the layout is the title only. Remember how we talked about that one? So you want to insert the text box. You show me, what do we do? Right. And then what do we do? Okay, so you drag it. What are you typing in there? Okay. So you need how many text boxes then? Exactly. All right, so you go ahead and type in there so you can show me you know what to do with that. Can you click on it and then, use typing? Upstairs. Okay, now you want to, how do we make sure you pull that up? There you go, Are you okay with all the pink?\n I don't care.\n Good. Make sure everyone's input is added, though. Maybe he can help with the graphics. Everyone needs to be able to do something. We have to make sure this is fair for everybody. You're working the mouse, you're working the keyboard and he's holding the paper. Let's maybe switch it up a little bit closer, okay? So everyone has a turn.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 014B LMECYA014B.srt.txt", "Copy of 014A LMECYA014A.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0494019], "annotations": [["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW05", "TW06", "TW16", "TW19", "TW24"]}, "1837": {"text": " Where do I have more potential energy, at position A, or position B, Matt?\n  Position A.\n Why?\n  Because it's fully stopped before it's there, it's already moving a little bit.\n What else? Why does this point here, point A, have more potential energy than point B? So this is A, this is B. Does everyone agree that position A has more potential energy? Raise your hand if you agree with that. Okay. Now who can tell me why, why does position A have more potential energy than position B?\n  It has more potential to do work.\n Why, has potential to do work, yes, why?\n  It has a greater height.\n It has a greater height. Who mentioned gravitational potential energy at the beginning of the class?\n  I did.\n Okay, so going back to GPE. When you have a pendulum swinging back and forth, types of energy that are involved are kinetic energy, and potential energy, specifically. We can say that the potential energy is representing gravitational potential energy. If you focus your attention here. What is that?\n  A pendulum?\n  A pendulum. Similar to what you have here. Actually, you guys within the next week, you'll actually be working with the simulation, it's effect simulation, they're online. They're free for you to use and they're nice because they allow you to play. I know you like to a play a lot.\n  I like to play.\n  Yes, Matt.  You will be working with this, but I just wanted to show you another application of this, just in a different format. When we swing the pendulum what's going to happen?\n  It's gonna move.\n  It's going to move and at point here. And here, let's say A and B, what type of energy is being represented?\n Potential.\n  Potential energy. Who can tell me where kinetic energy is going to be represented? You wanna come up?\n  Sure. Between A and B.\n So every place along the path between A and B. Does everyone agree with Ali?\n  Yes.\n Yes, okay. Where is gravitational potential energy at its max? Wanna go up and point?\n At points A and B.\n Right, so everyone agree on the two ends? Where would kinetic energy be at its max? Where is kinetic energy at its max?\n Right here.\n Why?\n Because it's lowest.\n What else? So we said here, let's label this point C, we already used A and B. Why is kinetic energy at its maximum value at this point here?\n  That's when the potential energy is at its lowest.\n Great, that's where potential energy, the gravitational potential energy, is at its lowest. And if you remember or can recall the kinetic energy formula, what does the formula state? What variables involved in the kinetic energy formula, Matt?\n  Mass and velocity.\n Mass and velocity. What can you infer about the velocity of the pendulum as it's swinging along its path back and forth, from A to B? What can we infer about the kinetic energy?\n  It's terminal velocity is .\n Well, we're not gonna say terminal velocity, the object isn't falling, it's attached. What can we conclude about the velocity at point C, any thoughts? Garrett?\n  Greatest.\n  It's at its greatest. When the pendulum is at this point, it stops at each point A and B, our two end points, it stops for a split second because it has to do what? Maddy, did you say it?\n  Turn around.\n It has to turn around. When it swings back down, what's happening to the velocity? Is it increasing or decreasing? Increasing, so if the velocity is increasing, what's gonna happen to the kinetic energy value? It's also going to increase. Now, if I show you a graphical representation. Who can describe the graphical representation?\n  Like a downward .\n Okay. Ali?\n As it moves I guess it swings back and forth, the kinetic energy when it reaches the middle point, it's the highest and then when it reaches points A and B the potential energy gets highest.\n So does this simulation validate the thoughts and ideas you just came up with?\n  Yes.\n Yes and we see that through the representation of the graphical information of your potential energy and kinetic energy. I can stop it at certain areas. Sometimes it comes out better than others. It is somewhat on its way back, but just note that the kinetic energy is lower than the potential energy. And if I'm really good I can maybe try and get it in the middle. Close enough, it's hard to stop it right in the center. But you notice that the potential energy does what?  Decreases and your kinetic energy will?\n  Increase.\n Increase rather. And you said that the kinetic energy will be at its max at point C. One other factor that's involved here. There is one other type of energy or form of energy that's involved, can anyone think of it? Celini?\n  Thermal.\n Thermal energy.\n  Mechanical?\n Mechanical.\n  Thermal.\n  Thermal. Garrett, you had your hand up.\n  Thermal.\n  Thermal. Who agrees with thermal? Raise your hand.\n  Wait, actually no.\n Is there thermal energy involved in the motion of a pendulum?\n  No.\n That's mechanical. Thermal. If you're saying thermal energy, what form of thermal energy is represented here with the pendulum? What is the pendulum doing right now? It's moving through the?\n Air.\n Air. When objects move through the air, what can occur? Or what is present? Air resistance, which is a form of?\n  Friction.\n  Friction. Is or is not friction an example of heat energy?\n  Is.\n Or thermal energy? Yes, so is it possible for us to have some thermal energy present?\n  Yes.\n  Yes. Now how come it's not showing up on the graph?\n  There's no friction.\n There's no friction. So what I like about this, and like I said, you guys will be using the simulation. And one of the options you have is to change the value for friction. Right now I have no friction so it's not showing up on the grid. So if I increase the friction you're going to see how the value for thermal energy will change. Also, when you apply or work with the simulation, you can actually change the mass of the ball, or the pendulum in the length of the pendulum itself. And those are factors that you will investigate and collect data on in the upcoming days. So let's add some friction. Let's go about halfway. What's happening to the friction?\n  It's increasing.\n  It's increasing on every swing.\n It's increasing with every swing.\n  And the pendulum is not reaching points A and B anymore.\n And the what?\n  It's not reaching points A and B anymore.\n Why, what's happening here, we have all these types of forms of energy, what's happening?\n  The air resistance slowing it down.\n The air resistance could be slowing it down. Want a little more?\n  Falls away.\n Lots of friction, and what's gonna happen? Ali?\n  Losing particles?\n It's not losing particles, I'm not losing any mass. We're not changing the mass, we're not changing the particles if there's a great deal of friction.\n  It's losing energy.\n It slows down. Does it lose energy?  How many of you think it loses energy? Raise your hand. How many of you think otherwise? What happens to the energy that was present? We had colorful bars, Matt said it's colorful. We had colorful bars representing kinetic energy and potential energy. Now we have these great big red bars, representing thermal energy and the total energy is thermal right now. What happened in this simulation? Ali?\n I don't know that, but because in the definition of thermal energy that's the total potential or kinetic energy in an object.\n So there is potential and kinetic energy involved, yes. Steven, you wanna try and help him out?\n  The energy gets transferred to thermal?\n Exactly, the energy gets transferred to thermal energy. What does the word transfer mean? Or transform, what does that mean? You know the movie Transformers? You guys are not too young for that right? I had a Transformer. I did. Jessica.\n  It changes?\n  It changes. If we were to come up with a new concept today explaining what happened, what could we say that we learned about the energies involved? What would be the main concept, the thing you just learned which Steven and Jessica proceeded? What happened to the energies, who can restate what they just stated, Matt? Or maybe give a definition. Energy is?\n  Transferred, but not lost.\n Okay, energy can be transferred or transformed and energy is not lost. So what you learned right now is that energy can be transformed into other forms of energy. Would you agree with that statement? Raise your hand if you agree. And what does the word transform mean?\n Bella?\n  Change.\n  Good, change. So you changed. We began with what kind of energy at this position? Elaine.\n  Potential.\n  Potential. Ailsa, it changed to?\n  Kinetic.\n  Kinetic, it changed to?\n  Potential.\n  Potential. Changed back to?\n Kinetic.\n Kinetic, and we also have some thermal energy involved. Is everyone clear on that concept? What you're going to do with your group, get out a sheet of paper, a piece of scrap paper. Or you could use the back of your packet is fine, there's a blank spot on there. One paper.\n  Per group?\n  Per group.  Okay, what you're going to do. I'm showing you two objects, I brought in props for you guys today. Real life, this is my toaster from home.\n  Aw.\n  Is it a brave little toaster? \n What I want you to do, you have two examples. Stand and look at the fan because it is plugged in, it is turned on, the blades are moving. What I want you to do to these two objects, I want you to write down the forms of energy that you think are involved with these appliances or objects, but what I want you to do is take it a step further. I want you to tell me or place in order, what type of energy do you begin with and then maybe with one to two types of energy or forms of energy that are transformed. So you begin with, you might have a thought, what type of energy do I begin with in order for the toaster to work? What type of energy did the fan begin with in order for it to turn on? And I want you to list the types of forms of energy involved and then put them in the order of transformation. You're gonna get about two to three minutes to do this. I would like every person in the group to participate. You all should be able to share your ideas freely. Respect what other people are saying, and then come to a consensus and write down your idea and your energies. Any questions before you begin? Any questions? Okay. \n See, it like stops here . Like that's potential energy and . \n Well, if you look at the fan, I purposely turned it on. So the blades are doing what? They're moving. Are they doing work? Yes. Base your forms or types of energy on what you see. The blades are moving, it is turning, okay? If you want to list the energy you begin with, put an arrow, put the next form of energy, put an arrow. Put the next form of energy to show the consecutive transformations of your energy that's involved with the two objects. Is it turning right now? Do you all agree on that? I would spend a little time sharing some ideas about that.\n Wait, wait, wouldn't they both be nuclear energy?\n Nuclear energy?\n Yes, because it's .\n Think about your definition of .\n  Here you put the energy for toaster.  I would write it down. Sucked in. I don't have the jolt in that, look. I don't have the toaster plugged in.  Don't burn yourself. But let's look and observe. Three of you, do you feel anything?\n Yes, do you see all those little black pointy things, when you put something in there and you turn it on? I don't know what you call those things, but they like...\n The coil?\n Yeah, the coil, yeah.\n \n Yes, they do! That's how you generate the heat.\n If you had the toast it would turn on.\n How about in the oven, coils inside, what colors do they turn?\n Orange. They turn orange, the same thing.\n They turn orange? So do you think that there's a form of energy involved here?\n  Yeah.\n Magnetic. That's right?\n Oh!\n But you discovered it on your own.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 1837 SCI_EA_1837_Video_Recording_A_edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.172516], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["Matt"], ["NaN"], ["Matt"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Matt"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Garrett"], ["Teacher"], ["Maddy"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["Garrett"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Ali"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Steven"], ["NaN"], ["Jessica"], ["Teacher"], ["Matt"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Bella"], ["Teacher"], ["Elaine"], ["Teacher"], ["Ailsa"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["Class"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Girls"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW05", "TW13", "TW16", "TW17", "TW22", "TW23"]}, "1078": {"text": "  What you just said. They're going to go back together.\n Well, I've glued them down so they can't. The green and the red charts are locked down in place. They can't get back, but I've taken up the orange field.\n  Wouldn't it generate a new field?\n They're going to make a new field and that new field will be?\n  \n Say it again. Oh, like the earlier drawing?\n  \n We can actually say a little more than that. In this vicinity here?\n  \n They'll be trying to pull each other back together. So, we're going to end up with a field that's exactly opposite . What we did was they move around. \n  As long as it's still running.\n They move apart until the field is basically nullified.\n  Let's look at one more example.\n  Do you have one more potato shape in there?\n  Most people.\n  Most people, right. So, let's start for this last one, let's look at this shape and say that I observe fields coming out like that. Write down a couple of observations before you make your prediction. Based on what you're seeing in there, what can you say about what you see? \n Are those lines all supposed to be straight?\n  Yeah. To the best of my drawing ability they're horizontal, parallel lines. My drawing was perfect.\n Mr. Shields, what ?  \n  They're going in two directions.\n  The orange?\n  Yeah, the orange one.\n  Like a very large plate.  \n  It could be just a potato in there and that's . \n  The thing in your hand.\n  This one?\n  Yep.   \n  Okay, let's take a look. Chris, can I get you to shut the door to keep the noise down? We'll give you a break in about 10 minutes or so. It's nice to have the extra period here. First thing before we talk about this new one, I failed to address Hannah's question and good insight earlier. Yes, . The orange lines in here will be drawn into the negative and they're going to bend and  will be coming outward   from the positive end. So, you're definitely going to see this sort of pattern. I think people saw a little bit of that in the simulations. Anytime you've got a conducting material... Anytime you've got a conducting material the field lines always intersect exactly perpendicular with . It's a conductor. So, it definitely makes a difference when you call it a conductor and look at what happened in the field. Let's talk about this new one. There's a couple of observations. Ian give me one observation and Claire give me the second observation.\n Besides the fact that the lines are straight.\n  No, that's a good one. The lines are straight. Very important. Claire?\n They're going in opposite directions.\n  Exactly opposite directions. Okay, Hakim give me another one.\n Well, the lines are coming out of it.\n  Okay, they're coming outward not inward. Good.\n To indicate that the .\n  Okay, so that one we know from the very first piece here. The net charge is positive. The fact that they're horizontal.\n They indicate like a plate or something.\n Yeah, is it like two parallel plates? \n  Two parallel plates? So, where would you draw them? Above and below?\n There are two on top.\n  So, like above and below like this?\n  Four plates.\n  Four plates. Let's make it 16. \n But if you had a plate and the thing is neutral or no net charge and then they would just...\n But what if you had one positive plate straight up and down the middle, then it would push away on both sides.\n Two positive plates .\n Two plates sounds twice as good as one, but I'm not sure that it is. Four plates sounds even more appealing. An infinite number of plates sounds fantastic. I'm hearing good ideas here. I want you guys to think about what it would look like in different scenarios. So, two positive plates.   Okay, two positive plates and I'm looking at the vicinity in the middle here, is that right? And do I want my two positive plates to be on the sides?\n  Negative plates.\n  Well, negative plates, okay. Two negative plates on the sides like this so the field would look like what?\n Bend.\n  Okay, we're getting a bending because if I draw it here--\n But you still have to compare .\n  It'd be like this kind of a picture?\n It'd still be bent. Greater than the distance.\n  Okay, so you've got... So, based on that you've got some things going on above and below that should be penetrating into that shape.\n What about two infinitely long?\n  Two infinitely long plates. Both negative? What would the field look like? Forge the potato shape. What would the field look like in the vicinity of two infinitely long, evenly charged negative plates?\n Wouldn't they go ?\n  If I take a single positive test charge and release it right in the middle, what would it do?\n  \n  What if I release it a little bit to the left side?\n  \n  An infinitely long plate. We derived this one before, a single one. Remember the equation for the field or the general shape of the field from an infinite plane?\n  It's constant.\n  It's a constant, exactly right. Brittany didn't even have to look at her notes on that one. But you remember, what was our analogy to an infinitely large plate?\n  \n  Yeah, gravity on the earth here, you know, big flat earth. I don't care how far above the ground I am, it's the same number, it doesn't change at all. That's exactly right. So, an infinite plate, the field is some number, another identical infinite plate, it nullifies it. So, in the same charge, okay? Well, that isn't going to work.\n  Infinitely far.\n Infinitely far away from each other.  When Brittney says it's a constant, even if you go to infinity, I guess it'd still be a constant, either that or you go to zero.\n It would be two sets, one set like that except that they are horizontal and vertical and they're infinitely far away where .\n Two horizontal plates like this?\n Yeah, because . \n I don't think that's going to work either. Ben, you're getting agitated back there. And what are you saying?\n We were just talking.\n You're saying there's no way in the world they can be infinite. Is that what you're saying?\n Yeah. \n  \n You can't have an infinite plane anything because you're defining the shape?\n  So, that's a good question. When I've got the shape here, do we require that the thing that I'm talking about fit inside of the shape?\n  No.\n  I'm going to say no. Okay, so does that change your answer? Okay. I think we can and will look at situations where the surface... And remember this is all leading up to that Gaussian surface idea we mentioned on Friday. Where the Gaussian surface does not fully enclose an object. Like an infinite plane, we need to be able to study those even though I can't fit it inside of a box. So, we have to expand a little bit to the possibility that whatever it is is inside of there.\n An infinitely long positive plate right in the middle.\n  Right in the middle. Is that what you said about seven minutes ago?\n Yeah.\n  I tried to ignore him because I didn't want you guys to get the answer too quick. But I do want to acknowledge him . Yeah, tell me if this makes sense and why? Somebody besides John and Ian. It doesn't make sense that I've got a plate and this is slicing my potato in half and it's a positive plate.\n  Would it have to be infinitely long?\n  Much longer . \n If I don't... Now, I'm not very good at drawing in 3D so is the potato lines, are they diverging this way at all? I can't tell. They're uniform this way, parallel lines this way, so we know that it has to be infinite this way. And not have divergence this way .\n  \n Well, I didn't draw any lines coming out of the . Do they have to be parallel to the ones that are on the board or would they be diverging? That's going to change the answer that you give. If I draw another red line that's coming like this, that's clearly diverging from this red line. So, I'm going to assume that every line, for this problem, every line that I draw is parallel and then we'll get a new .\n  Perpendicular with the plate.\n  Yeah, perpendicular to the board. And then all positive coming out both sides. Very good. Alright, I've got one more drawing on there I want to hit and then we'll just say some fantastic summary words and then I'll give you guys a break. The last one here, instead of the three dimensional shape, now all I've got is a single sheet of paper. And this sheet of paper I've got, I noticed...  I noticed parallel lines, arrows, coming straight out of that shape. Write down a couple of observations on it quick and then see if you can predict, based on what you observed here, what and where, if you want to, what the source of the field lines is. What can we learn from the electric field lines?  \n  They're all coming out parallel in one direction.\n  Yes, parallel in one direction.  One direction. They're parallel this way and they're parallel this way also. So, they're normal to the surface everywhere.\n Are they coming from the other side?\n  All I see is lines penetrating this way, so I could actually draw them like this and that's fine.\n Do you know anything about the other side of the plate, like is there anything there?\n  It's a two dimensional structure and the arrows penetrate.\n Oh, okay.\n  Yeah, they're not diverging at all. Yeah, uniform, orthogonal, all that good stuff.     \n  Into the paper?\n So, they're coming out of here?\n  They're going into here and coming out here.\n Oh, okay.\n To the differences, that's a closed shape. This is a two dimensional surface. If I had wrapped it around like this it would make a difference, right?  \n Okay guys, let's see what we've got here. I'm going to ask Paul first, Emily second, and then we'll see if Michael can go for the trifecta.\n Oh no.\n  No pressure. You can be wrong, it's alright. Paul, what is, based on your observations, what is the thing that you think is the source of the electric field here? Where is it coming from that it makes this pattern in this object, on this sheet?\n I think this is like the second or the third example we did when it was passing through.\n  Where they're just passing through?\n Yeah.\n  So, then where do you think it's coming from? What does that tell you about the source of the electric field?\n I'm not sure.\n  You have more to say?\n No.\n  Emily, give it a try.\n Since it's positive on this side?\n  Yup.\n You can see that there might be a positive charge .\n  Okay, so if I had a positive charge on this side, I would get electric field lines going like this? That's correct, okay.\n Or if you had a negative charge .\n Ah okay, so you're answering two things, which is pretty overachieving, but I like it that you're saying that instead of a positive back here, it could be a negative over here. Okay, now there's something incomplete about what you're saying. The positive here versus there could be a negative here, that's a great insight that it could be one or the other, but Michael's going to help us out because you're a little incomplete on what you're telling us.\n They have to be infinite.\n  Infinite. Infinitely strong charge.\n Infinitely long, whatever, a plane.\n A plane, yeah. A plane back here that's infinitely large, distributive charge that's positive. That's the only way to get a uniform field here. Can it work with what Emily was saying about it could be a negative over here? It could be an infinitely long thing here? There's one more option. Does anybody ?\n It could be intro .\n  That this piece of paper here is neutral?\n And you could just put a new positive charge.\n  But be careful. Any positive charge, if I start off with the very first drawing, and I look at what happens when I put a sheet here, the field lines are like this.   They're diverging. I'm not having divergence here at all. So, it can't come from any old point source. We are going to assume that this thing is neutral though. Okay, that itself is not... It's just capturing the story of what's going on. Hannah?\n Could there be both a positive and negative along the plate?\n  Yeah, you can have both. You bet.\n  That seems like a little bit of overkill, but as long as you're making your sheet infinite in size, you might as well make two infinite's.\n You have all your infinite .\n  That's right. And two parallel plates, two plates that are parallel to each other, one positive, one negative, is a very common thing. So common in fact that it's on my tie today. Oh yeah, there it is. See that?  Hakim, do you have a question?\n Okay, so it's the positive plane that's standing or negative plane?\n  Yeah, the infinite plane.\n The infinite plane. I was about to say that. That it would be infinite.\n  Yeah, I think Michael was saying that it would probably be. Not the charge distribution, the sigma, how much charge per unit area will be some number, but it would just keep on going on. Chris?\n \n  Yeah, you know, that would be a lot.\n \n  Reasonably speaking, if something goes to infinity, all of your homework is easy. So, there's no purpose for me doing that. What is the answer? Infinity or zero. It's got to be one. Infinitely large in size with a uniform charge distribution does add up to an infinite charge, but it's distributed infinitely far away. So that's okay. Now, remember the goal of this as we were getting into this today, is to figure out what can we learn from an electric field? And here's the thing. In the first three or four examples or five I guess for some people, if I take a closed surface I can learn a lot. Not everything necessarily, but I can learn about what's inside of that. Infinitively, is the first one positive?\n  Yes.\n  Yes. The next one that I drew was negative, absolutely. This most recent closed surface, it had to be a positive plate shoved in there. This last one with just a two dimensional structure to measure with, to gauge what's happening, I don't know everything. We've got a lot of ambiguity. And this is why with Gauss' law we need to use this closed surface. We need to look at it from all sides. We need to be fully envelop in what's going on or else we might miss something. We'll go back again. The equation that I showed you last week, we'll put that on the board in a few minutes when we come back from a break as well as looking at a couple of scenarios, just conceptually how we can draw these things to capture all that field. Go ahead and take a break and be back in five minutes.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 1078 SCI AYA 1078edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.145726], "annotations": [["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Class"], ["Voiceover"], ["Class"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Class"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW06s", "TW08", "TW15"]}, "1835": {"text": " It's big.\n  Okay.\n And that's all, and the little blood cells, and I drew one on there, in kinda like a magnified, and there's little blood strands, they're blood strands, DNA strands.\n  Now, those DNA strands are only in the blood?

Let's stick with how we get our traits. Do we get it through the blood? Okay, not really? Girls, what do you think over there?\n I was sure it had something to do with the blood , but that's between your parents, and it has nothing to do with the traits, so I don't know.\n  Do you want to come over here too?\n I want to come over there with the boys.\n Yes, I . \n  You guys are, you guys haven't even said anything yet, and already they're, they're joining your group. Okay, should we hear from the people who think, I've got a large . Lorenzo, do you want, should we hear from you? Or are you thinking about coming over to this group too? You're set, okay. Let's hear from Lorenzo. Okay, Lorenzo, what do you think?\n I think that it was  that brown-eyed people have more traits than blue-eyed people, because I know more people that are brown-eyed than blue-eyed, and I think I read somewhere that usually brown eye is a dominant trait over the blue eyes. So for most of the times, brown-eyed people, if you have brown-eyed parents, you will get brown eyes, but how is--\n  So you heard something about a dominant trait? Okay, any questions about that dominant trait? Brown eyes being dominant trait?\n Because a lot of people have brown eyes like that, and not many people have blue eyes.\n  True? Blue eyes are more rare? Okay. Lorenzo, whoever you want to call on, you've got two people.\n So like, what you were saying right now,  something about your parents, then you would get it from your parents?\n  Hmm.\n  What?\n Because when he was, when he was saying that, about the traits, he said you, if your parents have brown eyes or blue eyes, that you're gonna get that trait from them. So, from your parents, so--\n  Interesting. Do you get what she's saying?\n What?\n  She's, she's saying she's sticking with this group because it's coming from your parents. Okay.\n That's why they say it's half and half.\n  Okay.\n Also, I'm in your group too, but what's it called?\n  \n Yeah, I see more brown eyes, but still, they always get their traits from the parents, not only--\n  But a lot of people have, some people still get blue eyes, and then others, it's because of, they still get the traits from the parents, and some of them don't look alike, so--\n What about, what about, some people have, both of the parents have brown eyes, and some of the kids turn, they have their blue eyes, though.\n  Yeah, that's great, because that's a great, how many of you guys have seen something like that?\n I have seen it.\n  Where two parents have one trait and then their kid has the opposite trait? Like brown-eyed parents, blue-eyed kid? You guys have seen that? Why does that happen? What do you think?\n I'm not really sure. I know my parents have brown eyes, and me--\n And you have green eyes.\n Yeah.\n  Your parents both have brown eyes, right? And your eyes are blue?\n Yeah.\n  Okay, so why does that happen? Lorenzo, since it was your idea let's hear from you.\n If I'm correct, there's more brown-eyed traits, so you get, if you have a brown-eyed parent and a blue-eyed parent, you get a brown-eyed trait and a blue-eyed trait, but because brown-eyed is dominant, most of the time, you get brown-eyed. But you still have blue-eyed traits, so even if you have two parents with brown-eyed trait, if they both also have the blue-eyed trait, you could get blue eyes.\n  I have a question for you, Lorenzo. You keep using this word, dominant trait. Does, in your mind, does dominant mean more?\n  More?\n  When you're saying more traits, in your mind, does dominant mean there's more of it?\n Yeah.\n  Okay, what do you guys, how many of you guys have heard this word, dominant?\n  There's recessive, too, which is--\n Recessive? Okay, does dominant mean more? Anyone know that?\n It means power over the others.\n Like an overpowering trait, he's trying to say.\n Are you trying to say more? Are you trying to say more or are you trying to say stronger?\n  Stronger.\n  Okay, so this group, the group you're sitting in, the group one, right now, is someone who thinks that there's more traits, come from the brown. Do you think that? You're not sure?\n Say yes.\n  But you know something about dominant? Okay.\n  I'll stay with my group.\n  Yes?\n  Can I make my own  group where it's like--\n  Yeah!  Good, yes. What are you thinking?\n I'm moving.\n Maybe it's just maybe that nature decides what something will look like, because I don't know, my parents have brown eyes and I have blue eyes, and we don't really have anyone else who has blue eyes.\n  You're picking the--\n  Wait a minute.\n  Fiona, no. Olivia?\n Yeah, nature.\n Okay, nature makes, so you've got blue eyes, nature had something to do with that, not your parents?\n  Yeah.\n Okay. Anyone want to respond to that?\n  Ryan?\n How does nature do that? How does nature choose your eye color?\n  Doesn't it have something to do with your parents?\n Of course , how could you just , a slot machine where it's like 'ching' and then the eye colors roll around and stuff? \"Oh, you got blue eyes!\"\n  I don't know .\n Let him respond. You're not sure?\n  No, I'm not sure. I'm still .\n Any other questions? \n  Oh, yeah?\n  And like, you know how, I was gonna ask this, what if you get it from your grandparents or your ?\n  Grandparents have black eyes.\n  Or from your aunts or something.\n  I really don't know.\n  If your aunts and sisters .\n  Yeah, what if his aunt and sister has blue eyes?\n That's right. What if somewhere way back, someone in your family had blue eyes?\n  You guys better .\n  I don't see how that .\n How does that happen? Does anyone know people who look like their grandparents?\n  Yeah, my cousin does.\n Lorenzo?\n My mom said that I look like my grandparent because I have a mole or something that's in the same spot as my grandpa.\n If that's the case for you, does that support what he's saying? Nature decides? Or does that keep you in what you're thinking?\n  It keeps me in.\n  But I have a question.\n Okay.\n How do people, one eye is blue and the other one is green?\n  Oh, I know that one.\n  That's a mutation.\n  No, no, some people have really--\n  Yeah, like--\n All right, let's refocus. Let's refocus. We haven't heard from this group. We haven't heard from the few groups that have the most amount of people in them. Okay, so let's give them a chance to talk. Ladies, can you start us off?\n You guys read it. I have to read it? \n  We agree that people get half their traits from their parents. We think this is a  trait from both of their parents. Also,  for example,  that--\n What? \n For example, if one person has, one parent has--\n  Because for example, for me, I have my dad's eyes and I have my mom's, my mom's .\n She has traits from, some from your mom and some from your dad, okay?\n  Yeah.\n It looks like you've got someone who wants to say something about that.\n  But if, what if you get more, if you get some traits from your ancestors too and not just your parents? What about your--\n That would just go back a generation, though.\n Does that still support what you're thinking?\n Yeah.\n No, because we're talking about the parents. How they have half.\n  Yeah, but you then also get from your parents, some of them, so some people don't look like their parents at all, but they look like someone else in their family.\n I'm seeing this issue come up again. What about grandparents? Kids who look like their grandparents. How does that happen? Does anyone here wanna, any of you guys? Go ahead.\n You still get it from your parents because your parents, if your grandma has it, then that trait is somewhere in your mom or your dad. It just doesn't show up as much, so it can transfer back to you.\n  What can we call that? That there's a trait in you and you just don't see it? Does anyone know a word for that?\n Invisible? \n  I heard it over here.\n  Recessive.\n  Yes, recessive, okay. Who else has heard recessive? Raise your hands. Scientists call a recessive gene a gene that does not express itself. It doesn't mean it's a little gene that's quiet. It just means that it's a gene that's not showing. Or a trait, sorry, a trait that's not showing. That's called recessive. You also want to talk about this more, a little bit more, let's stay on this topic. I think it will help us figure it out. Yes, Ryan?\n Like he was saying, it's probably about the DNA strands, when they, when two people  combine in different parts or put in different pieces of it, like maybe one, like maybe the blue eyes is out and brown eyes goes in there. Or maybe when they have one of those recessive genes, the recessive genes get, it goes into the strand too. Maybe when Tyler said that none of, neither of his parents have blue eyes, maybe his grandpa or his grandma or their grandparents, maybe one of them had blue eyes, and it was in his mom or his dad, and it went into the strand that he was created from.\n It didn't show up in the mom, but then it popped up in the kid?\n  Yeah.\n Okay. David?\n  I don't know, I think, I don't know if I agree with him, but I think I kind of do because, like he said, it was dominant, but he still has, he still has a little bit in him, so it's kind of like a, well, because you still have, some of your traits, or your parents still kind of have a little bit.\n How are, okay, how are, how is this idea that brown-eyed kids have, I'm sorry, brown-eyed, there's more traits in brown eyes, right? Is that what this idea is about? All you guys right here? How is that like this one? That we get half from mom and half from dad? Or how can we use some of this thinking and layer it onto some of this thinking, so they're both right?\n  The question is how are those two the same?\n  Right.\n How are that one and this one the same?\n  How are pieces from this, how do we use pieces from this idea that Lorenzo is bringing up, dominant and recessive, how do we use pieces from this and combine it with pieces from this group over here? Let me get you to talk about that with your group. Let me ask, I'll ask that question one more time. What's right about what these guys are saying and how can we add it to stuff this group is thinking?\n  What if the kid is born blind, right?  Or what if the kid comes out deaf and blind?\n  some express themselves and some don't.\n Woo! That, you just gave me a brain scan because you read my mind.  Say there's two DNA strands. One in this hand, one in this hand. They combine. The dominant ones from each of these take over and make one of all the dominant ones that were in them.\n Can you give me an example ?\n With Tyler, maybe there was a dominant gene. The blue eyes was dominant. Maybe it was passive before it started, whatever it's called, recessive, and then it became dominant, but over time, and then it  went in Tyler.\n How can a dominant gene become a recessive gene and become dominant again?\n  Maybe  every time it gets passed down.\n  Hmm.\n  Like with us, we get bigger.\n What if your, if your mom had two blue-eyed parents, but Ryan here, today ?\n And they combine. I found it. \n  All right, are we ready to pull back? All right. I didn't get to hear from all, these two groups, but I did get to hear from them. I think what this group has is something good, and I think you guys want to hear it. , you're gonna be the spokesperson for that group? Great.\n We agree that people get mom and 50% from their dad. We think this because if there's two people who made the baby, then it's, logically, should be split in half. But all, every time someone has a baby, all of their genes of both parents go into the baby. Only some of them decide to express themselves and show.\n  Go ahead.\n Say I have two DNA strands from two different people. Say, Mary and Joe. Mary and Joe both had grandparents that both have blue eyes, and that gene got passed down to them. Now, they combined to make one gene. Say Mary had blue eyes, had a blue-eyed gene, and Joe had a blue-eyed gene. Those two genes combined to make one dominant blue-eyed gene and it goes in, like what Tyler, like with Tyler.\n  Right, so we, Tyler, he used you as an example. Your parents both have brown eyes, right?\n  Mm-hmm.\n  And what were you guys saying about, his parents both have brown eyes, but something, they had something else too?\n Yeah.\n Because everyone kind of has a little bit of everything in them, it's just some, some color or some trait just decides to show because it's more dominant.\n  You know the movie, you know the movie, , that movie? They went to some place and they went to go get,  found out, they got the book from some person and they matched it up to ours, and it was different colors, so they had different kind of genes for like, for things. So if you compare a baby who has blue eyes and one who has brown eyes, it's gonna have, it's gonna have different things with the eyes. The DNA thing will be different.\n  Maybe those DNA genes that, in a DNA, maybe they would look different for a blue-eyed person than a brown-eyed person?\n Yeah.\n  Did you wanna say something?\n Maybe the DNA of Tyler's parents, for example, if their grandparents had blue-eyed DNA accumulating in them, it might have been passed down through them. And then when they got to where they were forming Tyler inside their, his mom's stomach , it might have, the blue DNA might have overpowered, combining those two blue DNAs by getting, it might have overpowered the brown eyes, which made Tyler get the blue eyes.\n   50%? It could be like 50%.\n  That happened in my family.\n They're saying, what color eyes are your parent's, Tyler? What's your mom's eye color?\n  Brown.\n Oh.\n  Yeah, what you got on your mom's side?\n From my brown-eyed mom?  Brown.\n  So what about your mom's mom? What about your dad's?\n  What about your dad?\n All right, you guys, let's talk. Let's talk for a second. If we've got an example of one person, in science, you never hang everything on one person. Let's be careful about that. And we don't want to have him be the reason for all. But this is a good example. Do we think that people can have genes in them that aren't showing, but then they can have a kid, and then those genes pop up?\n  Yeah, because if the two genes--\n Did you want to say something about it, Lorenzo?\n  Yeah, because I think that if a parent had brown eyes and one had blue eyes, but the brown-eyed parent also had some blue-eyed genes, then the baby would probably come out blue, because it has the blue-eyed gene and then half of the blue-eyed gene from the other parent.\n How could we figure out how we get our traits for sure? Because we have a lot of ideas, but what, in science class, what will we do? What kind of activity could we do? What kind of research could we do? How would we find out?\n We could go on AskJeeves.com and we-- \n So we could look it up on the Internet. Okay, guys, one resource we could look at. How else could we figure this out?\n We could take a survey.\n  Didn't we do that?  the class?\n  We did?\n  No. \n But we could  whole school so we have more to research, or more, I don't know.\n  Make a larger sample size. Then, we get information and we find out that X percent of our students have brown eyes and X percent of our students have blue eyes. How does that help us find out where those traits came from?\n  It gives us more of an idea--\n  Their parents and their grandparents too. And their great-grandparents.\n  We'd have to ask people to, we'd have to ask people to do some research on their families? Okay, so we could do some family research. Sonja?\n We could make up an assignment .\n  Sure.\n  \n  Okay.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 1835 SCI_EA_1835_Video_Recording_A_edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.18566], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Ryan"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["All"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Lorenzo"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Lorenzo"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Lorenzo"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Lorenzo"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Lorenzo"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Ryan"], ["NaN"], ["David"], ["NaN"], ["Ryan"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Ryan"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Tyler"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Tyler"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Lorenzo"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Sonja"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW08", "TW22", "TW23", "TW24TW08"]}, "1838": {"text": " On a regular basis. Have you ever thought about what that causes? I mean, what causes wind to blow in the first place? Whether it be a breeze. Whether it be a hurricane. Whether it be a tornado. Would you take a few minutes in your notebook, would you just draw a line write after what you wrote?  And I want you to give your best explanation of what the heck causes wind? Just do this on your own first. What could cause wind to blow? Take a few moments, just on your own.  Just like always guys, you don't have to be right here. I just want to know anything that you think might contribute to wind blowing. On a big scale, on a small scale. Anything that you've got that we can build on, anything that you put down. Alright, when you have this discussion in a few moments, share your ideas with each other. And then remember one person will be called from the group to share either what you put down, or what somebody else did. Talk to each other. See what everyone there is thinking. What ideas do we have? \n The air pressure and temperature changes and so it kind of like shocks, and it creates wind.\n That's good. I think wind develops because clouds carries that air .\n I don't really know much. \n Alright, folks. When we go, let's use, let's see who gets to share. Person two. We're going to go with person two. And let me switch this over here real quick so I can write down some of your ideas. Hold on. Alright, where'd my pen go? Okay, here we go. Person two. And we're going to start over here. Did you guys have any ideas why wind to blow? No, table seven. Sorry.\n I don't know, but I said heat and cold air rising and falling. 'Cause I know how hang gliding gives us columns of air rising, heat rising, how you get in the air. I'm really not sure so I'm just thinking.\n  Okay, so something about hot air rising and cool air falling.\n  And like how they're .\n  Say that again.\n  And cold and hot air going over mountains. \n  Different land masses. Okay, very interesting. Now she had the toughest job. From now on every other person number two that goes you have to either come up with a different theory, a different idea, or you can agree or disagree with what Miah had to say. But you cannot say, \"I don't know.\" Okay? So you gotta kinda run with what's been said. Keisha, we're going to go back to you first. What was your thought at your group?\n  Well, we agree with Miah because basically we said the same thing that like the temperature of the air can have something to do with the wind.\n  Okay. So I'm just going to add on here temperature.\n  I was going to add pressure.\n  Temperature, okay. That may be something different. Let's see what we can add to this. So you're agreeing with Miah that it may have something to do with the temperatures of the air. Yeah? Okay. Table three, you guys had a different kind of theory.\n We agree with what she said except we also thought the pressure  how the wind blows and stuff.  Okay, so you guys talked mostly about pressure.\n Yeah.\n Could you pass that up to table two? So far we have two theories. One has been agreed to already. We have temperature, pressure.\n Our group wasn't sure. But I agree with Kavya in how the pressure .\n  You're thinking that it's something do with pressure. And, okay there's an agreement here with temperature as well. Pass that up to table one. Prescott, what kind of ideas did you guys have?\n Well, we were talking and we kinda agree with A, or hot air rising. And pressure and air too, but I was thinking that currents or air currents carry the wind, or carry the air, faster.\n  Okay, so let me add something about currents in here. 'Cause that's another kind of interesting thing. So are currents separate from these two? Or the same? Or added on to? Or they another thing all together?\n Just added on, I guess.\n  Okay, so we've got temperature of the air, we've got pressure of the air, and we've got something to do with currents. Could you pass that over to Conner? Conner, what is your thought?\n  We kind of agreed that pressure of the air probably makes the wind. Like low pressure and high pressure.\n  You know that's an interesting thing with the low pressure. What would cause air to be different pressures?\n  I thought maybe the Earth's core and the gravity pulls down more in some places than others.\n  Okay so, let's see. So you're agreeing with pressure, and you're kind of saying the pressures have something to do with gravity. Really interesting. Oops, hang on. Something to do with gravity causing different pressures. Pass that back to David. David, what did your conversation involve?\n  Well, I thought the, I really didn't know exactly what makes the wind blow, but if I had to guess I'd say it's air masses meeting.\n  Let's put that down. Okay. Hold on. And you threw out something that says air masses meeting. Alright, so when you talk about air masses, give us more of what you thought of what that is. What do you mean an air mass? And when they meet, how would that produce wind?\n  Well, I know that when warm and moist air mass collides with a cool, dry air mass it forms a thunderstorm. I was thinking of one warm air mass meets another warm air mass, then when they collide it might produce wind. I don't know why, that's just my guess.\n  No, no that's fine. So you're thinking when, you're saying when two different kinds of air masses meet it makes a thunderstorm. But maybe when two of the same meet it makes wind.\n  Yeah.\n  So let me put that on. So air masses meeting. So since we're talking only about wind right now, it's the same kind of air mass meeting. Alright. Would you pass that back to... Ah, Nathan we're going to have you go since Amber already went today. Back over to Nathan. Nathan what did your conversation revolve around back there?\n  Well, we didn't really know, but based on what everyone said I agree with Miah, that it's the hot air rising and the cooler falling. But I also think that David's ideas are kind of interesting. I agree with A.\n  You're agreeing with A, that it has something to do with the temperatures.\n  Miah, what's your thought?\n  I also thought what David said, 'cause I know how tornadoes are formed. But then I thought air masses are way too big. And I know almost all over the continent get a lot of wind. And so I think it might have something to do with air meeting together. I think that has to do with hot and cold air, kind of mashing.\n  Okay so. You said with hot air rising and cool air falling. And then you said something about hot and cool air mashing. So when you talk about them mashing, are they like coming together and like swirling together? What do you mean by mashing?\n  Mixing, not mashing.\n  Mixing.\n  Yeah, just kind of colliding together, but not swirling.\n  Okay, so when you're saying hot air rising, cool air falling, you're saying that those two things are mixing, and it's by the mixing together that's what's causing the wind?\n  Yes.\n  Okay. Guys take a second. I want you to talk, we've got two more tables to go. But I want you to take a few moments, talk about the theories that have been presented so far and see if your opinions change so far. And then any questions that come up based on it. Talk to each other.  Alright guys, about ten seconds. Everybody time. And three, two, and one. Great ideas so far, guys. Let's go to the last... Any questions or comments come up in your discussion that you just had? Yes.\n  Well, I think that if two of the same air masses meet it would just make a larger air mass. I mean if you're adding water with water, it's just making more water.\n  Huh, so you're saying instead of wind being created, you would just have a bigger one.\n  And I also think maybe it creates a thunderstorm if it's two of the different air masses, but maybe I think that would create wind like negative and positive magenets refusing to mix.\n  You're bringing a couple of interesting things. You're saying when a warm air mass and a cold air mass meet, you're saying that those are kind of like magnets. Like opposite sides attract? Am I understanding what you're saying?\n  Sorry, I mean both of the... I'm a little confused. Also, I would kind of agree with David now because if I'm thinking about magnets then two of the same magnets would refuse.\n  Right. So would that analogy be a wind refusing? Or would coming together be more like the wind?\n  I think that analogy would work with the two different temperatures of air mass, but there's, the magnets are the same, the air masses are...\n  That's really interesting when you go and you apply to analogy like a magnet like that, which is really cool to bring in. Let me get the two other theories and we'll come back to that.\n  How big are air masses?\n  Well, let me come back to that. Let me get the two others and make sure we get some other theories in. Richard, what'd you guys end up talking about? Did it change as you saw these ideas?\n  Yeah, so originally we were thinking that it might have something to do with gravity's movement. Actually, we thought it would probably be more something like a change in air pressure.\n  You know, I'm going to, because I think that's an interesting theory, I'm going to put it up here anyway. You said it had something to do with gravity and the movement of the planet itself. So with gravity and movement of the Earth. Okay and then once you started throughout this round, you're thinking more it has to do with changing pressure? Okay, and you agree with what... Connor, was it you that was saying that it was the gravity that was causing the change in pressure?\n  Yeah.\n  So are you feeling like, are you taking your idea and kinda hooking it together? Or does something else cause a change in pressure?  Okay, alright. That's fine. Where's the mic? Can you pass it up? Here, I'll come get it. Abigail, last theory. Go.\n  Well, at first we weren't sure. And we were talking about kind of atoms moving, like molecules and compounds moving away from each other and combining. But then we changed our opinions and think that like the pressure of air and the temperature of the air and the compounds that make up the air, moving and changing, make wind from the combination.\n  So you're really mashing it all together. So your theory revolves around molecules moving away from each other. That was the first part. And then, did that end up causing pressures did you say?\n  No, like and then the different types of air kinda combined I guess.\n  So then molecules move away from each other. When you say different types of air?\n  So like warm, hot and pressure.\n  And those combine?\n  \n  Should I add that to this?\n  I don't know.\n  Tom. Yeah, Tom.\n  I have a question. How would two air masses meet if they didn't have wind to bring them?\n  Well, now that's an interesting question. Do air masses, now that's a really interesting question. Are air masses just these big masses of air? And then wind blows them around?\n  Because then it wouldn't make the wind if it couldn't, if it couldn't come together, it couldn't make wind.\n  Oh, now that's a really interesting thing. So is the wind? Oh, wow. Is wind a result of the air masses? Or do air masses need wind to move? Well, that's a really good question. Ben, you had a hand up.\n  I just thought about it, and I didn't really want to share the question. I just was thinking in my head and I thought through the question.\n  Alright. Does anybody have any other theories they'd like to suggest? Other than are there. Let's go through them real quick. So we had the theory that said it's hot air rising cool air falling, and somehow those two mixing that creates the wind. We had the theory that said it's the pressure of air and that pressure is kind of dictated by gravity. We had something with currents. So it's somehow the currents in the air, whatever those happen to be, that's what's causing the air to move as wind. There's air masses meeting. If it's the same, what Dave was saying. If the same air mass meeting, that's what causes the wind. It's gravity in the movement of the Earth, which Richard and this table suggested. Although they moved away from it, I think it's a valid theory to be suggested. And then it's molecules moving away from each other and then somehow combining with the other things. So would you take a moment, and if you had to commit to one of these as being why you thought wind would blow, take a moment and talk to each other and decide which one you think you'd commit to as far as which one you think it is. Talk to each other. \n I don't really know like what Matthew brought up, how they would move... So...  \n  Alright guys, here we go. Would you grab the voter that is registered to you. And when you turn it on, you should have an A through F option. And would you choose one of those to be your theory please?\n  Is this graded?\n  No, it's not. No, we're just theorizing right now. So just go with the one that feels best to you.\n  What's the question?\n  It is which one of those theories do you think it is that is what makes wind blow?  Wait for a few more people to vote. Oh Mark, we gotta get to voting. Patrick, you in? Yep, you're in. Okay. Mark, what you want to vote on is which one of these theories you think is best. Votes are on your voter and fire away. And he's the last one to vote, as soon as he goes we'll see what way we as a class think. Oh, you got it? Okay, here we go. Let's see what you think. Alright, so B is our best theory so far. So right now as a group, let me save this. So right now as a group, we are thinking that it is pressure and... Let me ask you this. Let me get a quick hand vote for this, just out of curiosity. One of the things was that the pressure is caused by gravity. How many of you are going to add pressure would be caused by gravity then? Okay, most of the people voted that way look like they're going--\n", "filename": ["Copy of 1838 SCI_EA_1838_Video_Recording_A_edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0626849], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Keisha"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Connor"], ["Teacher"], ["Connor"], ["Teacher"], ["David"], ["Teacher"], ["David"], ["Teacher"], ["David"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Miah"], ["Teacher"], ["Miah"], ["Teacher"], ["Miah"], ["Teacher"], ["Miah"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Richard"], ["Teacher"], ["Connor"], ["Teacher"], ["Abigail"], ["Teacher"], ["Abigail"], ["Teacher"], ["Abigail"], ["Teacher"], ["Abigail"], ["Teacher"], ["Abigail"], ["Teacher"], ["Tom"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Ben"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW03", "TW05", "TW08", "TW13", "TW16", "TW17", "TW22", "TW24TW08"]}, "1839": {"text": " It's similar to when we had the hand warmer. What happens is when you add heat energy to the hand warmer, it makes the water rise up. So, in the glass, in the two liter bottle in the glass too, the heat lamp added heat to it, the heat energy. Then the water started to rise up.\n Of the water, okay. So, why do you think the water spilled over last time?\n I think that it's because of the molecules expanding.\n  Okay.\n And then the molecules didn't have enough room. Well, the water didn't have enough room, so it had to get out. So, then it popped out through the tube.\n  Okay. Do you share the same idea?\n Yeah.\n  Do you agree with her?\n Yes.\n  Okay. Alright. Let's talk about this. Yes.\n I have something. Like, with mine, we thought that since there was oxygen, I mean, there was a glass tube, that the water had room to expand and like, spill out. So, what's why it did.\n Okay, thank you. Alright. Let me ask you something. How many of you put that water molecules expanded? Raise your hand. As a reason for water spilling. Alright. Okay. They gave you the reason why, right? So, who can tell me why you put that? Alright, Rebecca.\n I put that because, well you see it... Well, in the bottle lab, we had water in there, so when it heated up, they expanded, and they didn't have enough room, so they had to, it had to come out.\n  So, molecules got bigger right?\n Yeah.\n If you don't believe molecules got bigger, what did you guys think that the water spilled over? Yeah.\n I think if the water molecules didn't get bigger, I think that the heat caused them to move around and bump into each other.\n Okay, so what is the evidence for both of these? You played with the water heater. Where is the evidence to support this? Anybody? Anthony.\n Like what I think is that, that the steam is like mostly involved with this, 'cause the only type of air water has is steam. And like, since the water was heated so intensely, it had to let out all the air it contained. So, it spewed out steam.\n Okay, thank you very much. Good job. I'm gonna go over with Moorea. Why do you think that water... You didn't agree with water molecule being, expanding, right?\n Yeah.\n  So, what is your evidence that it is not expanding?\n Well, I think when we added the heat to the water, I think the molecules started getting hotter, and the heat was transferred from the lamp to the molecules, and they started moving around more. Kind of like how sugar makes people, like have a sugar rush, and kind of move around more, and get more excited.. And then, they just needed more room, so they spilled out into the tube.\n Okay. Now let me ask you something. If that is true, how come if I press it here, it's going down? Why? Yes, Tyshon.\n Because of the heat in your hand.\n What's happening, the heat of my hand? Right, Saron.\n So, it goes down faster because the heat in your hand is enclosing around the top, I guess. So, it will make it come down.\n  Jake.\n I'm not sure, but I think it goes down faster, yes, because of everybody else saying that when you hold, from the heat of your hand. But I think it's also because gravity pushes things down.\n Okay. Alright. Alec has two finger, means he has something to add.\n I agree with Jake. And I also think that since the water went down, it's because it had more room at the bottom. So, when you put your hand around it, it immediately goes down, also because of gravity, and how it has more room.\n  How did you come up with that answer?\n Well, when you were holding the top, I saw that the bottom was empty. And like, so I thought that 'cause of gravity, when you hold it at the top, it has more room to go down--\n  But if you hold the bottom. Look at the whole bottom. Hold the bottom. What's happening?\n It's right there.\n  It's against the gravity. It's going up. So, hold on. I'm gonna provide the evidence about the result. This is computer simulation. Watch this carefully. I want you to watch this carefully. And look at this. The right side is water. Okay, the right side is water. And, did I turn the heat on?\n  Yeah.\n  Yeah. Okay. So, who turned it off? I'm gonna reset it. Okay. And then, heat is off. Watch. Look at air and water molecule. Let's look at the water molecules first, since we're doing the liquid part. Are you with me?\n  Yeah.\n Alright. What is happening to water molecule? Write it down with your group. You've got 30 seconds.  Talk to the group.\n Molecules are vibrating very slightly.\n Since the water's mostly cooled down, more than the air, it's more stable. It's like, doesn't vibrate as much as air, 'cause water is like, more still, and more like a solid than air.\n Okay. Please observe everything. And I'm going to be asking you questions. Alright. And here we go. I'm gonna turn the heat on. As a group, you need do discuss and write everything down, what you see here. Just the air. I mean, I'm sorry. Just observe the water, yes. Everything, okay. Here we go. Group. Water only.  Okay, now discuss with your group. Alright. Water only. \n The water molecules, they aren't moving around like the air ones, but they're vibrating. They're moving like back and forth. They're vibrating like really violently. They're staying in the same general area. Like . But the water ones are like... I'm sorry, the molecules in the air are bouncing around, and when the heat is applied, they start bouncing around faster.\n I agree with Maor, but I think that with the air ones, that they have more room to bounce around. That the water is all contained in one thing. So, the molecules have to stay in one position, but the air has to--\n What do you think, ladies? You haven't said anything.\n I think the same thing as Maor, because the air molecules have more room to the surrounding, because it's really nothing in there. And since water is a liquid it has less room. Whatever.\n I see that, the more the heat gets on the water--\n Alright, 30 more seconds. So, we're gonna start the discussion. There are people who need more time to write, but you already know what to do. So, here we are. Okay. I'm gonna call on individuals, so, please do so. You don't have to stand up. Ivree.\n I saw that when you turned on the lamp, it started vibrating faster than--\n  Which one? We're talking about which one?\n The water.\n  Okay. Vibrating faster. Joon Po, you think through?\n The temperature also started rising very little.\n  Excellent. Dylan, what else did you notice?\n I'm noticing that when the heat is on, the water is starting to vibrate very fast when it's turned on, but they are staying stationary, they're not actually moving anymore.\n  So, why do you think the water molecules are vibrating? Chelsea.\n Because of the heat that is going on to the molecules.\n  So, what you're saying is the heat source is going to molecules. Class. What do you call the heat source? Which is the lamp. What is it?\n Heat energy.\n  Heat energy. Very good. So, in this case. I don't know if you agree with Chelsea. Raise your hand. How many of you disagree? Raise your hand. Alright. How many of you agree with Chelsea? Raise your hand. Okay. Alright. The molecules are transferring energy. The heat energy is transferring heat to the energy. Thank you very much. Now, next part, I'm going to give you a life problem to solve. And I want you to come up with solutions. Okay. How many like to play ping pong? Oh, excellent. You know, I grew up playing ping pong, because in Asian culture, ping pong's a lot cheaper to purchase than basketballs. So, most every home has ping pong, or ping pong table, because it's easy to make out of wood. Now, having said that. Suppose you received a set of ping pong balls for holiday because you asked for it, from your parents, and your parents being really nice, and you behaved really well. They decide to give you these ping pong balls you got. The problem is you lost all of them except one. And your best friend came over to play with this. But he stepped on it on accident. So, now here's a dent. Right, he has to fix it. Can you fix it? You're all worried. Because you've never seen anybody can fix this. So, give me some suggestions by talking to your group. Alright. You have buddies back up there, alright. \n Kind of like the water bottle, right. Especially like, you can fix another part. Maybe you could do the same thing with the ping pong ball.\n Like if you start to squish the ping pong balls down, and maybe you could  its place.\n It'd be easier to pop it out.\n I think you can apply air. You can apply air like with heat. Like at least heat. 'Cause you know when the heat was added to the water? Right. Like you could apply air with a little...\n Do you need more time?\n Like the thing--\n Okay. So, I'm going to write the solution, alright, by asking group that has an answer. Just stand up one at a time, the group that hasn't answered yet. Alright. So here's a solution. Say ping pong ball dilemma. Alright. Okay, number one. Which group is gonna be? Just stand up. Just stand up, if you haven't spoke in this group.\n We already thought that you could try and use your hands and  like pop the air back into it and get it to its original shape.\n Okay. Alright, number two. Something different. Which group that hasn't spoken yet? Okay, Chelsea's group.\n Alec said that if you push around the edges, it might pop back into shape.\n  So, kind of the same thing. Yes.\n We think that somehow if you maybe poked a hole in it, you can use, like an air pump, or some sort of machine to get the air in it, and maybe the air will push against the dent. And make it a sphere again.\n  Let's see how many of you believe this dilemma, raise your hand. Okay. Alright. How many of you believe this is gonna work? Raise your hand. How many believe this is gonna work? Alright. Is there a third option, anybody? Okay. Yes.\n I don't know if this will work, but maybe you can put in front of a lamp.\n Okay. Excellent start. But why would you put it in front a lamp? Let me ask you something.\n Maybe so that the molecules in it, like in the water example, maybe they'll start, like vibrate...\n  No, you're okay.\n Well, it's air, so--\n  You want to add heat energy, right?\n Yeah, you want to add heat.\n  Alright, so, we're gonna try all of those. So, let's try with number one. So, I'm going to give Sasha a ping pong ball that's been dented by my best friend. Or not my best friend. Her best friend, so she's gonna try to do it. Okay, number two is what? Pop a hole in it. So, how many of you disagree with this? Or of this idea. Why would you disagree with this idea, Dylan?\n Because if you poked a hole in it, it would be kind of like, ruin it, and release all this stuff, and it would be kind of hard to--\n  Okay. What are you ruining in this case?\n The ping pong ball.\n  In other words. What you're saying, is a surface of the thing?\n Yeah.\n  Okay. Did you try?\n Yeah, like it's really hard. So, it's actually hard to pop it back in.\n  Let's see. Who's strong?\n Me.\n Okay. You're strong. She wants to do it. If she doesn't work, then let's do it. Okay, how about the lamp? Lamp thingy. So... Let's see. Are you the one that says the... Come on over. Okay. Leave it like this. Turn the heater on. Okay. On the top, yeah, that's it. The other way. There you go. Right there. Yeah, there, you got it.\n  Oh, okay.\n Oh, what happened? It helps if it's connected isn't it?  Okay. Try that again. There. So, we're gonna time it. While we're working on this for a couple minutes. Okay. Alright. Okay. Alright. So, who has the ping pong now? \n The dent was too strong.\n Okay, now. Look at the ping pong ball. I'm gonna show it to you. Okay, look. You saw it right? All of you. What happened?\n It has more dents.\n Not only the dent. What else?\n It broke.\n Is this gonna work? That's completely ruined... What did that do? Nothing. Alright, so, let's say first idea is no good. Okay. So, second idea, poke a hole. We agreed that it's not gonna work, because it's gonna compromise. How many of you agree with that? It's gonna compromise the shape of the thing. Okay. Alright, the third idea. Alright. It's about a minute. Nothing's happening. Okay. Do you have any other suggestions? Who hasn't said anything? Sydney?\n I think maybe you could like put it between your hands, because it might work the same as the lamp, but just faster.\n Okay. So, how many agree that, looks like both of you, if I'm not mistaken, that you have to have some kind of heat, right? You said because?\n I said because, like the water, it needs room to expand. Well, it's not actually expanding, but it needs room to move, so, the ball will probably expand.\n Okay, I'm gonna show you this simulation. Is there something... Yes, Dylan.\n Yeah, I want to add... Maybe it would work better under a stronger heat source.\n  Okay, like a sun.\n Yeah, like--\n Okay. Can I tell you something that I did before the class? I put it under the lighter and the ping pong went like pshhh. You know, to be honest with you, the ash was big as this one. That was it. I was looking for ping pong ball. It'll burn. Alright, now, I want to show you this simulation again. Okay. So, bear with me here. You all said the two things I'm gonna talk about. You all said the molecules were expanding, meaning molecules are getting bigger, right? Tell me. Is this molecule getting bigger?\n  No.\n Okay, so molecules are not getting bigger. How many of you believe it's not getting bigger? Remember, simulation is evidence. Is that what is happening? Like many of you said already. Jake.\n They're moving around really fast in the space. For air and water, they're vibrating.\n So, look at the air this time. Alright. The air. So, class, which one would you say is moving faster?\n  Air.\n Okay. So, air is moving faster. Okay, we're gonna discuss this next step. So, everyone's gonna get a big picture. You have a question, I need to see the finger thing. Yes.\n I have a, I guess, reason... Well, I have another thing that I noticed about that I guess, you could say. I think that the reason why the water molecules are moving slower is because the water is taking up space, and they can't travel around that fast because in the air, there's really nothing in there that's stopping them from moving. But I guess, you can compare it to us when we're swimming under water. We move slower than we normally do on land. Yeah.\n  So, air molecules are moving really fast, right? So, what's happening as it's moving very fast? Sydney, you have something to add? Okay.\n I was just gonna say, if you look at water, it sort of looks like it's in an invisible cage. And it's trying to move around, but it can't.\n  So, it's restricted. It doesn't move as well.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 1839 SCI_EA_1839_Video_Recording_A_edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0801286], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW03", "TW06s", "TW16", "TW22", "TW23"]}, "1072": {"text": "  Isn't it nuclear fission when, like, fusion? No, fusion is when they combine. Nuclear fission is like when they split apart, right?\n Yes, so it's a fission process.\n  See? Ah!\n So that's a , I see that, that efficient.\n  Efficient.\n It increases the safety though, right?\n  It's impossible to explain.\n No, I'm just saying, does it?\n  No, I don't understand. Am I the only one here?\n Apparently to you, though. \n So, why is it that when the atom is unstable it's radioactive?\n It could be it's removing protons and neutrons?\n I think you guys can discuss this.\n  Isn't it when like it starts releasing the neutrons to a different atom, or something, and then it gains the neutron, and that's when it starts becoming, like--\n More vulnerable--\n  More vulnerable, and it starts, like, a chain reaction.\n  You guys agree?\n I agree.\n  I agree.\n  I agree with everybody.\n That's right. \n  So, how can radiation help them? Like Amy said--\n It could also help in the electricity and helps us get our resources.\n Like you said. \n  What else though?\n Like cancer.\n  Cancer?\n  Cancer.\n I mean, I had an aunt that suffered from cancer and it kind of helped her even though she passed away. It kept her longer than it would have been without her having medication.\n Any last thoughts? Okay, that's fine, thank you. I have only one major, I guess comment, about that one. I noticed Steve used a lot of vocabulary words. He did remember a lot of the words, and I think he planned for that. And then I liked the way that David actually redirected the group. He asked the group, \"How can radiation help us?\" right at the end, and then people responded to that. So, he kind of helped redirect the questions for the discussion group. So, and then people were able to respond. So, that was a nice way to create a discussion. Okay, question number two.\n  Three.\n  Three.\n I'm sorry. Okay, I mean...\n How about number four next?\n  Okay, I'm going to do number four next.\n No!\n Do number three. The one with three.\n No, I'm going to do four.\n No, I want to do three. Okay, number four is going to go next. You have two minutes to prepare.  Number four.  Just ignore it.\n What is that?\n  A microphone.\n Oh, it works? So, they can hear me right now? Oh. \n It's recording?\n  Well, why do you think President Obama might support building nuclear power plants in the USA and what are some arguments for nuclear energy?\n  David, put that away. \n  Okay, Jane, who's going to go next?\n  Me.\n Jane.\n  Okay, so which vocabulary and evidence are you going to focus on?\n  Nuclear power plant, nuclear power plant--\n  Well, pick several.\n  The nuclear, yeah. The nuclear power plant can help us create more energy. I mean, well it's--\n Nuclear radiation, for my argument.\n  You know what Dano was saying?\n No.\n  He was just going to put power plants.\n Do you know what it is?\n Yeah, it's where they . Yeah.\n  Okay, what does it do?\n Creates energy.\n  Okay.\n  Okay, what other evidence are you going to use, though?\n The fact that we are running out of, well, we're not running out of, but, in the future we might not be able to find enough energy . So, we need to start. We need to start thinking about the future, like--\n Jobs and stuff.\n No, future things that are like, the future and what's going to happen and energy and how are we going to have a good supply. Like what if we were running out and start thinking about that?\n Okay, so the next person.  Okay, so the people on the outside, if you were recording the vocabulary last time, I want the people on the outside to switch so that you're recording something different. So if you did evidence first, switch to vocabulary. If you did vocabulary, switch to evidence.\n Oh, Sindi, sit like right here. \n Okay, this question is why do you think President Obama might support building nuclear power plants in the U.S., and based on the video we watched, what are some arguments to be made for nuclear energy?\n I think President Obama might support building nuclear power plants in the U.S. because it doesn't release chemicals, therefore it's eco-friendly, making the U.S. more green. Environmentally, green.\n I agree with her, because another reason I think the president might support it is because, like, like right now we're in an economic crisis, what you call the thing? And then like making new plants may create more jobs for people. It'll create jobs for building them, and then it'll also benefit everybody for clean power.\n  I agree. \n I agree because it builds economic stabilization, and it'll create jobs for the future, like, for more years, because in order to run a nuclear power plant you need, you know, like, to build it. And once it's built, you still need to work with it so I think the job's going to last for a while.\n I agree.\n  But if we're in an economic crisis, like if we're in an economic crisis how are you going to pay for it? Like, where's the money going to come from?\n Well, we're already in debt, so we'll get even more debt.\n  Yeah, it costs a lot to build a nuclear reactor.\n We'd get funding.\n  Yeah.\n And we have to, like, think about the future and how it's going to benefit, you know, for the economy and making more power plants would just provide, like, a stable future for the upcoming people and the jobs because it supplies more jobs and stuff.\n  And more, you know, we'll get more electricity. You know, if we build more nuclear power plants.\n Yeah, and not just 20%, but more like the other countries who have 30 and stuff like that--\n  needs luxuries, rising electricity demands. It won't leave the U.S. behind and all the new tech stuff? \n  And the more factories, and the more power plants we produce, we make, the more electricity and the more factories, it will get more stuff. It will build the more jobs, and that will raise up the economic problems.\n Yeah, because more stuff will be done that way.\n So, now you guys have given a lot of arguments supporting nuclear energy. What do you think is the biggest problem with nuclear energy that we should be aware of?\n The thing that causes cancer.\n Probably be the radioactive waste that the nuclear power plants give off. Well, they don't give it off, the water, the coolant or whatever. And then, like, they don't have nowhere to store it. I think it was some cave thingy that they were trying to build, but they didn't build.\n  They're going to run out of space to put the waste in. \n  Also, it's going to cause cancer to everyone.\n But doesn't it cure cancer and stuff?\n It has benefits, but more like some freak accident can happen, like what happened in Fukushima.\n Or the third mile.\n At the Three Mile?\n Yeah. \n So, say you never know what can happen, that's the downside. Because if it does happen, then it's like downhill from there because people start getting sick, then their kids start dying, and I don't know.\n Yeah, and like Giovanni said, if we are in an economic crisis, like where are we going to get the rest of the money? We're just going to get it from debt and stuff like that. We're going to help raise it up, but we'll also fall more in debt.\n Yeah.\n Going back to the nuclear waste, can someone elaborate on why is the nuclear waste such a problem?\n Because it's just there--\n Kevin?\n  I think nuclear waste will cause more wars and pollution. That's what I think.\n  Cause more what?\n  It causes more war and pollution.\n  War?\n  Well, I mean.  This isn't on camera, right? \n Okay, someone else?\n Wait, what was the question again?\n Elaborate on what is nuclear waste?\n Nuclear waste?\n Why is that such a problem for us?\n Well, it's a problem because there's nowhere where you could actually safely put it. Other than like, I think they have this, I read something about they have an island where all the waste of nuclear waste goes. That's the only place that you can, like, get rid of it. Don't throw it in the ocean because it'll contaminate everything. You can't just, like, leave it in the ground because then it'll probably like leak.\n And also, doesn't it, if it rains, if water gets in it, it's dangerous? So, that's why they have to find a place where it's not like--\n Why is it dangerous if water gets into it? \n Soil, I guess?\n  The waste and the water mix and then, like, it runs down into the soil and it might go into the ocean or the sewers and it'll mess up the ocean, or, like, water--\n And we end up drinking it.\n  And scientists are trying to find ways to get rid of the waste, like they're thinking of shooting it out into space or anything. \n One thing nobody talked about was half-life. What does the half-life have to do with nuclear waste?\n I think a bunch of years.\n  What does it have to do with Obama? \n Say it louder.\n What?\n Say it louder.\n We're talking about that noise. \n Wait, what was your question?\n What does half-life have to do with nuclear waste?\n Half-life, nuclear waste.\n So, energy?\n So, why is nuclear waste bad exactly?\n Oh, because they haven't determined the amount of years of when the half-life is. I think they determined like So they, so it was an estimate. It wasn't actually a fact, they just estimated that, so it could be before, so they wouldn't be able to prevent, to prevent it from affecting society.\n Oh, good. So, let's just get this done. Let's try the next group, okay? Thank you. \n I know, Bryan.\n I don't need to look it up. I know this already.\n Okay. Do you guys want to break before you go up? Okay, you guys get one or two minutes to prep yourself.  So it's not a shock  Okay, question number three, let's come up. People seem anxious, let's do this.  Okay, no phone Diana. \n We're missing people.\n Yeah, we are. Okay, so people on the outside, you guys should switch. So, if you did evidence, you know. So, what you did one time evidence, looking for evidence, and one time you're looking for vocabulary. Okay? So, people on the outside make sure you're checking different parts. Okay, so what, I might change the question, you guys.\n What?\n It happens. Okay, number three. What recommendations would you make to President Obama regarding clean energy and climate change? So, for example, they're trying to build two nuclear power plants in Georgia. So, what recommendations will you make to him about building in Georgia?\n Building in jorj-ee-uh?\n Georgia, the state.\n Um, I think he should make sure that employees aren't making careless mistakes such as the human error in the Three Mile Island.\n  I think that he should promote programs on alternative energy, but not just nuclear energy. But he could also use nuclear energy because it could, because the field cost and operating cost is low and 20% of our energy already comes from nuclear energy. So, we could just get more energy through nuclear power.\n  I think we shouldn't use it because of, it causes harm to people and you never know when an accident happens, and it might hurt the environment and it leads to cancer.\n Okay, nuclear energy affects public safety and it creates, nuclear power plants create toxic waste.\n  I would still try to build a nuclear power plant because it could also boost our economy when it's most struggling.\n  Recommendations I would make to Obama regarding nuclear energy is that, to stop because it's too dangerous to handle, and that if it gets in the hands of terrorists, they can use it to murder, to murder me or destroy countries. We can't prevent natural disasters from destroying nuclear power plants, then the nuclear radiation, which is unstable, can harm by radioactivity, and a nuclear spill has happened in the past with human error that hit Fukushima. And this means that it can happen to anyone, even us. That's what I wrote.\n I think it could be a good idea, but I think they should focus more on how it could harm people, to try and control the harmfulness so it won't harm people. Yeah, I think it's a good idea.\n I think my recommendation for Obama is that it is not good to  nuclear because it's going to affect us, it's going to affect our pollution. And he's going to spend like more energy on that and he can save more money if he didn't do that.\n Yeah, I agree with Charlie, too. We don't know what nuclear energy could also, like, harm us, which ways. Or, I mean we do, but I mean, it's better. Like we could just focus on studying more, like, having more thoughts. Like, ask him what's better? It's like to choose nuclear plants or to keep using what we're using now.\n So, I have to change one question. Based on all the videos and the articles you guys saw and read, what argument has influenced you the most?\n  The Fukushima argument.\n So, go ahead and explain it to the group, though.\n Because, um, things happen and they just prove to us that they can also happen to us, like human error. And I think they made people evacuate the cities and the damage, the area which is, nobody can go because it's radioactive, and they have to wait for the atoms to decay which is like, I don't know, thousands of years just for the half-life, and we won't be able to use that space anymore. It kills everything. People got cancer.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 1072 SCI AYA 1072edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.220882], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Multiple"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Multiple"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Jane"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Jane"], ["Teacher"], ["Jane"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Multiple"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Multiple"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Kevin"], ["Teacher"], ["Kevin"], ["Multiple"], ["Kevin"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW07", "TW08", "TW24TW08"]}, "1073": {"text": " Counting on that. I agree with AJ, but also I think that... What I want to say is that it kind of adds a lot more risk when they get rid of the space shuttle because kind of like what AJ was saying, it's good to have a backup just in case you want it. And we still do need to go up to space every now and again if we want to maintain stuff up there. So we know that, so we're having other people work with it, but the problem is, is that actually adds more risk because now we have to deal with the fact that, \"What if they messed up? \"What if they blow up \"or do something wrong?\" And if they're not as stringent on safety standards as we are then there's gonna be a lot more problems and if it's not able to do the same things that's going to be completely bad, too.\n Okay, Eric said, \"Go up to fix things.\" What would be some things that we would need to make sure that we're going up to maintain in space? Just to kind of follow up.\n  International Space Station.\n Okay, International Space Station.\n Some of the satellites we have in orbit.\n Okay, satellites that do what for us?\n Television and communication.\n Okay.\n Ms. McCall, what's that one with the sun that is predicting the sun flares?\n  You can just write Sun Probe.\n Sun probe.\n  That's fine. Excuse me while I turn this on.\n  And the Hubble.\n Hubble's gone a lot longer than they expected it to, so if it breaks, we'd want to repair it.\n Especially since we don't have a new one.\n Alana.\n I know how Mer was talking about the risks, like with the Challenger and that was really devastating, but I remember the wife whose husband died on Challenger. She said that he knew the risks. That's part of being an astronaut and being in NASA and willing to go up there and you're risking your life. It's not like they went in there totally blind about that. I think that's kind of the price of gaining so much knowledge about something so unknown right now. We have to be able to risk our lives to get it and if they have people willing to do that, I say go for it.\n  Okay, Blanca and then Megan.\n I get what she's saying with they risked their lives, but you're also risking... the money and time that everyone has put into it. They spent all this time and all this money on these ginormous space things and to put them up into space. And like the Challenger it just exploded and they didn't even really get that far just for one minor error. And I don't think they should cut all the way like they were saying. Have it just when you need it, but it's still a lot of money that our country doesn't really have right now, so maybe it's not the most important thing and there's other things that they need to fix before they can go back to putting more money into that.\n  We'll go Megan, then Bieber.\n So, you know how we're paying Russia to fly up to the International Space Station? I think what we should do is have a shuttle and have people pay us to ride up to the space station. Because then we have more funding for NASA and then we have a shuttle. Then people know they can get us instead of giving all this money to Russia to fly up there. I feel like we should still have our own shuttle so that we can fly up, not for free, but we can fly up with the United States and then have open seats for other countries who need to come in. They can pay us for it and then we get the money.\n  Okay, Bieber, you need to sit close. Eli, then we'll go Rachel.\n I don't know what color to show, but Russia's not making a profit off of us riding up there. They're just trying to cover their costs. It's not like we'll be doing good business ferrying people to the International Space Station. It's not like a tourist attraction or anything. It's pretty bland up there. Russia's just trying to pay to get us up there. That's the cost of flying somebody there. They're not making profit out of it.\n  Okay, good, that's a downpoint. Rachel?\n  I agree with what Eli said and also, people were talking earlier about... jobs and how it creates a bunch of jobs. And I think I read somewhere that they created 25,000 jobs or something like that. But if you think about it, if there's 300 million people, that's still less than 1% of the population. So, while it seems like a big number, it's still not creating as many jobs and we could be creating other jobs somewhere else. Especially with the economy, so we could be spending the money that we would be spending on NASA on something else to help boost our economy before we start focusing more on NASA and spending billions of dollars.\n  Amber, then Clark.\n I was going to say I kind of agree with that because our economy is so bad right now. Any kind of job that is offered will be really good for us right now, at this point in time. So, I don't think cutting the funding for it would be a really smart idea because that's also putting a lot of people out of work.\n  Clark.\n The statistics with the jobs created are probably from when NASA was being used a lot and now that it's been cut down already all those jobs have already been cut. And I don't think in this economy, people need jobs requiring that much education... not everybody has that kind of education to have a job like that. People just need regular jobs in general.\n So, you're saying their employment would be kind of geared towards upper level educated as opposed to maybe...\n And like in science and stuff and not everybody has that.\n That's a downpoint. Luis.\n Going back to the billions of dollars that are wasted or could be used for better things, I found out that the funding for NASA only accounts for 0.7% of the US government spending. I feel like if you just cut all of that, that's not really going to make a huge difference when the government's spending 99.3% on other things.\n  We'll go Hallie, then Troy.\n Going back to the risk of sending people out into space, I researched and... I found out that the risk of manned space flights are actually increasing because the budget cuts have already happened. As we're pushing for more people and more money, we're actually hurting ourselves more because the safety and quality assurance programs have been trimmed back. The risk is just becoming more and more.\n That's an interesting point. As we're slowly cutting back on the budgets already, we're automatically increasing that risk because of those budget cuts. Troy?\n I actually support... them cutting the budget because... for one, when they cut budget, they're setting aside money to... buy more space exploration from private companies. Those people are more likely to employ more employees than the government, which also stimulates the economy a lot more. I mean, if everybody's employed by the government, like what could happen to Greece.\n Okay, Shannon hasn't spoken, Bieber.\n Kind of off of what Holly said with the risk and everything going up, I did a little research and with NASA, there was only a 4.1% fatality rate. Out of something like 439 astronauts, there have only been 18 deaths. I feel like there are other jobs with a higher fatality rate than being an astronaut.\n Okay, so even with the budget cuts, we're not seeing this huge increase... Jillian.\n A lot of people are making the points that it's only affecting the people that are on the space shuttles, but at the same time, I don't think people realize the amount of carbon dioxide... put off by one shuttle launch. It's 28 tons of carbon dioxide and it's killing... the plants and fish around the site area and it has a lot of negative effect on everyone, not just the people in the space shuttle.\n So, you're taking the environmental aspect. Besides looking at costs, besides looking at jobs, there's this environmental piece specifically with carbon dioxide. What is the issue associated with carbon dioxide, Jillian?\n The ozone layer depleted... and global warming.\n Thank you, global warming. Tyler?\n To go along with what Luis said, they only get 0.7% of the national spending, but we also have gained more knowledge from NASA than any other government thing. We can discover maybe how Earth is going to end, and we can discover things that are more important than other government, government spending.\n So, you're kind of going at the idea that the benefits are outweighing the small amount of cost when we compare government spending. We'll go Eli, then Justin.\n Also, Luis said it doesn't account for very much of the US budget and if we cut that spending, it's really not going to go to anything more productive. Maybe more guns or something. It's not going to feed the world and buy food for homeless people. It's just going to go to corporations and wars. And then in regards to CO2 emissions... does anyone know how much CO2 emissions a moose puts out in a year? Far more than a truck driver. Cows and moose. I think they can flirt over that. I think that's just moose. \n So, you're making the comparison to say the idea that even though it's a human-made craft, if we look at natural sources of the CO2 emission...\n And the relative frequency that a moose passes gas. A space shuttle launch doesn't have that big of an effect on the environment.\n Touche. Anyone have a cup that hasn't spoken yet, that wants to jump in real quick? Justin.\n Going off of what Tyler said, if we stop funding NASA, then we pretty much cut off studying anything outside of our solar system because of the atmosphere of Earth just doesn't allow us to see that far. So, it would lessen the chances of seeing the birth of a star or the death of a star or where earth might be heading in the future.\n Interesting point. Amber, then Eric.\n Besides everything about the jobs, NASA has created a lot of things that have helped us today, different technologies. Like in someone's presentation, they were saying something about they're creating lighter systems for firefighters, and then cosmetic companies are even using their stuff. So, there's a lot of technology that's been created because of NASA, so I think it's benefited us a lot more than it hasn't helped us.\n And so, you're saying those products that have been produced because of the exploration are useful to us in our everyday lives. It's not just useful for exploring many new things. I forgot my order. Was it Eric on that one?\n I have a couple different connections. One of them's with the cost. Like they're saying, it's 0.7% of the total budget, but the thing is, not only is it that low of a cost, it's 14 billion, just to give you an actual number. It's 14 billion dollars for the entire budget of NASA. This year, just for this year alone. To give you a comparison, it's around $640 between $680 for the military budget. That is 47 times more expensive. Now you can say, \"Well, alright, that's the military.\" The thing is that first of all, it has a lot higher mortality rate. Second of all, it's... a lot less productive in general. I mean, we're pretty much paying people to kill other people on the planet. I'm sorry, but that's not very cool in general. For one of those things, we're trying to get a high fatality rate, not for our side but the other side. But the other thing is that for jobs creations, if you want to create more jobs and you're going for a more positive feel, you wouldn't decrease funding for NASA, you would increase funding. Because, think about it. If you increased it 47 times to the military, I'm pretty sure you'd get a lot more than one million even a lot, lot more than just one million jobs from NASA, if you increased this funding a lot, because imagine whole new planets. Just for environment alone is the fact that we have seven billion people on this planet, and with seven billion people, we can't hold that many people very long on this planet. But there are so many other planets out there, that we could easily fit everyone. There's enough planets in this entire galaxy for each person to have their own planet. That's how many planets there are.\n So, you're thinking planning for the future, that it might be beneficial for us. Holly.\n As I was researching, I found out that there's really no short-term benefits and we're not guaranteed long-term benefits. Yes, we are learning about things outside of our solar system and universe, but the main goal of studying outside the universe is so eventually it could help us. We're not guaranteed to find some new way to cure cancer or to protect the earth from... magnetic storms. There might be some way we can save ourselves, but we're not guaranteed that.\n So, you're saying the unknown part of that research kind of plays into  the factor. We can keep researching, but we may never find the answer. Monique, you got some info?\n Yeah, I think when Hepetiah said how benefits outweigh the budget and the risks, we've talked about what was up there. The benefits are so much longer than what we have in the risk section. We gain knowledge, we need to study, the sun probe and Hubble and International Space Station. With jobs, it provides a whole section of jobs, having shuttles go up to space. Not only that, but they've created new inventions through that, and I think the inventions they have created is really important at home and in the hospital. Going from there, there's going to be more. Not just stopping now.\n So again, tying in the cost-benefit analysis, that the benefits are much more outweighing the costs. A.J. and then we'll go Alana.\n I guess to counter what Troy said and what a few people have said, when they talk about that more jobs can be created using the money. It's not just about the economy. When you think about it, NASA wasn't meant to help the economy at all, and it wasn't meant for job creation, even though it has employed so many people. Through the research that I did, there was a story from somebody that's going to be retiring just because he knows he'd lose his job anyway. He said that, \"After 30 years, this is all I know.\" We're losing the most brilliant minds our country has, because they just don't know what else to do. NASA's been open for decades and that's their job. Technicians and analysts, they're not going to just become accountants or something. There's nothing after NASA. That's probably the highest, most prestigious thing. What do you do after that? It's not like they're just going to fill minimum wage jobs, which is what most people are looking for right now, anyway, if you're thinking about job creation.\n It's a good point, you have all these highly educated, specialized people as A.J. points out. Where are they going to go? Are they going to be able to find jobs within our country? Are they going to go overseas and then maybe be helpful and more productive for other countries? It's a good point. Alana, then Troy.\n I know we're talking a lot about the cost-benefit and job creation, but I want to go back to the safety, and I have a question for everyone just to think about. The main part in all the failed missions, especially with the shuttle and the Challenger, it's basically been human error. You know they talk about how the higher guys wouldn't listen, that it was too cold outside and the ring would break and  everything, but I've been thinking: what if we were to use some sort of higher technology instead of relying on human    and the possible errors that we make. Like robots, we use robots to build half our cars, and that probably cuts down a lot on the human error rate. So, do you think using more robotic and higher technology than just humans, would that help in any way with the safety issue and the errors that we make?\n  That's an interesting point. We'll have to put that on the question board. Troy, what you got?\n Kind of to counter what A.J. said, these people are highly educated. Minimum wage places are probably the ones that are hiring the least. Companies with a lot of money are the ones that are hiring them now. People that have... highly specialized degrees, they're really intelligent and they could be working at places like in finance. Those people are being hired a lot more than people that have financial degrees. If you can do quantitative physics, those people are going to be hired a lot more than someone who's just a finance agent.\n So, your counterpoint is the idea that because they're so highly educated, they will find some sort of a niche.\n Yeah. There's a lot of people that actually get degrees in rocket science and end up going into finance because it pays better.\n Interesting. Jillian?\n Back to what Alana said, if you're using robots to make it safer, that's also just going to cost more money to make those robots and to find people that can make those robots. If you're using robots as the engineers, then you're having people lose jobs.\n Interesting point. So, kind of a counterpoint to... shifting our focus from human exploration to robotics, there's some drawback association. We'll go Rachel.\n Going back to what Eric said a while ago, he was talking about the military and it has a higher budget, but I feel like the military helps a lot of people, and it creates a lot of jobs and educates people, because the military pays for a lot of people's education, university and stuff. I know a lot of people now, since university is so expensive, a lot of people are going into the military so they can get their education paid for. So, I feel like it should have a higher budget because it's creating so many jobs and especially for people who aren't necessarily... has a doctorate in physics or something. People that are really smart, like what Troy said, they won't really have that much of a problem finding jobs, especially with a big corporation. They don't have to necessarily work for the government or NASA or something. So, I think that the budget should stay where it is, because that's pretty funny.\n  We'll go Megan and Tyler.\n I don't know when it was mentioned, but we were talking about how we're trying to find how the earth will be when all has failed, and I feel like with all the carbon dioxide emitted and with our atmosphere right now, we're trying to discover what our world will be like when all of that's gone. I feel like that's really important for the development of Earth, is to know what it's going to be like when there is no more. What can we do so that we don't turn into a Mars or Venus? What can we do now to stop it from happening?\n Good, so you're making connections to maybe the video when they talked about the future if there's an issue with our magnetosphere. Potentially could we wind up like Mars? So, kind of getting a jumpstart to say where we are headed, future-wise. So, almost like a selfish need to figure out what's going on out there and where we might go. Anyone that hasn't spoken yet want to comment?\n", "filename": ["Copy of 1073 SCI AYA 1073edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0848766], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Girl"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Eric"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Rachel"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW08", "TW24TW08"]}, "1071": {"text": "  Today is Wednesday.\n Yes, I would clone myself.\n Good, why? Why would you clone yourself?\n Because everybody deserves a second me. \n So you would just...\n And I would clone a woolly mammoth for my clone to ride on.  Honestly...\n What would some of the negatives to cloning something like that?\n  Well, it's another me . But it's still good, because, you know, I'm me, and I'm good and bad.\n Do you know your clone is not going to be, like, set, right? You're gonna have to wait for it to grow up.\n So, I have to raise a little baby clone of me? \n Yes.\n And it'll look just like me when I was a baby?\n Pretty much.\n Oh, that's wrong!  Oh, my God. There are so many possibilities.\n Alright. So, let's start off with...\n I'll get it a baby .\n Raise your hand if you can remind us, like, what is cloning? There's only one of you?\n Like taking the DNA, or, like, I don't know, like, whatever, out of one person, like, trying to, like duplicate it into another one?\n Okay,great. We're all... well, was there only, like, one type of cloning? What were some of the different types?\n Well, one type of cloning is only tissues and organs only, and another one is, let's see, animal and livestock cloning.\n Anything else you want to add to that? Gady? So, what's one way they do the cloning? So, they take the DNA from one animal, what do they do?\n  \n Do you remember what parts they used? Like what kind of cell they used?\n  Nucleus?\n They did take the nucleus. And they used?\n  \n The eggs of the other animal. Okay, it's kind of interesting. You can take the egg from one animal and completely change its DNA. So, now when that turns into a new organism, it's an identical copy of the animal that it came from.\n And if you take... you can bring back endangered species, too. Because remember that  or whatever, then they put in the cow?\n Yeah.\n But they were, like, related in some kind of way, so it wasn't, like, weird.\n That's true. It was probably a decendent. Do you guys remember that from the video? They had tried to take an animal that was almost extinct, in fact, they couldn't actually do the tests on the animal. Remember, they were saying that there were so few of them that they couldn't even do the tests on them? Right? How long did  last? Does anyone remember?\n  Three days.\n Yeah, it was about three days, right. But it was the first time.\n So, when they couldn't open up that cow, the cow died, right?\n I don't know that for sure, but I'm guessing that they were not that interested in the cow medically. They were...\n Oh, no, I was just wondering because there's a cow sitting there with a giant gaping hole in its womb.\n That's true. That does happen.\n I mean, I don't care if the cow died, honestly. That's another hamburger for me. But that Goward? That Goward? That's swole. You can't get any other animal like that.\n Anybody else in here agree that it's okay to do that testing to save endangered species?\n Well yeah, because if there's like a hundred million cows and one... whatever that thing was called... \n So, we should probably try and get more of them?\n Yeah, why not?\n Okay.\n We should clone pandas.\n Let's hear somebody else, though. Is there anybody else that has....\n \n I said,  alligator.  try and bring it back.\n That's true. What happens when there's so many? I mean, how many of you have ever watched the movie Jurassic Park?\n Oh, my God, I've seen all of them at least twice.\n So, that's a good question. So, if we can bring back something that looks like a cow, fabulous. What happens when you want to bring something that looks just as cool, but has bigger teeth?\n Well, you see, it breaks out of the cage, like in Jurassic Park the Lost World, and it starts attacking all the...\n Great.\n Well, yeah, it kind of started eating people.\n That was wrong.\n Fabulous, but what could be some of the downfalls on that? Like, any negatives to cloning animals that are endangered or almost extinct?\n Well, hardly any of the \n You need to...\n The DNA might get messed up \n Yeah, but remember that when we're messing around with the DNA, yeah, maybe there could be a mistake. What happens then?\n \n It could die.\n It could die, yes.\n I would say. One good thing about bringing dinosaurs back is that you finally get to study them the way we want to.\n That's probably what scientists are thinking. \"Wouldn't that be great if I could study something and actually be able to touch it and see what it does?\" Because a lot of things they tell you about, you know, dinosaurs, is what they think they do. \"Well, we think they eat this,\" and, \"We think this is how they lived.\" Wouldn't it be great if we could actually study those?\n What if dinosaurs were never real?\n Well, they found skeleton remains, so they're pretty much sure they were around.\n They also found .  Because you can't just stick an animal in an environment and maybe it will survive, because it will mess up the chain of life.\n Anthony has a really good point, because what's going to happen if we have dinosaurs? We can't just stick them somewhere for them to roam around. Because they don't have anything they can naturally eat anymore. And they don't have any natural predators anymore.\n That's why you just bring back T-rexes and velociraptors. And what not. Then, you just feed them cows. \n You don't know if they necessarily eat cows, though. You don't know that.\n Well, it's meat.\n It is meat, but that's also your food source.\n Well, that's not going to be . Maybe eight or nine. Maybe 25 for a T-Rex. \n You're underestimating the size of some of these animals. But the same thing applies to actual animals, instead of just dinosaurs. What happens if we have animals that are going extinct because we are building new houses, and we're expanding our cities? So, we're moving into some areas where there are some animals, and they start to die off because we are taking over their land? So yeah, we could make a hundred copies of these animals, or whether it's plants, or birds, or certain insects. But that is a good question - where are they going to live if we just bring them back?\n Wildlife park.\n So, that is a good thing. And again, remember that you all add  because if you put them somewhere that  a park, they won't necessarily survive. So, you might need to think about all the other stuff that goes with that. So, yeah, the food chain. Interesting, how everything's connected. Raise your hand if you'd like to share one of your questions from yesterday. We'll start with Anthony.\n Okay, so like say me and this lady get married. We both can't have kids, so they take my DNA and they make a clone of me. I'm married to this person. Would that be only my child, or would that be our child?\n \n And if, why?\n \n Maybe, yeah.\n But what if you're married?\n \n Well, does it require two people that has your DNA? I'm sorry I didn't hear you.\n \n Maybe, it is. Maybe it's totally the environment. Who's to say? Maybe if you raise it, and you're like, \"This is our kid...\"\n Well, because of that case, then, there can't be any more like if we depended on cloning, there woudn't be any...  well, there'd be less drama in the world, because we wouldn't be... doing stuff the natural way. And, like, people being knocked up in bars and stuff,  and random places, and stuff, and, like, not knowing their father in life, you know. But you know what I'm saying, right?\n Do you think it would be hard?\n Like, what if people were 100% dependent on this? There would be a lot less problems.\n Eventually, if you keep cloning yourself, and then your clone cloned itself, and your clone clones itself...\n You'd have the same group of people.\n You'd have the best group ever.\n Yeah, but how would you know because you wouldn't be here.\n That's dumb, that's what that is.\n That's interesting.\n We can't have just a bunch of the same people. That'd be one stupid... That'd be dumb, man. \n I don't know. Walking around seeing all the same people?\n That's stupid! You're not going be like \n Like the Matrix, everything repeating?\n Other questions. Let's get one from a female this time. We got the guys' questions. Let's get a girl. Don't all shout out all at once. Mayra, what's one of your questions?\n I said, like, if they clone a sheep, and it's like, sick, wouldn't it... or let's say there's  a regular sheep, and they clone that, wouldn't the clone be sick, too?\n What did she say?\n Not necessarily.\n No, because it's like you said, it's two entire different bodies of life. A lot of things can go wrong in one person. So, how could it just be the same thing, two different ? Unless it's like a problem with an organ that the one had, and then .\n Well, I want to say that, like, a disesased kid \n Maybe. What about, remember, you just did genetics, right? If it's in your DNA, what would happen?\n If it was in your DNA...\n \n It probably would get it. If it was something that it caught, it probably wouldn't get it.\n That's true. So it depends, I guess, maybe what it is. Right? So you have this sheep, just cloned it, and because it has something very serious with it, and if it's genetic, then yeah, there's probably a chance that that clone would probably have the exact same disorder later on. I think they were showing... Remember when they were doing Dolly and they showed some of the animals they had cloned? I think they were talking about the sheep, Dolly, and then they had some mice that they had cloned. They had said that the animals  they had cloned... does anyone remember what any of the side effects... what they've noticed?\n  \n Sometimes they can't breathe right. What else?\n  \n Sometimes they died really young. So, just because it's a clone... maybe we haven't quite figured it out yet. Because it seems like maybe there are some issues with the animals actually coming out healthy or normal, if they're dying younger or having problems growing. Other questions? Hector, what is one of your questions? Or, if you don't have your questions ready, or you feel like  your questions were answered, maybe you just have a comment. \n You have none? What do you think about cloning?  Do you agree with it? Or are there are certain places or times you would agree with it?\n Um, I agree with it. Like, the pros I would agree with it,  like, for food?\n For what?\n Like cloning for more food?\n Oh, like the chickens? Right? Cloning to make more chickens. Wouldn't it be great if I have a perfect chicken, and I could make a hundred copies of the same perfect chicken? \n I've had all types of chickens. They all taste the same. \n That's true.\n Everything tastes like chicken.\n But have you ever gotten like a really tiny drumstick, and then you got like the nice meaty drumstick?\n Well, like a tiny little drumstick. They still taste good. \n True, but what one gives you more food?\n You got a point there.\n Okay, so maybe, right...\n But still, you could put them together...\n In the case of KFC, the reason why their chicken's so big is because they put hormones in them to make them big.\n Yes. That's the way they approach that.\n That's the best way to do that right there.\n Not really. People get cancer from that.\n So, would this be a good solution? So instead of making... eating... our cows and feeding pigs, and feeding chickens these extra vitamins and extra hormones, to make them larger and grow faster, would it better to just take the large, big cows and just clone them? Or make chicken and make copies of it? Yes? No?\n Does anyone see any... maybe. This sounds really great, like we're going to make these big meaty chickens so that everybody has a lot of chicken that they can eat, but is there any downside to that?\n No. Honestly, no, I don't think so.\n Not for you. Great. Is there anybody else?\n Money.\n Money how?\n They could cost more to , but they could cost less and be more affordable, which is what we want.\n Good. Money is a good issue, right? People won't have to think about money issues?\n I don't think there'd be a money issue if you were cloning chickens, because you can always just get, you know, take a syringe and, like...\n But that's what he was saying, that maybe it'd be cheaper if they could make it without using as much stuff.\n Yeah.\n Mm-hmm.\n It would take longer.\n What do you guys think about the cloning for body parts?\n Can I go back to the chickens for a second?\n Sure, go for it.\n Wouldn't there be a lot less farmers, so then there'd be a lot less jobs because, you know, like the whole...\n That is true.\n Like a lot of companies will go out of business because, I don't know, I feel like there's like a monopoly on it,\n More private industries are going to go out of business, and that's going to destroy livelihoods. Because all the big livestock companies like KFC and McDonald's... well, they're not a livestock company, they're fast food.\n But they're going to be selling it to those , right? They're going to let it go off of...\n Just by show of hands, who in here might have a problem eating food if they knew that it had been genetically messed around with?\n That's just because you guys are okay with dying. \n Chris, not sure, or does it just kind of...\n I don't care, really. \n What was the question?\n Oh, I said would you be bothered if you ate genetically modified food?\n No, before that. The one before Anthony started talking.\n We were trying to see if there was any downside of cloning chickens.\n We'll get there. I know the question. We'll get there.\n I want to say something.\n We'll get there. Alright. Erica. Medical, the cloning the body parts, like if people are sick and they need a new heart, or new lungs, or a new kidney.\n Ms. Scott, I wrote the name of it. It's called Therapeutic Cloning. They refer to it that way. So, that's what it's called when you do that.\n So when we're using it, for cloning for the organs for individuals who have issues, whether it's, like just a few cells, or like nervous cells for people who had spinal cord injuries... what do you think about that?\n I think it's a good idea.\n It's a good idea? Do you have any reasons to be worried about that?\n \n It would be better than nothing? Any concerns. Anybody else?\n Have you heard of of a book called ? What was it called?\n \n I don't think I have. What's it about?\n \n That's okay.  Levon is going to have to read it now, because he'll be like, \"What?\"\n It's about, like, in the future, will people, if parents don't want their kids any more, they can, like, they can give them a , like they can take their other body parts off and... they can take their other body parts off of them and stuff, so they  like your body parts are still alive,  so one arm could be like your real arm, and your other arm could be like .\n Interesting. I'll have to read that book sometime. Now, when they're doing the therapeutic cloning, they're not actually creating, like, a whole new human, and then  the body parts up. There's a couple of different ways they were doing it.\n \n Do you remember what they were using to... how they were growing the organs?\n \n That is true. But what were they trying to do with the cloning? How are they trying to avoid that? Do you remember? Does anybody remember? How is cloning supposed to help your body to keep from rejecting? Because...\n Do you guys remember what happened to the woman...\n Close. Very close to that.  So, remember when you get a body organ, like the lady with the kidney, right? Who'd she get the kidney from?\n  Her aunt.\n Yeah, so she got it from her aunt. Somebody she was not even related to that just happens to be part of the family. Like, they were a match. She had to take... remember all of those pills she had to take? To make sure her body doesn't, like, get rid of the kidney. And then, unfortunately, it still did? So, they're looking at getting, making kidneys, and I think that they were growing them inside of a cow. I think it was a cow. Might have been a pig. It was a big animal.\n So, you're going to grow human kidneys that are functional?\n Mm hmm.\n On a cow? They were using another animal, and they were actually growing it, like, not in the animal. It wasn't part of the animal. They were using the animal as a place to keep it growing and functioning.\n So on the outside of a cow, there'd be kidneys.\n Underneath the skin. Yep. And then they would take take them out, and transplant them into humans.\n This is like that episode of South Park where... it's a little bit inappropriate, but not too much.\n Then let's not go there. It's a little too inappropriate, then let's not.\n Nevermind. Nevermind. You're going to watch it for yourself.\n Fabulous. But they are also trying, by cloning, because remember a lot of times they're trying to find animal parts that might match. Like for example, did you know a pig heart is about the same size as a human heart?\n So, you could have a pig heart?\n They were thinking about taking pig hearts and transplanting them into people that needed new hearts. The problem is, of course, is it's a pig's heart, which means the outside of the heart looks like, pig cells. So, your body would know that it's not a human heart. It would know that it's a pig heart. And your body probably won't want that in its body. So, they were trying, remember they had, trying to grow new pigs? I think they had little piglets running around? The pigs had human DNA in there to make the outside of their hearts and the outside of their lungs, and kidneys all kind of copy what a human cell would look like on the outside? So, that when they keep those body parts, if they put them in a human, your body wouldn't recognize it as being something different.\n \n Did you know they've actually done that?\n My dad's friend's daughter has pig intestines.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 1071 SCI AYA 1071edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.185836], "annotations": [["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Gady"], ["NaN"], ["Gady"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW08", "TW19"]}, "289": {"text": " Look at your station one information. And the question we posed in station one was does temperature affect the rate of chemical weather. And yesterday, you guys constructed a graph to show that data. Why is it useful to construct a graph in science class? Sky?\n Because it's a visual way to show you information.\n It's a visual way to show you information. I have a case up here as an example. Based on that graph, what does that pattern reveal about our question? Gabrielle.\n The cooler the temperature the more the, I mean, more increases in time.\n The more what increases in time?\n The more uh weather.\n Okay, anybody want to restate that, Rebecca?\n The colder it is, the more time it takes to weather.\n Very good. The colder it is, the more time it takes to weather. If we're talking about dissolving a tablet, is that chemical weathering or mechanical weathering? Logan?\n Chemical weathering.\n Chemical weathering. So the colder it is, the longer it takes for the chemical weathering to occur. Would you agree? Thumbs up or thumbs down. Thumbs up, I would agree. Now I want to talk about, so what? Why does it matter to us. Why does it matter in our daily lives. Talk about it for one minute, record your thoughts on your wipe board, and be ready to share back. \n We could consider where to build our stuff...\n In what types of areas would you have to be specifically and particularly hot? What about up north? You've got 30 seconds to finish writing your thoughts. \n Okay, it might dissolve faster in a warmer place. Or, what type of rock would I want to avoid? Limestone, why? \n Okay, very good, very good. Alright, let's share some of our ideas with the class. Info managers, table three, what did you find?\n If you live in a cold environment, there will be less chemical weathering, than there is in a warm place.\n Good point, if you live in a cooler environment, there will be less chemical weathering than in a warm climate. Who's gonna be particularly concerned with this? What, for instance, job field is gonna be concerned with this idea? Forrest?\n Construction?\n That would be one area, what else?\n Statue building?\n Yeah, any kind of artist who's designing statues. What type of rock would you want to avoid if you're living in a warm area? And you know that chemical weathering could be a problem. What rock would you avoid? Patrick?\n Limestone.\n Limestone. Do you guys have some proof for me? Somewhere in your data as to why we should avoid limestone? Which station, Alex?\n Station three.\n Flip to station three for me. At station three, who can explain to me what the lab was that you did? Someone I haven't heard from, Colin?\n We put one small piece of chalk into a bottle of vinegar and a small piece of chalk into water, and we saw if the acid from the vinegar dissolved the chalk and if the water dissolved the chalk. And the chalk didn't dissolve in the water, but the acid made it fizz, bubble, and it was just dissolving.\n And why did we use chalk? What is chalk a type of? What is chalk a type of, Jeremy?\n It's a type of limestone.\n It's a type of limestone. So your evidence showed that yes, limestone weathers quickly with acid. Why is acid a part of our environment? How does it become part of our environment? Andrea?\n Acid rain.\n Acid rain, acid rain. Now, as we grow up it's important that you're environmental advocates. That you fight for protecting our environment. What types of things can you do in your lives to cut down on acid rain? Give me two ideas on your wipe boards. Two ideas. \n Is that polluting our water, our air?\n Polluting the air, and it's getting into our clouds...\n Very nice, very good. So air pollution particularly because the air pollution contributes to that formation.\n You are making worst case scenarios. You don't have to consider the unthinkable.\n It can happen, alright?\n You don't have to consider the impossible.\n So we can unplug outlets when we're not using them.\n We can turn off the water when we brush our teeth. \n What about things in your house? Electricity. Cut down on your electric bills. Remember you burn fossil fuels, to make electricity. So right now as middle schoolers, the easiest thing to do would be to cut down on your electric use. Alright, I want every table to share one idea. Info manager from table one, give me one idea.\n One idea is we can help the environment by taking a bus to school, instead of like everybody having their own individual cars.\n Good point.\n Or even better you can walk.\n Instead of having that carpool line going on, let's take busses. Table two give me one idea.\n Save power by changing your lightbulbs to CFLs.\n Yeah, use those light bulbs that are like the twirly light bulbs, they use a lot less electricity, good idea. Table three give me one.\n Conserve water by turning off the water when we brush our teeth.\n Now conserving water. Think about what the question was. How can we be environmental advocates to cut down on acid rain?\n We can cut down on electricity by unplugging outlets.\n Very good. Unplug items from the outlets, that's good. Table four.\n We could use hybrid cars.\n Hybrid cars, that's good. They burn less fossil fuels, good idea. Table five.\n Recycle.\n Recycle.  How would that help acid rain? Okay, so it's cutting down on factory use, that would be a good one. Table six.\n Cutting down on electricity.\n Alright, cutting down on electricity, because to make electricity you have to burn fossil fuels. Table seven, is there any that haven't been said?\n Carpool to work and school.\n Carpool to work and school, I love it. You got something to add?\n I was going to say instead of the bottles end up in landfills, so you can keep bottles out of landfills if you reuse them.\n Yeah, very good. A lot of times we focus only on the idea of recycling, but it's good to reuse, too. That's a good idea as well. So we talked about how the temperature will affect our chemical weathering. We haven't yet talked about how temperature affects mechanical weathering. Which lab would answer that question? How temperature affects mechanical weathering.\n Station four.\n Alright, look at station four. Take one minute, you don't have to write this one down, discuss it. What does station four tell you and how is that important in daily life. Take one minute. \n And it like ice wedges, and then it'll make bigger cracks and then it will do bad stuff for sidewalks. \n What were you supposed to be measuring? In centimeters. You measured in milimeters, but you meant to measure in centimeters.\n So how much was it in centimeters? Well if you said it was at 79, which would be right there. What centimeters is that at?\n Around 15.\n Write down 15. Oh wait wait! I had it going the wrong way, and no one even noticed. So if it was at 79, where would it be. At 79, the tick mark right below the 80.\n About 16.\n About 16, and if it was at 76 where would it be at?\n About 14 and a half.\n Very good Alright, let's pick someone at random, who's the lucky person, Andrew P. What did you notice was the difference between the same amount of water when it was frozen and when it was left as a liquid.\n When it was frozen it was taller.\n When it was frozen it was taller. What does that mean that it was taller? Lucy?\n Well the water was frozen to ice. So it expands a little.\n It expands. I like the use of that word. Water expands as it freezes. Here in Louisville how is that a problem? And it's been a particularly big problem this winter. Ethan?\n Because like, the water can get in the cracks in the roads and then when it freezes it will expand and it will crack roads and buildings. Soon the people will have the construction people will have to rebuild the roads.\n Right, very good point. Now that affects us here in Kentucky because we have those cold winters. What types of areas would it not affect? Forrest?\n Florida.\n Florida, areas that don't have freezing that's a good point. Now we've talked about climate as far as temperature goes. We've talked about the warm temperatures and the cold temperatures and how it affects the chemical and mechanical weathering. What is the other aspect of climate, other than temperatures? Other than temperature, what is another aspect of climate? Patrick?\n How humid it is?\n How humid it is. Which lab do you think would tell us how humidity affects weather? Flip through, Sky?\n Seven Let's look at station seven. Now, during our labs, the materials managers were always in charge of getting the materials ready. A material manager. Can someone explain to me, what's the difference between the steel wool that was covered with a cup versus the steel wool that was not covered with a cup. What would that difference be? Lucy?\n Well the steel wool that was covered, well the steel wool that wasn't covered with the cup, it was all like stuck together and it wasn't rusting and the one that was covered with the cup it had like stuff popping out, like it wasn't all stuck together and it was rusting.\n Okay, so the one that was covered with a cup and moistened, had a lot of rust. And the one that was moistened, but was just left sitting out dried and did not have a lot of rust. Would you agree? Okay, what is the purpose of covering it? Why do I cover that? Otis?\n Keeping the water from evaporating. Yeah, it's keeping that water in. So is the covered cup a dry environment, or a humid environment?\n Humid environment.\n A very humid environment. I have a great map here that tells you a little bit about different areas, and tells you what their humidity is like. I'm gonna flip off both lights to help you see it. This is a tropical wet area, tropical dry area, semi-arid which means dry, arid, then, marine, west coast, Mediterranean, and humid sub-tropical. These areas that are marked as humid, sub-tropical, such as down in Florida, those areas that are marked as humid, what do they have to be cautious about? If it's a humid area, what do they have to be cautious about? Don't see a lot of hands, talk about it for one minute. What do humid areas have to be cautious about? \n Now think about this, an area like Kentucky. And our summers aren't just hot, they're humid. So we have to deal with cold winters which are gonna affect mechanical weathering, and we have to deal with, Yeah, so we're kind of getting the worst end of both scenarios. Yes, we definitely are. Good point. Alright, I need someone I haven't heard from to share, let's see who the random card is, Lucy. What do you think?\n They have to be careful about rusting like their cars and stuff.\n They have to be careful of rusting. Good point.  Because the more humid the air is, the more likely you are to have what? Oxidation. Now there was another lab where we used steel wool. What was the purpose of the other steel wool lab? What were you trying to answer, what were you trying to determine? Jamiel, what do you think? \n There was the key word, the what kind of water? Salt water. You look to see if salt water affected the oxidation rate. You look to see if salt water did. Silently, look at your data, and tell me did salt water affect the rate of oxidation. Jeremy, did salt water affect the rate of oxidation?\n Yeah\n", "filename": ["Copy of 289 SCI EA 289 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.217126], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW05", "TW06"]}, "1373": {"text": " What do you think it is going to be this time?

I pulled number five. Number five, what is happening to your can?\n It's getting frost on it.\n  It's getting frost on it. Why do you think it's getting frost? What did your group think that it was getting frost on it from?\n The ice and the mystery ingredient.\n  The mystery ingredient and the ice are making the can frosty. What did we learn about, with the weather cycle, we talked about that, what's really happening? Talk in your group, is it the can making the water come on in and make the frost? Talk in your group and figure out if you guys know what's coming that's making the stuff on the outside of the can. \n There is water on the side of the can.\n Maybe the mystery thing...\n  Making condensation on the can? And because I learned a lot about that--\n I think the mystery one and the ice did it together.\n That could be.\n Yeah, that could be.\n And combined and then it created frost on the outside of the can.\n  I think that the water, the mystery ingredient, .\n  Okay, one, two, three, four, five. Number three, what is making your can get the frost or the wet stuff, what's that wet stuff called? Ella.\n Condensation.\n  It's called condensation. What do you, why is that happening to your can? Number three, that's you right Luke? Okay, what's happening?\n Because it's like evaporating, and when it touches the cold can, then it turns back into cold water.\n  What's evaporating? Stop, don't answer that. Think in your group, what, he said it's evaporating, and then it's touching the can. What's touching the can? Talk in your group, figure out if you can figure out what's coming to touch your can.\n So well really it  can.\n Yeah, it's kind of melting, so the water is on the can...\n So it's the mushy, icky...\n I know whatever mystery stuff.\n  Now I'll take it. It makes me, and then it makes water, water, water. Everything, you know, water.\n  How will Eve's last question?\n  Nope, we're just asking questions right this second. You guys need to wait, then we're gonna . One, two, three, four, five, come back to me. Number 19, who's 19?\n Ella.\n  Okay, Ella. What is happening to make that can wet on the outside?\n The water and the ice, well the water tries to evaporate, but since there's ice at the top, it hits the ice, and then it comes back down. But then it gets on the can.\n  So the water, you think the water, in the, the can itself is coming and making that water come back on and catch that, hit the ice. Good thought, let's keep going, let's see if we can get some more. Who is number 12?\n  Hayden.\n  Hayden's not here, so let's move on and let's find number nine. Who's number nine?\n Kayla.\n Kayla.

No this one, this one is gray.\n It's still got sand in it.\n This one is green and at least it looks a little bit greenish. I'd say like maybe green too. We'll have all yes. Okay, now this rock. Okay Diana, Cam and Gaelin. What I want you to do is you'll probably, how about you just take the rocks. Because I can't remember.\n What's going on?\n We're sorting them a different way.\n You're sorting them a different way. And what way would that be? How did you all decide to sort rocks?\n I thought we'd sort them by color and now we're gonna do it by cut.\n Tell me that again because I don't, I don't know that part. \n Now since we did the color, we're going to do is, we're going to do by texture.\n What's texture?\n It's by how it feels.\n Oh, well can you teach me?\n Find out the texture from these two rocks, I see how it feels. And since this one feels very smooth I'll put it by itself.\n Well, can I feel it?\n Pretty smooth.\n Pretty smooth. Have you felt it? Feel it. How you think it feels?\n Smooth.\n It does feel pretty smooth.\n And it looks like a piece of meat.\n It looks like a piece a meat?\n Yes.\n Better not eat a rock should I? Okay, where does this one need to go?\n It needs to go.\n Over here?\n We haven't finished quite yet so...\n Okay.\n And this one is like I'll say pretty rough.\n Pretty rough, can I feel this one? Oh gosh. Whoo. Yeah. It does feel a little rough. It does feel like it's got some sand on it. You know a word that I can think of that makes me think of that?\n Rough.\n Rough or gritty. You know sand is gritty feeling. Well, that's kind of gritty. It does feel a little rough.\n It can stand up.\n It stands up?\n I'm gonna do it, put it by itself.\n Okay.\n And we're going to keep on doing it. Until all of them are sorted.\n Okay, this is a pretty cool rock, how does it feel?\n I'll say pretty bumpy kind of rock.\n Pretty bumpy, pretty rough. Oh, this one's very rough.\n So rough I can hardly stand myself.\n Look at the shell on it. \n It does have a shell in it.\n On the other side, look. On the other side turn it like right here, it has another shell.\n It does, so what kind of rock would this be?\n A two fossil rock.\n A fossil rock. And what kind are they, what's it called? If it has a fossil imprint in it?\n Fossil.\n If it settled and got a fossil?\n Sedimentary.\n It would be a sedimentary rock. Very cool. I'm so proud of you. That was definitely very rough. Have you felt it?\n This is.\n What do you think?\n On, the back is kind of squishy.\n It is rough. Okay, you all keep working, you're doing a good job. I'm proud of you.\n Okay. Now you can put it with the rough, the super rough. I think this one is, I can tell. I say medium, a little rough, a little smooth. This one goes in the middle.\n This one is smooth.\n This is super rough. Let me feel.\n Smooth.\n I'm gonna put it in the middle because I think--    \n Very good Arianna, I like the way you--   \n One more medium rock than large. Because we have eight medium and seven large.\n Because you can see...\n A smooth side and a rough side.   \n Because if you add two more together it make 12. Medium is seven and large is eight.\n And I have an idea, when you do your rock what about you trace it?\n", "filename": ["Copy of 1372 GEN_EC_1372_Video_Recording_A_edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.0445749], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW17"]}, "1375": {"text": "  What are you noticing about it compared to these two?\n This one's light brown. These are all dark. So I think this one's not getting enough water. So we should water it.\n What's happening because it's not getting enough water?\n It's like drying out.\n What's happening to the seed?\n The seed is dying. It can't grow.\n And the seed's gonna die.\n Yeah.\n Because what's the first stage of a life cycle?\n And you have water in it.\n It's a seed.\n Yeah.\n And then it sprouts.\n But on this one all stems are dying.\n Oh wow, that looks really dry.\n So which one are you measuring?\n We're measuring water.\n Okay, let's measure it.\n Let me measure it.\n Okay, let's measure it and let's record how tall it is.\n I don't know how you use it. \n Yeah, almost four inches.\n Centimeters. Here, I'll measure it.\n Seven and a half centimeters.\n Can you hold it, yeah?\n Maybe if you hold it.\n Oh no, it came out.\n It's okay.\n It's alright we'll just--\n Ours came out, and then it's still good.\n Just hold him up.\n It's six centimeters.\n Okay, let's check.\n Wow, it's growing two times enough.\n Keep it there and let's see. Let's see if the rest of your group agrees.\n Yeah, I agree.\n That leaf is up to six centimeters.\n Okay, so what in, in a week, how much has it grown?\n It's grown three.\n Three centimeters.\n Three centimeters, yeah.\n Three centimeters.\n Okay, write and record it. So that's parsley. Write, write.  Why do you think parsley is doing so much better than roma tomato?\n Because the tomato is like, a tomato has one thing, and parsley has the same thing and they come out.\n What do you mean the same?\n I think maybe because parsley.\n Because parsley has, a rose, it's easier because, because a tomato has more time to grow, because it like, it's the kind of vegetable that has...\n Which is actually even drier.\n Can you guys help her out? Can you help her out?\n I think, well I think that's growing better than the roma tomatoes.\n Is tomato a fruit?\n Day one.\n Like it's growing a fruit, that's what the tomato is. Like a vegetable, it's the fruit of the plant.\n Yeah.\n That we eat.\n But I think that, what I think it's important is that we grow this.\n Yes.\n Yes, they'll grow at different times. Once they grow, it'll grow fast.\n Yeah, we started this one, planting faster, right? We started this one two weeks later. Do you think we need to water the tomato more though?\n Yeah.\n When you look at the parsley and feel, feel how wet that one is. And it's doing so well.\n I know.\n Compared to the tomato, maybe we need to water more?\n Yes.\n Is this parse? It's the parts?\n  No it's the gender.\n  I think they need to get more sun and water.\n Okay, so Abby's measuring her tomato.\n  I did it.\n  What do you guys want to do? Do you want to do the top of the leaf or should we do the top of the stem?\n Top of the leaf.\n  Top of the leaf. The leaf is part of the plant.\n  Okay, so you're putting it down, all the way down?\n Down and round.\n It's four.\n Okay.\n It's four.\n Alright.\n Four.\n So every single time when you measure this plant, are you gonna measure the top of the leaf not the top of the stem? Is that what you're going to do?\n Yeah.\n It started four sessions ago. It started four sessions ago. \n This one started two weeks before. This one. Let's look at the measurements, and how much for growing, can you compare these two? What are some things that you notice?\n I notice that--\n It's grown three and a quarter centimeters. Everything else, won't be able to have.  two more centimeters.\n G plant.\n Can you tell me which one's growing quicker?\n This one are pregnant.\n Are you sure about that?\n Yes. Actually, maybe because...\n This started out, and this one not so here before.\n Okay, and we started this one when?\n We started this on, I mean two weeks ago.\n Two weeks after this one.\n Yeah.\n So, even though this one was started later, what's happened? It's growing.\n More.\n Faster, taller, yup. Okay. Why do you think, and you guys even noticed that it was dry, and it's still growing faster.\n Yeah.\n So, should we keep water, should we water it more and see what happens?\n Yeah.\n What do you want to do?\n I want to, want to, since there's no more seeds in there, because we took two of them out and then the other one died. I think we should grow more seeds in there and then water it and see what happens.\n Okay, go ahead, you can plant it. And there are sometimes seeds, they just won't germinate. They're sometimes just like a bad seed and they just won't, they won't grow. Maybe that's what happened to this one too.\n Can I go through and bob it?\n But in the inside of it, it looks very dark. But the outside of it does.\n So maybe it's not as dry as we thought.\n Yeah.\n Now we have to take measurements again.\n We'll just see if that helps.\n There's only this one left.\n Let's look at this seed. What do you notice about it?\n I know for, we came from last time when we grow the parsley, this seed is way bigger than that parsley seed.\n  These are not dead.\n  How about compared to the sunflower seed or a pumpkin seed?\n  It's really small. And things can use the lines smaller maybe, because they're smaller things, or like a sunflower.\n Oh, so you think maybe the seed, the size of the seed tells you how big the plant is going to be?\n Yeah.\n Okay.\n On that, some of the tomatoes are as big as that, or bigger than that. Sometimes the seeds are, how they start out are smaller, but sometimes the shape of it, sometimes determines the shape of it sometimes, but others not.\n You mean the seed tells you the shape of the plant?\n Sometimes, yeah.\n It could.\n What about a flower or something?\n Flowers seeds are different.\n They all look different.\n No.\n So is that always the case?\n No.\n But some of your classmates have plants that are gonna grow bigger. And so maybe we should ask them about theirs and find out if their plant is growing faster, or slower compared to these two plants, than yours. And maybe we can see if the seed size makes a difference. Alright, you guys can get online. Yeah, you can go ahead and water it.\n One in here, and one in here.\n And then I want you to go to that website and start your graphs when you'e done. You might want to water it a lot more.\n Let me try.\n And then over it.\n  We finished watering our plants.\n  Do we each get a computer?\n We need help. When we type into trying capitals in it, it deleted our numbers. So.\n Okay.\n We didn't know what was wrong.\n Well you have your title, Plant Type. Let's be more specific because you're not doing all the plants. What plant are you graphing right now?\n Swiss chard.\n And?\n Kale.\n Did you measure them already?\n Yeah. And then we drag the numbers but then they don't...\n I think it's because of all that room.\n James, where is your measurement for swiss chard for today?\n Right here.\n You want to record that.\n Swiss chard. \n And kale was...\n What was kale again?\n Seven.\n This height look correct?\n No.\n What are we missing? Do you guys notice?\n The up need.\n Oh, I notice.\n There you go, alright. Okay, so what's going to be your label for your bar graph? That's the one going along the bottom.\n The bottom, the plant height? How high the plant reading?\n Are you gonna, what are you gonna graph then for your bars?\n Hmm.\n What do we always look at when we're thinking about our graphs? We always go back to our data table, right?\n What are we gonna do instead of getting ahead or not?\n Seven centimeters for kale.\n You're gonna have to put kale right there.\n I know. It's just, that was the big plan. I think I'm on the tail now because...\n Okay you have, what's this one?\n That was eggplant.\n Okay. And this is swiss chard?\n Yeah. Well here's that, why don't you measure that? You haven't measured it yet.\n About five centimeters.\n Did you agree Walt?\n Yeah, about five centimeters.\n Is that what you got too?\n Yeah. \n So why are we gonna have a graph for just swiss chard, and just kale? Or are we gonna have a graph for both together? What would be easier?\n Both together I think.\n Should we put it together? How would we do that? How would you merge that?\n I think like both should have their own bar, like in the same graph.\n I think so too. So which plant do you want to graph today? Are you gonna do swiss chard or kale?\n  They really needed help.\n  Let's do kale.\n Let's look at kale.\n  Okay.\n  What's kale?\n Here's the kale.\n  Which one are we measuring?\n James, what did you get for the height for kale?\n Seven centimeters.\n Okay look, see if Andrew gets seven.\n Yeah, about seven.\n Okay. And what was the height of it last week, James? So Andrew knows.\n It was six centimeters.\n Okay, it was six centimeters. So just put six centimeters here. There you go. Okay, so lets fix this, let's just make it kale height. Or grow. And then, what's this, what are you gonna put at the bottom? Look at your table.\n  The height of kale.\n Is that gonna go along the bottom?\n How tall it was, like in day one and day two.\n Let's look. What were the labels for our table?\n Date and measurement.\n Okay, so that's what we're going with.\n So the measurement will be on the bottom and the date is on the side.\n Do you guys agree? James? You think that's right? Okay, we'll try it. Go date and then go ahead and type measurement. Should we have a unit on it since we're talking about measurement?\n Mhmm. \n Okay. So the whole point of--\n And what's in row one?\n One, four, 13?\n Okay, write that. You're gonna put the date there? Will, would you like a turn?\n Mhm.\n Instead of doing commas, if you're gonna write it like that, you're gonna put a dash in between. I'm gonna have Will, Will type this time. We'll take turns. So type in the date.  Okay, and then what would go here under the? What are you gonna graph? Like what's gonna be the bar graph part?\n Six centimeters? No, no, the height was the, another beam.\n So type that in.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 1375 GEN_MC_1375_Video_Recording_A_edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0762503], "annotations": [["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Abby"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW06s", "TW09s", "TW16", "TW23"]}, "221": {"text": "  So our question was: What are the reasons why Holden has a sudden acceptance of letting Phoebe grow up. And I got this question because, I feel like the carousel represents growing up because  you have to let people grab towards something they want or else if you're not letting them experience the world to its full extent then you're just sheltering them and they're just going to live a sheltered life. So they can't really do all the things that they have the possibility of experiencing.\n Yeah, I agree with him, with Damon because I think the carousel symbolizes the ride through life. Because it never really stops, just continuously goes around and around. And the goal is to grab the golden hoop. And I think that symbolizes, I don't know, happiness because everybody tries for it and they keep trying even though they fall, they keep getting back up on that carousel and trying to grab it. And if you hold a kid back from trying to grab what he wants, it's just like no, I'm not going to let you go out there and try to get what you want. They're sheltering them from their own happiness, kind of. Because \n I also agree with Brandon, but I also think that, let's just say Phoebe was on the carousel and she fell off. I don't know if Holden would go to her, but I think based on his character he would. But then I think that would be bad just because, like Brandon was saying, if you don't let them fall, if you don't let them make their own mistakes then they're not gonna learn from life. So like my dad, he's so overprotective. I think pretty much all parents are really overprotective of their kids, but you should just let them go out there and experience the world and learn from themselves. Not necessarily, because I think that's their fear, learning from their mistakes. So I just think it's better if you just let them go like a little bit at a time just so they can just figure out things in life.\n I think people have a hard time letting go of any child, whether it's their brother, their sister, their actual child because it means that they're leaving soon and they're actually going to experience their own lives and then when it comes to a parent or an older brother or sister, they don't want you to experience the same thing that they did too, so they're like telling you what to do and it seems like they're telling you how to live your life, but they're giving you advice.\n I think parents, the reason that they're so protective is because they know that saying ignorance is bliss, because it really is, and innocence is in a way, you know, because you don't know. And so they just want their child to be happy but inadvertently they're actually making them sad if they just won't relax so they can \n And also, I think a lot of kids don't understand this but part of the reason why our parents have such a hard time letting go is because you were part of their lives for as many years as you've been born. They preciously try to take care of you and they may seem like they're trying to shield you from everything, but they're just trying to look out for what's best for you. But you can't think of it like, oh, once this one chance goes by, I'll never have it again. Because it really is like a carousel. You're gonna keep going on and you will have another chance.\n Going back to the carousel I also thought that the carousel, it may just seem that there are a bunch of different people on it. So I think Holden kind of realized that even though the carousel, he knows have different people on it, you kind of have to allow the kids to grow up because you can't always keep them the same like the carousel, it's not a real machine or something. We all have to grow up eventually.\n Just listening to you guys, what do you think about, when I was home in Los Angeles, my nephew at that time was about six months old. And at that point in time he was just crawling and putting everything in his mouth and stuff like that, like leaves. You'd show him an apple and he's like, \"Ahh.\" And then he puts a leaf in his mouth. And you're just like, \"Holy!\" You have to dig it out kind of a thing. So in one respect, I mean, it's just like there's this idea of let people figure out things on their own, but in that respect, he'll die if you let him figure out oh, you can't eat that. So I'm just trying to think as far as a parent goes, how does a parent know when to let them figure it out versus how does a parent when to protect them? And I think that's part of the conflict Holden is having, he's trying to figure out how he can protect people and what he should protect them against.\n Me and my grandpa talk to me and he was like, \"I know that I have to let you go.\" And I think that they know when to let you go by how responsible you are. Like if you do what you're supposed to do and you show them that you're working or doing what you said then they want to let you go because they know that you \n That's true, and I also think that it's not really based on yourself mostly. It's based on your parents and how they've grown and how with having kids you grow up as a parent and you know and it's just nature, you just know when they're ready. That's what I think. I don't think really it's just based on all of their mistakes. I just think it's pretty much based on \n  Interesting.\n I think when people start changing and stuff, like their attitude, because I've noticed my little brother, he's starting to change and he has an attitude now. He's starting to get a little rebellious and stuff, and I think that's when parents have to start letting loose on their kids cause we have to experience things on our own, and it's not just being told what to do and stuff. You have to have that experience to learn from.\n Every person has their own free will. Like the saying you can take a horse to the water but you can't make it drink. You can enforce your rules on your child as much as you want but you can't force them to do anything, you can just have an influence on them. And that's something that parents have to understand. You can't force your kids to do their homework, but you can ground them if they don't.\n All right guys, I want you guys to keep going. You guys are doing a great job. I can see your notes are also looking pretty good. I'm gonna move on to another group, okay? But keep this going because I think you guys can come up with a lot more, okay? Thank you guys. You guys are doing an awesome job with your volume, we're gonna come over to  this group over here.\n All right, can you fill me in on what you guys talked about making sure we have the volume up.\n We have a couple of questions, we have like - \n Oh, okay. Let's just come up with, tell me about the one that you guys are the most excited about.\n The first question is my question, which was what are the reasons why people live their lives through other people. And I kind of came up with that question because Holden, he kind of was denied of his childhood because Allie died and so that really impacted him. And since that he's kind of been trying to preserve the innocence of Phoebe. Like making her go back to the carousel even though she says she's too big for it. He's like, \"No, you're not.\" He's trying to help to her keep that innocence, or just children in general keep that innocence that he was denied.\n It kind of was a parent versus child kind of thing. It goes against like parent versus child. So a parent when they have a child, they kind of want to live their life through their child. And they make them do all these chores to get into  because they never got to do it when they were little because they were deprived and their parents probably didn't want them to do it. So they kind of .\n  Interesting.\n I said that I just think this whole concept of the identity is not yet established, and you have the father and have somebody else create their footsteps  I had these two other questions because I was reading the book where I was wondering why, I was trying to get more in depth with why Holden wanted his job to be catching children in the rye.\n Okay, so I kind of answered it and I said it's very in tune because when you fall off the cliff you can't get back up. Just like when you lose your innocence, you can't get it back because this experience happened. If you get exposed to it, you can't magically forget it. It just stays with you and that's a part of you that's just lost.\n  Interesting.\n That kind of relates back to the question about  It seems like Holden is kind of holding onto his past, and so he's still living in that innocent stage, and when he's living an innocent stage he can't make a wrong decision, which is very hard from his now because he's 16, he keeps transferring to all these schools, and he can't really grow up because he still has that memory and so that's why he's confused about his identity.\n  Good point.\n Going back to the first question about why people live their lives through other people, it kind of goes through influences too. Like he was talking about James Castle, and when he died he said that James liked to digress on a topic and have speeches and it kind of made him think about, oh yeah, that's a pretty great idea. It's not bad, but why would people be waiting for that? It was actually like a digression off topic makes you think of new ideas.\n And I think going back to that question again, that sometimes parents want the best for their child, so they convince their, what they want their child to be.  If that makes sense. And at the end, sometimes you can't force the child to do what they don't want to do.\n So in a way it's kind of like you guys said, the parent versus the child. They wanna form their own identity as a teen, but at the same time the parents are so busy trying to protect them. Is that what we're kind of getting at through everything? They're so busy trying to protect them that they just gotta learn to let go. Is that what we're saying?\n Yeah, kind of. Like Holden says he's trying to protect that innocence, because he's always referring to  There's a part where he's walking down the sidewalk and he called Allie to help him cross to the other side. And that's kind of interesting because usually you don't think an adult would say that. A child would say that. And it's because he's mad at his parents because they won't talk about it, so he's kind of just living with this.\n  Interesting. So he's just trying to find a way of coping? Is that possible?\n Yes. And then there was another kind of question about where Holden comes to  Kiana said-\n Why do people feel the need to forget the deaths and move on? And I thought of this question because when Holden was inside just his room, Phoebe was getting all frustrated with him because she was like, \"You don't like anything! You don't like anything!\" And he was trying to make up stuff that he did like. Like he did say he liked Allie, and she'll say he's dead so pick something else. And he was arguing with her saying that just because he's dead you don't forget him, and you can still like someone who's dead. And he thinks that Allie is thousand times better than, nicer than, people who are alive today, now. So that just proves how he's holding on to that and he's not planning on forgetting that, and he holds that near and dear to his heart. And so that's probably why he doesn't like a lot of people, because he compares them to how Allie was and his innocence, his maturity level, how it was then, and how he sees how people today, because kids don't understand he's holding on, so he doesn't really understand what's going on.\n  Anything else to add on to this?\n No.\n  I like what you guys are doing. I like how you're tying in the death of Allie with the catcher in the rye type of a thing. What about the carousel, first of all?\n I don't know, it sounds like it goes with the whole keeping the innocence going and all. 'Cause I know he would probably ride it too. Did he ride it?\n I was thinking of repetition, because how the parents feel, it rotates around and round. And whenever Phoebe passed by, he would tell her how pretty she looked. She was never changing. That's kind of what he wanted, he wanted her to stay in that stage, and nothing to change.\n  Nice. All right, guys. I'm gonna check on another group. I want you guys to keep going with this, you guys are tearing it apart. Good job looking at the symbolism and tying everything together. All right, and your notes look good as well too. I like it. I think you guys could explore the carousel and tie that in a little more. Okay, hi guys! You guys, the volume is doing really well.  So you guys fill me in.\n Okay.\n  Tell me what you guys talked about.\n Just mostly like  and symbolism in the book.\n  Start getting louder.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 221 ELA AYA 221edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.0501695], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW05", "TW08", "TW15"]}, "154 ": {"text": " Just take it in, but take your tube off first. Before you pull it out, before you pull the needle out, take your vacutainer tube off, and this is...\n Pull it out again?\n Yeah. Use your two by two remember.\n Oh, yeah.\n There you go. Good job, Faye. And, guys, it just takes a while. This is not something you're going to learn overnight. This is a skill that it takes a little while to learn. You've got to get hand movements down, you've got to figure out what works best for you. You know, if you need things placed in a different position. But after this, you all can start sticking the arms when you're not doing your book work. Then, whenever you feel like you got all your hand movements down, you feel like you're proficient, then I'll watch you, which I'll watch you doing, then you all will stick me. So what do you think, Cassie?\n Hmm?\n What do you think? Is it easier than you thought, or harder than you thought?\n Easier.\n Yay, Faye. Those arms are a little harder to get... Those veins are not as easy to feel as...\n That's okay. She's doing a fine job. Two by two.\n Sorry. You  to draw blood from them.\n Pop your tourniquet. Engage your safety. Good job. From down there?\n Yeah.\n They say not to use these, and you can use hand veins, but remember, first choice, second choice, last choice, and then hand veins. If you're going to do hand veins, you all have been through a lot of the book work already, if you're going to use hand veins, what kind of needle are you going to use?\n Butterfly.\n Butterfly. Okay I know you all have seen them use butterfly in the clinic. You guys will actually rotate through the clinic lab. We'll do it at Dr. Maderis' clinic, so that you all can get more sticks there.\n Is there some people who draw only from around here?\n Not usually. Now, there are some people, they'll come in and they'll say, \"You can't get blood from anywhere from me except here.\" What that one lady told you, is right here, right...\n I'm better at popping it out. Remember I couldn't get it in.\n Good. It will be something that, after you get these hand movements down, it'll just happen. Because when I'm not talking while I'm doing it, I mean, it just flows. Because I have done it for several years, but for some reason after you get older, it's hard to talk and do something at the same time.\n,  That's what we're going to do today, is you all are going to learn how to draw blood. You're going to learn how to actually stick the fake arms that we have or the phlebotomy learning aids is actually what they're called. And each one of you have gotten to a certain point in either phlebotomy or medical assisting where you're ready to start drawing blood. And I know that Wanda has gotten a little further but it never hurts to refresh on the procedures because, guys, when you get out there in the clinical area, a lot of people don't follow a lot of the steps that you need to do as far as blood draws. Guys that are medical assisting, you are not going to have to do as many venipunctures and the phlebotomy students but you may be responsible for drawing blood in a doctor's office. When you're there in the doctor's office it's just you and the person. So you quickly develop really good phlebotomy skills because if you don't get it then you have to send them to outpatient hospital to be able to get that blood drawn. The first things I want to talk about is your vein choice. And I printed off your veins. And the median cubital is your vein of choice and the median cubital runs right here in the middle.\n  You can see this one better.\n Yeah, you see that one better. Your median cubital runs right in the middle and then your basilic is the one you want to stay away from. That's the one that runs little finger side. And then your cephalic is on the thumb side. So this little finger side toward the inside of the elbow is the one you really want to stay away from. And the reason that this is your last choice vein is there's quite a few nerves that are right underneath it. So if you go too deep or you move the needle around too much you can actually cause nerve damage. And I will leave this on the table as y'all are practicing with your phlebotomy arms so that you can look at your vein choice. Nerve damage is a very real possibility and some nerve damage is permanent so be very careful when you're choosing your vein. You can only advance or withdraw the needle only. You cannot go sideways. I know those of you who's already been in the clinical site, you've seen them go sideways, you've seen them come out and go back in. And guys, that could be a liability for you, and you're the only one that can protect your patient and you. I've got the materials set up. Whenever we repeat this, you all will set your materials up so take notice of what we've got here because you'll need this every time you practice on the phlebotomy arms. When you go to clean your arm, you're going to clean in a circular motion. So I'm going to go ahead and get started. First thing you're going to do, I don't need your gloves, just the two hands. First thing you're going to do is put on your gloves. I just washed my hands but I'm going to put on my gloves. And why do I want to do that? Jim.\n  So I don't get infected.\n Yeah, I don't want to come into contact with someone's blood. Now, who could protect me from coming into contact with someone's blood?\n Yourself.\n I'm the only one that can do that. And I can tell you, from having my blood drawn, people have drawn my blood without gloves on though they didn't know me from Adam. And one person in particular got quite a bit of my blood on them. So I am the only one that can protect me. If I see you practicing without your gloves on, it is an automatic grade ding for that practice day. If I see you drawing in the clinical area without gloves on, then we're going to have a big talk, okay? Because you've got to protect you.\n  I have a question. With some people that you draw blood on, do you have to wear a mask? Like an eyeshield-type thing.\n If they are on precautions then yes, you would. And you've seen, at the hospital, on the doors where they have contact and respiratory isolation. If you were to go into one of those rooms, yes you would. In the ER, when you draw blood, you usually have on that splash mask. Now usually, with a venipuncture, you're not going to have that much pressure. It's not going to shoot the blood back out at you like an arterial would, but still, it's better to err on the side of safety. But also, if there's nothing wrong with me except I need a CBC to have a surgery and you come at me with a mask and a shield, I'm going to think, \"Oh my gosh. Why is she doing that?\" You know? So make sure that it's appropriate. If you're in a trauma area then yes, definitely. If you're in an outpatient clinic, unless that patient tells you, \"My veins squirt blood really bad.\" A patient will tell you. One time I was doing a finger stick and it squirted and I had on my glasses but I turned my head. It hit me in the hair. So sometimes the venous flow will do that. Good question, Cathy. All right, so got my gloves on, first I'm going to do is I'm going to put the tourniquet on. And guys, the tourniquet can be kind of tricky the first time or two you do it. And you're going to put it underneath the arm. You need to make sure it's tight so your vein will pop up but not so tight you're going to cut off the blood flow and not so tight you're going to cause petechiae, which is little red patches on the arm. I'm going to cross my hands over. What I do is I put my left hand in position, I take my right hand, get ahold of the tail of this, pull it, and then I stick it underneath with my little finger. You always want your tails up toward the top so they're not in your area where you're going to clean and draw. When I'm going to clean... well, let me show you how to feel first. Well, it's not going to cooperate today.\n You can use my arm. That way they can see better.\n Can you move the Sharps container?\n I'm going to stick it underneath there. And now it should stay on there. Now to locate a vein, I'm going to take my index finger and I'm going to feel back and forth. And guys, you all can do this on each other. Jim's excellent to feel veins on and he's a real good volunteer. Bounce back and forth. It feels like a gummy worm or something soft underneath there. If it feels really hard, like I have one that I'll let you all feel that is very sclerotic or hard, you're not going to get blood out of it. It's got to be... it's got to bounce. So when you go across and you find it, then you're going to find which way it travels. So you're going to go up it and down it so you know which way to put your needle in. Some veins will go off to the side and some remain very straight. So I found my vein. Now the tourniquet can only stay on for one minute. Has my tourniquet been on about a minute? Probably so, so I need to take the tourniquet off, give this patient's arm a rest, and then I can talk to them about the weather, I can go ahead and line up my tubes at that time, and then I'm ready to draw blood now. So I come in here, I put my tourniquet on, and guys, when you put this tourniquet on you got to be ready to go because you only have one minute. And I'm going to clean. I'm going to clean in a circular motion and then, if you're having trouble with the alcohol, you're not able to fan it, you can't blow on it, and you can take one very clean 2 by 2, go straight down, dry it off, and then... many of you already did that. This part of the needle, this part with the rubber on it has the needle on it. You screw that in, take the end off, this is a safety needle. You anchor and then you stick in the bevel of the needle, that is the pointy part, the bevel goes up and then the pointy part goes into the skin. I pull my thumb away as I'm going in. I take one of these Vacutainer tubes, thank you, Jim, and I push it in. And guys, when I push in with my thumb I'm pulling back with my fingers. And you're not able to see but there is... and I don't do this in the clinical side, but there is blood coming in there. You let it fill until it stops. Now it's stopped flowing. I'm going to wrap my fingers around it and push because the more still you keep the needle, the less it's going to hurt the patient. Pop my tourniquet and I'm going to take a different 2 by 2 than what I cleaned with. Fold it, lay it on the arm, and guys, I'm just going to kind of hover there until I bring the needle out and push down. If I push down while the needle is in the arm, it hurts really bad. And I'm going to hold here and I'm going to hold until it quits bleeding. And you can peek. Now if the blood... oh, sticky needle engaged. It's hard to talk and do stuff at the same time, isn't it? Sharps. And you toss that in the sharps. Now, if this patient is on blood thinners, I've got to hold longer. A lot of clinics will just put a 2 by 2 or a cotton ball on there, put a CoBand on them and send them on their way. If they bleed out outside of the lab, you're liable. And again, you're the only one that can protect you. So I make sure that they've stopped bleeding. And now how hard is that going to be when there is a lobby full? You guys have been observing.\n Can we ask them to hold it?\n Well, you can. But what if they don't hold it tight enough? What if there's a whole lobby full? Jim, what have you seen them do in the past?\n  and check.\n Yeah. You need to check it. If there's a whole lobby full sitting out there then you'll get to them when you get to them, because you've got to protect your phlebotomy certificate. You're the only that can do that. A lot of places, they will put a 2 by 2 or a cotton ball on there, tell the patient to hold their arm up. That breaks platelets, that's going to make a huge bruise, and it doesn't really help with the clotting that much, just kind of bruises. So we're going to look here. Okay, this patient has quit bleeding, so I am good to go here. Now, another lesson I will teach you about writing on the vials, the blood draw vials and what information needs to be on there. So before you all draw, let me ask you a few questions. What's your first choice vein?\n Median.\n Median. Okay. And why do we avoid the basilic? Nicole.\n  Nerves and tendons.\n Nerves. Okay. What can happen if I... powder on the shirt. What can happen if I dig around in there and I do injure somebody? What can they do?\n They can bleed or they can have their nerve damage.\n Right. And they can come and say, \"This phlebotomist drew here.\" And then, guys, if you're ever in a setting where you have to go to court, they're going to call somebody that's a phlebotomist like you are and they're going to ask them, \"What's your first choice vein?\" And they're going to say, \"The median, \" and they're going to say, \"What's your next choice? What's your last choice?\" So you're going to have somebody there that knows. You really don't want to draw from that one unless it is your last choice. Okay, what can happen if the patient's on blood thinners? Cassie, what's the most important thing to remember about the patient that's on blood thinners?\n  To keep pressure.\n To keep pressure. Okay. How do you clean your site, Martika?\n  In a circular outward motion.\n Circular, you don't ever go back over. And how long do you leave the tourniquet on, Faye?\n  One minute.\n One minute. Good job. Okay. You all get your... First thing you do is what?\n Gloves.\n Get your gloves on. So you all are going to draw.\n With drawing blood, are you supposed to record where you drew at and everything just like a nurse is supposed to?\n I would if I were you, because that just protects you. So you can write median. You can write an MC, median cubital, and that way you may... actually you could put it on where you put your initials where you draw. And that way they know that you drew from the median. That you didn't draw from basilic.\n I need another needle.\n Okay.  Anybody else need another needle?\n Thank you.\n You're welcome. I'm going to send tourniquets home with you all and you can practice on everybody. Feel their veins, feel all the different types of veins. Some people have garden hoses is what I call them. Some people have very large veins. And feel for your vein.\n The tourniquet pinched my thumb.\n The gloves are hard to... you trading them out? It's this arm, Jim, I think because I had trouble getting it.\n When I was doing it, too.\n Okay. Just make it a little tighter with your...\n Oh.\n Did you stick yourself?\n Mm-mm.\n Okay.\n I screwed the wrong part.\n I think she's bleeding and I haven't even done anything yet.\n Oh, yeah hand me another one.\n There it goes again.\n Okay, Casey. Let me see what I can do for you. Good job, Martika.\n Want to just chill, how's the weather, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n Is it not come undone now? You might want to pull your tail, just pull it in there with one of the smaller tails. It'll stay down.\n Okay.\n It's moving again.\n You're kidding.\n See?\n Okay. Just keep going.\n Okay.\n Just keep going. It's easier on a person. That's my stomach, Jim. It's hungry. Sorry.\n  Yeah, this one... Jim knows which ones stay better. Okay, you got to anchor your vein with your non-dominant... with your non-dominant hand you anchor your vein. I have to stand. I can't... see, you take your thumb and you pull down here. Anchor your vein. There you go. Casey, are you left-handed, too?\n Mm-mm. I thought you said non-dominant hand.\n Non-dominant hand to anchor. Back it out. Put it in this hand. Are you right-handed?\n Mm-hmm.\n Put non-dominant hand thumb there, anchor.\n Okay.\n Now, did you clean it?\n Yep.\n Okay. Then go in.\n Uh-oh.\n It's okay.\n It's okay. \n Well, that's okay. Put that on.\n Start over.\n A lot of this is hand movement. A lot of this is prac--\n", "filename": ["Copy of 154B CTE EAYA 154 B.srt.txt", "Copy of 154A CTE EAYA 154 A.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.21317], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW03", "TW04", "TW06", "TW13"]}, "1379": {"text": " I don't want a straight line.\n No.\n I like curves.\n Yeah, a lot.\n Because the friction in the air--\n Yeah.\n Pushes it, and the gravity  going on the next turn.\n I think it's because there's like a big wall, and that's a small little plane, and everything has gravity.\n You need to pull on the string. \n And, the reason why it's not going that way is because that wall will stray them away.\n The wings get cool.\n What was your longest throw? How long was it?\n Oh, it was-- \n It was mine, and it was probably one, two, three, four, five, six. Five-\n No, it's six.\n One, two, three, four, five, six.\n Into the six, but not before the six.\n Oh yes, into the six.\n Alright. Go over there, check that out.\n 38.\n Four hundred--\n 538 centimeters.\n Yeah.\n Let's put how many meters. Five meters.\n Write 538.\n But, why did, because fliers don't go into the wall.\n Because ... Everything has a little bit of gravity. There's not a whole lot of gravity where it would just go .\n Yeah, and then that doesn't have a lot of gravity, but I mean--\n I can see that, but he threw it high and it went up to the wall right there. \n But, it kind of did like that.\n But, it didn't really smash.\n I mean, it didn't go and stick.\n Yeah, it didn't go. Gravity pulled it, but it wasn't going to hold it there.\n Yeah. \n It's got more force on it.\n Yeah, I think there's more gravity up there than right here because that's higher, and it's closer. It's like, it has a lot more gravity.\n What has more gravity?\n  Up there. \n Had more pull?\n I think the reason why the sticks were going and the straw was going this way is because everything has a little bit of gravity--\n And, the wall!\n And, the wall, it like, a lot bigger than that stick, and it's gravity that's pulling it there, but it doesn't have enough gravity where it will just be like--\n It's not like this!\n Okay, so if everything has a little bit of gravity, what is the major gravity pull, though, that is bringing it down?\n The Earth.\n The Earth, because--  That's why, like if we threw this, that's why--  \n That's why it chops.\n Okay, this one went, it went three meters,  This one covered straw with paper and this one glides.\n It's a lot bigger.\n So, when it went like here, it went all the way down to the .\n Yeah, it's faster because it's bigger and this one's smaller and it doesn't go far.\n Glider, the other one's probably bigger. \n This one's also flat so it's got a better chance to glide.\n Yeah. That one's like round and bigger, and it doesn't flop on the, and it doesn't go, like, far. When you throw it, it doesn't, like, when it goes it doesn't go far, but this one, like, it'll go far.\n What do you think would happen if we put a paperclip on either the front or the back?\n It would help--\n It would lay it a little bit down--\n It would go a little bit down, because it's, it has more weight, it'll go down.\n If you put a paperclip on it, like a paperclip's not that heavy, but it would make it, like, when we fly it, it goes up in the air, and then comes back down and floats down. That's why they're so short.\n What makes it come down?\n Gravity.\n Okay.\n And, like you put a paperclip on it, it'll come down. Because the paperclip is heavier than the straw.\n What if you put it on the back?\n It would, it would ...\n It would kind of slow it. It would be like that .\n Okay, can you think of? What about this one? What if we put the paperclip on this one?\n It would--\n It wouldn't feel. It would get worse.\n If we put the paperclip on here, then it would get all messed up because if it's flat and it's trying to . It has weight, it will just go.\n Uh-huh, right. That one, when you fly it, before we got the paperclip, it goes high before it comes down. But, when we put the paperclip on it, it goes straight down, like that. And, like without the paperclip, without the paperclip on it, it will go like, it will go like an ocean.  With the paperclip on there, it would go farther. It would go farther and then it'll fall just down like that, but not go like that.\n This one, let's try this one!\n See, that one goes a lot farther.\n And, it probably goes farther because I put a lot of force on it. If you even put a lot of force on this one, it will go down because it flies like, I threw it like that, and it just flies off, because it's the gravity. And you throw that one, it goes farther.\n Okay, so gravity makes it come down faster than the glider?\n It makes it go down, because if you just throw it without the paperclip, it won't, it will just come down because of gravity. _ Yeah, the straw one is going like that. And then it just goes like, see how it flips down? But, with the paperclip, it'll go farther.\n Like that.\n Tyler, what were you saying about the air? Do you think that has a, do you think that makes a difference in what Mary Morgan is saying this one kind of floats and then comes down? Go talk about that.\n See, the air--\n The air feels like windy in here.\n It would push it, and then it would--\n It would go like this.\n Yeah, like that. And, it would just push. It would just push it towards like where everything was.\n Yeah, and this one with the paperclip goes really far.\n And, that paperclip, the reason it went far without the paperclip is because air pushed it and force.\n What is that force called? When you push it?  Remember, it's called--\n The thrust.\n The thrust, that's right. So the thrust, when you push the plane, made a difference, is that what you said?  Could you change the one with the straw, is there any changes that you could make that you think would make it fly further? Talk about that as a group.\n Put two paperclips.\n One on the front and one on the back.\n Put the lighter one on the back. Let's try that. I bet it will- It might go farther too. Okay, now push.\n We have a paperclip on it, and we're going to see if it goes farther the second time. I think, I bet it will go, I bet it goes a lot longer.\n That's fine. \n Well ... It went to 10!\n It went to 10. \n Okay, so I want you to discuss in this group, I want you to discuss what you found when you threw, when you tested this with the paperclip on it. Just talk about that together.\n Well, .\n So when there's air, I think when they closed the air up, it went in and back out. But, but, but, tied together .\n So, if you like flip off--\n The paper clip.\n The air, like if you could do this, and turn off the air, it would go further.\n But, if you take off of it, I mean if you, it won't make it that far. It will just be like .\n The paper clip, the straw, it does help.\n Yeah, about the same as this one without.\n I wonder what that one's like with paperclips.\n Me too.\n I want to try it.\n This is my prediction. I think it's on an angle--\n I think that's going to go further.\n I don't know, because they don't have no air stream to hold it. \n I think it will go farther.\n I don't.\n See?\n Well, you didn't put a lot of force on that one. Well, we all have to try.\n But, I still think it went the farthest, but I think .\n I think it's going to go farther.\n Nope.\n Well, it went farther than you.\n It went\n But, I mean, it didn't go--\n You all tried it with this didn't you all? Let me try it this way.\n I tried it with that, I tried it with that side.\n It all went to the yellow, but--\n But, it didn't--\n Strong enough.\n So, what did we find out back here?\n That it puts more weight on it so it goes.\n What puts more weight?\n This little paperclip. The paperclip puts more weight to that one, and it's not going to nose dive. But I was standing right here and mine hit that wall. And, that's without the paperclip. And, then you put the paperclip on there, it doesn't go near as far.\n Why did that make a difference? Was your throws the same? Did you use the same amount of force? What happened?\n Mine felt like I was using the same force. I think it's just because that, since there isn't any air space on that one--\n What do you mean airspace?\n I mean like, the air can't go through this.\n Yeah, like that's a straw, it has a hole.\n It's just putting more weight on that one, so that's just going to go boop. If you use this one, and put the paperclip right here, it's going to cut off the air coming in right here. And, that's going to go further.\n Oh, you're took off the air of the straw. And that makes it go further. \n Why does that?\n Because the air in the straw is pulling it down because it's like...\n Do you know what that's called?\n Gravity.\n Well, the gravity, but what about the air when the air is coming in?\n Friction!\n Oh, friction!\n Friction, the air is causing friction? Okay.\n The air's slowing it down.\n And, also the air. Okay, now I want you to think about if you change this plane in any way, what changes could you make to it to make it fly further?\n We could cut it up! \n Wrap around, and then have that like this.\n Yeah, I think that's set to have the same throw.

Can I have your attention real quick please. All right, once you find, I see most of you have yours in point slope would you also put it in slope intercept, okay? Because that'll help you with question number three, okay then I've got through question number three. Go 'head and find your answer and .  Here we have, what is this?\n Linear.\n Okay, is that a line?\n No.\n Okay. Were you supposed to draw a line through it? \n Okay, what does it say down there?  Okay, why you did number five before you did number one, it said draw a line through, right? This is like a, not a line, okay? A line is straight, so you wanna draw a line straight through there.

And then I was gonna, I actually had started out with what doesn't, mean in a situation, . \n But when you .\n Y equals one and x, yep, okay y = 1x. Now, how do we find, what's the ordered pair here? \n Okay, that's the slope intercept form.\n Oh, that's what, got 'em mixed up.\n So what is it though? And you don't have point slope. What is the ordered pair for y-intercept?\n Is that the one where you have parentheses with two n and then another one that's like--\n No, that's point slope. Okay, I just want the y-intercept. Okay, .2 is the y-intercept in this equation. y = mx+b.  Right, it's two. What did that tell me?  That's what the y-intercept is. What does it represent, the situation .  Okay, now wait, it's-- \n Okay, is it for two people? So  is for people? Okay, now if you were to look at your graph, which we haven't done yet. And where would negative two cross? Though I'm not sure that's . \n Now I'm also seeing something here about, . Why do you have a two here?\n Hello! \n So 30, 32.\n I know, right?\n Making me erase! \n That's okay.\n So it's three, six, nine, 12, then all this other junk?\n So you can get up there and get 33.

So it took three seconds to pass from the church, right? Now, what is minus 24 ? \n Okay, that's a year, you have y-intercept is negative 24, and it represents?  Okay, I want you to do one  graph. \n Okay yeah, whatever your Y is starting at. By the way, this is a . They want you to draw a line . Okay so, what is ?  Time in seconds, right? Where does the y intercept?  It crosses x, okay? It crosses x. The y-intercept crosses.  The y-intercept crosses y. Okay, the y-intercept crosses the y. \n Okay, so y is gonna cross the axes that is talking about what?  Okay? All right?  It's crossing, talking about time, okay? \n It's supposed to say what is the slope, the slope is wards for s.\n You should move your line so that it follows the dots. Okay, I'm gonna come back here. What's the problem?\n Time, .\n They're confusing me.\n All right, so number three, you said the y-intercept is six-elevenths of a second, is that what you're saying? Six-elevenths seconds? Okay, and you said that was what?  Okay.  All right, what were the people doing? People were passing books. So six-elevenths, okay, means that it took six-elevenths, were no people ? What was happening during--\n Each person to pass .\n So was each person passing the book at six-elevenths?\n That's how long it took for them to start passing.  Six elevenths of a second.\n Okay. So, who passed the first globe. I mean, who's was that?\n Angela.\n Okay, so he did what?\n He had to run around, and then to come back. And here and turn, a person.\n Right. He had to leave his desk . Okay now, is that an average throw? Okay, what's your average that you're talking about?\n 14 seconds for every 11 men.\n Okay, so we might wanna just change that to a decimal, okay? So, just find out how many for one person. Just change it to a decimal. And you might wanna change six-elevenths to a decimal so you can have an actual  Okay? That's great, all right. That's okay, does everybody understand what Jade was saying?\n I think the reason why she did that was because .\n We had to make a line.\n Okay now, . Okay, that doesn't mean make a line graph, .\n Oh!\n Okay. Are you ?  Drawing a straight line, a straight line. Now we just wanna look at what you got here. Okay, what did you put .\n One.\n One? And what does it mean?\n I got 1.27672767.\n Okay, and what does the slope on the line? Now don't worry about your line right now, just answer these questions. What does the slope on the line, your slope of one, represent in this situation?\n One second per pass?\n Okay, all right, you're gonna do one second per pass.\n Averaged--\n Per--\n Person.\n One second per person to pass the book. Get back, right? Okay. So what does your y-intercept represent?\n If it's at zero with no passage, that's what the seconds are, that's what the point is.\n Okay, say that again?\n If there's no passes, like the time starts at negative two seconds, I guess. I don't know how to explain.\n Did you get a negative?\n Yeah.\n Now, is that possible?\n No.\n No? Okay. Why might you have a negative? \n Sometimes it drops.\n Okay, but, if you have negative time, okay, can you? \n  She'd be like, oh yeah that was negative three seconds ago.\n Yeah, negative no, that was three seconds ago, but it wasn't, so you got a  point two, right, seconds. All right? Now, let's just think about, and you said it was what, negative two seconds, but . He wrote people. Okay, when was there a time when there was zero people?  \n  I mean in this situation during the book pass! When was there zero time?\n Never.\n When it's .\n When, okay. When they start moving, but somebody was moving.\n I think it's zero passes.\n No, all right, what does your y line represent?\n Time in seconds.\n Time in seconds.  So the y-intercept rounded out, that's what? Time in seconds, right? So it's a time, when was time when the books were not being passed?  Somebody had to all right, walk over and, pick 'em up, and then somebody had to walk over and put them.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 812 MATH EA 812 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.212538], "annotations": [["Inaudible", "Inaudible", "inaudible", "inaudible", "Inaudible"], ["Inaudible"], ["inaudible"], ["inaudible"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible", "inaudible"], ["inaudible"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible", "inaudible", "inaudible", "Inaudible", "inaudible"], ["inaudible", "inaudible"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible", "inaudible"], ["inaudible", "inaudible"], ["inaudible", "Inaudible", "inaudible", "inaudible"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible", "inaudible"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible", "inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible", "inaudible", "inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["inaudible", "inaudible", "inaudible", "laughing"], ["laughing"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW05", "TW09m", "TW17m"]}, "813": {"text": " Two times two--\n Aggregating rules, smaller the denominator, the bigger the fraction.\n That don't work sometimes.\n I know what you're thinking.\n Six eighths, okay.\n One, two, three.\n Hey, look.\n Four, five, six.\n You know it's like division, too.\n Yeah, that's--\n Okay, six eighths?\n Versus what?

We'd have paper and pen. People back in the days, they never had colorful--\n They didn't have a pencil, neither.\n Oh, yeah, well, you know what I'm talking about.\n They had clay and a pointy stick.\n All right, so, where's the paper? You guys want to use a pen or pencil?\n I already got one.\n So, who wants to go first?\n I'll go first. I will. Okay, group members. \n I can't really explain it.\n You can't really explain it? Then show me. If I said, \"four tenths\" and \"one third.\" Okay, so then how do you know that four tenths is bigger than one third, looking at those fraction bars?\n Because you add this and minus this. It's... It's one more than you need.\n No, because if you add one tenth to one third, it's still going to be bigger.\n Oh, yeah.\n All right, but just looking at these two. If I said \"one third and four tenths,\" which one's bigger?\n Four tenths.\n Four tenths.  How do you know by looking at them?\n Because... Three, four. Like, six.\n Four tenths. It's wider than one third.\n Good, it's wider than one third. So now you guys just finished envelope number two, and you guys have a couple questions to answer about envelope number two. Who's turn is it to write?\n Kayla.\n Kayla's? So, why don't you read the group question for envelope number two?\n Without using the fraction tiles, how could you explain to someone why five twelfths is smaller than one half? How could you explain it to them that five eighths is bigger than one half?\n So, what about that question? How would you explain to someone that five twelfths is smaller than one half?\n Just like we told you, it's because twelve, well, twelve six is half of...\n Six twelve.\n Yeah, six twelve. Is half of a twelve. And five is just a little bit smaller than six twelfths.\n Okay, very good. What about, what about five eighths is bigger than one half? Israel, what do you think? How would you explain to someone why five eighths is bigger than one half?\n Five eighths?\n Yeah.  How could you explain to someone that five eighths is bigger than one half, this question right here? How would you explain to someone that five eighths is bigger than one half?\n Because like more eighths, one eighth, is bigger than like one, and like, more it adds one half, and one half--\n So, what number would eight as a denominator would be exactly one half?\n Huh?\n Which number, which fraction, with eight as the denominator, would be equal to one half?\n Four eighths.\n Why do you say four eighths?\n It's one half.\n Can you show me with the fraction tiles?\n Didn't you say not to use the fraction tiles?\n I know, but I want him to see that he's right, that four eighths is equal to one half. Okay, guys, okay, good. So, then, how would you explain to somebody why five eighths is bigger than one half?\n It's one more, one more you add to it.\n You know that one eighths is equal to one half, because they're like even numbers?\n One eighth is equal to one half?\n Four eighths, four eighths.\n That four eighths is equal to one half. Okay. All right, guys, keep on going. Answer the questions for envelope number two, and you guys can get started on envelope number three, okay?  All right, guys. So, you guys are on envelope number one?\n Yeah. We're done with envelope one, we're just like answering this question.\n You're doing what?\n We're done with envelope one, but we're answering it.\n Okay, so what is the question for envelope number one? Anthony, can you read it?\n It is--\n Someone in the class said that nine tenths was more than one third, because the bigger the number, the smaller the fraction. Are they correct? How would you explain to them where they were correct or incorrect?\n So, that's something that I've heard a lot of people in the class say. That the bigger the denominator, the smaller the fraction. Is that always true?\n No.\n No, why?\n Well, because, well, the smaller the denominator, that means like, sometimes it could be like smaller, smaller, but sometimes, I think, like, well, actually--\n You're doing good, keep on going.\n Well, since like, they're the whole--\n Okay.\n So, like, two pieces is two pieces, one's shaving it all away and the other one is for...\n So, what does the denominator actually tell you about a fraction?\n How many pieces the thing is cut into.\n How many pieces it's cut into. What does a numerator tell us about a fraction?\n How many are shaded.\n How many are shaded. So, then why, right here, why right here, is nine tenths so much bigger, or bigger than one third?\n Because it's close to one whole.\n Because it's close to one whole. And how could you explain it with what we just talked about? Savannah?\n Because it's 10 is the denominator and three is the other, so if there's 10, that means there's 10 of the small pieces, and there's nine of the small of those pieces.\n But there's nine of those pieces. So, how many of those pieces are shaded in?\n Nine.\n Good. And what about for one third? How many pieces would we shade in for one third?\n One.\n Good. All right, guys, well, keep on going. Keep on going, you guys are doing well. Try to answer these questions, and then start with envelope number two, okay? All right, guys, keep going. All right, so which envelope are you guys on right now?\n One, we're answering the questions.\n You're answering the questions?\n Yeah, and now I'm writing it down.\n Four. \n So, what did you say? What did you actually say for the second question?\n Oh, we, like, if you just, I'm not gonna say it exactly how she wrote it, but we just, we all agreed that if you keep--\n Simplifying.\n --simplifying a fraction, into its lowest terms, and if it can't go any lower, than like, then it's one half or one third, you'll know if, if it's equivalent to one half.\n Or you can find a common denominator.\n You can find a common denominator, and that will allow you to do what?\n To see if they're both the same number.\n To see if they're both the same number?\n Yeah.\n Pretty much, the same number.\n Okay, why don't you guys start envelope number two, then? Open up envelope number two, and see how you order these on the fraction line.\n Let's try one half first. First, three fourths. Wait.\n Wait.\n Yeah, three fourths goes right there, five eighths goes right here. No, no, it'll go right here. Wait. It goes right here.\n So why don't you guys use the fraction bars, then, to figure it out?\n Because I know three fourths is half of one--\n Three fourths is...\n Half of, wait.\n No, it would be more.\n It's half of--\n It would be more. It would be right here.\n Wait, I want you, I want you to explain that a little bit better for me. You said that three fourths is half of one half?\n I mean one fourth is half of one half.\n OK, one fourth is half of one half, so what about three fourths, then?\n And three fourths would go right here, because two fourths is equal to one half, and three fourths would be in the middle between one whole and one half.\n Right.\n Also, I was going to say that since we all know one half is right here, three fourths would go in front of five eighths, because one half of eight is four eighths, and then that goes right here one half of fourths is two fourths, and then, that's not the same. Three fourths of eight would be six eighths.\n Good. And how do you know that four over four goes right over here?\n 'Cause it's one, it's one whole. Wait. No, that would be the same place as three fourths. Wait, yeah, that would be the same place.\n Why would it be the same place?\n Because--\n Oh, it is.\n You said it's an equivalent fraction, can you explain what they said? Why did they say that three fourths and six eighths are equivalent fractions?\n Because they're the same. Because, because four times two is eight, and three times two is six.\n Okay. And why does that make two fractions equivalent, then? Could you show me using fraction tiles? \n I'll help you.\n You can do this.\n Four, five, six.\n So how many of these do you need?\n Six, seven.\n So what are you getting the six for?\n I'm getting eight six.\n I already have six, though.\n Three fourths.\n One, two, wait, where are the fourths?\n I believe right over, oh.\n Okay, so show me, show me using the fraction tiles why six eighths is the same as three fourths. What do you notice?\n We notice that they're the same length.\n They're the same length.\n And, also, we know that pretty much what Akosha said, that if you multiply, or if, yeah, if you multiply, like, if you multiply three times two, and four times two, it's six eighths, because four times two is, yeah, four times two is eight, and three times two is six.\n Do you notice anything else about it here?\n That two eighths equals one fourth.\n Good. Good. All right, guys, let me see the rest of this.\n Yeah.\n How did you know that five twelfths was less than one half? Go ahead.\n Six is half of twelve, and five twelfths is lower than six twelfths.\n Okay. Okay. Why did you know that one third is inbetween one fifth and five twelfths?\n 'Cause, like we don't that the smaller the denominator, the bigger it is, and so, one fourth would be in the middle. So, that would be on the other side of one fourth.\n Okay. All right, guys, keep on going. You're doing good. \n We've over. It's over.\n So, which one are you guys on now?\n Four, but we need help with one of the questions on three.\n Five, no, we need help on number four.\n Let's look at the question on number three that you guys are stuck on, then.\n We're not. We just have a question on what it is.\n A conjecture.\n A conjecture. So, conjecture is something that we, we've talked about before in math. If it says, \"What conjecture,\" it's kind of like what a hypothesis is in science.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 813 MATH EA 813 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.153131], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW13", "TW23", "TW24TW02"]}, "994": {"text": " Let's talk about the advantages and disadvantages of each company. Let's start with T-Shirts R Us. Okay, who can explain to me what's going on with T-Shirts R Us? Devon?\n  You have to pay a 50 dollar copay and you have to pay six dollars per shirt.\n Okay, so you've got to pay And then what do you pay per shirt?\n  Six.\n Six dollars per shirt. Okay, what are the advantages of that? How is this one in some way better than top of the line? Allegra, what's better about this company?\n  You only have to pay six dollars per shirt.\n You only have to pay six dollars per shirt. So, you're telling me six dollars per shirt is definitely better than eight dollars per shirt? Right? Okay, what's the disadvantage to this plan? Who can tell me the disadvantage to this one, Sarah?\n  You have to pay 50 dollars first.\n You have to pay 50 dollars up front, okay? So, if I were going to buy a lot of shirts, let's say I was going to buy 200 shirts, which company do you think would be the best for 200 shirts? Taylor?\n  I think the T-Shirts R Us would be better, because you only have to pay 50 dollars and the shirts are only six dollars per shirt.\n Yeah, for this one the more shirts you buy, the better deal it becomes, right? But for this one, if you're not going to buy, if we were only going to buy for say 10 people, would we want to pay that 50 dollars up front? Are we probably going to buy enough shirts to make up that difference? Probably not, okay. So for top of the line tees, our initial charge, the nice thing about top of the line, what's the advantage of top of the line?\n  They're eight dollars.\n That it, raise you hand. Kevin?\n  They're only eight dollars.\n They're already eight dollars but is that their advantage?\n  Yes.\n  No.\n  Patrick says no. Patrick, is their advantage that they're eight dollars per shirt? What's the advantage for top of the line?\n  Isn't it because the design is free?\n Is free, so do we have to pay anything up front?\n  No.\n No, so if Cameron, if you and I were the only people that wanted to get shirts, that would probably be a good place to go, right, because for eight plus eight we pay 16 dollars, but up here two shirts is going to be expensive, right? Right?\n  Yeah.\n Yeah, it would be over 60 dollars, right?\n  62.\n That's not a very good price for shirts, okay. Brett?\n  I kind of brought this kind of up in my group even though it like wasn't really part of the data.\n  Okay?\n  Another thing I kind of thought whenever I was working on this last night, was if they're charging money for the graphic, couldn't it possibly be like a better graphic, but...\n It could be. It doesn't necessarily mean that it is, and I think for this we would probably be assuming that the quality would be at least comparable, maybe not identical but at least close, okay. All right. So, let's look at a couple of different things, okay? Let's start with these tables. You guys have had a minute to look at these tables. What, the first question says, which of the following tables represents T-Shirts R Us? With this being our given information, which one of these tables is T-Shirts R Us? Tell me how you know, Amanda.\n  The first one because the cost starts at 50 before you even buy any shirts?\n Okay, so Amanda says that this one is T-Shirts R Us, and how did you know that? You explained that in a really interesting way. How did you say that?\n  Because the costs are 50 before you buy any of the shirts.\n Yeah, Amanda says this one has to be T-Shirts R Us because you can see in the table the initial charge of 50 dollars. Do you guys agree that you can see the initial charge of 50 dollars?\n  Yes.\n Okay, that's one way to say it. Is there another way? Lindsay, you had something interesting on your paper. What's the other way that we can tell whether or not that's T-Shirts R Us?\n  I divided 30, divided by five equals six.\n Can you tell me where you got the number 30 and five?\n  In t-shirts there were a five dollar difference. The t-shirts goes up by five.\n Yeah, so this one goes up.\n  And the cost up by 30. And I just divided the two numbers and it told me which of the companies sells the shirts for six dollars.\n So she said that she found that the cost was going up 30 every time the shirts went up five. So, then to figure out how much each shirt was, she divided the 30 by six and figured out... Oh no, not by six, 30 by five and figured out that each shirt was six dollars per shirt. So, one way to figure it out is look at the rate of change, right, and another way to figure it out is to look at the initial cost. Like, what is it that you have to pay up front. So, in this problem can we see both? Can we look at this table and see here's what you have to pay up front and then here's what you have to pay per shirt? Can you see that?\n  Yes.\n Okay. Write that down. All right, so look at the table and let's talk about the original question that we asked. The original question that I asked you, and this was just a pick. Which company did you think would be the better option for our 25 students?\n  T-Shirts R' Us.\n What did you find out when you really, really investigated? Casey?\n  They're both 200 each.\n You really find out for exactly 25 students they both cost...?\n  200 dollars.\n 200 dollars. So, if we were just buying t-shirts for our class, would it matter which company we chose?\n  No.\n No. What if we decided we wanted to do all of my math students? If we decided we wanted to do all of my math students, which one of these tables would favor the option of buying it for all 100? Bree, what do you think? If we were going to buy t-shirts for all 100 students, because at 25, the cost is the same, right? Which one of these is going up more quickly?\n  The one on the left.\n The one on the left's going up more quickly? What do you think? Nahla says she disagrees. Nahla?\n  The one on the right is going up more quickly because it's going up by 40.\n Yeah, this one's going up how much every five shirts?\n  40.\n Yeah, this one's going up 40, and at that same time, this one's only going up?\n  30.\n 30, right Bree? So, Bree, which one's going up faster?\n  The right one.\n Yeah, so they're the same here. Do you guys see they're the same here? You see that Bree? But if this one's going up faster, if I'm going to buy a whole, if I'm going to buy a lot more shirts, what's going to eventually happen with this one?\n  It will increase.\n It's going to get increasingly more expensive, okay. So, somebody summarize this for me. What did we just figure out about tables? What did we just explain about tables? What can you find on tables? Sierra, tell me what we can find by looking at a table?\n  Y-intercept.\n  We can definitely find the Y-intercept. Can you tell me how we can find the Y-intercept?\n  When the X value is zero.\n When the X value is zero, that's going to be our Y-intercept. That was an excellent explanation. Guys, what else can we find from the graph? We can find the Y-intercept, what else can we find? Samantha?\n  We can find the slope.\n  We can find the slope, and can you summarize how we found the slope?\n  We found the differences between the y column and the x column and then we put in the rise over run.\n Yeah, we found the differences between the y column and the x column and then wrote them as the ratio rise over run. Excellent job, okay. So, that's tables. Cameron, question?\n  Is it okay on the table where it says, like, t-shirts in the columns, is it okay to put x and y over them?\n Cameron, if that helps you understand it then yes, that's completely fine. But you need to understand that x and y represent something. Right? It's okay for you to think about it as x and y, but just keep in mind that x represents the number of t-shirts and y represents cost, okay? That's a good question. All right, now let's look at the graph. Okay, suppose these two graphs were given to you. Okay, look at the graph. Is everything on the graph the same in terms of the way the graph's set up? Does the scale set look the same?\n  Yeah.\n The x-axis is identical and the y-axis is identical. So, let's talk about the graph for a second. Look at the graph. Adam, can you look at that graph and tell me which thing, which one of these two graphs do you think is top of the line?\n  The one on the right?\n The one on the right. Can you tell me why, because top of the line, keep in mind, the initial charge was zero and the cost per shirt was eight dollars per shirt. How did you pick this one to be top of the line?\n  Because it started at zero?\n Okay, so one of the things that's important was that you realized it started at zero. So, he looked at this and recognized that my, he said starts... at zero. Okay? That's important. How else could we figure out that that was, how else could we figure that out? Allegra?\n  I said that since it was five times eight, well, that's the first coordinate it would be.\n Oh, okay so the first coordinate was five, 40, so you said five times eight is...?\n  40.\n 40, okay, what about this one?\n  That is 80.\n 10 times eight is 80? Okay, is that an interesting way of thinking about it?\n  Yes.\n And does that also work? Does that make sense with this problem? Starts at zero and every shirt costs eight dollars, so she said five times eight, 10 times eight, and that pattern would work all the way up. Is there other ways that I could identify that this is top of the line, Amanda?\n  I went down there on the table, that the rate of the pulse goes up faster,\n Uh-Huh?\n  so, like, when you said how...\n Did you guys here the word she used to describe that? She said she recognized that this rate is going up faster than this rate. Do you guys agree with that?\n  The line's more steep.\n Yeah, the line has greater steepness is the word you used, steep, right? Yeah, so this one, not only does it start at zero, so we can recognize it that way, but we also recognize that it's going up more quickly. This one's going up eight dollars each shirt and this one's only going up six dollars each shirt, because, let's look at the rate of change for this one. If we went from zero to five, that went over five, right? And then from 50 up to 80, is what?\n  30?\n That's... from 50 to 80 is...?\n  30?\n 30, and so 30 over five gives me how much?\n  Six.\n Six per shirt, okay? Nahla, you had your hand up?\n  Yeah.\n Go ahead.\n  I was gonna say, that I understand that it started at 50? So, that would be T-Shirts R Us? So, if that was T-Shirts R Us, then the other one had to be top of the line.\n Guys, did you hear what Nahla said? Nahla said she looked at this graph and noticed that this one started at 50, so, because that one started at 50 it had to be what?\n  T-Shirts R Us.\n  T-Shirts R Us, okay? So, so what're we talking about? We're talking about looking at a graph and finding two things. What are the two things that we need to be able to find from our graph? Greg tell me one.\n  Slope.\n We need to do our final slope. Emanuel tell me the other one.\n  The Y?\n We need to be able to find the slope and the y-intercept, okay? Emanuel, can you summarize for me how to find the y-intercept? How do you look at a graph and find the y-intercept?\n  Where the line crosses the y-axis?\n Where the line crosses the y-axis. So ,Sierra told us when we're on our table, we're looking for where...? \n  the x is zero,\n The x is zero, but on the graph that means that it crosses the y-axis. Okay, nice. Can somebody tell me from a graph, how to find slope? Stella, I haven't heard from you for a minute. How do we find slope from a graph?\n  You use the slope triangle.\n You use the slope triangle.\n  Uh-huh. Then it leads your eyes, for example, can we talk about this one?\n It doesn't matter, you pick whichever one you'd like.\n  So, it will be the rise and speed, it's going up.\n Yeah, so this is our rise, okay.\n  And the run is how far it's going out.\n And the run is how far it's going out.\n  It's rise over run.\n And then you write it as a ratio, rise to run, okay? Excellent. Guys, I have one final question on the graph. So, we picked these, we did our slope triangles from those blue ones that are drawn right? And for this one we got 30 over five and figured out that that was six, right? Would it matter if I did..., went too far I think. Would it matter if I did that?\n  No.\n I heard no. Can someone raise your hand and explain to me why that's no? So, why does it not matter? Sydney?\n  Because it's the same shape, it's just larger. It's a similar figure. So, I guess if you were finding rise over run and once you simplify it, it would be the same?\n Did you guys hear what Sydney said? Sydney used the word similar, or used the phrase, similar figures. What do similar figures mean? What does that mean, Greg?\n  Like, two figures that have the, like they're, they don't exactly have to be the same size? It's like, basically a dilation of the other.\n It's essentially a dilation. Okay, so the first one we did went up 30, over five. Right? Well what about the red one? The red one went from five to 20. How much did it go over, if it went from five to 20?  Cameron?\n  15?\n It went over 15. So, if this one goes over 15, you sort of used that word, dilation, right? What's the scale factor from five to 15?\n  Positive 3.\n That's times by positive 3, right? So, likewise, what should this be? If my run was 15, what should my rise be? Raise your hand if you know. Jaylynn?\n  90?\n It should be 90. Okay, so let's check and see if it is. So, we went from five, so that went 15, and then we went from 80 up to 170. Now, what's the difference from 80 to 170?\n  80 to what?\n 80 to 170.\n  I don't know.\n That's okay. What's the difference? Who can tell me the difference from 80 to 170? Sierra?\n  90?\n The difference is 90. So, if I looked at those two ratios, so, if I looked at those two ratios, one would give me 90 over 15 and the other one would give me 30 over five. Are those equal?\n  Yep.\n Yes, that is, let's check it. Are each of those giving you six dollars per shirt?\n  Yes.\n Yeah, so how do we find slope from a graph? Taylor said we make the slope triangle, and does it matter which triangle you pick?\n  Nope.\n No, because they should be proportional. They should be dilations of one another. Okay, it be a good reference to something that we learned.\n  Can you show us how to start out like the first one? Or the first few pages?\n So, the question was, do you have to start out at the first one?\n  No.\n Sydney, why no?\n  Because, if the pretense is that the initial charge is 50 dollars, then you don't have to. Unlike the other one, it started at zero.\n  Mm-hm?\n Are you talking about the final slope, Nahla?\n  Yes.\n Okay, Nahla, you can start at the first point, but you don't have to, because if it's linear, should the pattern ever change?\n  No. So, if the pattern never changes, does it matter which two points you pick?\n  No.\n Any two exact points you pick, should still give you the same rate of change. That was a great question. Okay, all right. So now, this is a different one. So, on the last one, I gave you the verbal. Right, I did, I said T-Shirts R Us and gave you the verbal expression. This time I'm not giving you that. This time, we've got a third t-shirt company. The third t-shirt company Tee Time, they explain to us, this is their function cost. Cost is equal to 4.50x, plus 25. My question is, what does that mean? Who can tell me what it means to do 4.5x, plus 25? Samantha, start me.\n  We would charge and 4.50 per each t-shirt.\n Okay, so what do we have to pay no matter what? Patrick, what is the one thing we have to pay? If we ordered a shirt, what's the one thing they're going to charge us?\n  For the design? They're going to charge us that 25 dollars for the design, right? But then...\n  Each time?\n Huh?\n  Each time?\n Well, that's a great question. Do they charge us 25 dollars every time? That's a great, great, great, great, great question. No, why not? What's the 25 dollars for?\n  It's for the design on every shirt.\n It's for the design, and that is the design that we're going to use for all of our shirts. So, that's an important question. Does the y-intercept explain anything about change? Will the y-intercept change? Will it move up or down? No, the initial cost is whatever the initial cost is, okay? That was a great question. Who can tell me a little bit about what this graph would look like? What would the graph look like?\n  It looks like a zero,  but I think it'd start at 25 here.\n It would start at 25. So, it's go to start somewhere right in here, okay? And I'm not sure why those numbers are on the table, but they shouldn't be there. Okay, but that's okay. We can move forward from it. We can do this. What should the cost be initially?\n  25.\n The cost should initially be 25 dollars, okay. Then if we buy five shirts, how can we figure that out? Who can tell me how to figure that out? Ah, ?\n  You can plug in the value of five in the equation thing.\n You can plug into the equation? Ooh, I know what we can use. Oh, we can use... I heard somebody say this earlier. We can use a calculator right? Where would I put this information in the calculator?\n  Y equals.\n I'd go to y equals, excellent. Okay, and I put it in there my function. Right, so I've got 4.50x, plus 25.\n  And then you press second?\n Yeah, what am I trying to look at? I'm trying to look at my table. Let's go back for just a second. Look at the table that's already given to us. What do they do in their table?\n  It increases by five.\n They increase their x values by five. So, do I want to set mine up to go by fives?\n  Yes.\n Yeah, so how do, didn't I, how do I set up a table?\n Where do I do that?\n  It's a second and it's on top of a window?\n Yeah, it's second and it's on top of a window, we've got a table set up. Where do we want to start our table? What's the first number we need?\n  Five.\n Okay, because we already know zero, right? And then how much do we want to increase each time?\n  Five.\n We want to increase each time by fives, okay. Are we okay with that? Now, where do I go to actually have the calculator give me the information? Sydney, where do I go?\n  You press second and then you press the graph button?\n Second, graph, which will give me the table. So, I will give you a minute to make sure that your table is still being corrected, because I'm going to need you to help me with mine. I don't know why I put the wrong table up there. Okay, we good? All right so we used the calculator to help us get our table. What was it in fives? Who can help me with this? Help me with this, Cameron, real quick.\n  47.5.\n That's 47.5, or 47.50, right? What about tens?\n  70.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 994 MATH AYA 994 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.00431009], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["Devon"], ["NaN"], ["Devon"], ["NaN"], ["Allegra"], ["NaN"], ["Sarah"], ["NaN"], ["Taylor"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Kevin"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["Patrick"], ["Teacher"], ["Patrick"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Patrick"], ["NaN"], ["Brett"], ["Teacher"], ["Brett"], ["NaN"], ["Amanda"], ["NaN"], ["Amanda"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Lindsay"], ["NaN"], ["Lindsay"], ["NaN"], ["Lindsay"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Casey"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Bree"], ["NaN"], ["Nahla"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Bree"], ["NaN"], ["Bree"], ["NaN"], ["Sierra"], ["Teacher"], ["Sierra"], ["NaN"], ["Samantha"], ["Teacher"], ["Samantha"], ["NaN"], ["Cameron"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Adam"], ["NaN"], ["Adam"], ["NaN"], ["Allegra"], ["NaN"], ["Allegra"], ["NaN"], ["Allegra"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Amanda"], ["NaN"], ["Amanda"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Nahla"], ["NaN"], ["Nahla"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Greg"], ["NaN"], ["Emanuel"], ["NaN"], ["Emanuel"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Stella"], ["NaN"], ["Stella"], ["NaN"], ["Stella"], ["NaN"], ["Stella"], ["NaN"], ["Stella"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Sydney"], ["NaN"], ["Greg"], ["NaN"], ["Cameron"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Jaylynn"], ["NaN"], ["Jaylynn"], ["NaN"], ["Jaylynn"], ["NaN"], ["Sierra"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Sydney"], ["NaN"], ["Sydney"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Nahla"], ["NaN"], ["Nahla"], ["Nahla"], ["NaN"], ["Samantha"], ["NaN"], ["Patrick"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Sydney"], ["NaN"], ["Cameron"], ["NaN"], ["Cameron"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW06m", "TW13", "TW15", "TW16", "TW24TW06", "TW24TW07"]}, "996": {"text": " Right here. Okay, so is that gonna tell us what one of our asymptotes is?\n Yeah.\n Yes, because your asymptote is where this would be undefined, right? So, it's gonna be X equals what?\n Positive two?\n Positive, but, okay, if we put positive two there, we have two plus two.\n So, it'd be negative two?\n Negative two, that's why we have an asymptote that X equals negative two, okay? Now is there another number out here?\n No. No, so what would that other number be? See there is one here, but there's not one here.\n So it'd just be zero.\n So, it'd just be zero. So, does that tell you what your other asymptote is? Y equals zero, 'cause f of x stands for... that's your y isn't it? Okay. So, you can tell by looking at the function itself, what your asymptotes are gonna be. Okay, tell me what this asymptote's gonna be, your x, your vertical asymptote.\n  Zero?\n  Zero, X equals zero, so you're gonna be drawing your asymptote right there. What about your y? Remember how we covered this up, and you would have y equals what?\n Negative one?\n Negative one, y plus negative one. So, the function itself tells you your asymptotes, doesn't it? Okay, does that help?\n Yeah.\n  Okay. \n  All right, so...\n  No, but it's like that right here though.\n  But see she has negative two.\n  Right here.\n  Then how did she get the, did we write the first one wrong then?\n  'Cause x equals zero.\n  No, because she got zero and negative two, and that's what I got. You wrote it down wrong.\n  Where?\n  Right here, 'cause zero is supposed to be on top. Oh, so, no, never mind, you got it right.\n  It's the same. I just switched these around. No, but you're right because you know how x is vertical, okay, so, for this one it's going to be, the x is going to be negative 2, right?\n Mm-hmm.\n Okay I got it.\n  So wait, the asymptote isn't the same thing as the parent function, right?\n No.\n Did you have the graph? Did it turn out?\n And how do you know, up here?\n Check this thing out.\n Huh?\n  So, what would the parent function be?\n That's what I was trying to work out for you.\n  Did you find the parent function?\n For what?\n It's not x squared, is it?\n One over x.\n  All of them is going to be one over x.\n 'Cause you can't just put x. She said put a one divided by x. That'd be the parent function.\n  All right.\n How do you know which is the parent function?\n It's the one that's consistent.\n That first one that you put.\n It's the one that's exactly in between the first and third quadrant. This is your parent function. This is your parent function.\n This one and this one, right? So blue right there and right there.\n But you totally ruined it.\n Yeah.\n Yeah, the colors I used are kind of weird.\n Do you have a red? Are you using it?\n This is the graph, right? So, if it's the first one and the third one, right?\n Hey wait, that first thingy comes out at negative three, not negative two.\n Hm?\n  This first little line right here comes out negative three, not negative two. Is the parent function still, I mean, is the asymptote still negative two?\n I think\n  \n So, how is one negative two?\n  You gotta switch it, because the one x plus two when you use the calculator you go into a negative, so the y would be zero because it's not going to negative.\n How would the y be zero, the y is a negative?\n You got em' switched, all you gotta do is switch em'.\n I'm not understanding. She busy.\n Okay. Oh, I know why. It's because we don't have no y in the equation. Like this one, it'd have a y. The y would be negative one. And on this one, we don't have it, so, automatically the y would be zero and the x would be negative two.\n That makes more sense.\n  All right you got it.\n Yeah I had to think about that.\n \n  So, that's how you do it.\n So, then the asymptote is the...  right here?\n  Uh-huh.\n Which one?\n So, then the translation is the down one.\n Wait, what?\n The translation is the down one.\n So, what is this down?\n  Let me plug it in. Divide by x parentheses... One over, divided by x minus one.\n Okay, so we don't need no parenthesis?\n  No.\n  I'm almost done.\n You're crossing it, that's the y, yeah. But that's the x. This is x and this is y.\n Yes.\n  Well, look on the sheet. It will show you that, um...\n I basically used this one as an example. It's like the same type of format that the problem is.\n Okay.\n Okay, yeah that makes sense.\n So, the asymptote is zero.\n It says h equals x .\n Yeah.\n Yeah, so zero, yeah wait... Yeah.\n  This is the graph you start with?\n Yeah, that makes more sense 'cause that's how the graph is. Okay, we got the asymptote. X equals, is it zero? Yeah, and then y equals negative one. And the translation is one unit down. Do you have a value?\n Yeah.\n Uh-oh.\n So, it'd be three units down. We would put this on negative three cause that's y. So, since it's y, we would have to put it on negative three and zero.\n Right?\n  'Cause it's the same as this.\n Yeah.\n And then y equals negative three.\n Yeah, x equals zero and y equals negative three. Translation, three units down.\n Wherever the lines, like, go the furthest but don't touch.\n Okay.\n Oh, you're just marking down the asymptotes?\n Yeah. She said she forgot, yeah, so I guess you can just put up there yellow.\n Okay. Are you on number four?\n Yes.\n So, on number four it would be five units to the left.\n Number four, yeah, yeah, you're good.\n Okay.\n She just told me, she just told,\n I just wrote it wrong I guess, then.\n How do you know how to graph it with... ?\n Like in the calculator?\n In here. And it's really not good to graph it here.\n Yeah.\n Okay.\n This seems to be not that hard, now that I get it.\n Really.\n Like, remember how Grayson thought that it was three I knew she was wrong... .\n I mean, I didn't think it was wrong.\n You just instinctively knew that it was wrong.\n \n  Is it going to have a vertical shift also?\n Yep, up, down, down.\n Okay, up or down?\" Down how many?\n Two.\n On number five?\n Oh, three. It would be three.\n Three. Okay, so you're going to have two shifts on number five, right? Okay?\n Uh huh. I haven't plugged it in yet.\n We're going to have a shift here, right? What would make that undefined? If x equals...? How about positive two? Because two minus two is zero. I mean, the zero is where you needed to be. So, x equals two, right? Okay, now, what are we going to do with this thing out here? That's a vertical shift of y equals... negative three. Y equals negative three.\n \n So, we have two translations, okay? Two units right and...\n", "filename": ["Copy of 996 MATH AYA 996 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.361357], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW09m", "TW13"]}, "990": {"text": "  Megan, what quadrant am I going to be centered in?\n Quadrant four?\n  Good, okay, so I'm gonna go to the right six, and down five... I know my radius is three root seven. Now, this may be a little difficult for you, because three root seven is kind of a hard number to wrap your mind around. Any thoughts on how we can tell which quadrants this goes into? I want to know if it goes into quadrant one first. Twink, what could we do?\n Do you un-simplify it, so when it gets through the center, it'd be like, square root of 63, and then you like, have..., so it's in-between eight, nine, or I know it's in-between seven and eight.\n  Okay, did you guys follow her on that?\n  Yeah!\n Yeah, okay, so Twink knows that this decimal is going to be between seven and eight, because she knows it's the square root of 63. And the square root of 64 is eight. So, it's just below eight. All right? So, you may be able to picture a decimal in your mind, close to eight, but not quite, so we're armed with that knowledge, true or false, this circle goes into quadrant one. Melissa.\n  \n  Agree?\n  No.\n  Ben?\n Yes, it does go into quadrant one.\n  Do you have anything to back that up?\n  Yeah, because it only, the center point is down six, and if we go up one more than that, at least.\n  James?\n It's down five, and since it's more than seven, it's gotta be at least past the two.\n There were a lot of pronouns there. What James was saying is, we're five units below the x-axis, the radius is seven point something units long, so we're going to top out right around there. There's the top of our circle, okay. Let's speed up this process a little bit here. The, is it going to go into quadrant three?\n  Yes.\n Why, Abby Simpson?\n  Because it's over six,  and yeah, you count seven the other way.\n  Okay?\n  Or a little over seven.\n  So, we're going to be there.  Oh, and now for the great dilemma, will this circle go into quadrant two, Robert, what am I going to have to resort to?\n  The distance formula?\n  I can't hear you.\n  The distance formula.\n  Okay, give me some more pairs to plug into this formula. William?\n Zero, sorry, zero minus six squared, and then zero plus five squared.\n  All right. Now what is the square root of 61 in simplified radical form? Rue?\n Is it just square root of 61?\n  Good, maybe that was a trick question. Maybe not, it's not going to break down any further, because 61 is what type of number again?\n  Prime.\n  Prime, okay, so, we've got square root of 61. Robert, you told me to use distance formula, I used distance formula. I followed your orders to the T. I still don't know if this goes into quadrant two or not.\n It does not.\n  The circle doesn't make it to quadrant two?\n  No.\n  So, you're saying it does this?\n  Yes.\n Prove it.\n  Well if you actually put, I don't know...\n \n  Call on someone else please.\n  Maddie.\n Since you know that your radius is the square root of 63, and that's a larger number than the square root of 61, it therefore passes the origin, and it goes into the opposite quadrant, or quadrant two in this case.\n So, you're saying it goes like that.\n  Correct.\n Is that good enough for your piece of mind? The radius is longer than it needs to be to reach. And therefore yeah, you're right. Moral of the story? The circle goes through all four quadrants. So far, we've kind of been in, been there, done that land, and so now I'm going to take you into some new stuff, right now. The x and y intercepts. First, the x-intercepts of this graph. How am I going to find where this circle collides with the x-axis? Let me ask an intermediate question, what do you know about every x-intercept in the universe? They all have something in common, Abby?\n  All of their lines, like the y equals zero?\n  What, I'm sorry.\n Okay, all like the y's equal zero... like the y?\n  Which variable?\n Y.\n  Equals?\n Zero.\n  One more time.\n Y equals zero.\n Okay does that makes sense to you guys?\n  Yeah.\n Because if you do go up or down to plot your ordered pair, I've got bad news for you, you're not on the x-axis any more. Thus, it's not an x-intercept. All right, just one more time Abby, I forgot what you had said earlier.\n  Y equals zero.\n Okay, so how am I going to find my x-intercepts here? Twink?\n  I have a question, does it like, the circle cross over x, like the x-axis twice?\n  Well, we'll find out if it does.\n  I mean sometimes, doesn't it?\n  Yeah.\n  So, what do you do if it does?\n  So, this is the first time in your math careers where you might have two x-intercepts. Colliding once, and coming back down and colliding again with the x-axis, that's good instincts. And I'll just warn you right now, yeah, we're going to have two x-intercepts here. Maddie, how are we going to find these two?\n  We use the formula of a circle, and we plug in for y, zero?\n  Okay, so let's get the equation up here, because I forgot to write it earlier. Josh?\n  Ah, I don't remember.\n Ella May?\n  X squared... X squared plus, or minus six? Or no, x minus six.\n  Okay.\n  Squared, plus y? Plus five. Squared, equals 63.\n Okay, Maddie, now we have our equation, and you said to do what to it?\n Since you know you have, when you're looking for an x-intercept, you're always going to have zero for your y.\n  Oh, Abby told us that.\n Yeah, you have your y in that formula equal zero.\n  Literally, literally.\n   Well, we've got to see what x is, Ben.\n  Well, I know but that's it?\n Does it make sense to you?\n  Yeah!\n It isn't that hard of a concept, and that's why I had Abby repeat it eight times. If you get that y literally has to be zero, you understand why you literally make y zero, and then solve for x. We're finding, here's one of the ordered pairs right here that we're searching for, and I'll be darned if the y is gonna be zero. The question is, what's the x? All right, so I've got x minus six squared. Plus, I'm just going to write five squared equals 63. So, according to my calculations, we have that right there. Mason?\n  You forgot that middle term. It should be minus 12 x? Yeah, or something like that. You forgot the middle term. You forgot, like, the something x. Yeah, it'd be x squared minus 12 x, and then plus 36.\n Oh, so I need to square both those terms?\n  Yes, no wait, what'd you say?\n I just wanted to square the x and square the negative six.\n  No you didn't, you wanted to square the whole thing.\n Okay, which means we utilize what process in math? What's that called again, Twink?\n  Foil?\n  Foil, we had forgotten our oi, Ben.\n  Where did we get 12 x from?\n Vanessa?\n We squared x minus six, so we used factoring. We did x minus .\n Now do you see where we get it from, Ben? Okay, thank you Ben. What to do with the 63, what to do, what to do? Mason?\n Do you just combine, like subtract 63 from both sides, combine all the like terms of the whole numbers, and then you have a quadratic equation.\n  Okay. Well, now I have a quadratic trinomial, and it's arranged in what? What do we call that, Kate?\n  Ellie?\n Descending order.\n Mm-hm. Nice, so let's try and factor that. Michelle, you're shaking your head like no way.\n  It doesn't work. Well, all right, then I guess we're stuck.\n \n  That's so stupid.\n  Don't we have to do  the quadratic formula?\n  Yes, if only I could remember that though. It's been such a long time.\n  Sing the song!  You tell me the song, I'll actually write the line pertinent to this problem, what's the first line?\n \n  Keep going...\n   Plus or minus the root of b squared minus 4 a-c, all over 2a. \n  Okay. I'm going to do some of the math for you, and then I'm going to have you do some of the math for me, because I'm more interested in seeing that you can do this. So, I get 12 plus or minus the square root of 152, over two. Now normally, normally I would have you guys simplify that and give me exact answers. But it's hard on a graph for you guys to see where something like 12 plus root 152 is, I mean that's kind of an abstract.\n So, we're actually, I'm going to let you do decimals here. So, here's what I want to do, Kevin's row through Sarah's row, I want you guys to find the plus branch, so you do plus. You two rows, find the minus. As soon as you get an answer, real quietly and quickly check with a neighbor, and make sure we have confirmation. Let's go to the nearest hundredth.\n  Okay, if you've got an answer that corresponds to what your neighbor got, regroup. Regroup, Ellie. If you've got the same answer as your neighbor, raise your hand right now, over here. So, Melissa, what was the value of x you got?\n  12.2.\n  12.2, what is it to the nearest hundredth?\n  Oh, 12.16.\n  12.16. All right,  that sounds about right. And then over here, my branch with the negative sine in there, Ellie?\n  Negative 0.16.\n Okay, now let's not lose sight of big picture here. Context, what the heck's going on? Why have we been trying to chase down x, and why are we getting two different answers? And which one is right, and which one's extraneous? Help me make sense of all this, now that the procedure is done, Michelle?\n  Neither of them are extraneous, because the circle hits the x-axis at two points?\n  So, what are my two x-intercepts?\n 12.16, and negative .16?\n  In ordered pair form.\n 12.16, zero, and negative .16, zero.\n There's that one right there, makes sense. And then the 12.16, zero hopefully you have room on your paper, I don't have room on the board for that. Should be somewhere over here. It's a good pit stop moment right here. Pull off to the side of the road. Stop for a second, are you sure this makes sense to you?\n", "filename": ["Copy of 990 MATH AYA 990 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.128903], "annotations": [["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Melissa"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Ben"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Robert"], ["Teacher"], ["Robert"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Rue"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Robert"], ["Teacher"], ["Robert"], ["NaN"], ["Robert"], ["NaN"], ["Robert"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Maddie"], ["NaN"], ["Abby"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Abby"], ["NaN"], ["Twink"], ["Teacher"], ["Twink"], ["Teacher"], ["Twink"], ["Teacher"], ["Maddie"], ["Teacher"], ["Josh"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Ben"], ["Ben"], ["NaN"], ["Ben"], ["NaN"], ["Mason"], ["NaN"], ["Mason"], ["NaN"], ["Mason"], ["NaN"], ["Twink"], ["Teacher"], ["Ben"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Michelle"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Melissa"], ["Teacher"], ["Melissa"], ["Teacher"], ["Ellie"], ["NaN"], ["Michelle"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW06m", "TW07", "TW13", "TW22", "TW23"]}, "120": {"text": "  Okay, so, write your conjectures down. Denominators are repeating. Actually, let's put this one on number four. Put it on number four. \n We got any even number that had any odd number. \n  Okay, so if it's an odd number in the denominator, it's repeating. If it's got an even number in the denominator?  Oh, okay, so you want to add to it not just say it's even. If it's odd over even --\n It's terminating,\n  It's terminating. and what if it's even over even?\n Even over even? Two over six. It would one be one over three You'd have to simplify it.\n  Okay, you'd have to simplify it, and so what would happen when you simplified 2/6 to 1/3?\n It would be repeating.\n  It would be repeating, so maybe you're on to something. Might want to record that. Let's check. That's good. I haven't heard that one before, guys. All right, let me here some of your conjectures. This group, we're going with their conjecture. What's your conjecture guys?\n  That all odd denominator fractions will repeat.\n All right, here's the conjecture. All odd numbers in the denominator will be repeating decimals. Anybody want to add to it? Take away from it? Change it? All right, what we got here, over here?\n That's false because point two five goes into 100 4 times.\n  Okay, hold on.\n  I'm confused. Point two five. What is point two five represented as a fraction?\n  1/4.\n 1/4, and they said all odd numbers are repeating.  So far it works.\n  Well then 1/5.\n All right, let's try 1/5. Well hold on then. Let's get all the conjectures before we start trying them out. I do love the action that you want to make up your own fractions and try it 'cause I don't think it's safe just to take it at a glance. All right, Dylan, what did y'all's group. George, share for your group. What did y'all say?  Listen guys.\n We had two.\n  You had two, okay.\n Even over odd equals terminating.\n  Even over odd is terminating, okay.\n  And even over even is repeating.\n  Even over even is repeating.\n He meant two by that.\n Okay, so basically, and then I would assume that odd over odd would go here? Okay, my only question is I see even over odd, odd over odd, even over even, what's the other option?\n  Odd over even.\n Odd over even, where do you think that would go? Do you think it would go terminating?\nYes.\n Well, let's pick something really quick. 3/4. That's odd over even. That would be terminating. Okay, so opposites, even and odd, odd and even, you're thinking opposites --\n Attract?\n There you go. Opposites attract to be terminating, and when they're the same even and even and odd and odd. \n They repel.\n Okay, and they repeat. Pretty good. Here's what I want you to do now. Based on what you just told me, look at number six. I've given you fractions. I want you, let's look at them as a group. I want to come to a consensus as a class. Do we all agree with this groups thinking? \n We didn't get to share ours because 8/9 repeat.\n Okay, 8/9 is even over odd, and that repeats, so maybe we want to cancel this one out, and it's just odd over even? \n There might be something else. It might be that that doesn't go, necessarily, doing anything like the rules for divisibility like seven and eight, they don't have a rule because it just doesn't work, but it's right. It might be that that doesn't work.\n Maybe if it's even a law, you just gotta work it out.\n So do we want to make our rule this? If it's odd over eating. Eating? Is it time for lunch? If it's odd over even, it's terminating, everything else is repeating? \n We should test it out before.\n 3/4 is terminating, but 7/8 isn't terminating 'cause eight...\n  7/8? Try it on your paper real quick. 7/8.\n  It terminates.\n  So do we want to use this?  No and yes, okay, let's --\n Let's do more though.\n  Let's do a democracy here, okay? If you're liking the, well hold on. Who says no? Who doesn't want to use this? Why?\n Those rules may not work all the time for every fraction.\n  Okay, so do you have a better rule or conjecture?  So far is it working?  Based on what we know and the numbers we've generated so far, let's use that rule to categorize the following fractions, and I think we could do this as a group. So here I've got, our rule we said we wanted to try was odd over even. Everything else is going in repeating. Odd over even. We've already done these, so here's our new fractions, okay? What is this fraction here?\n  11/24\n It's odd over even, so where do we want to put it?\n  Terminating.\n Terminating.\n  Terminating\n Odd over even, would make it terminating. Six what?\n  Sevenths.\n 6/7?\n  Repeating.\n Even over odd terminates. \n But that didn't work. That didn't work.\n We tried it, and we saw that it didn't work, remember? Yeah, odd over even is the only one we're going with, so I've got an odd over even. I got odd over odd.\n Repeating.\n And I've got an odd over even.\n  Terminating.\n Okay, so here's what I want you to do. Check it. Use your calculators as a group, check it. Circle, go ahead and write 'em down. Categorize them just like I did on the board. Write 'em in your chart and circle any that don't belong. \n  Use your calculator. \n It doesn't work. Odd over even.\n  It doesn't work? Oh, no! Which one doesn't work? \n Seven over six doesn't work.\n All right, let's do this then. The 6/7, were we correct there?  All right, this one's right.\n No.\n This one was repeating or terminating?\n  Terminating.\n All right, so this one, we need to move over here. All right, 5/13?\n I haven't checked --\n Haven't check that one.\n Five divided by 13.\n We don't know. Too many decimals.\n  Okay, if it's too many, what do you think it's going to be?\n  Repeating.\n Probably going to be repeating, so that one looks good. Let's do this.  Hold on, I want you guys to try 11/24. I want you to do 15/14. I want you to check 199 over 200, and I want you all to check nine over 80. \n These rules already tested out.\n That's terminating. \n The rules weren't tested enough to be proven.\n  I think my rule is solid even though it's kind of condensed. \n  Five, four, three, two, one. Thank you. All right, 11/24? It stays? All right, it repeats, so it goes over here. All right, 15/14.\n  Repeating.\n  All right, let me change this though. Let's change this one to 15/24. Check that one. And while they're checking --\n Point 625.\n  Point 625, so it's actually going to terminate, okay? Repeating or terminating?\n Terminating.\n  It terminated? And nine over 80?\n  Terminating.\n  Terminating, okay, so it didn't work.\n So odd over even doesn't work?\n Right, it didn't work, so let's think about it then. We got a --\n Do you know a rule?\n I don't know, so I'm kind of doing this with you. Let's look at this. What is important? Do you think the numerator is important? Well, if the numerator's what's important?\n I think they're evenly important.\n They're evenly important?\n Without one, the other wouldn't be the same fraction.\n Do you agree? He said, \"Without one, \"the other wouldn't be the same fraction.\" What do you mean by that?\n You said, \"Which one's important?\" If you say the numerator's important, then if you change the denominator it might not work, so they're not the same fraction without one another.\n Okay.\n If the numerator is one less than the denominator, then it will be repeating.\n If the numerator is one less than the denominator? What about 5/13?\n That's just one rule, there's multiple --\n Right, well, I want to come up with just one rule that works for them all. So let's look at this. If the numerator is what's important, can we not look at these two fractions here? What do they both have in common? They both have a common denominator, and they have different numerators, and it's actually put 'em in two, separate categories, but they're both odd.\n Prime number.\n  Oh, you're seeing something about prime number? \n If it's prime over even it'll be repeating, but a prime over an even would be...\n Okay, so we're gonna do prime over even is which one?\n Repeating.\n Prime over even is repeating.\n Okay, because even number has what factor in it? Automatically?\n Two.\n A two, and will a prime number have two as a factor?  A prime number will have two as a factor? What are the factors of prime numbers?\n  One and itself.\n The only problem with that is the number what?\n  Two.\n Two, okay, so I think you're on to something.\n If it's prime over even, then it'll be repeating.\n  Prime over even, then it's repeating?\n I found a problem with that.\n Here's what I want you to do.\n I did 11 over eight.\n  11 over eight.\n It's prime over even.\n Okay, it is a mix number. It's not a mixed number, I'm sorry. It's a?\n  Improper fraction.\n What would it need to be a mixed number? \n A whole number.\n  And a fractional part. Good job. All right, so here's my question then. Here's what I want you to do. Look up here, and I think with fractions we always seem to stress when we're doing equivalent fractions. To put a fraction in its what?\n Simplest form.\n Simplest form. Anytime there's a prime number it's already going to be in its simplest form, right? 'Cause you can't reduce it anymore, so these are already in their simplest forms. What about 15/24? Is there a factor that they both have in common?\n Three.\n Three, okay, so if I factor out three out of fifteen?\n  Five.\n I got a five.\n  Eight.\n So that's an equivalent fraction, so I'm going to get rid of that. Odd over even. So maybe we could say in a fraction's, what?\n Simplest form.\n  Simplest form. In a fraction's simplest form if it's odd over even, then it, what?\n Terminates.\n  Terminates.\n So are we doing a rule that applies to every number?\n  Every single number. So if we were to make a conjecture, do we just base it off of six numbers?\n  No.\n  What I want you to do is I want you as a group to come up with your own example that can either prove this or disprove this conjecture. The conjecture is that a fraction in its simplest form, if it's odd over even, will terminate.

One, a two, a three and go. \u266a  \u266a\n Every single person here, please make sure you're playing F natural. Try it again. Here we go. One, two and go. \u266a  \u266a\n Okay. Now, when you guys improvise, you've got to improvise off of this D dorian scale. Okay? So, watch this. If I was soloing, and I was, you know, playing along with the music, and I played this... \u266a  \u266a\n All I did was play the D dorian scale, going up and down. That's all it was. It sounded a little fancy, didn't it? It really wasn't. Did it sound difficult?\n  Yes.\n It really wasn't. I just did this, like really changing the rhythm. \u266a  \u266a\n That's basically all I did. Okay? So, it's really not that difficult. I'm gonna play some rhythms. I want you guys to echo it. Please sit up. Thank you. Nice and tall. I'm gonna play one measure and you're going to repeat exactly what I play. We're playing this one on open D. Only on open D. \u266a  \u266a\n Great, now I'm going to do two measures. Okay? Two measures and you've got to echo it back to me. This is still open D. Here we go. Wait for it, I'll tell you when to go. \u266a  \u266a\n Excellent. Okay, it goes like this. I'm going to change it. \u266a  \u266a\n And go. \u266a  \u266a\n There it is. Okay.

With the exception of basses. So do an open G okay? So, D, F, and G are your three notes. All right, get in playing position. \u266a  \u266a\n Okay. So, basically that's improvising. I'm giving you a lot of ideas for improvising. Okay? And you will only use three notes when you improvise. D, F, and G. You don't have to use all three but those are your only musical choices as far as notes. When you improvise, there are certain rules to improvising. You can't just play any note, because if you play the wrong note it will not be the right choice. Okay? So, we don't want to play the wrong note. So, please make sure that you only play D, F, and G.

You'll pick the third one with the tune. Do you guys see it?\n Yeah.\n Okay. Make sure you're on the correct side. I'll play the tune for you so you can hear how it sounds, and then I'm going to have you guys play it. Okay? Listen to my tempo. \u266a  \u266a\n Are you guys following along? \u266a  \u266a\n Okay?

Now, I'm going to solo for you guys, and I want to show you how you can do this. Okay? \u266a  \u266a \n A couple things that I did in there. All I did was play a dorian scale up and down and swung my eighth note. That's all I did. It sounds really difficult, didn't it?\n Yeah.\n It was like whoa! No, I'm just going... \u266a  \u266a\n I can make it sound fancy and make it sound really difficult. You can do it, too. Okay. So, we're going to go around the room. Each person is going to solo. Okay? Whatever musical idea you come up with. Remember, your notes are D, F, and G. You got it? D, F, and G. Whatever rhythm you want to play, within the rhythms I gave you. So don't...  Okay? Here we go. Here's how we're going to do it. We're going to start with maybe two measures. We're going to start with Tessa and go around. Maybe after, Helen. Then we go with Tallulah. Priscilla, listen carefully. After Tallulah we're going to go around this way. After Jada, we're going to start with Sammy and we're going to end with Zoey. Okay?

Right. So, what do you all think about the fact that this is written almost sort of journalistically? I know you're the big newspaper man and everything. What do you think about that?\n That's what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the growth of the poem overall. The first passage, it's almost not objective, but it kind of states what's happening. It doesn't actually say what the author is thinking. As the poem grows and goes on and goes to the next passages, it becomes more poetic and more descriptive and it's more of the author's point of view and the author's stance on what's happening.\n Nora, what do you think about the poem so far?\n I thought it was a good, like, utilization of the message. I'm taking African American history this year.\n Okay.\n We've been talking about the slave trade the last few weeks. So, that first part, we were talking about how they were like , the sickness.\n What are the specific lines that you think best describe the sickness and the death and everything?\n \"We have jettisoned the blind to no avail. It spread. The terrifying sickness spreads. It's claws have scratched the sight from the captain's eyes.\" The slaves were all tied together in their own  so the sickness and disease could spread through them. But also, the slavers, like the white people on the ship were also susceptible to disease.\n That's where they got the idea of whites becoming more like the blacks because they're in such close quarters that it's inevitable almost and the fact that they are holding themselves above them, superior as civilized, but they're still acting acts of barbarism is very much a historical principle.\n So, you really think that there's a moment of transformation in this poem where the whites, who are theoretically the real barbaric people become like the blacks, who they think are savages.\n I don't think it's even a point of transformation. I believe that the author, Robert Hayden, is talking about this as it has been. So, this kind of opens in maybe a stress when they're sailing on the slave ship and they talk about this and it's like there's all sorts of imagery throughout this that implies that these blacks are, er, these whites are becoming like the blacks.\n What's your favorite line that shows this, Nick?\n \"Standing to America, bringing home black gold, black ivory, black seed.\" Now, I especially liked the middle part of that, black ivory. Because ivory is usually white.\n Of course. Yes.\n Yeah.\n So, you have the juxtaposition of black and white.\n Yes.\n I think the lines after that, \"Deep in the festering hold thy father lies, of his bones, New England pews are made, those are altar lights that were his eyes.\" Jordan, what do you think the about this religious connotation?\n Well, seeing that I'm not too familiar with the Bible-- Judaism and Christianity are similar-- but in these two paragraphs that you were just reading, I saw a big contrast between the glory of taking back these animals, these slaves and making the best of them in the new world. Between that and the evil that they're really bestowing upon the slaves-- \"Standing to America, bringing home black gold, black ivory, black seed,\" is kind of glory and that contrast between evil, \"Deep in the festering hold thy father lies, of his bones, New England pews are made, those are altar lights that were his eyes.\"\n They also kind of need a religious figure throughout this voyage because throughout this we see that they're going through a time of spiritual crisis. \"What port awaits us, Davy Jones or home? I've heard of slavers drifting, drifting, play things of wind and storm and chance, their crews gone blind, the jungle hatred crawling up on deck.\" It's like they understand that they're becoming uncivilized and they're trying to find a way to change this.\n To justify their actions.\n Yeah.\n That's what they need, a justification for their actions. So, they say God is with them and everything is okay.\n And you have that sort of anaphora of the hymn, that \"Jesus our Savior pilot,\" throughout this entire thing that sort of brings and invokes the God into all of this so that it's almost as if to me, they're looking for their justification. They're looking to justify the horrific actions that they're putting out.\n Which is ironic because these are often, these spirituals are often sung by slaves to get through all of the times of turmoil. So, it's ironic that they're claiming that God is on their side as a justification for the enslaving of blacks.\n I think it's also ironic, though, that the blacks are the ones who receive the justification from a lot of the whites in the new world. At the end talking about John Quincy Adams, he says it was completely justified what the blacks did when they revolted and attacked the white slavers. The suffering that they had been enduring...\n And that's like the moment of irony.\n Yeah.\n The slavers are saying, \"How paradoxical indeed that you whose wealth, whose tree of liberty are rooted in the labor of your slaves should suffer the august John Quincy Adams to speak with so much passion of the right of chattel slaves to kill their lawful masters...\"\n \"...And with his Roman rhetoric, weave a hero's garland for Cinquez.\" This is what I want you all to think about. Think about the historical connections here. John Quincy Adams, one of our founding fathers, fourth president of the United States was ultimately the man who got freedom or found freedom in court for Cinquez and the other slaves that were on the Amistad, which is a ship that, of course, being discussed in here. Think about these historical connections. I shall return. All right, group. What's going on?\n We're talking about a poem.\n You're talking about a poem? I'm going to talk about a poem, too.\n What a coincidence.\n I know. Isn't it coincidental? What's going on? What are you all discussing so far?\n We're looking for the marrow part.\n You're looking for the marrow part?\n Yeah.\n I'm glad you all have your \"Beloveds\" out and everything. What really interests me is the fact-- I think we have a real instance here where the 60 million or more to whom the book was dedicated. This is their story, is it not? What do you all think? How can we connect our reading of this poem to our reading of \"Beloved?\"\n In the second part, in the last paragraph, it says, \"The fever is melting down my bones.\"\n Yes.\n Right now we're connecting that to Stamp Paid, who at some point had said that he was tired in his marrow, as in his bone marrow. We're looking for the page right now.\n Okay. Found it.\n Okay.\n And it's on this.\n Whoa. What is that? Read the passage to us.\n \"'My marrow is tired', he thought. 'I've been tired all my days, bone tired but now it's in the marrow. It must be what Baby Suggs felt when she lay down and thought about color for the rest of her life.'\"\n Okay. So, let's connect what you say in this stanza, you have, \"I'd be trading still but for the fevers melting down my bones.\" What is it about that stanza that you want to connect to this allusion?\n We thought that her fever is melting down-- we thought that it was, it's pretty much the exact same connection because it's bones going into the marrow, so the outside going into the inside. \"The fever is melting down to my bones,\" it's just taking a different way.\n And to get more than a physiological point of view here, the marrow is where? Where is the marrow?\n In your bones.\n It's like the core. So, Raphael, when we're suggesting that the marrow is being corrupted in some way, what does it mean for us?\n It basically means that the entirety of the whole of the being is being corrupted.\n Okay. So, in essence, then, from a symbolic point of view, just like in \"Beloved,\" we can relate this to the poem. What kind of corruption do you see here?\n For me, it was mainly corruption of hypocrisy.\n Okay. Hypocrisy in what context?\n Mainly that the enslavers honestly believed that they were in the right, that they were different, like this passage, this short passage here. \"It sickens me to think of what I saw, of how these apes throw overboard the butchered bodies of our men, true Christians all, like so much jetsam.\"\n Yes.\n And then at the very beginning, they're talking about how they're throwing slaves overboard.\n Or even when the slaves decide to, \"Lost three this morning leaped with crazy laughter to the wading sharks, sang as they went under.\"\n Yeah.\n So, there's this sort of weird juxtaposition of the whites being thrown over by the savages or the apes at the end versus the slaves who choose to jump over at the beginning. Laura, what do you think is going on in this particular context?\n With all of the jumping off board, it's a true escape to eternal freedom, I guess if you believe in Heaven. The thing that confuses me is I understand why the savage blacks would throw the whites over, obviously death and more of a pain, but it also ends their misery in a way of staying on the ship with the slaves getting the sickness, the blindness and having to wait, I think it's like another three weeks before they come to port. So, it's really contrasting and interesting how it goes back and forth. This poem focuses, I think, on both sides, on black and white.\n Yes. It really does illustrate both. Which do you think is best illustrated, Laura, the black side or the white side?\n The black side is really, I don't want to say common, but it's similar to everything you hear about slave ships--\n And the slave trade.\n ...and the slave trade. So, I think it's interesting that Hayden decided to also put in the white side of it because you don't really focus on what came of slavery. Even though it was a horrible thing, on the last page here it says, \"That you whose wealth, whose tree of liberty are rooted in the labor of your slaves,\" I thought it was interesting because I often fail to make the connection that through the slavery, we actually were able to grow as a country and through our liberty first, we were able to bring the slaves out eventually through the Civil War.\n Jordan, continue.\n I was looking at more of the religious side of it as with what you were just talking about. Here it says, \"Their moaning is a prayer for death.\"\n Yes.\n \"Some try to starve themselves.\" And then you go down one, two, three, four stanzas later, it says, \"Jesus Savior pilot me over life's tempestuous sea. We pray that thou will grant, O Lord, safe passage to our vessels bringing heathen souls...\" It's not so much praying for death, it's praying and knowing that Jesus can lead them to freedom forever and allow them out of...\n Who is praying for Jesus here, Jordan?\n The slaves.\n Really?\n That's how I took it.\n Okay. Did anybody here take it a different way?\n I took it as the sailors.\n Exactly. Good. Not that that's-- I think you're on to something in the sense that the religion of the slavers was eventually forced upon the slaves themselves. So, I think that they could be. So, I think there's a real sort of duality there.\n For this point in history they evangelized--\n Evangelized.\n They had already--\n Evangelized. Yes. It's a hard word to say.\n Africa. I know the Dutch, for example, had already been there.\n So, historically speaking then, Raphael, when you say it's the slavers that are the ones that are praying, what's ironic about all of this?\n That they're so much in the wrong and they don't see it all and that kind of hypocrisy.\n And they're looking for justification for their actions. Speaking of justification, what I want you to think about now for a few minutes-- I'm going to talk to the other group up front here-- why is it that the white side of things is all reported to us literally through almost a journalistic style? It's all quotes. It's all basically kind of like it's from a ship's log. So, think about this and I'm going to be back to talk to you about it. All right, group, what's going on?\n It's all going on.\n It's all going on? Okay. Tell me. What have we discussed?\n Everything.\n Everything? Tell me more.\n Well, we've discussed about how in this stanza, \"That there was hardly room 'tween decks for half the sweltering cattle stowed spoon-fashion there; that some went mad of thirst and tore their flesh and sucked the blood. \" That was talking about the capture of the Africans.\n Yes.\n Who wouldn't be so thirsty that they wouldn't tear open their own skin and drink their own blood.\n Which is just crazy in terms of the suffering.\n Yeah. And how that shows that in some way they were driven into some sorts of savagery. And yet in the next stanza, it talks about how the crew would lay with the--\n The Guinea Rose?\n Yeah.\n \"The crew and cabin lusted with the comeliest of the savage girls kept naked in the cabins...\" Okay. Well, let's talk about it for just a second. We have a real juxtaposition of pleasure and suffering. What do you think?\n Yeah. It's a real contrast between describing these people as sweltering cattle ripping their flesh open and then it goes right into how the crew, like, would sleep with these women.\n Exactly. They're fully taking advantage of them. Imagine being kept naked in a cabin for the whole journey.\n Yeah. It's a very big contrast because they are calling them animals.\n So, what happens after their lust? In the stanzas right before we begin section two of the poem, what details are we given about what happens to this specific crew?\n They abandon the ship.\n It goes up in flames.\n Exactly. So, it's basically set on fire and then what happens?\n", "filename": ["Copy of 027 ELAAYA027.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.110078], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW05", "TW08", "TW24"]}, "026": {"text": " Glue.

Well, that's very good.\n And we're thinking about, it bends a lot, so we could do this.\n It's really bendy bendy.\n And you just broke it. Don't break it.

The top and bottom.\n Stick? Cause I was thinking we could put this on the bottom.\n Guys, like if we had one on the top and bottom, like on the movie, it would hold it down and up at the same time, keeping it flat.\n Hey, you know what we could do? We could make kind of like a T shape and then bend the top of the stick, and then glue it on that way.\n What would you glue that to? You say you're bending it into a T shape, okay so you'd have a T shape.\n Go like--\n  Okay.\n Try to bend that.\n  Hand me a book, we need to put more compression.\n I learned by that idea, if I put a book on it, it would keep the glue down, and it would keep it compressed.\n  We need more compression let's get a couple of books.\n Here's another one. Also, put a kilogram on it.\n Yes, you did put a kilogram on it, that's true.\n  I mean, like, on there.\n Oh, okay. So this rail that you have over here, that's a truss?\n And as soon as we add this.\n Is that going to be under or above the railway?\n We were deciding to go above.\n Cause it has to have a railing, and then below is optional.\n Okay, but how is it going to get attached?\n We were trying to figure out that.\n Okay. \n Now we just keep going.\n  Okay.  I will come back and check on you, all right?\n Okay, give me a couple Popsicle sticks, so I can put it underneath.\n Will we put them underneath the thing?\n  Oh, dang, dang, dang. \n  It's hard, because these right here, but only two places are touching.\n Oh, I see what you mean. I don't think it's overlapping, because there's the one in between\n  I was just making sure, okay.\n Yeah, I see what you're saying, but I kinda think they work, because this is really only touching this, and here it touches this one, but it's not like it's continuously touching from here to here.\n  I was just making sure, sheesh you guys.\n  Why don't you all tell me more about your bridge?\n  Well, it's kinda a mix between an arch bridge and just a regular bridge, I mean beam bridge.\n Okay, can you sit up?\n We're continuing to make our arch, but we have run into a problem.\n Okay.\n We decided we're going to put glue on top of here, to fill in some of the cracks that we had.\n It would act like cement, but we forgot that when glue dries, it contracts.\n So, the bridge has kind of curled.\n  Guys, guys.\n Logan, we're not in your group, we're okay.\n Also, I was thinking, when we did the arch, it might need support under the bottom, but the triangle might be a little odd, cause it would stand on this end part.\n  We could do what we did here.\n Can you get the popsicle stick to be the shape you want it to be?\n Well, I was thinking we could just, like, bend it, and put it on that.\n I'm going to test this on the weights\n We need two kilograms, if you can get it.\n  Now, how long is your bridge? Have you measured your bridge?\n Our bridge is--\n  Are you doing it in metric, or in customary?\n We're doing it in customary.\n  Customary, okay.\n It's 55 cm, or 22 inches and 2 cm. \n  Okay, we're not going to mix measurements.\n It's like, 22 and a half inches.\n  Okay. So if you had 12, is that 12 plus 9?\n Yeah.\n So 21 and a half maybe?\n Yes.\n Okay.\n You guys, I got the two 200 kilogram things, so we could--\n Gram?\n I said gram.\n  200 grams.\n It will be heavier than the glue bottle.\n And that way we can use the glue.\n Okay, so this is the bridgeway where the cars are going to go? The arch is going to be above the roadway.\n No, because, here you can't fit two cars, but it will go smoothly for the rest of it. Like, we made it so two cars would go right next to each other, like we didn't think we could leave the extra space.\n Right, but they might take off each other's rear-view mirrors. \n Right.\n We ran into that, though.\n What could you do about that?\n We don't really know, because all of this stuff is dry, so far it's holding up quite well.\n Well, what if this was only one lane? What if you made another one just like it to be the other lane?\n  That would be perfect.\n But it would take a good long while.\n  No it wouldn't. We built this in a couple of days. Yeah, we could glue it together with like these.\n Yeah, okay.\n Perfect.\n Thanks Miss Hoyle. All right guys, let's start working on that one. So are these the same size as these? Let's try to make it more even this time.\n Making that is going to take, like 50 days.\n We need 50 of these guys, right?\n  Tell me a little bit about this arch and what it's going to do. As you build the arch, how is that going to keep your bridge steady?\n Well, it's like, when the arch gets pulled on, it's gonna be secured here, so instead of the bridge itself getting the tension, it's going to go a little bit like it is now.\n Okay, it's going to pull it away?\n A little bit. Which means I've got to get the weight on it.\n So it's going to create the outward thrust?\n Yeah.\n Which with an outward thrust, what do you need to have on the sides of the bridge, if you have an outward thrust? Remember?\n Oh, it's, uh\n Abutments, do you remember that?\n Yeah.\n You need that, something over here to take the force, the pressure that's being exerted from the center outward.  the outward thrust.\n I have a thing with that one, it hates me, I hate it.\n So have you tried laying your bridge across a 20-inch span?\n Yeah, we did it on a desk \n It caved in a little in the middle, but when our arched is finished, it'll actually help.\n Tell me why you feel like it caves in in the middle?\n The important thing is, what we did was, we put glue in between in to act like cement, to keep it together.\n Uh huh.\n Well, that made it curl a little bit, and so it was a little weaker in the middle, because that's where it was starting to bend.\n And also partially because it's, it's--\n We don't have a lot of support on the bottom, which makes the, um, its tension affected.\n I kind of suggested triangles at the bottom, but we haven't really done that yet.\n Yeah, that's because we haven't got the arch up yet. Oh, you mean on the bottom of the bridge.\n Yeah.\n That's a good idea. Well, we need to start working on it.\n All right, well I'll leave you alone, and I'll come back and check on you later, okay?\n Guys, we've got four of these. We need a lot more.\n All right then, well let's get going. I'm going to keep working on the arch, okay?\n Wait, wait, wait, that was part of the arch support.\n The first arch needs to get worked on. Could you guys make the second road, and I'll continue on the arch. It needs to get to get built  \n This idea isn't working.\n Maybe we should try to like add this on here, so that it doesn't like fall.\n Oh, okay.\n And that way the arch will stick to the top, and this arch will stick to the bottom.\n Do you girls want to try that?\n Sure, sure\n Also, I think it will hold maybe a little better because--\n  Nicky, it's not all like--\n This is just like that, it's still gonna kind of, it's still going to kind of stick to this, even if we had this idea, it'd be like that, it won't exactly hold that very well.\n Show me how it's going to be touching, like this, onto there?\n I think, yeah, well like,\n Like that, this way?\n Yeah, but like with this on top, so like that, and then this at the bottom.\n Okay.\n It will hold better now.\n Actually this is the right way here, right?\n Yes.\n It's like that, okay.\n Yes, and then, we also figured out, um when there's going to be 1000 grams on there, it broke in half.\n Oh no!\n This part, it kinda snapped.\n  It can hold 500.\n Yeah, it can hold 500\n It can hold 500 grams\n Yes, and 200.\n And 200 grams.\n Yes, so I don't--\n Oh you tried 700 grams also?\n Yes.\n Okay.\n So that's not bad.\n It kinda snapped here, but, yeah so, um it might be a little more sturdy once we add the, like, underneath.\n Okay, the piers?\n We should add the piers in the middle, seriously.\n Well yeah, we can add it, like, side, middle, and side.\n I feel like we should do it, like, bang one on that side and one on the other\n Yeah, but it's still with the one on top \n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n We definitely want it--\n Want it to hold.\n Yeah, definitely.\n Yes.\n  All right, I want to see what's going on over here. \n Right now working on the railing.\n  Okay.\n And Molly's doing that by, she gluing, she's working on the sidewalk right now, we're almost done with the railing.\n  Okay.\n And what Molly's doing right now, is she is, we're gluing two popsicle sticks together like this.\n  Okay.\n And, uh, we're going to glue them against here.\n  Okay.\n So they can, we're probably going to put another popsicle stick like this in the middle, so they glue together easily. Glue them right here to the side.\n Okay.\n And then we're going to put the railing on the side of this, so like on this side, like this and then the railing will be on this side, so that'll, the railing is three inches, Brooke said.\n Right\n So, we're almost done with our bridge stuff at this--\n Would it be helpful to work from the bottom, to glue the pedestrian bridge, would it be helpful to work on it from the bottom.\n Yeah, probably would.\n And even though it bends, it's bent, it's really, really strong.\n Uh huh.\n It can hold more than a kilogram.\n Oh that's wonderful. Now did you, um, what kind of force, what do we call it when the bridge is bending like that in the middle?\n Um, it's compression and tension. Tension is pushing it out, like this, making the sides curl up, and then the compression is what makes the bridge \n Okay, so you're going to compensate for that like this. So are these your trusses?\n No, these are the railings. We thought that it would act like a truss.\n Okay.\n Even though we're not going to have one going on the bottom\n They're going to be on the top? It's all going to be on top.\n And you did try laying it across a 20-inch gap? \n We measured it to make sure it's 20 inches.\n Okay, good, well do want to try measuring a 20-inch gap between a couple of desks and just seeing what it, not while it's wet, but when it's dry? See what it's like. What are you doing Molly?\n I'm gluing the popsicle sticks together for the start of the sidewalk, and then when it's dry, I'm going to get them to go together like that.\n Okay. and then I'm going to take my railing. How's that going to attach?\n With another popsicle straight up and down attaching the railing to the sidewalk. And then just attach the whole thing to the bridge, as one piece.\n Okay.  I was thinking that you guys should take popsicle sticks and put them across the top, connecting the two railings together, with popsicle sticks at the top.\n  Like a covered bridge?\n  Yeah.\n So this is for a crab run bridge, is that what it's called?\n  Yes.\n That's a real bridge that needs to be replaced, isn't it?\n Yes.\n And we've actually figured out what's it's going to be replaced by.\n  Oh, okay, you found it on the internet?\n It's actually, it's um, a beam bridge. But it's not over water, it's over rough terrain.\n  Okay. And it's in Highland County, it's way to the--\n  It's northwest.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 026 GEN MC 026edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0838748], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Logan"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Molly"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Molly"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW09", "TW24"]}, "021": {"text": " But you're putting children in your sweatshops.\n How are you gonna get more money? How are you gonna finance the country still?\n Both of you need to listen to Cambodia. Because Cambodia...\n I am awesome, Cambodia is awesome!\n What are you doing to fix this?\n Well, for the money problem, I'm not really sure, but you can get loans for other wealthier countries and then as you're getting better, pay 'em off and then for, and then for child labor, you make a law that kids have to go to school and learn, so that way they can get better skills and stuff. And then put their, after that works and everything to age laws. I'm the only one with an answer!\n I have no child labor whatsoever.\n Whoa, whoa, whoa, I thought we discussed that you do have child labor, but...\n Well, we do have some child labor but it's more the grits going in and making your child choose the forms to get hired.\n So, what do I win as the only one with an answer?\n How did you pull your country off child labor? You need to be giving them suggestions and ideas, OK, what can we do, what can we do to crack...\n You told us some solutions the other day.\n Right, so that's why you guys are supposed to be discussing now.\n OK. China do you wanna go ahead and...\n So, China, you know how to get rid of all your child labor in your country? You have a plan, you have your whole plan in place...\n Pretty much.\n What's the first step, what's the second step, what's the third step, what you're gonna do.\n Yeah, you wanna hear it?\n I do.\n First, we'll make it illegal for children to work all day. And the other half they go to school...\n OK, but wait a minute, but don't your parents, your families depend on that income that those children are bringing in?\n Yes, but if they work half the day, while they're at school, they still earn money.\n But then they're losing half their income.\n But then on weekends they can.\n But they work weekends right now, anyway.\n Maybe we could establish a minimum wage over there.\n Oh! Now there's an idea!\n What?\n They could establish a minimum wage.\n Yeah.\n OK, so you're gonna establish a minimum wage.\n Yes, and going to school to get a education helps them get better jobs when they're employed so they can get more money with better jobs, so then they don't have that issue...\n So what are you going to do in the process, because you are gonna have to have children leaving the workforce, just starting to get their education that takes several years for that generation to become educated, what are you gonna do in that gap? You still have to have a plan for those 12, 13, 14 years.\n What about programs like those they used in like the de, de, depression, that's the word!\n OK, that's what you guys should be discussing, those are some of the things you should be coming up with.\n They could start...\n Keep in mind that needs money.\n But then they would get loans from wealthier countries, and as they're getting stronger and more...\n OK, take those ideas and work with them. You guys are on the right track, you're rolling with it.\n So, put that down, establish a minimum wage...\n OK, Cameroon, what was your solution...\n Say the children stop working, and the adults get it, well it would be taking money away from the family. Not other than the ones we came up with on Friday, like have countries send money.\n What about that like education like half school half work campaign, it's like where where you're working, part of your wages pay for your school and then you take the rest home\n And then, like, with me, in my country, already go to school. So, I guess all those times you mentioned. But they only go for like six years, from age 7 to... Wait, I don't know.\n  OK, anyway, that would help with like the country being...\n France for the win! Like the same thing but more...\n Coffee, OK, if it was our major export it would get rid of poverty and many things.\n Where's your country? Where's your country? OK, never mind. I was thinking you move at the same time, but no.\n If we work together with the coffee export, like... If we combine the export... If we produce... Well, I meant like from whatever we sell, we could try to hawk them together, to help each other create better education...\n Y'all can combine your profits in coffee, and begin making schools.\n You have an industry that brings in a lot of potential money, correct?\n Right.\n OK, but remember, you don't sell that product to the customers, you're selling it to the businesses. But that's bringing money in to your businesses. It's the businesses that hire people and you create jobs. So you need to figure out a way to take that industry, that product and expand it, so that it's bringing more money and bringing more jobs. Which is gonna help because then you'll have adults, you have 45% income.\n We can combine it so that children who are of suitable ages can have jobs.\n What would be a suitable age?\n Eighteen.\n Eighteen? This mine is not an easy job, is it? It's hard work, it's dangerous down there. To have twelve-year-old kids down there...\n You're still United Nations, correct? Is that gonna be agreeable to you? You can create laws that forbid businesses from running her product. So whatever she suggests to you, you have to make sure that that's OK, because, remember, you can tell her, sorry it's not gonna happen.\n Yup.\n Which means you have more money going out than coming in, correct? So you need to figure out a way to change that. You need some money coming in. So what are the strengths your country has? That you could potentially build and grow, when she's got the diamonds.\n I saw a pendant on the internet, and it had like, a string and there was like three fat fond doves on one string.\n OK, that's a factory purchase, but what you could make...\n I don't know.\n That's what you need to know. What does your economy depend on? I mean, you have to produce something.\n It says making foreign... OK, I have a question, what is a \"foreign exchange?\"\n It's Nestea's largest exporter, so you are exporting product. So you do have some products that you're exporting. Oh, you're Taiwan? You have a lot of textile factories, you make clothing. Your country's the one that's got all the sweatshops. So that's what you need, you need to build... You should be suggesting some ideas to her. Giving her ideas, say, OK, you've got a product to export, but you need to do this, and you need to do this, and you need to do this.\n  They need to find some way to pay.\n Exactly.\n Wait, I have a question for the United Nations. OK, how you said, setting up your steps, well if there's not a lot of educated people, then how are they gonna find teachers?\n Well, if you said, exactly... Well, first...\n You could hire people from...\n Different countries. Maybe if you like hired somebody from like the US that's educated, they could do administry of helping like educating adults and then they're educated. They're doing the same thing that kids are, they've been in child labor and stuff, plus when they got older, they're just working again, so they haven't really changed anything, so to change that, I guess, maybe if you got other countries to come and educate them and then after that they could the educate the children. So you couldn't get the kids out of the work so fast because you still have to educate all the teachers. And the kids have no where to go.\n Well, I say, since they're already adults, that we kinda like, work on the children more with education. I guess because the children are small.\n So, before you even take the kids out of these places You have to get all the people, and you have to... So you have to figure out some, like, you're gonna have to figure out a timespan of how long that's gonna take. It's basically, you're taking, elementary schools you like.\n I mean, they could set up a scholarship. That way they could go from like...\n And even, your country could help pay, help pay the people that are teaching. Because in the long run, you're gaining, that money's gonna be spent...\n The population is gonna face it, they get the cotton for the clothes, and get the food for their teachers and all that.\n If we can help poverty... To help pay for some schools.\n Yes, that would be amazing.\n We could also have all the adults work the rest of their life, like, insanely or something.\n I'm the government, I can say, hey, there's laws now that a kid's gotta go to school, and he can't work so many days of work, so many hours of work.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 021 SSH EA 021edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.06014], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW05", "TW09", "TW24"]}, "020": {"text": " Can you think of... what-what images are coming into your head about the Holocaust that relate to this?\n Um, people dying in the gas chambers\n Okay, and... and how did that happen?\n He convinced other people that they were awful, and then that's really the only way you can get people to do something as cruel as that.\n Okay, so you're saying Hitler couldn't have carried out all that evil himself so he had to convince other people that basically the Jewish people were what?\n Nothing\n They were just less than... just a lesser race of people\n You're on a good track, I'll check back with you in a second. \n ... by stepping on another group of people.\n So the other groups would actually help them.\n Like we have to remember that the injustice... the injustice is what causes us to want to go and help and restore justice and it's not just injustice anyway.\n you have to want to help and not just sit back and do nothing.\n Well outside people like in Atlanta and Birmingham, like, in there, like, in Birmingham were being persecuted while people in Atlanta weren't really doing anything.\n Well I mean, look what's happening today, I mean, we have a volunteer army and people are volunteering and going and trying to stop the injustice in Afghanistan and so that was practically the same thing as what Martin Luther King did for Alabama.\n So you're saying you see a connection in the real world news?

Think you've gotten enough from them, Brianna, for that one?\n Yeah, I think so.\n Well I guess Clyde's already said that, there's already one for the current news--\n Yeah\n ... that we could put down.\n So the volunteer soldiers.\n Volunteer army.\n Volunteer army.\n I'll check back with y'all, good job.\n ... are they more reluctant to, like, um, listen to the lower class bunnies cause they felt like they had a better rule of it.\n Yeah I think that's it.\n Okay, so in Watership Down, the higher class rabbits did not want to give up their superior... how do you spell that because I think I spelled that before... privileges\n Privileges? You know what, to be honest with you every time I am typing, I let spell-check do it because that d and g always messes me up\n I was spelling superiority.\n Superiority, I'm sorry. Okay, so what group have you chosen Colleen? and what... what... ?\n Uh, privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily and groups tend to be more immoral than individuals.\n And I hear that you're using a Watership Down example, which-\n My idea.\n Your idea, good for you! And what is the, um, what Warren are we talking about?\n The very first one, um.\n Sandleform.\n Sandleform, yeah.\n Yeah, go ahead and tell me about that.\n Yeah, it's like, um, the higher class rabbits didn't want to give up their privileges of superiority to listen to the lower bunnies. \n Does that make sense to you, India? That's a good example, I really like it! Okay, have you gotten anything else?\n Um, we did the one about the time in history where this quotation applies?\n What was the time in history, Bish?\n Um...\n Number two.\n Where this quotation applies is the Holocaust. Um, during Nazi rule, people felt better about discriminating against the Jews because many others were also doing it.\n So what was the privileged group that were reluctant to give up its privileges?\n Um, actually I think this one was grouped to be more of an individuals rights.\n Right, so the whole group of what?\n The whole group of, um...\n Nazis.\n ... the Nazis and the pretty much anyone that favored Hitler and the Nazis.\n But maybe they wouldn't have carried out those atrocities alone but kind of got into a mob mentality, is that kind of where  we are with this?\n Yes.\n Good, well y'all go ahead, I'm just going to watch a minute\n So...\n I'll finish writing the Watership Down one... the higher class rabbits did not want to give up their superiority to... how about... admit that some of the lower\n Number four would be easier to connect to a teenager's life... that one actually fits for both of those.\n What does?\n Um, for telling a time in a teenager's life, um, both of these, the two parts of the quote would apply because it's like, when you're getting, like, verbally abused, it feels much worse coming from a group than it does from an individual.  So if there's a whole group picking on you, then that makes it worse and the privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily. So say, say someone has a good cafeteria lunch table and someone who's sitting over by the garbage cans wants to move over there, so they ask, \"Hey you don't have to sit over at our table, but can you move somewhere else so we can sit there just for a day.\" They'll probably say \"No\" because they won't think of another place to go besides that table that those other people left.\n And they don't want to go by the garbage cans.\n Nobody wants to.\n I think that's a good connection. A good, very present day connection. Good, I'll be back. Yes of course\n Um, Allison, would you like to?\n I have no clue, would it be okay to write about, like, how people in foreign countries use, like, the sex trade as an \"it,\" an I-it relationship?\n Certainly.\n Mr. Gallant's class.\n We just had to make sure it was all right with you before we started just writing it down.\n That's okay, that's okay, that seems very real to me. Okay\n ... fictional things, so if it's fictional, it doesn't have to be people\n I didn't say that we could use, um, what's that, Watership Down, I said we could use that, did I not?\n All right, let's see...\n Okay, whatever.\n I said we can use Hazel and the Warren for oppressed people that are not...\n But I think we should do Efrafa because the bunnies, like, revolted and they got free remember?\n Yeah.\n That's what I'm thinking.\n I'm hearing an argument where both of you think Watership would be a good connection but we're debating which what?\n Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever.\n Which Warren would like... be better\n I think Efrafa.\n Which one did you say?\n Um, the first one that came to from... what was it called...\n  Sandleford.\n Sandleford.\n Okay, tell me why you think that.\n Because they were, they had freedom, but it was like they were just, they couldn't do what they wanted all the time. They could just do certain things in a certain vicinity. They couldn't go out or go anywhere, and they were just stuck against their will for that long of a time until they, um, like, revolted against their Warren and left.\n What were you going to add, Michael?\n Oh, like it was like a routine everyday, like, it was the same thing, they followed like a routine, like they went out and then ate and then slept\n But I think Efrafa is like that except for it's a lot worse, like they didn't even get to go out, like they got like feeding times and they would have to feed, like, right here and they'd have to go right back into their Warren.\n I think they're both good examples, but I think Machi's is more able to be explained by that because they did, but in his, you know, uh, uh, Hazel and Big-Wig and all them broke away and then they went to go search for...\n They eventually got what they wanted. In Efrafa they didn't get what they wanted until someone came in to...\n And not everybody in Efrafa got out.\n But not everyone in, um, Sandleford got out, most of them didn't.\n But I mean the group that we're talking about, the main...\n But the main characters got out and achieved what they wanted, where they wanted.\n Because no one else would listen.\n Let me tell you something, the main reason we're doing this is so that these quotations and these philosophies and that kind of thing, will inform our later life. It doesn't make me sad that you have two examples because when it's a little bit wrong, or when it's a lot wrong because when you notice it when it's a little bit wrong sometimes you can keep it from getting a lot wrong, so it kind of pleases me that you're seeing it at two different levels, so I think use Efrafa and Sandleford, and you'll have the best answer, Okay? Okay, what are we working on?\n We are trying to debate whether we should pick Cuba or Egypt as current events for-\n ... for privileged groups so we can get...\n Well, let's hear your arguments.\n Cuba, Fidel Castro has been a tyrant for\n Metaphorically, he's about to die.\n He's still in power, okay? Egypt's been resolved already.\n No.\n Well, they're arguing that it's not in the news but it's going on right now.\n Well I think it would be best if we did something that was going on in the news that we've like talked about in class that's really really really...\n And we all understand it.\n What don't you understand about Cuba though?\n Like there's nothing that's really in the news right now\n Cuba, they still have the same old thing just like every other country that's happened, just a little bit worse.\n Here's what I'm hearing. You have a great example but your group is wanting to go with the Egypt example, and it doesn't dis, uh, disvalue yours because it's important to be able to understand that it can happen over a long time and sometimes when he's talking about apathy, when it's happened for a long time, people don't, less and less and less, revolt, Okay?\n Could we possibly do Cuba in the history one?\n Oh I think you could! Work on that, that's a great idea. How are we coming?\n Good, we're done.\n Good, done\n I think we are finished.\n I want to hear your, uh, everyday life one.\n All right, our, for our teenager?\n Yes.\n All right, we're saying, like, if there's a group of popular kids and they're like calling names and putting down a group of the not-so-popular kids and they're just not treating them like they're normal people too, they're just treating them like lesser people.\n Less than human?\n They might, they might not pay attention to them, also, they just...\n In the way you wouldn't necessarily recognize a theme, but in a way, you would never ignore a human or we would think should never ignore a human being. Okay, great. So I want you, as you're looking back over yours, make sure that you've given your reader or your listener enough information. My shortest one was like three sentences and there's nothing magic about the number of sentences, just check yours because you're a little ahead of everyone else for thoroughness and see if there's any details you could add. Okay great. How are we coming?\n Um, good.\n Pretty much done.\n Awesome, awesome. You've got three of the four? Which ones did you do?\n Um, the tell us a time in history when the quotation applies and the fiction quotation and the teenagers of life.\n And your quotation was?\n Oh, we did, um, it is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends, the last temptation is the greatest treason to do the right deed for the wrong reasons.\n Thank y'all for choosing that one, that's a very hard one\n And we put .\n And the third one, great. Now will some body tell me what your fictional one was?\n Um, we did... why don't you explain this one Isabelle?\n Okay, I did Peter Pan.\n Uh-huh.\n 'Cause when Peter Pan, he persuades, or, he offers to take the children to the other place and it sounds wonderful to them, but he's doing it for the wrong reasons.\n What reasons do you think he's really doing it?\n To have a mother for the children, the lost children.\n And so he's not really thinking of their well-being, he's thinking of his and the lost boys' well-being.\n Right.\n What a great connection. I'm so proud of y'all! That's awesome! And did you do news?\n Uh, we did history.\n History, what's your historical one?\n Uh, we did, uh, when the Europeans-\n", "filename": ["Copy of 020 ELAEA020.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0221688], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["chatter"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW08"]}, "265": {"text": " That's a start, ok, Devon and Sasha? 3 1/3, what are the classifications?\n  Natural.\n No, not natural.\n  Rational.\n Yes, rational.\n  Real.\n Yes.\n Ok, it's rational, and it's real. Now Brian, you had first said natural.\n Yeah, I kinda, because a fraction isn't natural.\n Ok, right, a fraction is not natural. Who else can tell us something about natural numbers then? What do we know about our natural numbers?\n They're the counting numbers.\n Yeah.\n Ok, counting numbers, what do we mean by that, the counting numbers?\n  Numbers that you count with?\n Like one, two, three.\n Ok, our natural numbers are our counting numbers. So 3 1/3, again, was just a--\n Rational.\n Rational and a--\n  Real.\n Ok, very good, somebody else. Ok go ahead, Natalie?\n Square root of 19. What are the classifications?\n  Rational.\n  Hold on one second, thank you. Can you show us your number? So the square root of 19. Ok.\n  Irrational?\n It's irrational, I decided.\n  It's irrational. 'Cause it's the square root of a nonperfect number.\n Nonperfect square.\n  Nonperfect square.\n Ok, so Sasha and Christina both agree that it's irrational, and Christina, what else did you say? I'm not sure if they heard.\n It's a nonperfect square.\n Ok, it's not a perfect square.\n  And it's also real.\n Ok, it is irrational, and, we wanna remember that, an irrational number is also a real number, even though it doesn't end or repeat. How did you know, without using your calculator, that the square root of 19 was an irrational number?\n It doesn't make a perfect square.\n Ok, and how do you know it doesn't make a perfect square?\n Because, I have no idea.\n If you multiply two numbers, you don't get it.\n Ok, very good, that's exactly right.\n You actually can multiply two numbers to get 19--\n It's just a decimal or--\n Yeah, it's an irrational decimal.\n It's an irrational decimal, ok. So you can multiply, and we looked at an example, of that, we did a little activity with the square root of 19. Is it gonna be two whole numbers that you could multiply, to get 19? Mm-mmm. And that's what makes it irrational. Compared with, if you did like the square root of 16, what two numbers can you multiply to get--\n  Four and four.\n Four and four, ok, good. Ok, how 'bout another number? Go ahead.\n The classifications of 1/3.\n Rational and real.\n Ok, rational, real. Anyone wanna throw in anything else about 1/3? Mm-hmm?\n The greater the decimal, it's repeating.\n  Right, it's a repeating decimal.\n It doesn't end, but it does repeat.\n  Ok, so if it were--\n If it was, you could get a rational number.\n Right, and that makes it a rational number, very good. Ok, we looked at several numbers. How about someone ask a question? Someone wanna throw in a question? Ok, go ahead Scotty.\n What integers are also whole numbers?\n Ok, what integers, and let's make sure everybody's having the opportunity to answer questions. Repeat that again.\n What integers are also whole numbers?\n Ok, so what integers are also whole numbers?\n  Two can be a whole and an integer.\n Ok, what did you say first?\n Two.\n  Ok, two is an example, it can be an integer and a whole number.\n  Positive numbers? Positive numbers?\n Ok, our positive numbers.\n  Negative numbers could be, too.\n  Can negative numbers be whole numbers though?\n  No.\n  No?\n It can, zero.\n Ok, zero.\n Positive numbers.\n Ok, who remembers, what example did I give you, when we're thinking about whole numbers?\n  Pets!\n What can help you think about whole numbers?\n Pets?\n Ok, Sasha says pets. Who can elaborate on what that means?\n The number of pets you have--\n Count the number of pets you have.\n And then we asked for a number or something. They wouldn't say, like I have 3/4 of a dog or something.\n Ok, so if you'd ask somebody how many pets they have, their answers are always gonna be what?\n  A whole number.\n A whole number, which, and what are our whole numbers?\n Zero, one.\n Zero to infinity.\n Zero through all the way.\n Ok, mm-hmm. Zero and all. Alright, good. Good question, Scotty. Let's have another question. Go ahead Luke.\n Is a negative number rational or irrational?\n Ok, turn that around so we can see. So is a negative number, can it be classified as rational, or irrational?\n  It would be a rational number?\n No.\n  A negative number is a rational number?\n It would be both.\n Yeah!\n It would be both.\n If you have the square root of a negative number.\n  It's an integer.\n Take the square root of a negative number.\n An integer is always rational, so--\n An integer is rational.\n And a negative number is a, is rational.\n But his question, let's see that again. Is a negative number, so it could be rational. Can we have a negative number that's irrational? Can somebody give me an example of that?\n Negative pi.\n  Ok, negative pi, mm-hmm.\n The negative square root of two?\n Ok, the negative square root of a number. Would the negative have to be on the outside, or the inside of the pi?\n  Outside.\n The pi?\n I mean, outside the square root sign. So Luke, can you conclude us, what was your answer to that question?\n Sometimes both.\n  Ok, it can be both. Mm-hmm, good. Alright, good question too. What about another number? What's another number? Madison, go ahead.\n The square root of 144.\n  Ok, the square root of 144, who can give us the different classifications?\n Real.\n Ok, Damian says real.\n Natural.\n  Natural.\n  Whole.\n Whole.\n Integer.\n Yeah.\n Integer. Any others?\n Rational.\n Ok, it's rational. Do you agree, Madison?\n  Yes.\n Ok, very good. So we looked at when that's, if we look at our graphic organizer, when it starts here with natural, we read this going out, that it has all those different classifications. Good. Ok, how about another number? Go ahead, Amy.\n What is the difference between these two numbers? The negative square root of nine, and the square root of negative nine.\n  Ok, I like that question. So what's the difference between those two? So on the first example, we see the negative on the outside of the square root sign, and then we see it on the inside.\n  One's real and one's not.\n  Ok, Damian says one's real, and one's not.\n When it's in the inside, it's not real. Because you can't take the square root of a negative number.\n Exactly, we cannot take the square root of a negative number. So when we see it on the inside, there's not a solution to it. What about when it's on the outside?\n You can take the square root of it and just add the negative sign.\n Ok, so what would that answer be, negative square root of nine?\n Negative three.\n Right, negative three. Let's talk a little bit more in depth about, when that negative is inside the square root, why do we not have a solution to that? So it was a square root of negative nine.\n Because you can't multiply two numbers to get a negative.\n Right, exactly. So if we had like the square root of nine, what two numbers can we multiply to give us--\n Three.\n Oh, nine, three and three.\n Three and three, and remember how we talked about, what is the inverse of taking the square root of a number?\n Squaring it?\n Mm-hmm. So there's not two numbers we can multiply to give us that negative nine, good. Alright, let's have another number. Go ahead Brock.\n Ok. 3.14, pi.\n  I'm glad you showed that number, 3.14.\n  That is not pi. It's rational and real.\n  It's irrational.\n  No, it's rational.\n It's not rational, because it never ends or repeats.\n  It is rational.\n  Yeah, but 3.14 ends.\n  Yes, it ends.\n  It's 3.14, not pi.\n  That's not pi. \n Pi doesn't end.\n  That one ends, pi doesn't end.\n Ok, so are we all in agreement that the number pi, is an irrational number that doesn't end or repeat?\n  Yes.\n But what is Brock's number?\n  3.14.\n 3.14, so that number, 3.14--\n  Ends.\n It ends. So, what are the classifications for that number?\n  Rational and real.\n It's rational and real. Now when we're working problems, like area, or circumference of a circle, why do we use 3.14?\n Because it's easier.\n  Because it's easier.\n Right, could we use a whole number for pi, to do a calculation?\n  No.\n No way it's gonna end.\n Right, it would never end. So when we're doing our calculations, we use that 3.14. But, Brock I'm glad you had that number, so, you know, there's that difference. Pi doesn't end, but just 3.14 does end. Mm-hmm?\n Square root of negative 41.\n Ok, can you show everyone your number? So the square root of negative 41.\n  Not real.\n Ok, not a real number.\n But if it was real, then, and they were on the outside, then it'd be irrational, wouldn't it?\n Ok, and why would that be irrational, the square root of 41?  Mm-hmm, no two numbers that can multiply. Not the same two whole numbers. Let me ask you a question about the square root of 41. What if your neighbor came and said, I'd like for you to help me, make a fenced-in area for my dog, and I want it to be a square, and I want the area to be 41. How would you maybe respond to your neighbor?\n Make it 49.\n Ok.\n 'Cause it wouldn't be a square.\n  It wouldn't be a perfect square.\n If it was 41? Ok, so you, what did you say Damian?\n To make it, like 41, so you could have a seven by, or 49, so you could have seven by seven.\n Ok, good.\n  Or make it a six by six, 36.\n Ok.\n I would tell him to make it way bigger, because a dog needs a lot of space.\n No that wouldn't actually be a very big area, would it?\n  No that would be small.\n Unless maybe it was a small dog.\n Yes.\n A really small dog, like a teacup chihuahua.\n Ok, how about another question?\n Oh!\n Ok.\n Are repeating decimals ever fractions?\n  No.\n Yes, 1/3.\n So you could have a repeating decimal as a fraction?\n Yeah, 1/3.\n Ok.\n 2/6.\n It's a bunch of threes.\n Yes.\n Ok, 1/3, definitely, that was the number Damian had, a bunch of threes. And you said, now two, what about 2/6?\n It's repeating also.\n Ok, 'cause that will reduce back to what?\n 1/3.\n 1/3, ok. Alright, how about another number? Ethan?\n Square root of two.\n Alright, I don't know if you can see that, but the square root of two. What if you try to take the square root of two?\n  It's irrational.\n Irrational.\n Ok, it's an irrational number, but it's also a...\n  Real.\n Real number, good, alright. Another number that we can look at? Maybe someone who's not answered. Down here? Nicole?\n Five divided by zero.\n Oh, that's a good one, we've not had that. How about five divided by zero.\n  It's not real.\n  That's not real.\n Ok, not a real number again. Can we go a little bit further? Why is that not a real number?\n Because there's no longer a number you can multiply by, it's zero.\n  Anything divided by zero is not a real number.\n Ok, I had several of you talking, and I do want to hear everyone. What did you say Natalie?\n It's undefined.\n  Ok, we do say that's undefined. Michael, could you add to that?\n You can't divide anything by zero.\n Ok, you can't divide anything by zero. And if you look on the overhead, if I were to write that out, and put five inside as our dividend, and zero as our divisor, is there a number I can multiply by zero to get five?\n No, 'cause anything times zero is zero.\n So that makes it undefined. Ok, very good. Ok, another number.\n Ooh! Ooh! \n Ok, Cliff go ahead, and then Brock, you had your hand raised, I'll come back to you.\n The square root of 53.\n Ok, hold that up so everyone can see. Ok, we have the square root of 53. Classifications for square root of 53.\n  Irrational.\n Irrational and...\n  Real.\n And real, very good. Ok Brock, how about your number?\n Ok, the square root of a prime number is always what?\n  Ok, Brock's given us a question. Can you repeat that again?\n The square root of a prime number is always what?\n  Oh, that's a very good question.\n  Irrational.\n Ok, so if it's a prime number, and you're trying to take the square root, it's always irrational. Ethan, you said irrational, can you expand on that?\n I said the square root of a prime number will always be irrational because you cannot make a square out of a prime number, you have to have two, for it to be a perfect square. You have to have two numbers, prime numbers, and you have one, and the number itself.\n  Ok, only those two factors, right. Ok, very good. Ok, maybe another question. Mm-hmm.\n Is a repeating decimal rational or irrational?\n So if it's a repeating decimal.\n  Rational.\n Rational?\n Yes.\n Ok, very good, how about another question, that we could discuss? Madison?\n True or false: a terminating decimal means the decimal repeats.\n  It's false.\n Ok, it's false. What does that mean, Mariah, if it's terminating?\n It...\n So if it terminates, it--\n It ends.\n It ends, right, exactly. Ok, how about another number? Anyone, an example, we've not had many with integers. I see you. How about one with a negative number? Anybody have one with a negative number? Brian, you do? Ok.\n I have the square root of negative 225.\n  Not real.\n Ok, not real, again, why is that not a real number?\n Because it's negative.\n  The decimal's inside.\n Ok, well not the decimal is inside but the--\n  Negative.\n The negative's inside. I wanna throw a number out. How about negative 4/5? For the number negative 4/5.\n  Rational?\n  Yeah, rational.\n Ok, it's a rational number and it is a--\n  Real number.\n Is it a negative number?\n Yes.\n No!\n  Yeah.\n  No?\n Hmmm. So negative 4/5. Wouldn't that be considered an integer?\n  No.\n Because it's not a whole or a natural number.\n Ok, very good. What do we know, we haven't talked too much about integers. What do we know about our integers? How do we classify an integer?\n That it's whole numbers and their opposites?\n Ok, whole numbers and their opposites. And we used our number line in class. Do we have any fractions or decimals on our number line?\n  No.\n So what numbers are not considered integers?\n  Decimals.\n Decimals and...\n  Fractions.\n Ok, so if they have that negative sign in front of them, then what do we call em? If they're not integers.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 265 MATH EA 265edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.136855], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teachers"], ["Class"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Madison"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW06m", "TW07", "TW08m", "TW13", "TW23"]}, "012 ": {"text": " Now, what you just did was count how many times you made a successful... Eric... ...you made a successful throw and how many times you made a successful catch, out of 10. All right, we're going to use that information that you just gathered to answer the questions on this form that you've got. You each should have your own reflection sheet, all right, and I'm going to allow you to as a group, as a partnership, I'm going to allow you to talk about the answers together, which is just fine, because with your partner helping you, you might learn something about your throwing ability, or catching ability, that you might not have picked up on your own. All right so...  Now, if you look at the backside, if you start here,  each of you should have your sheet in front of you, OK and you should have a pencil or you have  and I'm going to read this to you to help you best understand it. This is a chart to help you gauge your abilities and for your progress from the start of throwing the Frisbee up to this point. It's broken up into four categories. One, you see where I'm pointing at here. It says, Beginning; Two, Developing; Three, Proficient; and Four, Excellent. So the question you have to ask yourself is, \"Am I still in beginning stages of throwing Frisbee?\" In other words, do I use correct Frisbee throwing form sometimes? Two, it says, \"Do I use correct form \"some to most of the time?\" Three, proficient. Do I use correct form when throwing the Frisbee or catching the Frisbee most of the time? And four, excellent. Do I use correct form all of the time? All right. So this is what you are going to test yourself on. I'll read it to you, and as I read it to you I want you to mark the boxes. Again, you can talk to your partner and make this assessment with your partner if you'd like. So sitting with your partner, you're talking about it. I'm going to read it as we go. Number one, movement. Do you move to meet the Frisbee's expected location? Are you at the beginning stages of that, developing stages, proficient stages, or are you excellent at it? Do you always move to meet the Frisbee's location? Sometimes, most of the time, or rarely? Give yourself a check in the box of where you think that belongs. Body position. OK, this is how you position yourself to the oncoming Frisbee aside from moving to it, this is how you square your body with it. Are you in the beginning stages, where you rarely do it well, are you in the developing stages, where you do it sometimes, the proficient stages, where you do it most of the time, or are you in the excellent stage where you do it all of the time? Ask yourself that question. Feel free to discuss it with your partner. All right, so you should be checking the boxes. You should be checking the boxes. That's right there.\n  The boxes are already checked.\n Next, Hand position. When catching the Frisbee, do you use proper hand positioning with your palms together, fingers opening, rarely? That makes you in the beginning stage. Sometimes? That's your developing stage. Do you do it most of the time? That puts you in the proficient stage. Do you do it always? That puts you in the excellent stage. What do you think? What is your target? What would you put a grade on? Now when it comes to the throwing, the same things apply. Your stance and your elbow. Are you at the beginning? And I'm not going to go into detail with each one of these now, I think you get the idea of how these check . Are you at the beginning stage, the developing stage, the proficient stage, or the excellent stage? When it comes to your stance and your elbow position. When it comes to wrist snap and point OK what stage are you at? Are you rarely, sometimes, mostly, or always? Again, beginning, developing, proficient, or excellent? And then lastly, when it comes to releasing the Frisbee what stage do you think you're at: the beginning, the developing, the proficient, or the excellent? So I want you to just think about that reflect on that, but I'm not grading you on this. I'm not grading you on your ability. Hey, Mike, would you sit up for me? Thanks bud. I want you just to reflect on what you have learned and your ability. All right? Now, with your partner, I want you to turn the page over and it says Frisbee throw reflections, OK, and then we have some questions that we need to answer. We discussed what angular momentum was, we discussed what force absorption was, and we discussed what force reduction was. With your partner, I want you to answer those questions that you see, one through seven. Number one: why is angular momentum important? Two: describe force reduction. Three: describe force absorption. Four: considering... You don't have to do this... I'm just reading them out loud before you do it. Considering the fitness components of speed, agility, endurance, and balance, to which sports would you compare Ultimate Frisbee? If you think about when we were playing Ultimate, the game of Ultimate, what sports would you compare that to?\n  Football!\n No, you have... do it with your partner. And a couple more questions. Where can Frisbee be played for fun? What are two popular Frisbee activities that you are aware of? You already know one that we played in class. You might know of another two. And then lastly, based on the activity you did just before we sat here, how many times did you catch your Frisbee out of 10 and how many times did you accurately throw the Frisbee out of 10? OK? So go ahead with your partner and go ahead and start answering those questions to the best of your ability. You guys should be working off one another and sharing your answers, ready, set, go. \n  Do we basically \n No, just rewrite it.\n  Force absorption?\n You absorb the force when you . Describe force absorption.\n  \n Yeah, OK, start with that and maybe go a little farther and describe what makes it...\n, To learn today. We're going to begin a unit on indoor ultimate frisbee, and we've got the indoor, soft styrofoam frisbee, all right? One thing about the frisbee I want you to understand, number one, it's styrofoam. That means you can easily break them. All right, please don't bend them like I'm doing here any more than I just did. Obviously, tugging on them, pulling them, poking them is going to harm the frisbee. You want it to be intact, so just use the frisbee as it's meant to be used, and don't play with it in any other way, okay? So that way we keep the frisbee in good shape. Now, here is the question we want to answer: why do frisbees fly? A lot of different reasons, and a lot of these reasons have to do with the concept of flight. All right, like an airplane, like a helicopter, or a paper airplane, okay? Now, frisbee flight's a little different than some other types of flight. Firstly we're going to look at this: angular momentum, big word, but the concept of angular momentum essentially means that frisbees fly, one of the reasons why frisbees fly and maintain stability in flight is because they spin. So, the fact that the frisbees spin is called angular momentum. All right, and again, that's what produces stability in the air. You find angular momentum in a lot of things. You guys ever use a top, a spinning top?\n  Yes, at home.\n That's an act of a football as a top. If I just balance this football, it'll fall, right? It doesn't remain upright. But, when I spin the football like a top, it maintains its upright position. That is angular momentum. That is why it does not fall down. The force of friction will eventually slow down the football, and that's why it will topple over and fall, but while it's spinning, angular momentum is what keeps it up. When a frisbee spins, the reason why it doesn't wobble in flight and fall from the air is because it's supposed to spin, as you can see there, and that's what keeps it stable. That's also what helps us to throw it accurately. Another concept is angular lift. Angular lift, like an airplane. There's different pressures above and below the wing. These concepts are really complicated if you look into them in detail, but the basic gist of this concept is that there's a low pressure on top, and a high pressure on the bottom, and when I throw the airplane, that pressure difference is what gives it lift and allows it to fly, okay? Now, one thing I'm going to do before I throw this airplane is I'm going to use force. Force production, I produce force behind the plane and that allows it to fly. In the same way, I will produce force behind the frisbee, and that will allow it to fly. The other end is force absorption, which we'll talk about in just a minute. So again, aerodynamic lift is when the pressure differences allow this airplane to lift, and I'm going to produce force for that to happen.\n  Can I go get it?\n No, we'll leave that there, all right? Now, I need one person to demonstrate how to throw the frisbee properly. Julia, please.  I'll have you stand here, now watch. You're going to, listen, I'm going to go over this one time with you, and then you're going to use these checklists on the cones to teach one another how to do it properly. Now, I know a lot of you, listen, please. I know a lot of you would like when you do the frisbee, you can throw the frisbee, but there's one... The difference between really just throwing the frisbee and understanding how to throw the frisbee. Understanding the mechanics behind it, okay? So, the mechanics behind throwing a frisbee are just this: the mechanics behind a frisbee are this: number one, I need to know my target. Two, when throwing a frisbee, you step with the same foot. Not the opposite foot, like when you throw a baseball, but rather, I step with the same foot. I'm going to point my elbow at my target, I'm going to curl my wrist and bring the frisbee across my chest. Girls, I need you to pay attention. If you miss this instruction it's going to be more complicated later. So, I'm going to step towards my target, frisbee curled up to my chest, and then point my elbow at my target. Now, when I extend my elbow, I'm going to snap my wrist. That's going to create the spin that gives this one, two, three...\n  Angular momentum.\n Angular momentum. And that's what's going to give it stability. So, I'm going to step, point the elbow, snap the wrist, point to my target, produce force, and on the other end, what Julia's going to do, once I throw it, is she's going to use force absorption. She's going to catch it. Fundamentals of catching. Julia, what I'd like you to do is, square yourself with the frisbee. If the frisbee moves to your right, I want you to move to your right, okay? If it moves to your left, I want you to move to your left. Because you want to meet it, and square your body to it. And last, I want you to put your hands in this position, palms together and fingers out. All right, they don't have to be touching, but we're going to try to pancake the frisbee. All right, hopefully my throw goes well. Here we go. Step, elbow, oh, wrist snap, release. One more thing I forgot to mention, release it level with the ground. If I release it at an angle here, it's going to go up or down this way, if I release it at an angle here, it's going to go up or down this way. So, release it level, one more thing to remember. Ready? Step, nice try. Don't laugh, don't laugh. All right, I want you to try the same thing. I want you to step with the same foot, point your elbow in, and when you throw, throw it, point your finger at me, remember to release it level. You're ready, go. Yes! It's all right, you can grab it with one hand, there's no problem with that. That frisbee had good spin on it, all right. She released it, did she release it level?\n  No.\n No, that's why it bounced off the wall. One more time, step, elbow, wrist snap, point, release level. Good catch.\n  Nice one, dude!\n Here you go, you got it. Perfect. Now, I could have moved to the side a little bit to catch that frisbee, but I did a little reach, and that's okay, too. All right, so with your groups of four, remember, wait, wait, wait! You're going to coach your partner in throwing and catching, use the checklist on the cones. Ready, set, grab one frisbee, go.  \n Can I stand here?\n You and you, here. You're going to be here. You guys are all working together, you're going to hold this. Wait, wait, wait! There should be two on each cone, one person holding the cone. Stop, where's your partner? You're going to coach her throwing. You're going to go first, and I want you to catch it, and then throw it to her, and you're going to be catching, and every couple tries, we're going to switch. Okay, pick up your cone and coach. Pick up your cone...  You're the instructor, he's going to catch, right? All right. You're the instructor, you should watch her. \n One, two, three, frisbee!\n Make sure you're reading and helping!  All right, practice a couple times, and, three, stop! Stop, stop, stop. Now, with the catch, with the force absorption, okay? You're absorbing that throw, listen. I know that the throws aren't all going to be accurate, that's all the more reason why you have to move to where you think the frisbee's going to land, and meet the oncoming frisbee, okay? So, with your partner's help, coach's help, keep practicing, and we're going to switch in just a minute. Make sure you correct any improper technique.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 012B PE EAYA 012Bedited.srt.txt", "Copy of 012A PE EAYA 012Aedited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.266954], "annotations": [["inaudible", "inaudible", "inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible", "inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW05", "TW06", "TW17", "TW24TW06"]}, "004 ": {"text": "\u266a  \u266a Great job, thank you for playing along.

And so I think that at a certain pressure, they're so close together that they aren't a gas anymore and they become a liquid.\n Cool.\n Because the difference between a liquid and a solid with the atoms is that the solids or, the difference between a liquid and a gas with the atoms is that the gases are more spread out. And the liquids can still move freely, but they're more close together, so.\n Okay.\n We thought that in a liquid, they can't move as freely as it can in gas.\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n Well, another gas has to expand, well it does expand to fill its container.\n Yeah. So does that have anything to do with how they move?\n Well, you said that some, tried to, sometimes they don't always expand as much as they can, but I think they do. My guess is probably the distance between the molecules is based on how big the space is 'cause you think of pressed gas.\n What are you guys all thinking about of what you're hearing?\n Well...\n Do things sound reasonable?\n Yeah.\n Is this a question that we need to maybe think about a little bit more? Just how spread out do things have to be to be a gas? At what point does that matter or not matter?\n Uh-huh.\n Okay.  We're gonna keep that one on the books for something we need to check into.\n, That's what I want you to do to prove to me that you understand that beyond just telling me what, you know, maybe the book would say. Beyond just a definition, right? If you're going down the right path here and you know what that is, I see you're making a nice Venn diagram here, comparing and contrasting, that's great. What I want you to do is on this sheet here, cause this is what you're going to need to present to the class in a couple minutes. Put down these thoughts, these words that you've got. You can even draw your Venn diagram on here. But, explain what that means. What does that mean, bubbles floating inside the lagoon? What does that mean? It's escaping off the top. When we think of matter, what do we actually think of in our heads? Conceptually we're thinking of a chunk of matter, a beaker of liquid, so there's some space and what else?  And what?  So matter has mass and volume. What's matter made up of?  Okay. Atoms, molecules. If it helps you, you can decide okay let's think of this in terms of water. Just so it's a known right? Okay, good. Yeah that's a good way to do that. So, draw some pictures. When you say it's escaping off the top, what does that look like? Okay, so try to get it into some visuals.\n  Okay.\n I'll come back. \n Matter, like I don't really understand.\n  The definition of heat?\n Yeah.\n  Okay, so what is heat? \n  It's what? \n Heat is like the transferring of energy from a warmer thing to a colder thing, right?\n  So you want to separate what something is from how it behaves? So you're saying heat is the transfer of energy. Transfer is how it behaves, right? What is it?\n  It's just energy.\n It's energy, right? So heat is a form of energy, and you're absolutely right. It can move around in the environment, between systems, in and out of the system  . So let's say you've got a beaker of water sitting on the counter and it's hot, right? It's sitting in a cold room. What do you expect to happen? What will happen to the temperature of the water, for example?\n It will .\n Okay, so the water will get colder and the air right around the beaker will get warmer til they level out?\n Yeah.\n  Okay, equilibrium, good. So, you understand that heat is energy. And you understand that it can move around. So the question here is how does adding heat energy, for example, matter cause changes to temperature and changes of state? So not that it does, but how? So, what you need to do is think about your ideas about matter. What is matter?\n Something with a mass or volume?\n  Occupies space, has mass or volume. You know. You just said it.\n Okay.\n  Yeah, see you know. Okay, matter has volume, it takes up space, right? And it also has what?\n  Mass. The property of mass. Do you guys have any kind of a conceptual model of matter, like if you think of it... Obviously this is matter right, but if you zoom in on that is there a way that you think about what matter is? Do you guys think of matter as being made up of smaller things?\n  Yes.\n Okay, atoms, molecules. What would happen if you had one atom and you add some energy to it? \n Remember this isn't rights or wrongs, this is what are you thinking right now so that you can make sense of this. So what if I have two atoms and I add more energy to them? What if I have hundreds of atoms and I make them all move faster?  Well, I mean that's what I'm asking you guys to think about as best you can. How would that occur?\n We said if the molecules have more energy and they move faster then that leads to...\n And they get warmer. Oh, that's the same thing as adding more energy right?\n Then they move faster and that leads to changes from liquid.\n  I would say add some pictures. I think you guys are thinking some good thoughts here about the structure of matter, what it's made of. So why don't you draw me some pictures of what that would look like in, say something that is changing state. Maybe take a chunk of something solid and then draw what you guys see, as being a series of steps, getting it from here to here. So start with a lump of solid matter, okay something like that. Take it all the way to a gas.\n  Okay.\n How do you see that matter.\n  Okay.\n Okay, alright, let me give you guys a couple minutes to do that.\n Start with an atom, and build like a box...\n  So folks, I want to take a couple more minutes and then have you guys share your thoughts with each other. \n  Theorizing is good. Why don't you draw me some pictures of what might be happening here? Yep? Did I take your pencil? I'm sorry . Okay we have a pencil thief. So, you're saying there's some specific temperature in which all phases can exist at the same time? Water would be evaporating, ice would be melting, and vapor would be condensing. So, I just want you to tell me a little bit more about your theory. How would that work in the environment in terms of the physical conditions that the ice and the water and the vapor would be under? Yesterday, we talked about some things that affect phase, what were they? What was one thing that we said affects what phase of matter something is in? Okay, temperature. Anything else?\n  Pressure.\n Pressure maybe so is there a way that you can describe to me in terms of pressure and temperature, and the matter itself, how that would work? Okay, you may need to mentally zoom in on matter. What is it, what is ice, what is water, what is gas? If you zoom in and we look at it beyond just a chunk, what do we see on the \"inside\"? What's it made up of at a very small level?  Does everybody here see matter as a collection of atoms or molecules? Like you can visualize that? So bring that in here. If you do that then show me how your theory would apply to that. Try. Okay?\n  Okay. How's that sound? Okay a couple more minutes.  Seems like you guys have gotten your thoughts wrapped around this, and you're working on presenting it? Okay. \n  How am I supposed to do this?\n Oh god, I can't draw cups.\n  Remember you have to explain to everyone what you're drawing's showing, so it doesn't have to be perfect.\n Oh, okay.\n Don't worry about perfection. You're gonna get to stand up there and say this is what I drew. And they just have to believe you.\n  Okay, that's how bad it's gonna be.\n  Okay, so there's like the water.\n  I think I have the difference between the molecules. \n Okay, so that shows that, that's gas and liquid. \n What is the big red arrow?\n  It's like going up out of the liquid--\n What's it?\n  The molecules.\n Okay, molecules.\n  Yeah, that's what this is supposed to be.\n So the only thing I would like for you guys to add to your explanation here is something about why, like why or how. What are the factors in the physical environment that are allowing or not allowing the things that you're drawing to happen?  That's up to you, what you think is making... I think that's quite good actually. That explains it to me really well. The things that you think are having an effect on what's actually going to or not going to happen.\n  Like this amazing flame?\n Like that amazing flame. So you might want to label that or make sure that you explain that.\n  Label it F-L-A-M-E. \n You've vibrated, those are actually quite good vibrations.\n  That's our gas.\n They're awfully close together. These are closer together here than they are here. Is that something that you intended?\n  No.\n  There supposed to be really spread out. \n It's up to you what you're going to write. I'm simply asking you a question because it seems like between liquid and gas they got closer together.\n  We didn't mean to do that. I can draw more.\n What do you think?  So, we've shown them closer together. Do we want to revise this or do you think it doesn't matter?  So they could be closer together?\n  They could be closer together as long as they're moving more.\n Okay.\n  So I think being like spreading out and occupying all space available.\n So if you're thinking that, you should include that somehow, and it seems like then you and Katelyn, and Ignesia's have different ideas about this. And that's important to acknowledge because those are two different things so we want to think about... What are you doing? Oh, you're adding to it. So, I hear Lindsey's saying that you thought they'd be more spread out, occupying more space and I hear you guys saying the spacing of them doesn't really matter. So that's worth thinking about, because that's two different ways of looking at this. That's two different ways of looking at this. Anyway, we don't need perfection right now. We need your initial thoughts, but somewhere I'd record that discrepancy. I would record here that you're still thinking about that issue. You think one thing, you guys think another. That's important. So you guys, I think I'd like to have groups... Don't worry if you're not totally done. I would just like groups to kind of explain what they've got so far. And we're going to go in numerical order. So I am going to ask everybody to come back to the tables though, and give your poster to one group member. Let's do that now. Don't worry if it's incomplete. This is a work in progress. Come on back to the tables. Don't worry if it's not finished. You get to explain it. And we're gonna keep these around so you can add to them. Come on back to the tables.\n I count two.\n Alright, so group one, I'm gonna have you guys come on up and hang up your poster. You guys let's load towards the front of the room so that we're all closer. You don't need all your stuff, just come on up and sit a little closer. Let's squeeze in, in all these front tables.  Yeah, you guys are gonna explain a little bit to us of what you're thinking was. So, everybody come on up as close as you can. Let's squeeze in at these tables. Let's get a couple people here, let's get a couple people here. Pull a chair on up. \n  Come on up. Somebody come sit here, somebody sit here. So, we've only got a little bit of time left and I want every group to have a chance to tell us a little bit about their thoughts. You guys may, on your pre-think sheets, take some notes. Remember this isn't about right or wrong. This is about how do we think we understand this system right now. And this is all leading towards trying to understand it more thoroughly and better and correctly by the end of the unit. So, their question, the first one is how does adding heat energy to a sample of matter cause changes of temperature and changes of state? So, you guys tell us a little bit about your thinking here?\n Okay, so we were thinking that something about adding heat would have to do with the boiling point and the freezing point. And we were also just listing facts that we knew that would probably help us determine about our question. We were thinking about specific heat. The equation for specific heat. Also, we said based on the specific heat of the substance, an amount of energy will raise the temperature by a certain amount, and we thought that was important.\n And it varies for the substance because each substance is like a difference between the heat. So if you add one it will raise one gram of a different substance by a certain degree, and then a different substance by a different amount.\n And we also thought about how solid, liquid, and gas, that it has to do with the change of space.\n And the solid, they're like locked in place but they're still vibrating a little bit. Then, if you add more energy we think it goes to a liquid, where there's more freedom of movement, but they're still sort of contained, and then in a gas.\n And in a gas the molecules will be occupying all space available and moving faster. And they're not like moving in a certain direction.\n What questions do you guys have for them, or comments about what they're thinking?\n Why would different materials have different specific heats?\n You don't have to know the answer. Does anyone have thoughts on that? Guesses? Maybe they're different what?\n  Different types of material, I mean substance.  \n So I think that maybe they have different specific heats because the atomic structure is different. So they can kind of collect heat differently.\n How does that sound to folks, reasonable? Is it true that atoms bond in different ways for different substances? Okay, so maybe that's something worth looking into as we study this and see why that, why that physical property of specific heat, why isn't it the same for everything?\n  And so we were actually still thinking in our gas drawing here, because you can see that we drew all the molecules, really close together compared to the solid and liquid I guess. And we weren't sure whether or not in a gas they could move freely. And it doesn't matter how spaced out they are as long as they can, they're not stuck in one space like solids are. They can just move wherever. Or whether they have to be more spaced out and so...\n  Didn't occupy the whole space.\n Do you guys have thoughts about that? What they're saying? Do you guys understand the point Katelyn's making? How far do they have to be to be a gas?\n Well I think that that's actually a lot like ours because we were thinking about pressure...\n", "filename": ["Copy of 285B SCI EA 285 B edited.srt.txt", "Copy of 285A SCI EA 285 Aedited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.026303], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW05", "TW08", "TW09s", "TW15", "TW18", "TW22", "TW23", "TW24TW08"]}, "269": {"text": " Okay, so what we're doing, is you guys are trying to figure out which one of these invisible tapes yeah, is the best. So, the first thing you gotta do is come up with a nice question for your problem, that you want to solve. Sharonda you wanna share what you've come up with?\n Which tape is the strongest?\n Which tape is the strongest, okay. Now see that's good because you don't like... We were discussing earlier you don't wanna say which tape is the best, because you really don't know what does the best mean? Strongest, stickiest, longest lasting but I like it, which one's the strongest? Do you ladies have any ideas?\n I said it was Scotch. Well we were gonna hang the same amount of tape up the edge of the table and stick a marble to the other side and see how long it holds the marble for and that's how you can determine which one is the strongest.\n  Okay so y'all have marbles?\n I have.\n You got some marbles, that sounds fine. So you're gonna do a sort of a time test, which one can last longest okay. That might work. You might wanna do a little test run tomorrow because if it's something where their gonna sit there, the tape's gonna sit there with a marble on it for be able to get that done. So you might wanna think about maybe adding marbles to see which one can hold the most or do something to the tape to make it drop the marble. I don't know what that might be. We're gonna come up with some more creative ideas.\n I was gonna maybe cut like, like this tape is cut halfway into it, to see how long it will hold with the marble on it.\n  Oh, once it's been cut.\n Yeah.\n That would be good, okay. But, and again you have to make sure that you cut each tape the same distance. You gotta be fair. So what about, give me a passionate sample hypothesis that y'all came up with.\n If the Scotch tape is the strongest then the marble will stay on it longer.\n  If the Scotch tape is the strongest, then the marble will stick to it longer. So in your hypothesis you're mentioning the type of tape, and you're mentioning what you're measuring. Okay.\n I'm having trouble finding the group control experimental manipulator.\n Okay, remember think about your variables think about the, especially for your manipulated variable what you're changing between the groups.\n  The tape.\n Yeah the types of tape.\n I understand.\n Okay, I'll come back and we'll discuss the other ones. \n Alright guys, Josh,\n Sir?\n since y'all have already been working a little bit give me a sample question, what you're problem is, the question that you guys came up with.\n Our problem it was, which paper towel sucks up more water?\n  Okay so you ...\n Absorbs more water.\n Absorbs more water, or sucks up that's fine. We're just nice and simple, it means the same thing. So you guys are going straight for absorbency?\n  Yes sir.\n What about a hypothesis, Darren?\n If Brawny, Bounty and a name brand paper towel are tested then Brawny will absorb the most water.\n Nice and simple, nice and simple. See you mentioned all the different brands right in the beginning and then you picked one and said exactly what it would do better, absorb the most water. Okay, perfect. Now, have you got any idea how you're gonna test the absorbency? Any ideas about your procedure, what kind of method are you gonna follow, to figure out which one absorbs the most water?\n   We're gonna use water.\n What do you need with water?\n Like water, we need water.\n We need water, yeah.  We need water, but how are you gonna use the water to test it?\n  First we'll get a measurement of how much water we have in a container. And then we'll put the towel in the container and see how well it sucks up the water. To see if the level drops and we'll measure it from there.\n So you're saying put a known amount of water in some kind of container, and we've got tons of beakers we can use. Then put the paper towel in there, take it out. How long you gonna let it sit in there?\n  Like a minute.\n Well, you gotta know. You gotta come up with the time and it's gotta be right on. Cause you don't wanna leave Bounty in there for 10 seconds but Brawny for 40 seconds. That's not fair. You've gotta keep it equal. But that's the kind of stuff you've got to think about. You've got to be detailed. Alright, and then you're gonna measure what liquid is left in the container?\n  Yes.\n You can do that. Yeah, that'll work okay, nice and simple. So whichever one leaves the least amount of water behind should be the best as far as absorbency.\n  Yes.\n Okay.\n  For our procedure we're trying to think and like maybe you could put like three of the same stains on one sock and then test it without one.\n  You definitely need to use the same stain. You don't wanna have Zout going against coffee and Clorox fighting mud. That's definitely a good idea so, what kind of stains might you use?\n We'll use, what kind of  we got?\n We can use food coloring.\n  Yeah, food coloring.\n I actually have some food coloring.\n Or we could use,\n  I got some barbecue sauce.\n Barbecue sauce? As long as you do not eat it during the lab. That's fine, I like that. Because that's more natural, I mean.\n  Ketchup.\n And that's already measured for you, like in packets that may not be a bad idea.\n Or mustard.\n Maybe yeah, now if you're gonna do those kind of liquids we'll have to find a way to measure it.\n  We can use hot sauce.\n Or hot sauce. Okay that works, that is more liquidy that might actually work. Because we can pour it out we can use pipes or you can use pipets or beakers or something to measure it out so that each sock gets the same amount. You don't wanna, again don't wanna put twice as much hot sauce for this to fight than this one, that's not fair.\n Yes sir. Okay, what kind of hypothesis?\n Our hypothesis was if we test all three samples,\n Test all three. and then I believe that the Clorox will remove the stain faster.\n So you're picking Clorox, why'd you pick that?\n Because the Clorox is sponsored by more,  by more varieties of stain removers and they beat...\n So in other words you've seen commercials about it?\n Yes sir.\n So you're taking what you know, inferences like we talked about, talking about what you know and making a prediction. This one seems familiar, have you heard of Zout?\n No sir.\n Okay most people say they haven't. I don't know why.\n  I picked the same one because that's the only one I'd heard of.\n And the reason why we said...\n Instead of using a marble which I forgot at home and we used weights, but they were way too heavy. So we put a glue stick on a piece of each tape that was about 10 centimeters long, and we made a cut in it that was one centimeter because one half centimeter was too steep or thick. And then we recorded it and we found that the first one that dropped was this one which was a second, it didn't hold on at all. And then this one was 17 seconds and then Scotch proving to be the strongest dropped at 79 seconds.\n  79 seconds alright cool. So what does that data then tell you, Sharonda? You said when you collected it, what are you, looking at what you found out with your data? What does it prove?\n That the Scotch tape is better.\n And it's not even close. So I like how you guys have chosen to use a bar graph because I can just look at it, I can just look at it and go wow look at that. The bar is up so huge compared to the other two. Okay so it's very easy to distinguish which one did the best. Okay. Did you find maybe, ladies, that you had any kind of error?\n  Well yeah, the first time I cut into the tape I cut too deep like twice.\n Cut too deep?\n Yea, and then we found out the weights just tore right away. They were way too heavy. They wouldn't even hold on when I let go.\n  So you're very careful about making it drop.\n Yeah.\n Alright, cool. Okay so what kind of data are you collecting Mark? I mean what kind of data are you guys trying to put together?\n We trying to figure our which one is stronger, which one would last the longest.\n Right now we're seeing which one lasts the longest for how many times we rinse it. This is the first time we're rinsing it and then we're trying to wipe it up again.\n  Okay and this is still the...\n This is still corn syrup.\n Still the corn syrup. Okay cool, alright that'll work. So how are you gonna organize this?\n I'll chart a graph, and we're gonna see how, which one tears first on which rinse.\n  So you're just going straight up by the numbers, before it rips. Kind of simple so that gives you, that generates you some numbers to use, okay. Alright. Michael, did you guys, I know you're still kind of in the middle of collecting your data. Anything you see that can be done better, something maybe you made an error with? Something that seems to not be working like you expected?\n Dropping this one.\n  Okay.\n That was one.\n  That was one alright, anything else? Maybe that you're noticing with your, anything that you're noticing with your procedure that you could, to make it?\n This guy could help out a little bit more.\n We could've put this stuff in a little beaker thing, would've made it easier.\n  Put what in the beaker?\n Our solutions and stuff so we could've put it in there. That way we have an exact measurement.\n  That's true, okay so what, what you're saying is that your experiment may have some errors because you don't really know what's left?\n We got measurments but we don't have exact measurements.\n  So you think it would've been better to do that, if you were to do it again that's what you might do? Okay, alright cool. Carry on.  Okay, hi Jeff and Keosha. Alright so you're right in the middle of collecting your data. Do you have a, have you come up with a data table yet? Designed how you want it to look? Not yet, how do you think you want to? You gotta make it organized when you put your data in. How you gonna write it down? Any ideas?\n What about a graph?\n Well, you're definitely gonna have a graph too. But you also need a data table to record it, now that you're starting to get some results.\n I don't know to do that, like.\n  Okay well we'll just think about it then, make something up. What do you think will be the easiest way to organize? Okay let's do this, what results are you looking for?\n The best thing, stain cleaner.\n  Okay, based on what, I mean what are you using as your rule to say that they clean the best? Color change or?\n Yeah.\n Okay.\n How much it took off.\n How much it took off, how are you gonna measure how much it took off?\n By, by the color.\n  Or do we need to use something?\n  I don't know, this is up to you guys. This is your experiment. What do you mean by the color?\n Like, how dark it went to light. From darkest to lightest.\n  Okay you do that, I mean you could compare it side by side. That's a good way, like a scale, sure. You got any other ideas? You could do that. Alright so let's just say you went straight up, we're gonna compare the original color to the new color. How can you organize that into a data table? What kind of information would you need to put in there?\n The color.\n Yeah, the color change. Okay, so the color changed. You definitely have to have the brands, you've gotta know which one did what. So how are you gonna write down the color change? How could you organize that into a chart?\n  That's hard.\n  I know, I know. I think you already told me the answer. What would you say you were looking for, what did you say you were looking for? The color change? How were you gonna compare it?\n  From darkest to lightest.\n  From darkest to lightest okay. So isn't this sorta like before, and after. So maybe you can have a, somewhere in your data table a column or a row where you're talking about what the color is before, describing it. So it's gonna be what kind of data since you're describing it?\n What kind of graph should we use?\n We'll get to that in a second. So what kind of data is that where you're just writing down like descriptions and colors? That's what we've been working on. We're not using numbers.  Well, we'll get to the graph in a second. You know what kind of data it was where we, collect descriptions and colors and words?  It's right there. Say it.\n It's . You've got a .\n Quantitative?\n Well that's numbers,\n Qualitative.\n Qualitative, so that's what you're doing. Now how you gonna put that in a graph? \n  From the darker shade to the lighter shade, right?\n  Decide what goes where.\n Okay that sounds good to me.\n  What kind of graph?\n  I don't know. If you're trying to compare and contrast these...\n Double bar graph?\n Sure. That would probably work. Okay here so, you guys have been working on which paper towel absorbs the most liquid. I see y'all have a data table that, nice and simple. Record how much water they...\n  Absorb.\n Absorb, how much water they absorb. And what kind of conclusion, Ms. Goodwin could you draw for your data?\n For my data I drew that Southern Homes had absorbed the most water. And then Brawny absorbed the next,  absorbed the next most. And then it was, Bounty was the last.\n Bounty came in last, but only barely.\n  Only by one.\n So, Josh.\n  Yes?\n Based on the results that your group got, how would you, how would that change your thinking? In other words, how might that change your shopping habits, if you had these to choose from? Well, I would pick Southern Homes more than any of the other brands because it absorbs more.\n  And isn't that what it's supposed to do?\n Yeah.\n Okay. So Darren, looking back at y'all's procedure looking back at your entire lab, is there anything that maybe if your were to redo this lab right, is there something you might would change about it to make it better or more accurate?\n Yes I would use different measurements of water, like three of them.\n  Three?\n Yes.\n You mean like repeated? Like maybe for each paper towel do it three times?\n Yes.\n Okay, alright, that's actually a pretty good idea because when you do those extra trials it helps to eliminate mistakes. Because you could've found out with these two being so close, if you would've had time to be able to do it two more times you could have found that maybe on average Bounty ended up beating Brawny, or vice versa you never know. Okay, Mia. What about, what about your hypothesis, was it right? Did you pick the correct one?\n No, I picked Brawny.\n Brawny, okay so what kind of new hypothesis, based on this? Let's say that you guys came up with a whole new idea, that was different from what you did this test. Like another whole procedure like Darren was saying, do it multiple times, maybe it's completely different. What kind of new hypothesis would you make, if you were gonna do a similar experiment with a twist to it?\n I would pick Southern Home.\n Just because it won this one?\n Yeah.\n Okay, so based on your results you might choose the same one. Anybody think they would choose a different one?\n  I'd still stay with the same one.\n Which was which one?\n Brawny.\n Why would you still pick Brawny?\n Because it was close it wasn't, it was like, it wasn't that close, but if we would've made like more, if we had tested it more then it would've probably stayed.\n And so do you think it's possible,\n It is possible.\n that if you did a completely different test, than just seeing which one sucked up water, maybe if you tested strength, Brawny could have won that one?\n Yes. I know it could.\n  Okay, cool. I like how y'all did the lab it was nice and simple. And other then Darren's error did you see anything that, anything else you would do differently? Anything else that you feel that you could have done better other than just maybe doing it extra times?\n  Test to see like how thick it is.\n  Test the thickness of the paper towel?\n Yes. \n  Are you straight? So in other words have a second type of test. Okay, sure.\n I'll probably change the temperature of the water.\n  Change the temperature of it?\n Yeah.\n  Oh, that's true. So you have to add in different variables because maybe one of them works better under\n Heat.\n  or lasts better under higher heat, okay. Cool, awesome.\n  Tim!\n It's okay Tim doesn't have to be over here. So let's see what kind of chart you have. Now explain this chart to me Deontay, because all I'm seeing is check marks.\n I did mine, I just did something simple.\n  Okay that's fine.\n I put my name right there and I put if it left a light stain I left a check mark and if it left a dark stain, I meant stain, I put a check mark.\n  Okay, so I see some of y'all are still working on your graphs and how you wanna display them.  Alright. So why did you choose a bar graph?\n So we can do like the levels of the stains, we got like medium.\n  Medium.\n Light and dark.\n Let me see. So you saying you're doing, you're going kind of like a qualitative data, light, medium, dark and you're just sort of shading up to the level you think that it had. Okay, how could you do that better? What might be a more reliable way to gather data? I mean the color change is okay, I mean the color change is fine because that's what you're looking for, right? When you buy a stain remover you wanna see that it takes the stain out. What might be some more reliable data you could gather, if you were to do this differently, for the future? You need to come up with a creative way to get better data or more data maybe?\n The more data we can get is by looking through the sock up under the sock to see how dark the color went through.\n Okay, so compare the levels and how much stain was pushed through the sock?\n Yes sir.\n Alright that'll work. What else?\n Or we can tell by if it's a light, if it's a ring around a light spot then we can tell if it cleared and if it clears some color off of it.\n So you're talking about maybe the shape of the stain or...\n Yes sir, the shape of the stain.\n Okay, possibly.\n And if it's a ring around it like this one right here, if it's a ring around it it's a light spot and we can tell it isn't't clean enough.\n  Alright, so how about this? Whose opinions did you use to get these scales?\n  I used my own for mine.\n  Okay. Cause they think that one was the best and I think this one was the best.\n  So, what might be, think about this what might be a better way, a more reliable way to get more data, than just your opinions?\n  Ask other people's opinions.\n  Ask other people. Again, if you were to redo it, do you think it would be a better idea to maybe ask some other people?\n  Yes, Like going around the class asking what they think?\n  Getting a vote.\n  Like a vote, like a survey?\n  Yeah a survey.\n  Or a vote, okay. Alright, last thing. Now that you've finished it, what kind of problems did you see? Is there something that okay, if I did this again, I know we could've had some error during this point, like we could've made a mistake here?\n We saw that, if we woulda let the colors and the stain remover sit a little longer, that it wouldn't have come out.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 269 SCI AYA 269edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.0822401], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW09s", "TW13", "TW15"]}, "268": {"text": "  We started testing out our theory that it's an exponential.\n 'Cause we found out that the ratios...\n  Does that verify that it's an exponential equation?\n We thought it did but it doesn't.\n  So why aren't you sure?\n I don't know.\n  So the more disks I add, I'm eventually gonna have a cap on the minimum number of moves that I can make.\n Isn't that a logistic function?\n  So logistic function would say that you're gonna have a cap on the minimum number of moves you make. And it would say at some point you're gonna slow down the number of moves you're adding on. Does that make sense based on what you've done so far?\n No, not at all.\n  What do you think is gonna happen instead?\n That it would increase.\n  And what would that be?\n That's the exponential.\n But the numbers are all really long decimals.\n  So, I heard someone in here earlier say you were gonna scatter plot this. So have you looked at your scatter plot?\n  Yes\n  Okay. What might be other ways to change an exponential function?\n  I can get it out of my backpack.\n  Based on what you had before what was your gut instinct with your ratio? Before you did any of the arithmetic, what did you think your ratio might be?\n Small? I don't know. I didn't really think it was two automatically.\n  But two's in your head. Why is two in your head?\n  Because doubling?\n Because there's doubling.\n  Here's what I'm gonna suggest to you guys. You've got your scatter plot on Marissa's calculator, right? You're thinking that two might have been the ratio. Why don't you graph two y equals two to the X and compare it to what's happening on your scatter plot and see if there's a different way that you might be able to change the extremum.\n  It's increasing by a factor of 2. She's trying it in an actual game.\n  Normally I'd want you guys to struggle with it right now but it sounds ... We're at 20 so what's your goal?\n 27, 28, 29, 30, 31.\n Good job, Caitlyn.\n  Good job. Now I'm convinced that that works. You're seeing that the difference is doubling each time, correct? What kind of function is that suggesting?\n Exponential.\n  And what do you suspect is probably your factor?\n  Two?\n  Two? So that's what I want you to look at. How could you verify that it's an exponential function using any of the tools you have here? Once you've found out this was an exponential function what did you do to figure out what the function actually is?  There is a little bit of a trick to this one. It has to do with some of the other types of changes we do to functions. Okay? Figure out that. When you get stuck again, let me know and I'll be back.\n  So you think that's two to the power of X minus one?\n  Why did you get minus one?\n Because with one it worked fine but with two, when you try to put in X as the exponent, two to the X so two times two is four. So far X minus 1 is the exponent.\n  What I'm hearing is that you're convinced that the factor is two. And you're trying to do some transformations on this to make your y values fit with what you got here, is that correct? Talk me through again why you guys think that the exponent is x minus one and then why you're adding the one at the end? \n Because there has to be at least one move.\n  We added the one at the end because we were looking at just the y values first.\n Oh wait, that doesn't work though. If you have one, so two to the zero is 1. And one plus one is two but that's ...\n Tell me more about this idea of the plus one at the end. You said that had something to do with why you had to have a plus one.\n Is it a piece of the function? That would be really mean.\n We were like well it has to double and then we have to add one on the end.\n  I think you guys are in a great place. I think you've got a good idea here which is to take y equals two to the x and find the transformation that gives you this table. So try more with the transformation. I also like this idea you guys have about how you have to have at least one move, but I would think a little bit more about how to pattern your moves, that's just that you need at least one move. Alright, I'm going to leave you guys to think. I'll come back.\n  So we found the equation but now we're stuck at number four.\n  Okay, so talk to me about the equation and tell me how you found it.\n  The difference between...\n  I was kinda thinking of how this was relating to the difference, so how it would relate to the y values.\n We saw the two to the x, we figured \"oh well, two to the four to the 16. Well how do we get to 15, minus one?\"\n  This is going back to the algebra from last year. So you saw that you had two to the x. You noticed here that we have just two to the x and then you go back one using algebra. You also talked about how when you graphed two to the x it matched up with your scatter plot. Did it lie directly on your scatter plot?\n No.\n  So what do you mean by it matched up?\n It was close.\n It was the same curve.\n  So how did you know that created a transformation?\n  Because whether it depends on the number or which value it is. It changed the steepness of it. So we just knew it transformed it somehow. Like we had to have it. It wasn't the parent function.\n  So what made you guys think about doing a minus 1 after two to the x instead of saying four times two to the x or three to the x? How did you know that? Because if you'd done four times two to the x, you would have stretched it.\n  Because it would have moved to the left too... on the graph.\n  And what did that end up doing to your y-intercept? Okay, so that would be my next question for you. I agree with you guys that definitely there's a transformation. I agree with your algebra and your understanding of tables, you've done a nice job with that. So how does a transformation, what you've done is you've taken two to the x, what does the minus one do? Does that move this to the left? Move it up or down?\n  Well if you graph it...\n It moves it up.\n  Okay. So Jamie is saying that she thinks that changing the a value changed the slope of the function. And you're saying that you don't think the slope changes. Okay, so you change the y-intercept. And do you have a change in the y-intercept?\n It's still zero comma zero.\n  So you just had two to the x. Find out just two to the x. What's the y-intercept of the graph? What happened to your function and how did the function get transformed to achieve that?\n The y-intercept moved down.\n  And does that match what we've been talking about? You take the function and subtract the value and move down one? Alright you guys said you were stuck on number four?\n Yeah.\n  Okay. Why are you stuck?\n So we figured out that you put But the minus one doesn't do anything.\n  Yeah, the numbers are so big that it doesn't matter. It actually does change the actual number a little teeny, tiny bit. But our calculator can't see that number. It looks like the same number on your calculator.\n  So we have a number of moves.\n  If each move is a second, then how long is it gonna take for the world to end? Alright, now you guys are also at the challenge question down here. Which is, based on the patterns you were seeing and how the pieces were moved. Why is your function which is correct match the way the patterns that were made? Okay? And I'll be back in a little bit. I'm going to give you guys about seven more minutes. You should answer question four before you try that. \n  So I got it kind of close. Looking at just... I did what you do to find a normal exponential equation. I plugged in y-two over y-one and then to the square root of four.\n  And are you getting consistent ratios between those y values of yours?\n No.\n  You guys are correct that this is exponential. But if we're not getting a consistent ratio between y values then that suggests that your original thought, which was to start with two to the x and do a transformation, is on the right track. So I really think you need to go back to y equals two to the x and find the transformation that gets you to these y values.\n Okay.\n  I'm gonna make a suggestion to you again stealing from another group. Try finding the differences between all these y values and see if you can see a pattern between the differences and the actual y values you have. Alright, what have you guys got?\n  Our answer was 30.\n Talk me through how you got that function and how you know it works.\n I realized that... the table matches the graph of two to the x but minus one.\n  So you just have that in your head. Did you graph it or did you just know those numbers in you head?\n We didn't graph it. We used the tables to confirm that it was y equals two to the x minus one. Went to the table and it was the same numbers.\n And I noticed here you've got 2 to the 64th minus one. What's that for?\n That's from another number. It's like a really high number. One point eight times\n Two to the 19th.\n  While you guys figure out how long it's gonna take for the world to end with that really huge number, I'd also like you to think about the answer to the challenge. You guys spent a lot of time looking at the patterns and how these pieces are moved. So I'd like you to think about why your function has two to the x. Why are you doubling those?\n", "filename": ["Copy of 268 MATH AYA 268edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.192383], "annotations": [["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW09m", "TW13", "TW15", "TW24TW09"]}, "028": {"text": " How's everybody today?\n  Good.\n Good.\n Okay, we are gonna work our bodies real hard today, and we are gonna play a game called Wellness Uno. How many people, raise your hand if you've ever played Uno. Absolutely, put your hands down. Do you know that there are four colors in Uno? Who knows what one color is? Alexis, what is it?\n Blue.\n  What's another one?\n Um, red.\n Red. What's another one Nate?\n Yellow.\n Yellow.\n Green.\n Green, absolutely. Okay, we've got the Uno cards spread all around the circle here, first graders. And what we're gonna do is, in just a minute, you're gonna come up here, and you're gonna get an Uno card. I might pick this one right here, this one is a...\n  Green four.\n Green four. Okay I look at it and then I put it right back. If you notice the gym is set up in four different color zones. Point to where the green color zone is. Boom, you got a green cone over there, stay right there, watch Ms. Miller. The green color zone is the muscular strength and muscular endurance station. So if this is, you have choices when you come over here first graders. Choice number one, you can get a rope, and you can swing, how many times?\n  Four.\n Four. Swing four times. Which rope would be easier to swing on, Alexis?\n  The knot one.\n The knot one, 'cause you can hang on to it better, that's right. So you can swing, or can come over here, and you can do those bicep curls that we've been working on in muscular strength and endurance. Stand right here to the wall, and do that four times, nice and what?\n  Slow.\n Slow, absolutely. And here's your last choice at the muscular strength and endurance station, if I got, what was my number again?\n  Four.\n Four. Look there's four hula hoops on the rock wall. You would start here and you would go through hula hoop one, then hula hoop--\n  Two, three, four.\n What happens if I had a green two, how many hula hoops would I go through, Paige? How many would I go through?\n Two.\n Just two. Okay, so it's either four, whatever number that is, that's the number of hula hoops you go through. Then I come back over here and I pick another card. Hmm, did I pick this one, oh I just picked that one. Let's pick this one, what color's that?\n  Yellow three.\n Yellow three Point to the yellow color zone. Absolutely, the yellow color zone is the cardiorespiratory zone, and guess what you have to do here, first grade? There is a cone here and it says yellow--\n  Add zero.\n What was my number?\n  Three.\n Three, and if I add a zero to that, what does that make that number?\n  Thirty.\n Thirty. That's what we're gonna have to do. I have my choice, I have to do thirty of something over here. Here are my choices, I'm gonna do thirty, oh gonna work my heart, thirty step-boxes. Or if I don't wanna do that, I can do the ball on the stick. How many times?\n  Thirty.\n Thirty. And if I'm really good, and if I really wanna try, I can get a jump rope right there on the wall, and I can try jump roping thirty times. Now I'm gonna run back here and I'm gonna get another card, and I'm gonna get this one right here. This one is a--\n  Red six.\n Uh oh.\n  Red nine.\n Red nine, it's a red nine, see where that line is under there, so that means it's a nine. Red nine, point to the red color zone. Woo you guys are so smart. I come over here to the red color zone, and look, what does the red color zone have on it?\n  Times two.\n  Times two, so what was my number?\n  Nine.\n Nine. What's nine times two? Say it Alexis.\n Eleven?\n Not eleven, this is hard. What's nine plus nine? What is it Nathan? Do you know? What is it Ethan?\n 18.\n It's 18. So we're gonna do 18, Ms. Miller will help you with the math if you don't know, so we're gonna times that one by two, and here are my choices, I'm gonna come over here, and I'm gonna get a paddle, and I'm gonna, this is a hand-eye, I'm gonna use my hands and my eyes, I'm gonna put my safety strap on, and I'm gonna do how many of these?\n  6, 9, 18.\n 18 that's right, 18. And first grade, how can I challenge myself at this station? If I wanted to make this station harder for myself, how would I do that, Courtney?\n Um, use your left hand?\n Use your other hand. Ms. Miller is left-handed so if I use my left hand, I would use my right hand. So if you want to challenge yourself, you'd use your other hand, so you're gonna do that how many times?\n  18.\n 18, okay. So that's, you could either do that at this station, or I love these, these are the, I call them the ice cream cones. Look, you throw that ball and you're gonna catch that ball. Do it again, that's how many?\n  Two.\n Two. And you're gonna do that all the way 'til you get to whatever number you have at that station. That was using your hands and your eyes, watching that ball right into that cup. And now I'm gonna come over here and I'm gonna get one more, and oh, I just grabbed that one, let's see what's, oh, what's this number?\n  Blue...\n Blue six. Where's the blue color zone, point, where's the blue color zone, over there. Hey, the blue color zone is balancing, watch Ms. Miller over here. You're gonna come over here, and if you don't wanna touch the gym floor, Ethan sit down for me, you're gonna step on the stepping stones, and you can either step on the sides of the ladder, or if you wanna make it harder for yourself, you can step on these rungs, and balance all the way to the bleachers, step up, come across, and then we're gonna go on this balance beam. Hey first graders, when we're balancing, do we go fast or slow?\n  Slow.\n Slow, we go slow, we don't wanna go fast at this station, because we wanna have good balance, and we don't wanna fall. We wanna make sure we don't touch the gym floor. So that's, wait, what was my number again I forgot!\n  Nine.\n It was a nine red, how many times would I go then?\n  Nine.\n Nine times around there. Or your choice is the hippity hops, Now Ms. Miller's a little big for this hippity hop, but you kinda get the idea, you just use the boing, hop hop to the black line it's one, and then back is how many?\n  Two.\n So I would do that nine times. Okay, those are your choices, so there's four stations, yellow, red, excuse me, green, and blue. Turn around and face Ms. Miller now. I wanna talk to you about something really quick, it's something called personal integrity. You ready back there Ethan? Everybody sit on your bottoms, sit on your bottoms. Personal integrity, and first does anybody know what personal integrity is, do you think you know? Maddie, when you hear that, what do you think that means?\n Listening\n Listening, okay, what do you think Maria?\n If you wanna go to one station that you really like and you get a different card, you can't put it back and get the one you want.\n Ah! Wow, do I like that definition. Absolutely, personal integrity, this is the way I think of it, is doing the right thing when nobody else is watching. You said it Maria, you know what my favorite, I really like those swing ropes over there, I really like to do that. Would I have personal integrity, if I came over here and I did this, I got a card and it's like, ooh blue, I don't wanna go to blue, I wanna put that back. Ooh there's another blue, I don't want that. Would I have personal integrity if I kept picking cards until I got what I wanted?\n  No.\n Can Ms. Miller watch every person get a card?\n  No.\n No, so you have to have some personal integrity. Whatever card you get, that's the one, what happens if I just got a blue card, and I come over here and I pick another blue one? What am I gonna do, what am I gonna do, Paige?\n You put it back down and you get another one but not the same one.\n No, no no, we're not gonna get another one, we're going to what, it's okay.\n You just go back to the blue station.\n That's right, you're just gonna go back to the blue station, and just maybe if you did the hippity hops, maybe do the balance drill next time. Outstanding, okay, we're gonna get started, this is what I want you to do. Oh I forgot one more rule, when you get a card, do you ever run across the Indian?\n  No.\n Do we ever run across her because we wanna stay spread out, we don't wanna bump into anybody. Nelson, do you have a question? Do you have a question about something?\n You'd probably rip the card.\n You would absolutely rip the card if you were to step on them or actually you might slide on them and you could hurt yourself. Hands down, let's get started. I'm gonna call months of the year. And if I call your month of the year that your birthday is in, then you're gonna get up, and you're gonna go get a card. Are you ready? If you have a birthday in January, February, or March, go get a card. How 'bout April, May, and June. July, August, September. October, November, and December, let's go.  What'd you get Chris, let's see man. What is that, talk to me.\n Red eight.\n Red eight, do you know what eight plus eight is? Eight plus eight, think about that. Almost, 16, go do 16 of those, good job buddy. Hey Paige, you wait on the end of the mat there until Alexis is done. What's your number Alexis? Four, don't hold the bottom, grab up at the top like Brian is doing, that's perfect, yeah. What was your number?\n  One\n  What was it?\n  One.\n One, did you do one? Do you think you can do one then come back here and go get another card. Ooh Steven, Steven what'd you get, man? What is it?\n Blue seven.\n It's a blue seven, go! Hey Ethan, what'd you get? Now remember the line means what?\n A yellow six.\n Okay, what are you gonna do with that yellow six? Wait come here, look at me,  you're gonna put a?  No, you're gonna add a what to the end of that? A zero, and that makes it what number?\n 60.\n Yeah, let's go. Woo, look at these people over here at the cardiorespiratory station, they are going up-up-down-down, they are getting their heart rates up. What number did you have Maddie?\n Um, 50.\n 50, holy moly. Keep counting. It goes like this Maddie, up, up, down, down, that's one. Every time you hit the ground that's one, okay? Woo! Be careful. That's okay, just hold it up like this. Watch, watch, you see how it whirls like this at the bottom? There you go like that, it can get pretty hard. Yeah, Chris?\n  I saw one card that was um, um it was turned over.\n  Oh did you?\n  So I flipped it over.\n Oh really, thank you so much, I appreciate you taking care of the cards for me. Here you go, five times two, what's five plus five?\n Ten.\n Ten, that's what it is. Jamie, what'd you get?\n Forty\n Forty? Did you get four yellow? Go. Woo look at these hippity hops over here Outstanding. Man are you guys doing a good job, I like how you're going really slow at this station, that's good balancing. Ooh Chris, way to get your balance back. Slow down buddy, woah Nelson, I know. Can you put one foot in front of the other? Can you bring your other foot in front? Wanna try it? Ms. Miller's right here in case you have to grab onto me. Yeah, look at that, what a good balancer you are.\n I balance on the monkey bars.\n You balance on the monkey bars?\n Yeah.\n Woo! Good job. You did it, good job. All right what'd you get buddy? Blue four! Hey, are you supposed to have your card with you? I'll go put it back for you, remember to leave the card. Hey Jane, did you run through the middle of the Indian? Did you forget? Don't do it again, go on, stay on the floor. Way to practice! How's it going over here Paige and Ethan? Keep your eye right on that ball. Ooh Paige that was close. Right on there, good job. How bout you come over here. What is eight times two? What's eight times two Paige, do you know that? That's a hard one.\n Nine.\n Eight plus eight. Eight plus eight kids. Six times two, what's six plus six? Six and six put the two sixes together.\n 12.\n 12! That's what it is. Just keep going, there's new music coming on, there's new music coming on first grade. Keep it going. Way to go there, Nelson, I like that. Woo! Your arms hurt? You're getting a lot of good muscular strength. What'd you get here, let's see. What is that?\n Yellow seven.\n What are you gonna do to that seven? You're gonna put a what on the end of it? A what are you gonna put on it?\n A zero.\n What does that make it?\n 70.\n Go! Woo Maddie you got a blue--\n Nine.\n Yes! No kidding! Don't go running. What is that card?\n A yellow four.\n And what are you gonna add to that four?\n", "filename": ["Copy of 028 PE EMC 028edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.0314178], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["Alexis"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Brandon"], ["NaN"], ["Brandon"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Chris"], ["NaN"], ["Chris"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW03", "TW04", "TW05", "TW10", "TW11", "TW17", "TW20", "TW24TW17"]}, "1069": {"text": " So, good morning everyone.\n Good morning.\n Good morning, today, today, what we have is, we're going to have a debate based on a couple things that we have recently experienced. One was research that we have conducted about the chemistry in scientific measurement that's required in order to address a local issue that we have with current regulations on water and different lobbying groups trying to change those regulations for their own interests and the groups they represent. Okay. And so we had a field trip to Wastewater Treatment Plant that allowed us to gain information locally from scientists to see what they're doing on their side and what their opinions are for either side of this debate that is current in our city. So, today I'm going to start with our overarching question which has really helped us in our research and is now going to help us to just devise our debates. The overarching question is up on the board if you'd like to see it. It says, how is scientific measurement applied in the creation and the regulation of our local environmental protection laws? The environmental protection side over here is proposing new tighter regulations that may have an impact on local businesses and rate payers, or the people who pay for the water utilities in our city. So, I'll discuss the format of our debate. First, and that's, again, up on the board. I will be finishing up my introduction here, and then we will have our lobbyist group introduce themselves, who they represent, and what their major goals are for today's debate. Okay. Then we'll have a question session where each group will be able to probe into the reasoning and the deeper understandings to reveal your research and each side of the story, so that our City Council members on our outer rows back here will be able to reflect upon what is being said. So, city council members, please be writing your notes. When we get towards the end of our debate time period we will then have you folks make a debate. It's going to be a vote on whether or not we should agree with the environmental side and their decision to make tighter regulations to change current regulations to allow lower levels into the water of various different chemicals that they will be discussing. Okay. At the end, each side will have a one minute opportunity to discuss a focus summary statement in which they will be able to summarize the things that have been revealed during today's debate.  Good. And then, as I said, at the end we will have a vote. City Council will vote on whether  we should make the restrictions tighter on the water quality standards in our city. Are there any questions before we begin? Okay, excellent. And so, I believe the, this side had choice, and so that means that Corbin and his group, for representing industry, will be allowed to have that closing, the last closing statement today. And so we'll start with Tyler, and then we'll try to go back as fairly as possible, back and forth. So Tyler, if you'd like to start with your opening comments about who you represent and why you're here today.\n Our side of the argument focuses on the environmental side of the debate. We believe that new water regulations via legislation that would more effectively treat our drinking water should be enacted. The hazardous and deleterious chemicals that are in our water, particularly the excesses amounts of nitrogen and phosporous need to be controlled. While it may negatively affect the selfish interests of industry our group would like to promote the idea that doing nothing and leaving our water the way it is is not an option.\n  Excellent. So Corbin, we're ready to hear your side and who you represent.\n Our side focuses on the business aspect of this debate. We hope to persuade the EPA and City Council to agree that the waste water that we put back into creeks and streams meets the criteria that is currently the standard for cleanliness. And that it does not need improvement except for a few chemicals which does not improve nitrogen and phosphorous or that we do not need to severely increase taxes to pay for all of that.\n Outstanding. And so, and then we will begin, I guess, then, with Tyler who can go ahead now, and you can ask your first question. And we'll be looking for City Council members. If you have any questions that need to be clarified, statements that you would like to determine what the reasoning is behind it, please raise your hand, and we'll make sure that you get in immediately. Okay.    This is so funny.\n Okay, we figure that since you say that our waters don't really need to be, it already meets the standards of cleanliness, but already in Colorado we see fresh water species that are becoming more endangered, as the more chemicals, because of the pollution that is put into our waters via industries like metals and dentistry. have already become endangered and extinct, and we just would like to know why you think that that means that the water's clean enough.\n Okay, let me ask you this. Do you have information on what chemicals killed those fish?\n We have like the excess amounts of nitrogen and phosphorous that the EPA, the standards that they're trying to enforce now. Like we saw on the video, this creates the dead zones because it removes oxygen and the algae, algae blooms start to produce. So, it's mostly the nitrogen phosphate that's preventing the correct amount of oxygen in the water for the fish to breathe, technically.\n Okay. I'd like to follow this up with an article from, I believe this is from the Gazette, which is our Colorado Springs newspaper. Since we're focusing this debate on Colorado, most likely our city, we see that our city does not have a problem with algae blooms, says the writer of this article. So, therefore, when you talk about algae blooms, we don't have a problem with this. So why should we be focusing on it?\n Because the water runs off the lakes. That does cause a problem with us.\n Okay. But even if we did have, I mean, a few...  Like I said again, our city does not have problems with these. So we can't, therefore, we can't focus our debate on these things because it doesn't apply to us.\n Well, that one article in a local newspaper from one writer said that we don't have problems with algae blooms. But I've been in the mountains around our area, and I've seen many lakes, ponds, just completely covered with algae and scum. And that so many of our local creeks, Monument Valley Park, and stuff, are just littered with gross algae, and it creates these dead zones that the fish swim into and do not have any way to swim out of because they have no nutrients in them and just die on the spot.\n And the same thing happened in the 1960s with Lake Erie, and it later happened with Chesapeake Bay like we saw in the video. And the same thing was happening where they said we don't need to fix it everything's fine, and then just as nothing, nobody did anything. The lake soon was dead, and it was like, there's no fish in there. And the water's just completely ruined with all kinds of chemical wastes, so doing nothing isn't really...\n Okay, so I'm gonna interject. What I'm hearing is that there's a debate in here about whether or not our local water is an issue, so I'd like to hear from somebody in the City Council area who will be making a vote today. How about your thoughts about the current water quality? What you have heard from your constituents in the areas where you are located and to determine whether or not you feel currently, right now, what level of danger are we at? Have you heard a lot about this? Do you feel like we are in need of serious change? So, we can direct the rest of the debate. Okay. Anybody who would like to contribute? Okay, Stephan.\n Well, all I know is that where we're located, we're at the, we're pretty much the first people that use our water, and then it goes downstream for other people to use it, so, so when we were talking about eliminating the pollution, the pollutants that we put into the water, it's not, it wouldn't be really affecting our city, but the cities that are down the stream from us.\n Okay, but this article says that our, excuse me, I think I read this wrong, our state does not have a problem with algae blooms.\n Regardless of the algae problem, it says without the oxygen, the fish, bugs, and other organisms that live in the water will die, and quoting from the same article it says in the worst case scenario you basically have water devoid of all natural aquatic life.\n But that's a worst case scenario that we don't have right now and we haven't had, and it's not an issue in Colorado. Granted, it might be an issue in like Chesapeake Bay, or Lake Erie. \n But we don't have it here, it says so. And multiple scientists have backed that article as well.\n Now Corbin, do you have any measurements, or do you have some values that you can back that up with?\n Not specifically on nitrogen and phosphorous. I tried to find some, but I found...\n So, does anybody have any of that information because we want to know how close to danger are we.  Do we know about current levels or about where we want to go with this? \n Okay I would like to comment on... \n I'm sorry, behind you, I just called on her.\n Oh, excuse me.\n So, even if it's probable, wouldn't you want to prevent it from like happening here, with the algae? \n Well, if it's not happening already then what do you have to do to keep it from happening?  Yeah, if it happened, but it hasn't happened yet.\n Yeah, but what she's saying is it might happen.\n Yeah.\n I mean just saying that something might happen is just like saying something awful might. I mean I could say that, you know, an earthquake might kill everyone tomorrow. It might happen. We don't know if it's going to happen.\n But fish and other organisms are dying. It is happening. It's not necessarily just the algae, but it's the future problem. We've already seen issues with the...\n  Yeah, let's see what Nina has to say as far as City Council.\n Well, I just have a question, wouldn't it be better to be safe than sorry? _ You're right, it would be better to be safe than sorry, but like I said the levels of toxins in the water right now do meet the EPA required standards. So, therefore, it is a safe level according to the scientists who work for the EPA.\n But we're saying that the EPA standards need to be improved.\n  Yes, yes, we realize that.\n Because they're not, they're too low, and there are many chemicals that are new because of new industry in metal companies and many other things that are dumping into streams. And those chemicals are getting through.\n How would you go about doing this? How would you go about stopping the pollution? Because something that's important to remember here is the fact that the pollution is not only caused by industry it's something that's misconcepted, is for example cars. People think cars pollute the air, and it exactly does pollute the air. But when it goes up and it becomes acid rain and it falls back into our creeks it's also a pollutant. Therefore, industry's not the only people who are polluting the lakes. It's actually U.S. citizens doing the same work too.\n  Okay, I like that. And so, can you be more specific? Did anybody gain anything on the fieldtrip about learning about which types of things the citizens in our area are putting down their drains?\n Yes.\n  That may cause issues?\n Yes.\n  Okay.\n I've got a whole bunch of them.\n  Alright, Corbin, why don't you share then what it is?\n You want me to read all of them, or just?\n  So, we're not focusing just on one group. There may be other groups as well, but also maybe it could be addressed as a result of this debate. Go ahead, Corbin. \n Well, the guy that we had giving us the tour of the wastewater facility did make some funny comments that he's found some pretty ridiculous things in the water treatment plants. Some of those examples were railroad ties, dentures, and he found a live person inside of them one time. So, it's not like the waste treatment plant is purposely putting all this out there. It's, you can't stop humans from putting out waste, and a lot of the stuff that they're putting in there that they're actually reducing the levels to parts per a billion or parts per a trillion, which some of the machines there do do, are poisonous things like fluoride. Which actually, the highest water treatment plant that puts out the most fluoride is actually Mason, which is right up there, and lead and mercury. And it eliminates that from parts to a billion from parts to a trillion. \n Well, first of all, I would like to answer Mr. Dunmar's question, or Mr. Waz' question. I'm sorry...  We do have information on how much nitrogen is required in the water, and it's 10 parts per million. So, that's just to answer that question, and then to move on to yours. Yes, of course, as you said in your own words, you can't stop people from the pollution that they do cause. However, it is the job of the water treatment plants to kind of remove that pollution and to produce a safe environment. And when we don't have strict enough regulations this environment is endangered for not only for people, but for also the wildlife, for the economy, for, you know, natural systems that occur within Colorado. It's all, you're putting it all on the line.\n Okay, let's talk about what would happen if we did restrict pollutants that go into the water.\n  Okay.\n Well, let's talk about the costs that everybody's, the citizens are going to be paying that they said that all our state is going to be paying.\n Before you talk about cost, would you rather pay more and be safe or pay less and risk dying?\n Okay. I would like to comment on that. That's an asinine statement because do you have a statistic on how many people have died from water pollution?\n I do have a statement from the Secretary General of the United Nations. Ban Ki-moon says, \"More people die from unsafe water than from all forms of violence including war.\"\n  You just said from the United Nations.\n Yeah, this isn't, yes, we're talking about a local issue now, but that is a statement that proves that.\n Okay, I would like to comment on this once more, when you said United Nations that's...\n  Okay, I'm sorry. We're going to have to go to hand raising I believe because we're getting too fast of an answer before someone gets a chance to finish. So, Theo finish up, and then Corbin will follow behind you. \n No, I made my point.\n Okay.\n Well, like you said, you do realize that's a local issue, but the U.N. is United Nations of the world. So, that's not a local issue. You're bringing up a fact that's from countries like Africa that don't have clean water at all, nonetheless water. So, of course they're going to die from water poisoning, but here in the United States, we have the cleanest water in the world, no matter where it is. And Colorado also has one of the cleanest state populations of water, if you will, out of all the states.\n Yeah, because of the regulations we have in place, and with the new chemicals that are being put into our water, we need to restrict our regulations.\n  What are the new chemicals?\n  Yeah, they've been there for awhile.\n We're having new problems though.\n  Can you explain it?\n Everything such as nitrogen and phosphorous.\n  It hasn't been an issue before. Why is it an issue now?\n It has been an issue.\n It absolutely has.\n It has happened all over the United States.\n  Okay, when we talk about nitrogen, we're talking about if we restrict that we're talking about maybe shutting down part of what we do here. As we all know that we are, we do grow many crops in our state. And nitrogen, mostly where it comes from, is fertilizers used in that industry. So, to say that we're going to restrict nitrogen would be, we might have to restrict or shut down some industries that do produce food.\n  Such as what? What industries?\n For fertilizers.\n Fertilizers.\n You can't use fertilizers on your lawn because if you have...\n And not even lawn, crops.\n Crops, lawns, anything because the fertilizer you use goes down drains, which go into creeks, which is really polluting it more than the wastewater facility was.\n So, shouldn't the wastewater facility pollute it less since we already have natural pollution coming from these facilities? \n We're already doing so much to prevent these chemicals from going into...\n Okay so Will, I hear you're saying that we're doing a lot. What was learned on the field trip? Specifically what role do the scientists play who are employed by our city? What role do they play at the wastewater treatment plant? And how does that affect your group's goals for today's debate? What are the scientists doing, specifically, and how does it support your side? \n Like they said on the fieldtrip, they use bacteria, E.coli, to break down the wastewater that's in the water. It's not like they're adding pollutions to it. Their job is to take it out, which they are trying to do. By doing that, they add some phosphorous and nitrates that are just byproducts of it, but they remove a lot of those afterwards. It's not like to clean it 100%, it's going to cost 25 billion dollars, and that's just for the state of Colorado.\n  Okay, let's see a City Council members. I'm trying to get to them quickly. I'm sorry, Amanda, behind you, Stephan.\n Where did you get that information that it would cost 25 billion dollars?\n  This is from the Gazettte.\n  The Gazette article.\n  It's from the article.\n Science has proven that to remove nitrogen and phosphorous from the water, which is you guys's goal to restrict it, it's going to cost about 25 billion dollars to remove it all. If you just want to do parts of it, it's still going to be 2.46 billion dollars.\n Which is four times the amount of what it is costing right now to remove the things from the water.\n Wouldn't that be better tough than  having to fix up a completely good stream that destroys the economy.\n Well I actually, on the fieldtrip, I asked several of the chemists that work there whether the pollutants that we put into Fountain Creek and what we're doing for the environment, and they said the water they put back into Fountain Creek is the water they get out of it. It's cleaner than that.\n Yeah.\n So, in my opinion, that statement is totally absurd. We're putting cleaner water for nature, and nature seems to enjoy it more as I asked the chemist as well. And farmers down stream also enjoy that water to water their crops, and it helps their crops grow more than Fountain Creek's streams already.\n  Excellent point, Corbin. Why don't we try Alexis and see what she has to say.\n I have a question as to how the water pollutants destroy the economy. You can say a lot about the economy.\n  What do you mean by water pollutants destroying the economy?\n Well you say that...\n", "filename": ["Copy of 1069 SCI AYA 1069edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.125217], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Damon"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Amanda"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Damon"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Damon"], ["Corbin"], ["NaN"], ["Damon"], ["NaN"], ["Corbin"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Damon"], ["Amanda"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Damon"], ["Cole"], ["Corbin"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Damon"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW08", "TW20", "TW24TW08"]}, "132": {"text": " Emotions.\n Is emotions, that's so right. Kippa, were you going to say something else?\n In this picture, he uses lots of texture to create, like when he's doing the sunflowers, he uses texture to show the light going on.\n Right, and how did he show that texture, did he, how did he apply his paint?\n Sometimes he would squirt it straight from the tube onto the canvas because he wanted to do it fast.\n Sometimes he would squirt straight from the tube and he would paint so thick, Vincent would, that you could almost feel it, feel the texture. And emotion, like Ozea said. Emotion was huge for Vincent. If he was happy, he painted bright. If he was sad, he painted sort of dark. How about our man Pablo Picasso? What movement, Logan, is he?\n Do you know the move--\n Cubism.\n  Cubism. And why, do you guys know what the characteristics are of cubism? Anybody besides Mr. Logan, anybody else know? But thanks Logan for raising-- What are you thinking, what...\n Using geometric shapes to make things.\n Using geometric shapes, that's right. He was very involved in geometric shapes and you can even see, and flattening the shapes and flattening his color. Where Van Gogh used his color to really be part of his painting and it could be bright or it could be dull or a mixture of the two. Picasso used very flat shapes of color and you can even see that in his self-portrait. I wanna put up the work. Let's start with our man Vincent again. Let's take a look at-- See where my hand... Oooh! You can see all the wrinkles in my hand.\n  No way!\n Isn't that cool? Okay! Sorry, don't mean to keep fooling around. So let's talk about this. Let's talk about these two paintings, guys. What do you guys, and let's see if someone else maybe can answer or talk about something. What do you see, do you guys see a difference between these two paintings right here? Anybody, somebody besides Kippa, Carina?\n That it kinda has to deal with his emotion, like where the boats are, I feel like, what I'm feeling is that he was kinda depressed and very sad because the skies were kinda dark and stuff. And then at the sunflowers he's really happy and bright and...\n That was good, Carina. Okay, Elijah, did you wanna? Was that about what you were gonna say? You were gonna talk about the sadness. What colors, like do you think that if... Go ahead, Elijah.\n He could've been in the boat because on the computer the boats were really bright colors but the sky was darkened more but the boats were all light yellow and dark, light red and all these other bright colors.\n Right, and I remember you saying that when you showed me with the picture from the computer, that's why I looked at you because you were talking about he must have been conflicted with his emotions, wasn't that what you were saying?\n Yeah, he was feeling both happy and sad 'cause the sky was darkened and then the boats were really bright and the sea was darkened too.\n Right, that's good. Okay, Jose, what did you wanna say?\n He's sort of like there too, but the boats might be out to sea. Like one's out to sea but one's not, but torn. I don't know how many are already but... Three are out, in. I don't know how many are out.\n There's four that are here and then there look like four that are out.\n I think that's the other-- \n Okay but what were you going to say... Oh you're right, three. Well what were you gonna say about them?\n I'm guessing three, two or three were the family of six kids and the mom and a dad. But they could only take three because there's only enough for... There's enough room for only three boats or three people. But they only wanted their own boat, two or three of them were, but three didn't go because they didn't know what to do or anything but the other three did.\n Interesting, that was sort of your story behind the picture that you saw?\n Kind of.\n Yeah, I like that, I like that. Trevor, what're you gonna say?\n It's kinda like medium of a position between sad and happy because the sunflowers, they're mostly up but looks like they're starting to droop. They're starting to die.\n  That is good, I like that.\n He might be like, \"Oh, I'm happy for a while but \"I'm starting to feel back down.\"\n  Nice. Did you wanna say something?\n I would like to say one has different types of  One looks more real. Those ships on the top look a little bit more real than the...\n Than the bottom, more realistic than this picture? He really pushed his color lips in the sunflowers, I think. Does anybody know, what were you gonna say, Elijah?\n You can see in the sunflower one like at the very top there's bright yellow but when you go down a little bit it's orange and then at the very bottom it's dark green. Like right there.\n Yes that is very true. That is very good.\n The storms and the sunflowers is trying to say that nothing is never everlasting.\n  Wow, Kyle...  Happiness is never lasting and what was the last one? I'm moved by that opinion. Go ahead, and what was the...?\n So in the flowers, the flowers are happy but then they start to droop and die.\n Because happiness can be fleeting. And we know-- Oh, does anybody know, what was the political, was there any political things going on? The political mood or the setting. Where was Vincent from, did you guys find that in your research? He stayed in France, is that where he studied? Is that what you guys are telling me?\n  Yeah\n That was sorta the hub of his movement, we'll say. Any other facts that you guys know about the artwork that's up? You can look on your research papers to see. Or anything-- Go ahead, Emily.\n I think that the actual emotions of these paintings don't really connect at all with the political mood because when he painted the bright sunflower one so awesome it was kind of a dark time in France. So really I don't think they were much of a...\n Really affected him? What were you...\n Going along with Emily, maybe he was just so dull that, or maybe it was coming to an end when he painted them. Because if there was a war or some sort of bad time and it was coming to an end he was probably starting to feel better about it because it was ending. So it depends, maybe he was going through things like maybe a very happy thing happened in his life then. Because he didn't have the happiest of all lives so...\n He didn't. We've even talked about that. Do you guys remember when we talked about how Vincent Van Gogh suffered a little bit mentally? He was a little...\n Crazy.\n Crazy and in and out of mental institutions.\n Yeah so maybe something good happened. 'Cause his life was not very happy. So most of his pictures are... No, not most of them but quite a few of them are actually quite dull. But you can tell when he's going through joy because he has those bright colors coming in. Like the boats, you can see a little bit of happiness in them but the majority of it is dark and sort of sad. And then if you look at the sunflowers they're all bright and dreamy. I mean yes, this is a few dark bits but I think that's probably a time when he was going through something that was better in his life.\n Guys, this is really great. I love all your comments. Logan, I'm gonna take one more and then I'm gonna tell you something. What, go ahead Logan.\n I thought maybe that he was painting it and then something happened. Like maybe he heard that war was breaking out or something. And then he started painting it sad.\n I have a question.\n  I think that-- You've got something really important, hon?\n Yeah, so he never really stopped a painting in the middle. When he started he finished. He never stopped. Because if the light changed it would totally change the picture.\n  That's so true. That is very true. And you guys know that-- Jose, is it okay if I speak real quick and then we'll go back because we wanna talk about Picasso too for a minute. You guys know that Vincent used to live with a painter. This is my fun fact. Not really fun I guess. But a fact about Vincent. He lived with a painter, Paul Gauguin. This was when he was in and out of mental institutions. And they had a fight and he became so upset, you guys know he cut off his ear. And I showed you that one picture of him is a self-portrait of him with his ear cut off. You guys remember that? And the other important thing I wanted to tell you was that he didn't sell any of his works during his lifetime but he did sell one of his paintings after... After he died they sold one of his paintings for $8,000,000,000. Remember that? It was the most expensive painting ever sold at the time. Okay, now let's talk about... And Van Gogh people, if you guys wanna talk about Picasso you can, but let's give the Picasso teams some time here. This is... And I'm sorry the lighting is not the best. But who knows what the name of this painting is? Marie.\n  Is it Three Musicians?\n Three Musicians. And it was done by who?\n  Pablo\n Pablo Picasso. Does anybody know where Pablo Picasso was from? Let's see someone other than Mr. Logan. Travis.\n  Barcelona.\n  Barcelona. Where's Barcelona, you guys?\n Spain.\n  Spain.\n  I got my Barcelona jersey.\n Alright and who knows, Rudy, do you happen to know... And he's like, \"Uh-oh, I'm on the spot! Ooo!\" Do you happen to know what movement or style he painted in, Pablo Picasso?\n In Cubism?\n Cubism, that's correct. And we did go over, what were the characteristics of cubism real fast? Anybody? Mr Logan.\n  Geometric shapes.\n  Geometric shapes and what else?\n They were flat.\n  What was flat?\n His pictures.\n  But what element--\n His painting the colors.\n  The colors were flat. Thank you. Okay, let's have some opinion about what you see up here. The Three Musicians, does anybody have... Randy, do you have any, how do you feel about it, honey? What do you think about it?\n I don't know. It doesn't seem like it's in a down mood 'cause music is usually a happy sort of thing. So it seems like a happy kinda picture.\n  Kind of a happy fun picture. Pablo, he wasn't so concerned about emotions when he painted. He maybe was influenced by the political setting of his time. Does anybody know what was happening in Spain at the time? What are you thinking?\n  Civil war.\n There was a civil war. So maybe he was a little bit affected by that. He also traveled. Does anybody know where he traveled to, Rudy? To go and study the art forms of...\n Paris? He went to Paris because it was of all the artwork and stuff.\n So he went to study there and then where else?\n  He went to Africa.\n  He went to Africa and he really became obsessed with African masks. And so he did start using that as an influence in his painting. Carina, what were you gonna say, darling?\n Oh, I was thinking it's kind of like a mix of emotions 'cause it has so many colors. There's bright orange and yellow and then if you look deeper, there's a blue and a black and it kind of just grabs your attention.\n  It's attention-grabbing, isn't it? 'Cause of all the contrasting. I think more in his is the contrasting colors. You can see the blue and orange right next to each other. Those are colors that lie opposite each other on the color wheel and they make for very bright, they totally stand off each other. Right, the blue and the orange. I can't remember what-- Oh, they're complementary colors. I couldn't remember what that was. Right, so that's why. And I think his color contrast says a lot. His flat colors and they're bright and he puts them right next to each other. What do you think about this picture, Robert? Do you like it?\n Yeah.\n  Do you know why you might like it or you don't like it?\n I like the picture, like... yeah.\n  Well you and Maria are talking about doing, remember you were talking about making your own picture? You wanna tell us about that, what you guys wanna do? For your own picture? And you're doing the style of Pablo, aren't you?\n Yeah.\n  So what do you think you guys are gonna do?\n Have a picture of me and my brother and a picture of the Three Musicians on a porch.\n  You wanna have the Three Musicians be in a picture with you and your brother? And Maria, are you gonna--\n Not on a porch. On a deck.\n That's what I was gonna say.\n  And you guys are gonna, are you guys gonna reduce it down to geometric shapes? The picture?\n Yeah.\n Try to.\n  Good, good. Do you guys have anybody-- Oh, what were you gonna say, Elijah?\n It makes me think about it, because there's so many twists and turns and curves and things. Kinda like if you look hard enough you can see 'em but when you just look at it you're like, \"Whoa.\"\n Right, when you first look at it, you're like, \"Whoa, what is that? Are those people? Are those shapes? \"There's lots of curves and turns.\"\n  At first it's a little confusing.\n At first it is a little confusing, isn't it?\n  When you actually pick a name and you actually try to look for 'em you can actually see what it is.\n Right, if we didn't tell you it was the Three Musicians you might not know at first.\n You can kinda tell because of that one right there. That thing, yeah.\n The instrument here. And the guitar.\n And then the paper with the two...\n The sheet music.\n The sheet music, you could kinda tell it was about the musicians.\n What were you gonna say?\n When you first look at the painting, your eyes are immediately drawn to the first guy in blue's clarinet. Whereas if you peeked a minute and look at it you can actually kinda see instruments like they were saying. At first, when you just... but instead you just see a whole bunch of colors and then you look at it and it kinda starts to form.\n It does start to form. What were you gonna say, Emily?\n I think that in my\n", "filename": ["Copy of 132 ART EAYA 132edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.0100683], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Marie"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Travis"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Logan"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW06", "TW08", "TW16"]}, "1060": {"text": " So, here's the first set. I thought I'd start a little bit easy. So, go ahead and within your groups now, I'll give you like a minute to tell me all the methods that you can of how to separate, how to figure out which one it is. Okay? Go ahead.\n  You can uh...\n  You can you use Beer's Law for this, right?\n  You aren't able to taste that.\n You aren't able to, that's not big enough.\n Our...\n Okay, so...\n  Doesn't dissociate.\n  How's the temperature? Boil it.\n Yeah, that's the only way.\n So, the one with the highest concentration's going to have the highest boiling point.\n  Yeah.\n  You could freeze it and weigh it.\n  Okay, freezing it.\n The point three would have the most weight.\n Weight. Yeah. But which one would freeze first?\n  Point one.\n Point one would freeze first because there's less. Okay. What else?\n Point three weighs more.\n But we would need to freeze it first, no?\n  What? We wouldn't need to freeze it.\n  The first one being, would   be with the tasting one.\n Or the volume one. I don't know the tasting one.\n Okay, you say the tasting one, you say the volume one. Whichever one comes first. \n  The one who boils fastest would be the one with the point one, right? Okay.\n So, the one that boils the fastest.\n  Point one.\n You could measure the vapor pressure by also just leaving them and adding them and then just coming back after like five minutes or ten minutes.\n Alright. So, we can have equal volumes of each solution, right? And then, after like a certain time--\n  Alright, that's it. Everybody stop. Stop, stop, stop. Okay. So, who want to go first? We'll start with with Miles, I think you had your hand up first, so go ahead. What's one way that you can identify these things?\n  Well, you could boil all the solutions until all the water vaporizes, and the beaker with the most sugar in it would be the 0.3 molar, 0.2 would be the middle, and 0.1 would be the least.\n Okay.\n  If they were all the same volume.\n  Ahh...\n  Yeah. You guys heard that, now? Good. Good listening skills on that. If they were the same volume at the beginning, alright? Does everybody agree? So, one method is boil away and weigh. Did you say weigh? How do you know which one has the most? I would imagine you could weigh it, right?\n  You could weight it.\n Start with equal volumes. Okay. There's several other ways. How about Joseph?\n If you take equal volumes of each solution and you taste them, whichever one tastes more sugary would have the highest concentration. \n Okay. Anybody have comments on that? Jimmy?\n I don't think we're able to distinguish the taste that well. Because our mouth isn't that sensitive.\n  Okay. Miles?\n What if someone dropped some lead nitrate in there? \n So, there's two concerns. Obviously I think Miles is the most important. You know you guys can see that I'm smart enough to put the right substances.  I keep forgetting I'm getting old. And I may go in the back, and I reach for the lead nitrate or something, right?  And then the other part, what do you guys think of the other part? Could you taste the difference between a 0.2, 0.3, and a 0.1? And just say \"Ah, that's the sweetest one.\"\n  It's kind of hard.\n {Miles] You'd need some salt.\n The problem I think is this is something we would actually need to try, right? I don't think this is a theoretical thing that we're trying to, we're practicing theory here. We would actually have to do this in a lab, right? I would imagine we would.\n Wouldn't it be different for every person? Because we could--\n  It could be different for every person, right? Because I can't see as well as you, for example maybe, right? So, there could be variations in tasting of those. Ian?\n Given excess humans... \n  Oh, wait. You're on the next one?\n  No, on this one.\n Alright. I didn't get that either.  Okay, so let's look at another method, alright? We're not going to list that one because we don't want to be tasting things. Okay so Paran, your group.\n What about at equal volumes you could test the vapor pressure and the 0.1 would have the most, and 0.3 would have the least because there's more sugar covering it?\n  What do you guys think? Okay, Juan?\n He didn't say how you could measure it. The way you could measure it is that with equal volumes you leave them out, and the one that evaporates the fastest is the one with the highest vapor pressure. \n Everybody agree?\n  Yeah.\n Okay. So, that was my concern too, right? How do you measure the vapor pressure? You're not wrong. But how do measure it? And thank you, Juan, for bringing that up.\n  Could you repeat that?\n Okay, so you would take equal volumes and leave them out to evaporate because they'd always be evaporating? The one with the highest vapor pressure which is 0.1 molar, would evaporate the most after a certain amount of time. \n So, I'm going to write this as evaporation rate. Who's got another method? Different view? Alright, Jimmy?\n Okay, so you're gonna put the same amount in a sealed container and put it into light. Whichever one grows algae first is the 0.3. Then the second one is 0.2, the last one 0.1.\n What do you guys think?\n  Could you repeat that?\n So, you're going to take equal amounts, take it into the light, make sure it's the same conditions for each one, and then whichever one grows algae first is the 0.3. Second is 0.2, last is 0.1.\n  What do you guys think? I know some of you guys are thinking that's bio, but you took it, most of you at least right? So, we could finish this. What do you think?\n Wouldn't it take a long time for the algae to start growing?\n  It's going to work, right?\n  Nobody sees--\n  Where's the algae--\n  You're always asking me. Come one, folks. You think about this. I'm going to say the problems. But I want you to tell me first, alright? \n  Alright, let's go with Ivan.\n I don't think the results would be consistent. Because what if some algae cells just go in one solution and start going there for no reason.\n So, because you didn't mention how much algae you put in, there could be an issue there. What else, though? No Juan, you go alright?\n I don't think you can assume that you have all the necessary stuff in the water for the algae to grow in the first place.\n So, I think Juan is saying growing conditions require lots of other things. Not just amount of sugar and amount of water. There could be other nutrients, is that what you're saying?\n  Yeah.\n Nutrients and other things of that sort. Could I just back up for a sec? Algae produces sugar, right? Assuming that you're talking about algae that grows, they use carbon dioxide. So my hunch is, there's several, right? One, I think as Ivan pointed out, you've got to put in a certain amount. Why don't you put in something that eats the sugar like yeast, and then we could all finish and have a beer at the end?  You picked algae so, yeah. Although is that a bad idea? It could work, but we have to be careful with conditions. A lot of conditions need to be met. Anything else?\n  You boil them.\n  Hold on. Let these guys go.\n If you have equal volumes and you add heat to them, 0.1 should boil first.\n Okay, so you could use boiling point. Elevation. I wrote this down before we even discussed it. But everybody agrees that works, right? So, what's another easy one that we, boiling point elevation, right? You need me to repeat that or you got it?  What immediately follows with that idea?\n  Freezing point depression.\n Freezing point depression. Okay, what else? I have a question for you then. Could we use Beer's Law for this? No? Tell me why. Could we use Beer's Law for this? Ian, you have your hand up.\n At first glace I would say no because I do not believe that stuff actually has a coloring solution.\n  What do you guys think?\n  Yep.\n  Don't you need color? Unless what? Unless? Come on, keep going with this stuff. Not you Ian. You spoke. I'd like to have as many people participate as possible. Alright Nick, go ahead.\n You could add food coloring possibly. Yeah, you could add food coloring and maybe the higher concentration would appear darker, possibly?\n Nick, we're trying to figure out the difference between these, right?\n  Yeah.\n What do you mean \"add?\" You mean add a drop to each of these?\n  Yeah.\n But then what would you be measuring? The food coloring. You wouldn't be measuring the sugar. You know what I mean?\n  Yeah, I know what you mean.\n You're still okay with that?\n Uh, I don't know.\n Wait, Nick. If you add food coloring, how much? One drop?\n  Yeah.\n Okay. One drop to each of these, right? Now they all look the same.  Don't they?\n  Yeah.\n And if I stick this in my spectral photometer, they should all measure the same. Did I succeed in figuring out which one is which? You understand that, right?\n  Yeah, yeah.\n  Okay. Nat?\n Could you somehow measure how fast the food coloring spreads?\n That's interesting. Could you measure how fast the food coloring spreads?\n You'd have to indicate that high concentration would--\n [Teacher} Hang on. But once again we have to be careful of conditions, right?\n  All the temperatures have to be the same.\n What do you guys think?\n  Sure.\n Why would that work?\n Because the sugar molecules are getting wet and it's not able to spread through the molecules. So, that would be in the 0.3.\n  Science!\n Glad you like it. Alright. How about, wait. Gevorg hasn't spoken. So I'm thinking, Gevorg, it's your turn buddy. What did you want to add? You wanted to add a new technique? Okay, go ahead.\n If we did a Benedict's Test, I don't know if it would just turn the same color because I'm not sure how the Benedict's reacts with different concentrations. But maybe if you put the same amount of Benedict's and if it gets darker or it gets affected with the molarity then you could use a color emitter or a spectrometer to test.\n  What do you guys think? Benedict's is a reaction between this Benedict's stuff with sugar, to show the presence of sugar.\n  What comes out of the reaction?\n  I'm not sure but it's a color change.\n  Oh well, the more color change--\n  But if the color change is too intense, it could just be like it's all going to change that color or not, see what I'm saying? That's what your pointing out, right? So again, that sounds like an experimental one. Could I share one more? How about this. You know when you take your AP test, you just don't know what. And we started with something that I think is sort of easy. Could you use density? What do you guys think? Someone who hasn't talked yet. Could we use density?  And how do we use density? What do you guys think? No? Alright, Ian. Since nobody's going for it.\n Do I have to say it?\n  Go ahead and say it. Tell me how. Tell us how.\n Take equal volume of each of the three and weigh it.\n  Exactly. Which one's going to weigh the most? The one that has the most sugar, okay? If you take equal volumes, this one will weigh the most. This will be the most dense. The more sugar you add, the denser it gets. You know this, right? Does anybody have any more? Alright, let's move on. Set number two. Now this says \"solid\" and I'm trying to get you to see a different range on these. Go ahead and talk about it. I'll give you a minute or so.\n  Colors? \n  Conductivity?\n We could root the potassium chloride out with conductivity.\n Well, they're solid. You have to remember. So, solid has a lot of problems with it.\n  That's just...solving it.\n  It's hard to conduct a current.\n  Well you could dissolve it--\n  It's doable. It's just a little difficult.  Potassium.\n Then um...\n  Wait, calcium.\n What about pH sensing? So CACL2.\n Well they're solids.\n Oh, if you put them into a solvent?\n Yeah. Can we put them into solvents? Can we make it into--\n So, lead can't dissolve in water, right?\n Lead?\n  I mean lead chloride.\n  No, lead chloride will not dissolve in water.\n  But then KCL and CACL2 would?\n They would.\n So, you can rule that out. That's one way. But then how do you figure out between the other solution?\n Couldn't there be a bigger concentration of chloride and then you could form a precipitate?\n I wouldn't say form a precipitate, I would say...  Actually, I'm thinking you can hybridize the fact the lead chloride doesn't dissolve at all with boiling point elevation, freezing point depression because you're going to have more little bits in the CACL2 than the KCL.\n As an end result, calcium chloride, potassium chloride get what? PBCL2 does nothing. So, after that if you boil it, right? Calcium chloride, potassium, the higher value.\n  Alright you guys. That's it. Let's gather up. Okay. Some of you guys just got back, so you guys know what we're doing, right?\n  Yes.\n  Okay. Let's get it together. Alright, everybody stop now. Christina, you had your hand up first. Take the easiest one. What's the easiest way to distinguish these?\n You could take equal amounts of each of them and weigh them, and then PBCL2 would be the heaviest, and the KCL would be the lightest.\n  Equal volumes?\n I mean equal amounts.\n  What's an amount, though?\n Like grams. \n  But if I take equal grams, then I could have ten grams of this, ten grams of this, ten grams of that.\n No, I didn't say that. \n  Alright, what did you say then?\n I meant like equal--\n  Equal what?\n Volume.\n  Volume, okay. Now let's answer that one. What do you guys think? She's saying take, let's say 10 milliliters, 10 milliliters, 10 milliliters. And this one's going to weigh the most. This one would weigh, which one's second?\n  Oh, sorry. Second would be CACL2.\n Okay, so this one would be second. What do you guys think? Someone other than Ian?  Okay Ian, go ahead.\n Does atomic weight, atomic mass directly influence--\n  Listen to this, Miles.\n Does atomic mass directly influence density?\n  That's the question. Does the formula mass have anything to do with the density of these solids? They're all ionic compounds. And the answer to that is no. You cannot assume that because this has the highest formula mass, that this is the most dense. Okay? Where, just to follow that up, where could you use formula mass in relationship to density in a pattern that works?\n Ivan? Oh wait, let's give it to him. Just, he's just walked in. Niresh?\n Is it in gases?\n  Gases, right? Does everybody agree? Gases, you could do that. If the formula mass is high on a gas, then it's going to have more density. Could you do that for liquids, now? Could you do that for liquids? Ivan?\n You could do it if it's all the same subsets for different concentrations.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 1060 SCI AYA 1060edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0766465], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Christina"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Natalie"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Natalie"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Miles"], ["NaN"], ["Miles"], ["Class"], ["Teacher"], ["Miles"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Ian"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Miles"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Juan"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Miles"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Nick"], ["NaN"], ["Nick"], ["NaN"], ["Nick"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Nick"], ["NaN"], ["Nick"], ["NaN"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Miles"], ["NaN"], ["Miles"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Miles"], ["Teacher"], ["Miles"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Miles"], ["NaN"], ["Miles"], ["Melissa"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Ian"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Christina"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW08", "TW15"]}, "1062": {"text": "  How much bigger is one than the other?\n It\u2019s like a thousand times.\n  It\u2019s like four times.

Now does that picture help us understand why our hypotenuse is almost the same as the side? Okay, so, do we use our picture to make judgments?\n Yeah.\n Okay, only if it's to scale. Thank you, ma\u2019am. Okay, Sam. You understand that? Okay. Alright, now one more thing we needed to do for the- Yeah. Go ahead.\n That hypotenuse has got a curve. \n It\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll make allowances. He doesn\u2019t have a straight edge up at the board.\n Okay, Raci, what else do we have to do here?\n  Find the direction.\n Find the direction. Raci, how would we go about doing that? \n  Okay so tangent... \n No, that\u2019s fine. We can use tangent. Which numbers will we use then? \n Okay. And-\n Pardon me?\n Are we trying to find the hypotenuse right now?\n  No.\n  We, well, yeah, we\u2019re going to. We just didn\u2019t write it that way. To solve for Theta we would do inverse tangent okay? Now, what do I tell you always to do with this? Make sure...\n It\u2019s in degrees.\n  In degrees. A couple of you had it in radians.\n That\u2019s because in Precal, we .\n  I understand that, but- So. Okay, now we have the angle. Is that the angle of the resultant?\n No.\n  What would you do, Jonah?\n 180.\nAdd 180 because?  It\u2019s in the third quadrant. Drew would you agree with that?\n Yes.\n Because?\n Because the resulting forces can\u2019t-- They can\u2019t, there\u2019s no forces in the other quadrants, so the resulting force couldn\u2019t possibly be in another quadrant.\n Okay, but how do we measure that angle? Counter clockwise from East. Okay good. Alright. Any questions? Sam?\n Question. I didn\u2019t add the 180, but then I put my answer as a certain number of degrees southwest.\n That would be fine. So you can do south of west also because it defines where that angle is. Alright? Now, do you guys feel better about this problem? Okay. John?\n Can you measure that from? I said it was... I\u2019m pretty sure this is incorrect, but 12 and a half degrees west of south. I mean, now that I realize it's...\n Yes, you could have. I guess it's technically the same thing.\n It would have been west of south. Did I mark it wrong?\n Yeah.\n Alright, well just show it to me later. I might have just missed that angle there. Okay. I\u2019ll make that correction for you, John. Okay. Let\u2019s go on. Jonah? Jake, thank you. Jonah, you\u2019re going to the board for this one.\n What should I write?\n We can erase all of number one.  Taylor, would you please read the problem for us?\n  Sure. A proton accelerates from rest in a uniform electric field of 640... What does that say?\n Newtons over Coulombs. \n Okay, let\u2019s stop there for a second. Hold on. Don\u2019t erase the nanocoulombs. You see the difference between an \u2018N\u2019 slash \u2018C\u2019 and a lower case \u2018nc\u2019? Sometimes, if you\u2019re reading too fast you are going to mess those up. I do it myself. So, always take a good look at the units. Units help inform you what you have. Okay, thank you.\n  At some later time its speed is 1.2 times 10 to the second . For A, you have to find the magnitude of the acceleration of a proton. For B, how long does it take the proton to reach the speed? C, how far has it moved in an interval? And D, what is the kinetic energy at the later time?\n Okay so, Connor. Calling on you again here. Magnitude of the acceleration. How would we go about finding acceleration normally if I just said, Connor tell me how to find acceleration? What\u2019s the first stuff that comes to mind?\n  \u2018f\u2019 equals \u2018m\u2019 \u2018a\u2019.\n \u2018f\u2019 equals \u2018m\u2019 \u2018a\u2019. Okay, or \u2018a\u2019 equals-\n  \u2018f\u2019 over \u2018m\u2019.\n  \u2018f\u2019 over \u2018m\u2019. Jonah, \u2018a\u2019 equals \u2018f\u2019 over \u2018m\u2019. We\u2019re working with a proton. Mass isn\u2019t given in the problem, but is that going to be an issue for us?\n No.\n  No, because that\u2019s our table of equations. So the mass of a proton: 1.67 times 10 to the minus 27 kg. So, we have that part, but we don\u2019t have the force. So Rachel, how might we find the force?\n Isn't the 'e' equals 'f' over 'q', so we can use the charge of the proton to find the .\n To find the charge, and what\u2019s e?\n It\u2019s a constant. No, no, no its not a constant. Oh, isn\u2019t it the 640 newtons over coulombs, right?\n And what does e represent, Rachel?\n The electric field.\n Electric field, good. So, if we solve this for force, what is that going to be? F equals- Okay, you can plug numbers in first too, that\u2019s good.\n Jonah. Can you slow down for some of us, please?\n Yeah, Jonah, you\u2019re not supposed to be looking at your sheet, so put your sheet down. What did Jonah just write up there? \n Okay, he went too fast. So let\u2019s back up.\n He plugged in the variables.\n He plugged in the numbers. But do we all know where that equation came from?\n Green sheet.\n Green sheet. And 'e' is the?\n Electric field.\n Good okay. And 'f'?\n Force.\n 'q'.\n The charge of a proton.\n Alright. So, now do you all know the charge of the proton?\n It\u2019s equal to the charge of an electron.\n Very good, alright now we can find force, right? What was the force then?\n 6.13 times 10 to the 10th?\n I got 1.02 times 10 to the ninth.\n That's the acceleration.\n Oh, my bad. Yeah, I was doing acceleration.\n F equals?\n 1.67.\n 1.024. How did I get this problem right? Oh, there it is right there. 1.024 x 10 to the negative 16th.\n And that brings up another good point. Write your work more clearly, right? Because if you can\u2019t follow your own, how do you expect me or the AP reader to do that? So, do yourself a favor. Make sure its clear. Okay. Where do we go from here, Ann? Back to a equals f over m. And we have force and we have mass now, right?  Okay, now I have led you through the problem solving steps for number one and number two A. John, lead your classmates through 2 B.\n Okay. 2 B. You have... Do you want me to lead the class?\n I want you to ask questions. Don\u2019t tell us. I want you to ask questions, okay?\n Okay. So, you need to find time. So, what equation would you use?\n Jonah, stop using the sheet.\n No, I told him he could use it.\n Wouldn\u2019t it be velocity equals acceleration times time?\n It is.\n Yes. \n Oh, come on Jonah, don\u2019t... It's actually v o times x, times t, not x v o times t.\n That\u2019s right.\n Isn\u2019t it v o times t?\n You are thinking of the equation for displacement. Oh yeah, x times v o. Well v o is zero because it's from rest.\n Alright, Drew what would you plug in?  The speed that you\u2019re given at the beginning of the problem and you found the acceleration. Oh, the speed is 1.2 x 10 to the sixth, and then you plug the acceleration you found from the previous problem, into that equation and solve it. \n So, t equals...\n No, John\u2019s leading.\n Class what does t equal?\n 1.96 times 10 to the negative fifth.\n Negative fifth or negative seven?\n Five.\n Alright, Sam, you lead for part C. Read part C. You lead.\n Part C. How far has it moved in the interval? And if you look up to the problem, nope you don\u2019t have to look up to the problem. You look up to number B which we just did. Number B. Yes, you do. Number B, and you look at the time that we just found, and that\u2019s going to be the interval. Thank you, Jonah. So, how are we gonna find time, Ann? Or distance? Sorry, distance.\n Why\u2019d you ask me a question?\n You told me to ask you a question.\n No, I didn\u2019t.\n Alright, anyone else know? Gretchen, you look like you know. What\u2019s the equation to find distance in number C?\n Distance equals velocity times time.\n Nope. That's not what I got. But, I guess you could do that. You could do that.\n No, you can\u2019t. You can\u2019t do that.\n Why not? Because I was gonna do that at first Gretchen, but then I thought in my head, that since the object\u2019s accelerating, the velocity is not going to be constant throughout the path of the travel. I have an equation.\n You have an equation, Ann?\n I do.\n What is it?\n How about x equals, x, the original x plus v o times, times t plus one half 'a' 'v' squared.\n So, what do we know about v o and x o, Ann?\n That they are just zero.\n So what can we do to both those first parts of the equation?\n Just throw them out the window.\n Drop it like a bad habit.\n Drop it like it's hot.\n So, that would be half times acceleration times time squared. And conveniently, letter A, letter A we found the acceleration which was what, Drew?\n 6.13 x 10 to the 10. Nice. \u00bd is just \u00bd and the time in letter B. What was it Raci?\n 1.93 times 10 to the negative .\n So, if you pound that out on the calc...\n Can we just pound it out?\n You cannot just pound it out because you have to...\n Do what, Miranda?\n I don\u2019t know, .\n Put the square in there?\n Change back to degrees?\n Oh, you snuck it in.\n Snuck what in?\n The square.\n I don\u2019t think I said the square. No I didn\u2019t, but Jonah thank you for saying the square for me. Pound that out in sig fig-wise, what do you get?\n I got 11.8.\n 11.7.\n John.\n If acceleration does matter, couldn\u2019t you also use the equation \u00bd v t? Because I also did that and I got the same.\n D equals one. Write it on the board, please. D equals? What\u2019s d?  I know it works. I just don't know how it works. I\u2019m going to tell you in a second. One half v average times t. So, why will this also work, then? Let\u2019s get some of your thoughts. Ann?\n Because if it\u2019s the average, then it\u2019s looking at the middle velocity instead of the top and bottom so you just-\n Wait a minute.\n It\u2019s the average velocity; and really the equation is \u00bd the quantity vo plus v times t.\n Yeah, that\u2019s what I wrote down.\n Right and so you take into account the acceleration with the change in velocity.\n So, wait a minute. If the equation is \u00bd vo plus v?\n Then you just get rid of the \u00bd.\n No.\n Yeah, you do.\n \u00bd v plus vo times t.\n \u00bd the quantity vo plus v.\n Times t would just be v average times t.\n Okay, let\u2019s write the whole equation out. John, one half parenthesis v o plus v end parenthesis t.\n Then isn\u2019t \u00bd vo plus v just v average?\n So, t equals v average times t.\n Not \u00bd v average? \n No.\n Yes.\n But vo plus v divided by 2... \n Oh okay. I\u2019m sorry. I see what you mean. I missed that. Yes, sorry. But it can\u2019t just be final velocity. Okay. Is there another equation we could\u2019ve used? I saw some of the other ones on your sheets that worked.  Anybody in this class have one of the other ones? Jonah, did you?\n You could do V squared equals 2 a x.\n  So another way, v squared eqals 2 a x and solve for x, right? Good job, so you can see there\u2019s multiple ways of getting at the same answer, right? And D, letter D. I'll have Gretchen lead.\n  Letter D is asking to find the kinetic energy at the later time. So, what equation would you use? Sam?\n  Would it be kinetic energy equals \u00bd times the mass of the object times the velocity of the object squared?\n Yes. And then if we know the mass of the object of the proton from the first equation and that was?\n 1.67 x 10 -27 kilograms.\n Thank you for using the unit.\n And then we found the velocity in letter...\n Given.\n Or it was given, right. So 1.2 x 10 to the 6th...\n Meters per second.\n Thank you.\n Squared.\n And then you can just plug that into your calculator.\n Sig figs 1.2 times 10 to the negative 15th gs or kilogram meters per second.\n  Meters squared over seconds squared. Don\u2019t forget you have to square the units.\n Kilogram meters squared over seconds squared?\n Kilograms meters squared over seconds squared. Yeah.\n What is kilogram meters per second?\n You have to convert the meters.\n I could have sworn kilogram meters per second was something.\n Oh, momentum.\n That\u2019s not what we\u2019re looking for though, right?\n No, it\u2019s not. No, we\u2019re good.\n Okay, now. Better understanding?\n Yes.\n You gotta stay on top of stuff. You can\u2019t let those distractions get to you. Okay. Pass your quizzes to the front face down. I\u2019ll put them in your files for you.\n Do you want to see ?\n I\u2019ll take yours separate.\n Are we allowed to retake them?\n Pardon me?\n Can we retake them?\n Sure. Thank you. \n You gave me a minus six.\n Well...\n I had everything .\n Okay now, we are starting the next chapter today, so I have some handouts to give to you. \n Do we have till this Friday to retake the last test?\n Yeah, and quarter ends on Friday, so anything you guys need...\n", "filename": ["Copy of 1062 SCI AYA 1062edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.178977], "annotations": [["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["mumbles"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voicover"], ["mumbles"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["chuckles"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Raci"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover", "mumbles"], ["mumbles"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["voiceover"], ["mumbles"], ["voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["mumbles"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["mumbles"], ["Taylor"], ["crosstalk"], ["NaN"], ["Taylor", "mumbles"], ["NaN"], ["Connor"], ["NaN"], ["Connor"], ["voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["voiceover"], ["mumbles"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["mumbles"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["mumbles"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["mumbles"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["mumbles", "mumbles"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["mumbles"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["mumbles"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["mumbles"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["mumbles"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["crosstalk"], ["mumbles"], ["NaN"], ["voiceover"], ["Gretchen"], ["Sam"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["mumbles"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["mumbles"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["mumbles"], ["mumbles"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW08", "TW13"]}, "1064": {"text": "  Also causing habitat loss--\n Anyways.\n  Indirectly through our use of C02 emissions.\n It says that... It is a naturally occurring greenhouse gas and we want to keep that, right? We want to keep it naturally occuring, we just wanna work on our--\n  Levels.\n Yeah. Because our impact is not exactly natural.\n  It's not like we're trying to stop the unhuman-related processes. Just like, what we're doing to increase it. Because like, it's been staying at a level until we started releasing a bunch of CO2, and then it went up, so it's kind of obvious that we're the cause of that. So, I don't think it's going to go down, then what it was before, normally.\n  Yeah, I think it's highly unlikely that this would ever happen.\n  Yeah, and 20 to 40 degrees Celsius is a lot, too.\n I highly doubt this would happen. If we reduce the CO2 emissions, in what we're doing, this is kind of ridiculous.\n  Give some more evidence for that.\n  Why?\n  Yeah, why? Explain why do you feel that way?\n Because carbon dioxide is part of the natural carbon cycle, yeah? But we're contributing to make more of it.\n  There's so many economies and stuff that are dependent on it right now, that are not going to get rid of it for a long time. Therefore, there wouldn't be such a drastic change in the amounts of carbon dioxide, that there wouldn't be a drop of 20 to 40 degrees Celsius.\n  Because we don't plan to tamper with the natural... Flow of the carbon cycle. We just want to tamper with our  which will take a long time anyway. So, we're going to be up and up and up for a while.\n But we kind of already did tamper with the CO2, the natural ones, because yeah, we're trying to reduce our own personal emissions, now that we're doing it now, but we've already gone in and tampered with it. We've already cut down millions and millions of trees. We've already, so can we talk about... I'm trying to touch into what we've done in the past, and how if we kind of try and back out now, then we leave the Earth in a sticky situation. Does that make sense?\n  Well, I do have a question. I don't remember, does the greenhouse effect exist naturally, even as like a little bit, right?\n  Yeah, we just made it bigger.\n So it's like, they're claiming that without the greenhouse effect, the Earth's average temperature would drop drastically, well obviously because the greenhouse effect exists naturally, but we're making so much of the greenhouse effect that we're trying to bring it down to normal levels. We're not trying to bring it down below normal levels. I think they're saying that this is going to happen if it's below the normal level, but the problem is that we are already above the normal level, so if we bring it down, it's not going to make it a complete effect anyway.\n  I mean, they are right saying that it's going to get significantly below, as everyone said, it's not going to be to the point where life will not exist. But I mean, the process by which sun penetrates the earth, like some of the heat is retained because of that effect. And what we're doing is enabling the Earth to retain more heat than it normally does. So by releasing some of it, by reducing emissions, we are making the Earth much, much cooler.\n  But we also can't get rid of the greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere. So, those would stay there, and our temperature probably wouldn't drop as much, probably still would drop, maybe not as extreme.\n  And also, we live in a world where we use so much carbon dioxide, there's no way that we're going to get it to the level of just the natural processes. I mean, at least not in a ten year period.\n  I was wondering how long it thought we were going to slow so-called global warming. It doesn't really give us a projection.\n  I don't think we're going to have another ice age for a long time.\n  I mean, we're having a mass extinction as it is, the way we are right now. I think if anything, reducing it would help stop the mass extinction.\n I think we've kind of talked about all we can at this point.\n Alright, so, at this point, if you feel like you have talked a lot, in an effort to get you to stop, I'm going to have you actually, I want you to scoot your chair back like a foot or two, for the next one, to give some other people a chance to talk. Yeah, I have two, you want the good ones with lotion?\n The next one, sorry, is, \"Concerns over CO2 emissions are unfounded.\" Somebody want to read?\n Okay. \"Concerns over CO2 emissions are unfounded. \"Water vapor is a leading greenhouse gas. \"Today, Mythbusters Daily exclusively reveals \"what climate scientists have been hiding from the public. \"Water vapor is actually a much more prevalent \"and potent greenhouse than carbon dioxide. \"Water vapor concentrations in the atmosphere \"between 30,000 to 40,000 ppm, \"while maximum estimates \"put CO2 around 370 ppm. \"Due to its abundance, water vapor's \"a much more important greenhouse gas, \"so human inputs of CO2 are negligible. \"We should stop focusing on CO2, \"and refocus research and funding \"on reducing the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere.\" \n Would that be parts per million for ppm?\n Yeah, parts per million.\n Water vapor unit, really, really. Okay. We have a whole water cycle, I know we have the whole carbon cycle and everything, but we have contributed so much to the carbon cycle. I mean, and global warming hasn't really been a problem until recently, gee, I wonder why? Maybe because, I don't know, we are emitting a lot of carbon. I mean, it's not like we've been emitting more water, you can't create more water. Okay. Yeah, I'm done, I'm sorry.\n  I think if you explained what the greenhouse effect actually is it will disprove the water vapor theory. Because the way the greenhouse effect works is completely unrelated with water vapor.\n  How?\n  Well, because like, isn't the greenhouse gas a gas that lets in sunlight, but it prevents the heat from leaving, or whatever or something right? But water doesn't, I don't think water does that.\n I thought it was a greenhouse gas. We learned about that in chapter 20. But... We did it on the worksheet, maybe, or the thing that we had for homework last night. It's considered a greenhouse gas. That's all I know.\n  You know what effect it had?\n Sorry.\n No, it is a greenhouse gas. I remember reading that. But--\n  You can grab a textbook, if you'd like.\n  Keep talking, Elizabeth.\n Water vapor has always been there. It has always been at this level. Am I wrong?\n  Well, I mean, if our CO2 emissions are increasing, and global warming is happening, then you would be releasing more water vapor. I mean, heat would cause that to happen.\n But then technically this is an effect, it's not a cause, then.\n  Is it possible to be both?\n Maybe.\n  Like a positive feedback loop?\n  What do you know about water vapor?\n  It's a greenhouse gas. We know that now.\n Isn't it when water evaporates.\n  Clouds. \n  Nope, that is an excellent point.\n Hold on, you guys, what do clouds do? They block sunlight. \n So, if the global temperatures rise, there would be more water vapor, because there would be more fluctuations of creating water vapor?\n  Don't look at me, look at your people. And people who are on the outside are not supposed to be talking.\n  Well, just like--\n  Well, she can finish.\n  Sorry, sorry, no go ahead.\n Go ahead, finish. She said  you could finish.\n Oh, Okay. Well, when water vapor, think about it, when you like boil water, it's hot, and it creates water vapor. So, increases in global temperature, there would be a possible connection between increased temperature and increased water vapor.\n Hot air rises.\n Which way would it be though? Because if increasing temperature causes increase in water vapor, does that mean increase in water vapor causes increase in temperature?\n  Well, you said that water vapor is clouds, so wouldn't, clouds would block sunlight, so wouldn't that decrease temperature? But that's kind of like contradictory.\n  Can that happen, though?\n  Like how hot air rises, and cold air drops, so maybe, forgot what that process is called.\n  Well, it's like sometimes when you're on like islands, or something that it's like all cloudy, but still really hot and humid, so maybe it can increase the temperature. \n  I have a question. At what altitude do clouds form?\n It depends. I mean they can form at ground level. That's what's basically fog.\n  What's the highest altitude that clouds are going to reach? For the most part, like on average?\n I have no idea, that is an excellent question.\n  But like what part of their, is it under the stratosphere?\n There's a laptop over there if you guys want to get it. No one's ever asked me that. That's a really good question. I don't know. I know that they're throughout the troposphere, but I'm not sure how high up in the stratosphere they go. That's a really good, I don't know.\n  Can I read something really quick? \"Four natural greenhouse gases in the troposphere \"are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, \"and nitrous oxide. \"These gases have been present, in varying concentrations \"in the troposphere during most of the Earth's long history. \"Fluctuations in the troposphere, \"concentration of these gases, especially carbon dioxide \"and methane, plus changes in solar output \"are the major factors causing new changes \"in the average temperature of the troposphere \"over the past 400,000 years.\" And then it just talks about how from the beginning of the industrial revolution, human actions have led to significant increases in carbon dioxide, and therefore it correlates the relation to the increase in temperature of the globe.\n I just read another thing. \"Additional clouds can have a warming effect, \"positively back by absorbing and releasing heat \"into the troposphere. \"Or a cooling effect, a negative effect, \"by reflecting more sunlight back into space.\" So, they can have a warming effect.\n So, should we be worried about water vapor more than carbon dioxide?\n  No.\n Why?\n  Because doesn't the CO2 cause the warming, which, never mind.\n  No no, keep going. That was good, keep going.\n  That was it.\n  Okay. \n Well, based on what she just read, and based on everything we know about carbon dioxide, we know that carbon dioxide can lead to a lot of effects. A lot of them bad. And one of the major things is that it does lead to more water vapor, and if water vapor is such an issue in terms of global temperature increase, then you would think their first thought would be decrease carbon dioxide emissions. But, no.\n Can we directly regulate water vapor?\nNo. Can we directly regulate CO2?\n Yeah, we can decrease our emissions. We can switch to alternative vehicles. We can find other sources of energy. I mean there are a lot of options with water vapor, we just have a water cycle. We can't tell the water vapor to stop rising into the clouds, like, \"Yeah, can you just pause for a moment?\" No, we can't do that, because it's a natural cycle.\n  Are we done with that one?\n So, what do we have so far, Nida?\n Well, that heat would cause the release of more water vapor, and clouds can trap and release heat, but they can also cool. And concluded that clouds are water vapor, first of all.  What we were saying, should we worry about water vapor more so than CO2? Probably not, because we can regulate CO2, but not water vapor. And water's a greenhouse gas.\n I call that using science. \n  I have a question for you. In nuclear power plants, how the steam comes from the cooling tower. Is that water vapor emission?\n That is considered a water vapor emission.\n  Okay, so maybe we could control that aspect of it, control the steam.\n One additional thing to just sort of keep in mind, and we'll talk about this later, is what we call residence time. Does anyone know what that is? Residence time is how long a chemical stays in wherever it is. And so one of the things that we're concerned about, when we look at a chemical, is its residence time. So, if we're talking about a water pollutant, what's the residence time? How long is it going to stay in water? Is it going to break down quickly, or is it going to be very persistent, and is it gonna last for a really long time? So, when we were looking at greenhouse gases, we're also looking at what's the residence time in the atmosphere. How long does an average molecule stay in the atmosphere? And water vapor tends to cycle in and out of the atmosphere a lot quicker than some of our other greenhouse gases. Its cycles are usually on the order of days, whereas others are on the order of months to years, versus like, do you guys know what CFCs are? The ozone-depleting compounds. Chlorofluorocarbons, we'll talk more about those as well. CFCs are also a greenhouse gas, but their residence time in the atmosphere is more like hundreds of years. Hundreds of years to thousands of years. That would be something we would be more concerned about.\n  So like, the residence time of something radioactive could be like its half life?\n Yep. And then a third factor that we look at is also how potent of a greenhouse gas it is. Some gases have more warming potential, and some gases have less warming potential. So, we also want to look at what is its potential for heat trapping versus its concentration? And we'll talk a little more about that, too. Alright, we have two left. I'd actually like for you to pick one. I'm thinking maybe you should do the freezing temps one, because we already kind of talked about the cloudy one, but if you want to do the cloudy one you can do the cloudy one.\n  You suggest the freezing temperature one?\n That's my suggestion, but I won't be upset if you overrule me.\n Let's do freezing temperatures.\n Does anybody want to write--\n", "filename": ["Copy of 1064 SCI AYA 1064edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.236418], "annotations": [["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Elizabeth"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW06s", "TW08", "TW24TW08"]}, "828": {"text": " Well, let's say about like a plane. A plane can use the wing to, like, slice right through the, the wind, making it just fly with ease, but let's say the wing was vertical, and then it would just be working like a parachute and just stop its fall.\n Okay, did everybody hear what he said?\n No.\n Daniel, did you understand what Jonathan was saying?\n Yeah.\n Okay, so does that make sense to you then, Daniel?\n Yeah.\n Okay, John?\n About the thing, the last part, did he say vertical?\n Yeah, like, like, like, vertical, like pointing upwards.\n Oh. Okay.\n What do you think? Reese, what do you think?\n Um, what Jonathan said?\n Jonathan, would you kind of say it again? Reese would really like to pay attention and he'd like to hear.\n Yeah, I'm saying, like, like a wing, it uses, like, like, like a V shape of a duck, of a duck squad. Like every single wing goes down each part and then it's just like a V.\n Okay.\n Shayla?\n Um, I said they fly because the air pressure in the wings gives it stability to keep stable and make sure it doesn't fall onto the ground.\n Okay. Kelsey?\n Um, I think that if the aerospace vehicle was in space then I think it would just float in space because there's no gravity.\n Okay, we're kind of... yeah, Ramaji?\n Okay, I'm kind of lost...\n Ramaji is lost, let's help her find herself. No, that's a good thing. Because, I'll be honest, I'm a little lost. So tell me where you are.\n Like, I thought we were supposed to put, like, why we think they were built, not how they were built, like, like, I wrote, um, I think aerospace vehicles fly to improve society and help, and new aerospace technology helps build modern things.\n Okay. Can everybody understand where Ramaji went with her answers? Kelsey?\n I'm totally lost now.\n Okay, here's what happened, okay, so let me see if we can find this a different direction. Um, in reading all your different sentences, most of us had a purpose for aerospace vehicles flying, okay, or some of you wrote that they fly both in space and in the air, okay, and so we're not kind of getting where I want to get to. So can I, for a second, kind of change the discussion? Just because... Yes, John?\n Is it, like, when you take a rocket, like, on the rocket it has, uh... two wings and like one tail?\n Great, so, his question that he asked, does a rocket have two wings and a tail? Um, here's what's happening. Mm, I thought the vehicles would help you, and what I'm seeing is, having the vehicles is making you try to figure out what it is about how this vehicle was made. And I'm not as concerned about how this vehicle is made, okay, as I am the science behind how it flies and why we design it that way, does that make sense?\n Yes.\n Okay, so can we go a different way with me for a minute? Each of you has a picture of a hot air balloon on your table, correct? Okay. I know, I took yours, Reese, which is why you don't have one now. I need to know something, okay? This vehicle doesn't have an engine, okay? Okay? Now, I want you to think about this for a minute, and I want you to discuss it at your table before we talk whole group. I want to know how does this hot air balloon fly, how does it get in the air, and how does it stay in the air? And is it possible you don't know anything about this?\n Possibly?\n Possibly. It is possible, okay, it is possible, Joelle, you don't know anything about this, okay. So I want your table group to share what you know for a couple of minutes about a hot air balloon and how it flies, okay? And I'm gonna come around and talk to different groups, okay? So how does this hot air balloon fly?  Okay, so you two start the discussion at this table.  So, discuss that, because some of us did have a good concept and some of us don't, okay? So share in your group. Okay, what do you two know?  Okay. Has an engine, a propulsion engine?  Okay, but is that an engine?  Okay, so now you can do your discussion. What did you come up with over here?  So the fire blows hot air into the balloon.  Okay, without it, it would do what? It would fall down, okay. Okay? So, any idea why the hot air makes the balloon rise? What do you think?  Okay, okay.  Ooh, that was awesome. You are so good today. Um, I think we're now getting somewhere. So let's talk about this hot air balloon for a minute, okay. So, I've heard some different things around the classroom, I want to know how does that balloon get into the air? Nathan?\n The fire in the hot air balloon blows the, the balloon up to where it can float down.\n Okay, Shayla, do you agree or disagree?\n I agree with that, because, yeah, because you pull on a cord and like, it lights up the fire and stuff, and then the fire pulls in air and it, like, shoots it up with the fire.\n So, is the fire being shot into the hot air balloon?\n No, air is.\n What kind of air?\n Hot air.\n Hot air is being shot up into this part. Okay. John?\n Didn't they say one of those, like if you compare...\n They can't, Jonathan can't hear you.\n Oh, sorry. If you compare a hot air balloon and a balloon, they're, you use hot air for the air balloon, and you use the helium for a small balloon, yeah, and the, it's not really air, kind of, I thought it was steam.\n Okay, okay. Now why would you think it was steam?\n Because you know how when you just, um, when you put like a fire, fire in one place, it sometimes can turn into steam? Maybe?\n The fire turns into steam?\n No, not the fire, but like when it's, when it's done...\n Ann Maria says she thinks you need the word \"water.\"\n Yeah, because when you heat up water, then steam comes up out of it. Because steam is, like, moisture.\n Steam is like moisture that's...\n In the air.\n In the air, okay. Ramaji?\n I agree with you, John.  Okay, I think what he's saying is, because in air and the fire is there or whatever, and so then when they're getting pushed up that comes and like, then... I'm lost here! Okay, like then the steam, like, yeah, you were right about the moisture part, but it, but there is no way that, like, water is in this...\n There isn't water in there!\n Yeah, I mean...\n Reese, be supportive. \n I mean, there's moisture in the air, but still, like... fire is a big part of it!\n Okay, can I ask a question? Okay? Do I need water in order for the hot air balloon to fly?\n No, no you don't!\n Ramaji says no, Laura says no?\n I said no.\n Mariah says no. Kelsey?\n I'm totally lost! \n Kelsey, it's okay to be lost, okay. Kelsey, you're, if you're lost, you need to know where you are. So here's the question, what do you feel like you know and understand about what's been discussed so far?\n I thought I was understanding everything until John said... I'm so confused right now!\n So tell me...\n John was talking about steam.\n John was talking about steam. I would agree, Kevin, John was talking about steam. So the question is, prior to that, Kelsey, okay, prior to that, what would be your understanding of how the hot air balloon flies?\n Basically, nothing before that, I just think it's steam, because of like hot and air, because, or like, there would be like a fire inside of the air and then it would be steamy...\n Okay, let's see if I can bring around some concepts. Ramaji and John, can you let me have two seconds, okay? Um, we have a concept of this fire that's heating air, but we also seem to have a concept of water that gets heated and creates steam. Correct? But I'm also hearing, and I just want to make sure I understand, I'm hearing that the steam isn't necessary for the balloon to go up. John?\n Well this is, this is how I thought it was steam. Because you know how sometimes there's clouds, and you, you want to go up in the air balloon, and sometimes it might rain, like when you're in the air balloon sometimes it, like, when you pass through a cloud and the air is super hot, it actually turns into steam I think.\n Okay. Ramaji?\n Okay.\n Listen, I've got to come over here.\n Okay, so like, like...\n You two can put your hand down for a minute and I'll go to you next.\n So like, steam is, I think it's putting pressure, like on the balloon to like, make it go up?\n So we feel like we have air pressure, okay.\n I don't agree with Ramaji though because with the air there's no steam involved, there's like, kinda like what John said, he said when the planes come up the hot air pushes it...\n Okay, I'm gonna ask... Oops, I didn't let you speak.\n Well, like, it's just like, like comparing this to a regular balloon, with helium it would float up just like an air balloon, but you can't put helium in an air balloon.\n Does everybody understand that? So if I put... okay, that is an awesome analogy! So everybody listen. If I put helium, helium is a...\n A gas!\n A gas, okay, helium is a gas, so if I take a regular rubber balloon and I put helium in it, the helium because it's a gas, helium floats, that makes my balloon float, right? Whereas if I just blow up a balloon, what happens? It just falls down on the ground and I got nothing, okay. On the flip side, Kevin, what she's saying is, with a hot air balloon, instead of filling it with helium, I'm filling it with hot air, okay? Now I have a question, I think you've got to think really deep about this one. If hot air, Reese, is what makes my hot air balloon go up, okay, I want to know, would it be easier for me to fly my hot air balloon on a warm day or on a cold day? Just think about it for a second, just think. Would it be easier for my hot air balloon, do you think, to fly on a hot day or a cold day?\n What about on a windy day?\n Ooh! Okay, she said what about on a windy day. Let's assume that there's a slight breeze, on either day, okay, but the temperature is either warm or the temperature is cold, okay? Kelsey?\n I personally think that it would be better to be on a hot day, because then the sun would be helping with all the hot air so then it would make the air inside the hot air balloon warmer to help it fly higher.\n So I'd get radiation into the balloon? Okay. Ramaji.\n I think a cold day.\n And why on a cold day?\n Because, like, there's not, I mean, even on hot days, there's still, like, low humidity sometimes, and so, like, it, you basically with fire would kind of... I don't know, not set your hair on fire, but like...  No, when it's cold there's no moisture in the air, so like, it would be, like, like helium, but like...\n Okay, Shayla?\n I think that it's a hot day. One of the reasons is because there's hot in the hot air balloon, and if it was on a cold day, there's a fire in the thing, in the hot air balloon, it could blow out the fire and that could make the whole thing just plummet to the ground, and people could die.\n Okay. Ann Maria?\n I think it would be better on a cold day, because, well, I don't know if this actually really makes sense, but, like, the hot air would be working against the cold air--\n Exactly!\n And like if it's on a hot day it would be like the same.\n Just a second. So Ann Maria, if the cold... if the warm air is in the hot air balloon, and it's a cold day, what would you expect to happen to the balloon?\n Go up.\n And why would you expect the balloon to go up on a cold day faster than on a hot day?\n Because... like, the hot air would be... pushing against the cold air, faster than it would be pushing against itself?\n Okay. Over here.\n I agree with Shayla on the hot day, because, like, a regular air balloon, just regular heat would make it go up, but if you had the sun hitting against it, I think, it would help with radiation, like the sun would help out...\n The fire?\n Yeah, how it has something to do with radiation.\n Okay.\n I think the sun hitting against the balloon would make it go up higher.\n Okay. Nathan?\n I think on a cold day, because it would give it less chance of popping from the hot air, that might pop it.\n Awesome. Kevin, what do you think?\n I think the same, hot air, because I've never seen a hot air balloon fly when it's cold.\n Okay. Dakota? Oh wait, Kevin, I have a question for you. How do you define a cold day? Okay, what's the, okay, here's my question, okay. You said you'd never seen a hot air balloon fly on a cold day, and what I'm asking is, is there a particular season that you would say the air would be too cold?\n Winter.\n Winter, okay. Dakota, what do you think?\n Uh, I think, uh...\n Kevin, Dakota can think on his own. I know he can.\n I don't know.\n Cold day, warm day, what do you think?\n I think a warm day, because it would be easier to fly?\n Okay, Daniel, what do you think? Cold day, warm day?\n I would say a cold day, because the hot air would meet the cold air, so it would be more enhanced, going up you'd get more from the hot air.\n Okay, I need to kind of bring this to a close real quick, and I know you two have lots to say, Tyree, did you want to add the last comment?\n Yeah. Uh, I think the hot day, because who would go out on a cold day, when the higher you get, the colder it gets.\n Okay, Tyree says who would go out on a cold day, because the higher you get, the colder you get, so Tyree's logic here is that if I'm going to go in a hot air balloon, I don't want to get really really cold. Okay, ladies, I know you have lots to add, okay, but I kind of want to bring this to a close, but I need to know a crucial question. So everybody has to commit to this question. I want you to-- don't do it until I tell you to! Ready? You're gonna hold, um, you're gonna hold your arm straight up if you believe the better day would be the warm day, and you're gonna hold your hand at the side of your shoulder if you believe it would be the cold day that would be the better day. I didn't say go yet! Okay, on three, everybody. So, does everybody understand? This is cold, this is warm, okay? Ready, one, two, three. Okay. Okay, now hands down. I have just two more questions, and then we're gonna close out today's lesson, okay. Question number one.

Well, here's what I'm talking about, you only need four people in this group, and you don't have as many pieces of paper. Don't take more without asking, why are you taking more? Why?\n Because Tyler got  on it.\n Go wash it in the sink. I'll mark down on my clipboard who's having trouble with self-control. Go to the sink and wash it with soap and water. All right, so you guys do not have the same number of papers that they have at the other table, because you only have four people, so I'm gonna let you add more. If you feel that you could add a few more pieces to fill it out more, go for it. And then I'll check in with y'all in just a minute.\n Add head.\n Yeah, but she said it has to be a word. What's another word for stomach acid?\n Stomach acid?\n Acid?\n Why don't you put acid?\n That could be anything.\n In your stomach?\n Stomach acid's kinda like a compound word.\n Well, actually, since stomach's already here, and if we put acid right here, you can't just say it's any kind of acid.\n Yeah, because it's going down the mouth, to the throat, to the... and they have acid in the stomach.\n Well, that's the intestine. Duh, acid. \n I'm gonna stop you right now, because we wanna take this to another level, but what I have is I have several groups with several different ways of looking at it. What seems to be a common thread among some of you is to order things, to put them in an order of sequence. I had one group that grouped them. So, what I'm asking is that, I'm still seeing a little bit of food in there, and I'm still seeing that you've got processes, some people have processes in there, and body parts, we got lots of body parts. So, what I'm gonna ask you to do is, if we could put, if we could create a big system on the board, with the pieces, and if there are duplicates, this is why I didn't want you sticking 'em too much, we just put it on top. So I'm gonna ask you to do this, this is gonna be tricky, we're not gonna have a lot of time, so I'm gonna ask you to bring, by groups, your Post-Its and put them on the board, this is our work space. So if you think it should be in, out five groups, four of you think it should be in a linear kind of grouping, so we're gonna go with the sequence of events order. So what I want you to do is put 'em on the board and let's look at what you've got, if there's duplicates, put it on top, if there's something you have that's different, figure out where, if you can move something, can it share a space, does it happen at the same time? We talked about it over there, what three things did you have?\n Esophagus, throat and neck.\n So they thought those were on equal grounds. That they were all, either in the same place, or the same function, I wasn't sure, I didn't ask them, but they've got them together. So, this is gonna be hard. It's real easy sitting there with your group of five or six or four people. Now you've gotta work with twenty-four, twenty-three. Okay? So, we're gonna start with Group One. And if you can just come stick 'em on the board, and I'm gonna get Group Four next. And you'll go up with them. So, you have to make one picture on this board that shows me how you think they fit. If you wanna put them in the same order, don't make them touch, leave enough room for manipulations. Yes?\n \n No. Pardon?\n \n The abdomen is the middle, the butt is the fleshy part. The anus is the actual opening, and the rectum is the tube. Yeah, so it's very distinct differences. They can't interchange. All right, so just stick 'em on, and then move quickly. Got 'em? All right, got 'em on? That's why I said, they're not going to stick well, if you keep sticking them on your face and get the oil from your face. All right? Make sure you agree. Now, you're gonna go up there with your Post-It notes. You may need to use some of their pieces, you're welcome to move any of their pieces, to fit in, since you're coming up there after them. And the group that comes after you will be free to move any of your pieces, okay? All right, y'all pay attention. All right. Got 'em? All right, can you do me a favor and plan before you get up here how you're gonna do it, so we can make it move quickly. All right, guys, have a seat. Now, they don't, they have some words you don't have. So how are you gonna make this work? You gonna put yours up above it?\n We're gonna put ours in our order, we could fit their's in there.\n There you go, however you wanna do it. Come up and get their voices.\n What's next, mouth? Water, where's water?\n I think we need mouth.\n I have teeth.\n Tongue, then teeth.\n Mouth.\n I have taste-buds. It was tongue, teeth, then chewing.\n It was tongue, then teeth.\n Saliva, it was saliva, saliva.\n Chewing. I think it was tongue, then saliva. No, It was tongue, taste-buds, saliva, teeth.\n Then chew. And then I think it was esophagus, next.\n I have intestine, stomach and waste.\n Stomach and then intestines and then waste.\n And then kidney, no put 'em on the same. All right, we put theirs up, now teeth, intestines...\n I'm gonna leave you guys for last over there, you have a smaller group, I'm gonna leave you for last. All right? \n All right, so health? Health should be overall, I guess it's like, yeah.\n Yeah, you get health from eating.\n Proteins go with food, no?\n Yeah, nutrients.\n How are you doing?\n It's kind of hard to put this in the same group with...\n So, you were looking linear, and now it's hard to go linear, because they've thrown these other things in. Yeah, you have a scrap board, what do you do? You might wanna build off.\n That's what I'm saying, or like, switching some, some of them are very vague.\n And that's exactly it. If they're vague, you're not quite sure how they tie in, you weren't there for their discussion. So you don't know what their train of thought was. So make it work. And realize that somebody's gonna come behind you, and they might change it.\n Let's put protein and nutrients. But health is overall.\n All right, this is getting very interesting. Their strategy...\n You have to realize, and I'll make the point while we're waiting for them to finish, because they're having their own discussions. When you have your discussion with your group, your having a discussion with a small group. So, when you get up there and you see a word, and you weren't there for the discussion that brought that word into the list, you weren't there, you don't know what their thinking was. So, just like we always say, you can't disregard somebody's input because you don't believe it should be there. You have to find a way, oh, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Thank you, I need you next, because y'all have the next least amount. Thank you for catching that. You have to make sure that what you do doesn't lose the meaning or change the meaning and doesn't judge somebody else's input, you have to just make it work. Grab it. If you know where it goes. All right, but if, by some chance, that's what happens when you start stacking, we can use this masking tape in little tiny pieces. All right, go for it.\n Ooh!\n Are you all right, is it still working? You're fine!\n Yes, we're okay.\n You lost a nose, we dropped a nose.\n A nose!\n But you see, it's OK, it may not have stood out in your discussion. And you might have brought something to the discussion that they didn't.\n Y'all gotta talk louder.\n Okay, nose should be here.\n Literally, put it right on top of it.\n Stomach, okay, teeth, chewing, epiglottis, esophagus, wait, esophagus, esophagus, wait.\n If you have to move something, or if you think it needs to be...\n This is the esophagus.\n In other words, if you think you have to move something over to fit yours in, because it's not there...\n And then...\n Intestines.\n And then acid.\n This word's already here. So right after the mouth?\n Then intestines, and then to the kidneys, and then to the waste, and then health.\n Do you wanna move it somewhere else? If you think something should be on the same plain, I just use the example of Scrabble game with them.\n I think saliva...\n I think water and food.\n Once you put it into your mouth, you're gonna get saliva.\n Okay, so, see what they did? So if you feel like you need to move anything, we need to get saliva back in there, so how's saliva gonna work?\n Saliva goes with taste-buds and mouth. And tongue!\n Put it, like, in the middle.\n Okay, it should stick. Wait, discuss, go ahead, tell them what you think.\n It looks like...\n Are y'all ready, are you almost ready?\n No.\n You do know, the more that get up there, the harder it gets.\n So you're making it harder for us?\n No, I'm making it harder for them.\n Oh!\n All right, I'm coming. Got it?\n They have like three on intestines.\n Let's put a little piece of tape to hold up the intestines. Yeah, just stick a little piece up at the top. It doesn't matter. And can you add this to the waste so it doesn't fall? All right, you guys, good? Okay, go! All right, how are y'all doing out there? Are you watching this unfold?\n Yeah.\n And Group One, I mean Three, Group Three? You guys look at the task ahead of you, it's gotten bigger.\n I need tape.\n All right, I'm gonna give you a little bit. I'd like you not to put too much on the board, more on the paper. You have to figure out, if you have a duplicate, then just tape it over the top of it. Anything that's duplicate. All right, all right.\n I need tape.\n You need tape, all right, so,\n Where do you put stomach?\n All right, so he's got a question about where to put stomach.\n No, I have stomach acid, I'm seeing where she's putting stomach.\n It's over here, this is acid.\n All right, so it's way down there. So move down there.\n I need some tape.\n And I will tell you the same thing I told the other two groups. Think about Scrabble. So if you have to go in a different direction to make something work, you just go in a different direction, you make it work. Okay, you guys have the hardest job. Or it might be the easiest.\n Mucus!\n Where does the gallbladder go?\n What is that, epiligotis, oh, my bad.\n But, look how much came out. That's good, we didn't have that much expansion on that idea before, all we had was body parts.\n Can we have tape for two?\n What do you need?\n Two pieces of tape.\n All right, two pieces of tape. All right, how we doing?\n Emily, where do I put mucus?\n Mucus goes with the, in between...\n The neck thing?\n Is that everything?\n All right, y'all ready?  Would you do me a favor and tell Mr. Dresser we need five more minutes? You have a test? Oh, tell him three minutes.  Thank you. So we need three minutes. You got it?\n Okay, I think it's good.\n All right, ready guys? All right, have a seat. Okay, now, everybody goes up, last group. Take your papers, go!\n I need a band-aid.\n For what?\n To put over my...\n Your what? Let me look and see if I have one. Sometimes you have those little bitty ones. Okay, I will look. If you need them... Thank you. All right, if you're stacking it and it won't stick, I have tape. Here, stick your mouth on that mouth.\n This we can put over this, can we change this?\n Yes. Use this, all right, you got it? Here, just put it like that. All right, how are y'all doing? What do you have left? Why don't you, Alex, would you lift up health and move my volcanoes, just slide the volcano down, it'll come off. Just slide it down. Now you can do it that way. Do you need more tape? All right, how are we doing? In case it doesn't stick. Got it? All right, now, I want you to, while you are waiting, and I appreciate the patience that you guys have had, I want you to watch and look at what it looks like now. Because some of you made some significant placements and they've made some significant changes to that. So take a look at what the resulting image is here. Y'all finished?\n Wait, don't you think this should be over there?\n That's right, they get to, you have your perspective and they're bringing theirs to it. And they had, what could have been the hardest part, or the easiest part. Okay, I wanna pick up on one thing that you guys said, because one of the things that you had, when you came here, and the group was already, had already laid all this out, was that they felt strongly that the mouth needed to be here. So why?\n Because food goes in there.\n  Paging Mrs. Dalton, Dalton come in.\n I'm sorry, hold on. Try it again.\n Like if you're eating something like a hamburger or you're drinking water, it's gonna go straight to your mouth, and then, it goes in there.\n So in the order that we've established here, do you see what they did? Do you agree with that?\n Yeah.\n Is it logical?\n Yeah.\n OK, is there anything else that you placed, that you recognize was changed? And you wanna know why it was changed. Or you went, \"Oh!\" Because I did hear a lot of, \"Oh, we didn't think of that,\" when you were watching these things go up.\n Like at first, I thought that that should go before that.\n Don't know \"that,\" I don't know what \"that\" is.\n Um, the glucose, water, and food.\n Okay, this column of...\n Yes, I thought that that should go before the mouth, because, I was like, \"But don't you put it in, \"don't you put the food in your mouth?\" And they were like, \"Yeah, but once it enters your body, \"it's not first in the...\"\n Okay, using that logic, is there anything else that should be adjusted? Blair?\n Uh, where the nose is?\n Okay, what do you think we should do with that?\n You should put the nose right before the mouth, or after, because it's like, you kinda smelled it before you put it in your mouth.\n So would this be logical if I moved this over and put this here, like he suggested.\n Yes.\n I want to disagree.\n You disagree, you're welcome to.\n Smelling it, is not a part of digesting it, at all.\n Yeah, that's what I said.\n Is growling a part of digesting it?\n No.\n It's the way your body reacts to the smell.\n If we use your logic, I'm not saying, remember, the way we work things in here is that you can't judge if it's right or wrong, you can certainly disagree with it, that's true. I may disagree, but this is your work, this is not for me to, this is what you're thinking. So, but, using the logic you used, growling, light-headed and dryness in mouth is not a part of digestion, but what do these things have in common? I saw someone, what do these things here have in common?\n They're symptoms of hunger.\n OK, so you're calling them symptoms of hunger? What else might they be?\n Indicators?\n Indicators? Is there another word?\n Signals.\n Signals.  If you have stomach growling, you feel light-headed, you have a dryness in your mouth, that's a signal, right? And where does the nose fit in to that? And I'll come back to you. You have an answer for my question with the nose? Or you have something else to add?\n Like the nose, the nose indicates that you're allowed to put food in your mouth and so you prepare with the saliva so you can help break it down.\n So the nose, so if you can't smell...\n It's like, when you have a cold, you can't really taste things.\n Okay, but does the saliva not flow? Because you can't smell? Because you said, you need to smell to be able to get the saliva to break it down. So if you can't smell, if you have a stuffy nose, or if you don't have a sense of smell, does that stop the saliva?\n No.\n No, she said, \"I don't know.\" And that's an okay answer. She doesn't know. You could have an opinion.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 825 SCI EA 825 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.146542], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["laughing"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Loudspeaker"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW08", "TW13", "TW17", "TW22", "TW23", "TW24"]}, "297": {"text": " Stationary point.  Did he move? Okay, some of the other groups are moving their fingers around, sometimes they were releasing from up here and up here, so do you think your data might be a little more realistic?\n Yeah.\n Yeah, okay so, now one thing, what type of formation do you guys have? \n Good. Put an adjective in front of it.\n Extremely strong.\n Strong. A strong positive. Do you think every correlation around here is gonna be the same?\n No.\n No.\n Okay, so yours is probably going to be one of the strongest ones. Remember that correlation coefficient?\n R, it went from positive one to negative one or zero?\n Oh yeah.\n What do you think yours would be close to?\n One.\n It'd be really close to-- Then we'll get to that shortly guys, later on. Okay?\n So you probably would have one that's a decimal 999 or really close.\n Okay, so you're trying to find your slope?\n Yeah.\n So what is your slope?\n Two.\n Two, okay, so over here we're gonna put-- And now, does everyone have the exact same?\n You do?\n Pretty much.\n Oh, most groups who are four people are slightly off depending on where you put the line. Okay, here's the slope. So you just told me your slope is two, now what am I asking you to do? What is your-- \n No, we're not done yet. What is your--\n It's 2.0.\n Read the question. \n Okay, what's the slope of the equation? The slope is-- What did you just tell me?\n Oh, two.\n Two.  Okay now, what's the real-world meaning of that? What does that mean when you say yes, those are two.\n Okay now, we can go back to that, I just want to talk to you about the solution. Just on your slope, you said it was two. That was perfect. But now, what's the real-world meaning?\n So the slope is the more rubber band...\n What are you looking at? \n So it's one and two...\n One. \n Why can't it?\n So you want to put five? Okay. Ten over. Okay, so now you're telling me your slope is, ten over one.  Okay, well I'm asking you what's your slope. Now you're saying your slope is 10. That's what the slope is but I want the real-world meaning. So what were you saying?\n For every one rubber band that drops...\n How do you know? How do you know-- But where are you getting... I need a little more detail though. It's dropping what? So, 10 centimeters for every?\n One.\n One rubber band. Okay. Now, what's your y-intercept?\n Seven.\n Seven. Now is your y-intercept directions to get somewhere else or is it telling the exact location? What's the y-intercept? Because a slope, isn't that directions to get somewhere else? What's the y-intercept? I want the entire-- It's zero seven. So can you write zero seven down please? Write zero seven down. And now, tell me what the real-- When I ask you what the y-intercept is, yes, zero seven. Now what's the real-world meaning.\n ...subtract out of seven...\n So what's this saying? Translate that for me. You're saying there's no real-world meaning, what's that saying? \n So, before we put any rubber bands on, this already moves seven centimeters. What does that mean? Going into this lab, did I know if the real-world meaning was gonna make sense or not. There's been a few groups today their y-intercept has a real-world meaning\n zero zero. But did I know where your line was gonna go? No. But if it went straight through zero would that make sense? Zero rubber band? So--\n So what's the real-world meaning?\n Well, what do you think? This y-intercept that you had, does it have a real-world meaning? No. So yeah, it doesn't have a real-world meaning. What slope did it? Okay. Once again, did I know that coming in? Depended on your data. Good job. \n Guys, you're asking If you plug into this, four times three, that's 12.\n But yeah. Three, two and four. I think it says three. Okay? So what's your equation...  Y equals 3x plus 12? Okay so let's talk about that.\n No, no it's one, intercept the y... \n It really doesn't play out with that algorithm.\n It makes no absolute sense whatsoever. \n Yeah but you find air.\n Oh that makes sense.\n But this...\n What are we talking about?\n We got one anyway, but really that's it.\n Wait one second, backtrack for one second. So, what did you say here?\n Five-thirds.\n What is a five-thirds?  5/3. Okay, so what's the real-world meaning?\n Every five inches there is three rubber band.\n Okay. So now does the ball go on a rubber band? So flip that around so you're saying two rubber bands, the figure is going--\n Yes.\n Okay, does that have real-world meaning? Does that have real-world meaning?\n Yeah.\n Yeah. Okay, Now you're saying what, your y-intercept is-- can I see your graph paper for a second?\n Yeah.\n Okay. So yeah, it looks like it's around-- Does everybody have the same?\n No.\n Do you think everyone's gonna get the exact same line?\n We didn't really have an intercept slope, we just looked at... \n We just...\n Yeah, which sounds great because you're all gonna draw that line slightly different, so go with one then.\n What does that y-intercept-- Is that directions or is that a location? It's a location, isn't it? So can you write the exact location? Because you're only counting one. What's the order of pairs here? You have a pair of zero one, so write that down.\n Pair of zero ones. You have a pair of zero ones.\n Yeah.\n What's zero represent?\n Zero rubber bands.\n Zero rubber bands. So when zero rubber bands were attached, how far did that--\n One.\n One inch. Does that make sense to you? So when there's zero rubber bands attached, you figure out one inch? Alright, let's demonstrate that. Let's see. Can I see that for one sec please? Okay, let's go back to before we started. Zero rubber bands attached, what's happening. Okay, what's happening right now. Zero rubber bands-- Did he already move one inch?\n No.\n So, Does the y-intercept come in?\n No.\n No.\n You said... \n Because you just told me it was five inches of three. Yeah. What are we discussing now? The data, or the equation for the... Okay? Now so, does this y-intercept make sense?\n No.\n Zero rubber bands are removed. So does the y-intercept have real-world meaning?\n No.\n Does the slope have real-world meaning?\n Yeah.\n Did I know your y-intercept wasn't gonna have real-world meaning?\n Yes.\n No, because there's some people today that actually have real-world meaning. What would be a y-intercept if it made sense?\n Zero zero.\n Zero zero. Zero rubber bands equals--\n Zero inches.\n Zero inches.\n What were you saying your slope was? So let's discuss three. The slope is three, what's the real-world meaning?\n How many rubber bands would you need in your description?\n Grabbing one rubber band, does that make sense? Okay, now, so now what anout your y-intercept would be at 12. Now you gotta figure... Let's discuss this right here.  Now, I think you're thinking ahead. But this line looks like it's crossing up here to-- Where is it crossing? It's crossing at-- We're going up three, look, three, six, seven. Yeah I was looking like around four. So let's discuss this. You have six? That could be perfect, but we know the exact way a line likes to go. Let's go with Monique, six. What's that saying? Let's go to a pair, to the y-intercept. Zero pair, zero six. So what does that mean? So write that down, zero pair, zero six for the y-intercept. And what's that actually mean?\n Zero rubber bands in front of the six equals how many inches.\n So, this was the figure. Zero rubber bands attached, does that make it already move six inches? Does that make any sense at all? So does the y-intercept have real-world meaning? Could it still have real-world meaning? You were thinking ahead I think, when you drew your line. Because what's the only y-intercept that makes sense here? Zero rubber bands--\n 81 inches.\n But you didn't move. But does that mean you can decide I want to make real-world meaning and just draw my line down the zero? Because what am I looking for? The equation for the line of-- Is yours the equation for the line now? Your y-intercept makes sense, If you knew the equation for the y-intercept.\n You plug in 81 inches for X right?\n Did you end up with a negative?  \n You're fine. You what? \n Minus what? Oh, minus one. I wanna discuss it. If you're y-intercept is... What's the order of pairs...? Zero, negative one, so what's the real-world meaning?   What's that mean? What's the zero represent?  Okay, so zero rubber bands, what's your y-interception? At zero rubber bands, how far does it go now?\n Negative one\n Did he already go one, or did he reach it? So does that make sense? Zero rubber bands and he's already traveled one? Does that make any sense? So does the y-intercept? Does that mean your y-intercept just didn't end up happening?\n Yeah.\n When you know how to use this it works,  With zero rubber bands, how fast are you going? Zero? Zero. Okay, does that mean your data's all wrong? No, that's the way your numbers work. Could you slope this out instead three? What's that mean? Three, three what? Four is still, Five is... So three... Three what? Let's go and do number five. Distance, so what would your distance be? Inches. So it's like three inches is over one-- So that makes sense. So, does your slope have real-world meaning?\n Yeah.

We have done one thing, well, we have done several things, all year, on that first slide, which you copied onto your board. What is it?\n The moon phases.\n The moon phases. You do the moon phases every day. So, you should be pretty familiar with moon phases, what they are, how they happen, all that good stuff. We get to move on. Okay. Let\u2019s start with something you do know. What is a moon phase? Tom.\n It\u2019s what, well, it\u2019s technically, when you look up in the sky, and, like, what light you see in the moon.\n Good. What light you see in the moon. Where does the light come from? The green she\u2019s reflecting.\n The sun?\n The sun. How does that work?\n The sun shines on the moon and reflects back.\n Good, the sun shines on the moon and reflects back. So, that\u2019s how we see the moon. Do you agree with that? I see most of you agree. Good. Okay. Then, if we know that it comes from the sun, why don\u2019t you tell me some of the moon phases, so we can build on what you just told me. What are some of the moon phases? This one should be easy.\n Waxing crescent.\n Waxing crescent, excellent. Aisha?\n Waxing gibbous.\n Waxing gibbous, very good. Grillen?\n Waning crescent.\n Waning crescent. Bailey?\n Full moon.\n Full moon. Tom?\n Waning gibbous.\n Waning gibbous. Ramos?\n 1st quarter.\n 1st quarter, excellent.\n New moon.\n New moon, excellent.\n Last quarter.\n Last quarter.\n Third quarter.\n Third quarter and last quarter, very good. When we talked in the last class, some of you said, \u201cSecond quarter!\u201d Then, the second quarter is half time, so, that would be what moon phase?  What\u2019s halfway in between first and third?  What moon phase is that? \n Full moon?\n Yay, full moon, yay!  Yeah, just start spouting everything out, and then, eventually, you\u2019ll be right. That works for me. Yeah, it\u2019s a full moon. Get it, half, full? Or not, okay. So, we have all these moon phases. How can you tell which one\u2019s which? Why don\u2019t you just look up and say, \u201cYay, it\u2019s a fingernail!\u201d How do you tell which one\u2019s which?\n Because different moon phases look different.\n How does it look different?\n Because--\n It\u2019s okay.\n Because different parts of the moon have light on it, in different amounts.\n Okay, different parts of the moon have different amounts of light on it. How would I be able to tell a waxing something from a waning something?  You\u2019re almost, almost there. Yeah?  \n I think you will because the moon has different kinds of faces.\n Good, very good. Different kinds of faces.\n One lights up on the left side and the other lights up on the right side.\n Which one lights up on the right side?\n The waxing.\n How do you know that?\n Because, um... Well, you always told us it\u2019s light on the right, it\u2019s wax-iting.\n Yeah, it\u2019s light on the right, it\u2019s wax-iting! Or, what you guys like to do...\n Wax on, wane off.\n Or, wane off. I don\u2019t know, wax on. Okay? So, I don\u2019t have a problem, I don\u2019t think that you have a problem knowing the different phases of the moon. I think you guys are pretty set on that. How about what causes the phases of the moon? What makes that happen? You\u2019ve already told me light reflecting off the moon that comes from the sun, but, why would you have parts? Why wouldn\u2019t you just be able to see the whole thing, all the time? Sean.\n Because the earth blocks out some of the light that\u2019s coming from the moon.\n Okay, good. Brenda?\n Because the earth rotates with time, and when the earth rotates, the earth blocks the sun, so you can see, maybe, at the top of the moon.\n Okay, good. Tom?\n There are other stars shining in different directions, not just the sun.\n Okay, very good. Stars shining at different directions. Anything else? Nancy.\n Because the moon is moving, and so \n Okay, as the moon moves, we see different phases. So, I hear a lot of that the earth blocks the moon, the sun from reaching the moon. Are you in agreeance?\n Yeah.\n A little bit.\n Yeah, yeah, somewhat? Okay. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna do. You have won the experiment. You\u2019ve done the flip camera. But, what I want you to do, on your table, everybody has, like a big lollipop. You either have the blue styrofoam ball, you have the big, white styrofoam ball, you have a little styrofoam ball. I want you, each person in your group to have one of those styrofoam balls. Okay? And then, you are going to come this way--\n Down in your light paths?\n You are gonna come up front, and gather around my lovely light bulb. Okay? Come forth, children.  And you might wanna squat down, if you\u2019re near the front. Yay! I know it\u2019s bright. Good?\n Can\u2019t see.\n Oh, you can\u2019t see, okay, alright. Oh,  Okay, what I want you to do, and you\u2019re already doing it, hold it out in front of you, I want you to look at your moon. What am I holding in my left hand?\n The sun.\n The light bulb, the sun. You have the moon, yay. Here, hold it out in front of you. What moon phase do you have on your moon? Aisha?\n New moon.\n New moon. Why is it a new moon?\n Because you can\u2019t see any light.\n You can\u2019t see any light. I can see lots of light. It\u2019s blinding me. Oh, there we go. But, there\u2019s a light source. Isn\u2019t my moon illuminated? Becky?\n It\u2019s illuminated on one side, but since you\u2019re behind it, you don\u2019t see any of the light coming--\n Well, then, how do I know it\u2019s illuminated?\n Because you can see other light?\n Oh! So, I look across from me, and I see Sean. Sean, you have a full moon.  Now, you\u2019re supposed to disagree with me, and tell me that no, you don\u2019t.\n Oh, okay. Um...\n What moon do you have?\n A new moon.\n No, you don\u2019t, you have a full moon. \n He has a waxing moon.\n No, he doesn\u2019t, he has a full moon.  You all are crazy. Look.  It\u2019s illuminated on the other side.  Okay. Oh, yeah, you could do that. But then, wouldn\u2019t your head be in line with the earth?  It doesn\u2019t make any sense.  But, that is one way that we can figure out that the moon is illuminated. Not that we have 15 different moons, or 28, or however many people we have. But, just because we\u2019re looking at a new moon, doesn\u2019t mean that the moon\u2019s not illuminated, it\u2019s just the other side. So, I look across, and I can see full moon across from me. What else can you see, from where you\u2019re standing? Tell me what you see and where you see it. Yes.\n Over there, with Zack and Sarah, I see fullmoon.\n Okay, good.\n Over there, I see a waning gibbous.\n Really? I see a waxing gibbous. Uh, Becky.\n I see a full moon, over at Zack.\n Nice.\n I see a waxing gibbous with Charlese.\n I see a full moon.\n Well, I see a waxing gibbous.\n Why? Why do you see a waxing gibbous, and I see a full moon?\n Because we\u2019re in different places.\n What\u2019s that got to do with anything?  I thought y'all told me that we saw moon phases because the Earth's shadow blocks the sunlight from reaching the moon. How can we see moon phases then? Tiffany? Ooo... Kaitlyn?\n Line of sight.\n Line of sight? What does that mean?\n Um...\n Besides, your sight in a line. \n It's, um, well... Because sunlight's here, it looks like a new moon, but if the sunlight were, like over there, it wouldn't.\n Huh? Interesting. Brooke.\n Well, I'm just suspecting that Lauren turns kind of the moon out of view then, like I couldn't see a shadow I could only see the new moon.\n Oh, because, oh, well, oh Lauren's head is in the way. \n Look at if the Earth was in the way that.\n If the Earth was in the way, would that cause a moon phase?\n Yeah.\n Is the Earth in the way of the moon all the time?\n No.\n What could we call... Sorry.  What do we call it when we have the Earth and the moon and the sun lined up, or if the moon is blocking light from getting to the Earth, or if the Earth is blocking light from getting to the moon?  Bailey?\n An eclipse.\n An eclipse. Have we talked about an eclipse before?  A little bit. Just a little bit. So, is there anything in between me, well, is there anything between the moon and the sun? In my...\n No.\n No. vicinty, because if I ask you, you're gonna be like, \"Yeah, Lauren's head is in the way.\"  \"She's blocking all the light.\"  There's nothing in between me and the light source, yet all around you're saying you see different moon phases. Correct?\n Mmm hmm.\n Mmm hmm. I want you to think about that. Why you can see different phases on my styrofoam ball, but there's nothing in between us.\n Because the moon and the earth is at a different angle.\n Ooh. 'Cause the earth is at a different angle.\n Because of our position?\n Your positions. Very interesting. Here's what I'm willing to have you do. You all have a light bulb, some work, some don't I know there was at least one group in the last class that blew a light bulb.  So, you might have to share, but I'm gonna have you go back to your seats. Some of you have three people. Some of you have four people. Some of you have two. Daniel, you have three now. I want you to set yourselves up in an arrangement around your light bulb, where you personally can see four different moon phases, or three different moon phases, depending on how many people are in your group. So, you need to be able to see, if there are four of you, four different moon phases. You stand there. You hold it, and if you get it, raise your hand for me now.  Okay, that was your challenge. You don't have to fill anything. You don't have to do anything. Off you go. \n Try not to blow it.\n Alright, move Michael.\n Where do you think it's gonna be?\n Put it like this. Okay.\n It doesn't have a switch. It's just automatically on and off.\n Yay, we made it.\n Nice. \n Are we getting there?\n Okay.\n Okay, since you have four people, you're going to position yourselves differently than they are. They only have three. So, you're gonna think, think about a clock. Where on the clock will you put everybody, so you can all see four different moon phases, from your angle.\n Well, one can go at twelve.\n Twelve, twelve, six, and nine and three.\n Like a cross.\n Do it.\n I don't think we can put anybody over there.\n And then, tell me when you get it.\n We can't put anybody over there. So, that'll be like twelve, this'll be like...\n Well, we need a camera for it.\n Right there, we're not using a camera.\n Okay.\n Well, now...\n So Brenda can stand there, Brooke can..\n Or, we can do, like, um, like, this kinda way. I'll be here. she'll be there, and she'll be there, and you'll be at the corner.\n Yeah.\n Okay.  So, take your moon.\n It won't move until you stand there and hold it.\n No, I see yours. New moon.   \n No, it looks like a waxing.\n Excellent, ladies and gentlemen, I have a group who has it. Ooo, it looks like I have another group who has it. Ooo I have another group who has it. Somebody tell me, If you equate it to a clock, where are you standing? Tell me what numbers you're standing on, Jamie.\n Uh, oh...\n Oh. Forget about that?  For one moment, we had it.\n She's on number one. She's sitting at four.\n On a clock.\n She's nine. She's three, and six and twelve.\n Good. So, one of the ways you can do it is, twelve, three, six, nine. You can do it that way. Or, you could actually scoot yourselves a little differently, you could rearrange yourselves and see something besides... What are you moon phases that you have?\n Um, that's waxing gibbous\n Waxing gibbous There's full moon, new moon, and this looks like...\n I see full. I see new, and then if you're at nine and three, I should only be able to see  half. What would those things be?\n Mmm...\n Go ahead.\n First and third quarter.\n Good, first and third quarter. I want you guys to see if you can figure out different arrangements to make it--\n Okay.\n Something besides those four. And, you got it too.\n Okay, we could...\n Get a...\n And then someone could be... Could be right there, and right there. \n Yeah. \n I see a full moon, I see a full moon.\n I just see a full moon. Because your the light source.\n I see a full moon, and a...\n I see a full moon.\n I just see a full moon.\n Do you see a half moon here?\n I see a full moon.\n Well... \n Now, do you wanna switch out?\n Okay, I'll take it.\n Okay, it's blinding.\n Ooo, yay. Oh, yeah. I see a new moon, and I like see a...\n Everybody got it at least once. \n Yep.\n Yep. Okay, do me a favor, unplug your light bulb, and come back to your group. \n Okay. Was there anything in between you, well, actually, your moon and your sun? \n No.\n No. So, does your theory or your hypothesis that the Earth blocks the light from reaching the moon still work?\n No.\n Carolyn says no. Tom.\n Technically it can work, because when you have a, I forgot what kinda eclipse it's called, but it's an eclipse of the moon it goes, like, all red or something, we had it this year, and the Arth, Earth, arth... The Earth is blocking it in a way worse.\n Okay, so is that going to change the phase of the moon, nightly? Becky.\n No.\n She says no. Do you agree? So what changes the phase of the moon? Ben?\n The way we see it from Earth.\n The way we see it from Earth. Agree?\n Yes.\n Ah, interesting. Now, when you did the experiment before, when you did it with a flip camera, we're gonna re-watch some of those videos. I'm just gonna do the montage, so it's not necessarily gonna be your entire class, but we're gonna go through, and you need to critique each one. You need to figure out do they do something wrong? Do they do something correct? Do you need to do something with that? Do you need to re-think your flip camera video? Because, we're gonna do it again after we get finished with this. Make sense? Are you sure?\n Mmm hmm.\n Are you positive?\n Mmm hmm.\n Let's watch the first one.  Okay. Let me play it for you again. See the phases?\n Yeah. \n Alright, now. I want you to tell me. Besides being blinded. What did they do correct? What was right?\n They were in a orbit not around the sun, just a orbit.\n Excellent, they were not orbiting around the sun, a.k.a. the lightbulb. What did they do incorrect?\n They didn't call out the phases.\n Okay, they didn't call out the phases.\n They didn't orbit, orbit the camera.\n They did. The camera was in the middle. So, it went around. So, that's okay. Think about that. They went around. There's even something wrong...\n", "filename": ["Copy of 826 SCI EA 826 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.0296587], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible", "laughter", "Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["laughter"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible", "Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["laughter"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["laughter"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible", "laughter", "laughter", "Inaudible", "Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["laughter"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["giggling"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["giggling"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["laughter"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["giggling", "tapping"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["laughter"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["coughing"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["giggling"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW06s", "TW13", "TW16", "TW18"]}, "1380": {"text": "  How you guys doing?\n So .3.\n Oh, what did you do by touching those?\n It made a short circuit.\n It crossed.\n Wow, the orange is a lot less than the kiwi and the apple.\n Yeah.\n It's only .3.\n Why do you think that is?\n .03.\n Maybe because...\n It's like different rods or something.\n Oranges are more sour than the other fruit. Not, and like have more acid or something. Because it stops the energy.\n We want it a half centimeter apart right?\n Yeah. Two centimeters. Around.\n So okay, go ahead. Make sure they aren't touching.\n 0.1.\n It's not even measuring at all. Oh, 0.1. 0.01.\n Oh .01.\n That's crazy.\n I know. How this supposed to be one, the other two were so high?\n 0.98.\n I never thought fruits and vegetables could have so much energy. Except for oranges. I thought this would have as much as the apple.\n My hypothesis, I actually thought that the orange would have the most.\n Go ahead. Alright, Lizzy you can do the voltage reader. Stick them in a half centimeter apart. And a centimeter in. Okay, Lizzy make sure they don't touch.\n Don't short circuit them.\n It's like completely zero. \n The bigger it is, the more volts it has.\n The middle one, it left like a little here and this was the most.\n I think it's more concentrating volts in the middle more than anywhere else.\n Hmm, I wonder why that would be.\n Okay, so now we have to get a calculator. Okay, so 0.22. Plus 0.09.\n Plus 0.28.\n I got 0.1966667.\n So what are you gonna do with that number?\n Round it up.\n Okay. 0.20. But wait, doesn't someone else need to try it?\n Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a good idea. 0.22, plus--\n 0., oh never mind.\n Divided by three. I got the same answer.\n So what was the answer to the investigative question? What do you think?\n The...\n The apple, had the most.\n Do you agree with that?\n Yes.\n Why do you think that is? Do you have any guesses?\n It's...\n It's bigger. It could carry more volts.\n It has, yeah--\n It has like more juice.\n Yeah, that's true.\n I think the juice.\n Was your hypothesis correct?\n Actually, it was. Like right here, well. Well, actually I said the potatoes will have the most voltage because like usually they, potatoes for like cloth and other things to energize with, but I guess apples would work better.\n What was yours?\n I thought the, I thought the carrots would produce more because you know, usually when you like eat one it's like very wet, wet when you just get them, so I thought the carrot was going to win, but guess not.\n I thought it was the apple. I already said that.\n My hypothesis, I thought, I think the potato would have the most because I heard like, I've heard that potatoes could produce a lot of energy, and last year when when they were doing a science experiment they said that they had potatoes for like volts. So I suspected that they may have been, have a lot of voltage also.\n Okay.\n To our investigative question, our question was which fruit will produce the most energy?\n And the...\n Kiwi.\n Kiwi and apple had tied for it.\n 0.98.\n So I don't know, maybe like some other time we should do another experiment and see if we get the same results.\n I wonder why the orange was so low though.\n Maybe because we, since we put it too deep or something.\n No, we did the same thing, we put all of them.\n Yeah, I know.\n Well.\n So then our, so our answer was that the kiwi and the apple both had the highest.\n So how about your hypothesis?\n I thought orange would have it. I thought orange would have it.\n I thought orange had it too.\n And had the highest.\n Why?\n Because it had like...\n I thought the apple would because we didn't, I thought the apple was because of how much bigger it was.\n How about you Kirsten what did you think?\n I thought the orange because it has more citrus in it, I mean yeah.\n I would have thought kiwi would have less because it's so small.\n Yeah, me too.\n That's what I thought.\n Then what was our evidence?\n Apple had for an average, had 0.98. Orange had 0.16. And then kiwi had 0.06. 0.16. And then kiwi had 0.98. So kiwi and apple tied.\n And then our evidence is our data table because that's where we recorded everything.\n Yep.\n So then how can you be sure that you conducted a fair investigation?\n We did them the same length apart and...\n So what are you guys trying to figure out over here?\n We're, we're trying to figure out what if the apple, carrot or potato has enough voltage to light the food battery.\n What is the food representing in this case?\n A battery.\n Okay.\n Yeah.\n Okay, how you gonna figure that out? What is your plan?\n We are gonna do, gonna try to do a voltage reader and put, try to see how much voltage there is in an apple, potato or a carrot.\n I think we should use the apple because in our investigation it had the most voltage, well like the apple, but should we do a parallel battery or the something that starts with an S battery?\n Series.\n Series, let's do series.\n Let's try series.\n It lights up more.\n Yeah, it's brighter.\n Okay, let's get it done. Oh wait, we're gonna need more.\n There's a wire in here.\n So I think that the apple will like light up the battery brighter. Or at all because it has, I think it's gonna have the most, it has the most voltage and so it'll make it become brighter.\n Which do you?\n Oh wait, we're doing a series battery so...\n Maybe we--\n Where's the other apple?\n It's over there, Reece has it.\n Need to wrap it around tight.\n Can I check?\n Jayden, do you wanna do it?\n Sure. I'll have the honors.\n Keep this one untouched because I'm gonna wrap this wire against that because it needs to, this negative. Just the white one.\n Okay, there is no wire in this.\n Okay, so--\n I think we have enough wires here.\n What do you need the wires for?\n To wrap around, to make a series.\n To allow the energy to flow through.\n Okay, so what's the purpose of the wires?\n So that the energy will be able to flow.\n What is the energy that's going through the wires?\n Electricity.\n But okay, so what is the function of the wires?\n To like be able to pass from one spot to like, the battery to the light.\n Okay, so you have two different wires. Why is that?\n To be able to...\n You know, why you have two different wires?\n Um, no.\n No. I'm gonna give you a minute to think about it.\n Okay.\n Is it working?\n No, not yet. Well, I don't think it's working.\n I think I didn't--\n Oh, it's going.\n No, I don't think I  wrapped the wire around right.\n Oh, yeah, because the--\n This is really short.\n So yeah, it was tucking it.\n Let's see that and that and that. Yeah, that thing's wrapped up tight.\n Well, if the volts are enough.\n Don't the apples have to be touching?\n No, they don't have to be touching. They just have to be, the wires just have to go from positive to negative.\n Yeah.\n True.\n But if they don't have enough voltage, we should use a potato.\n Yeah, we can put the potato to help.\n Yeah, we need to put them in every fruit. And then connect the wires like that to that, that to that.\n So, make sure they don't touch.\n Yeah, so kinda wrap it around with the wire. Yeah, try to wrap it around as tight as you can so that...\n Do you, what do you guys think, do you think that fruit could power our school?\n I don't think so.\n It might power a small light bulb like the ones that we use in here, but--\n You don't think there's enough voltage to supply our whole school?\n No.\n Well, like maybe if we put like a bunch of fruit on the roof or something. I don't know how that would turn out, but maybe if we put a whole bunch and like stacked it on top.\n Would you think that would be economical? You think that would be beneficial to us in any way?\n Maybe.\n Why?\n It could, but we'd have to keep changing out the fruit, and changing out the fruit.\n It'd be lots more work that's for sure. Don't let them touch.\n That connects to that and that.\n Do we have another one? Because this one is broken.\n Can we borrow one from over here?\n Oh, we have one. There you go.\n What do you think is gonna happen?\n I think it'll like, because we have none of the same touching.\n First we should check the voltage.\n Well I don't, we'll just see if it lights the light.\n No, don't connect those.\n Why would you wanna check the voltage?\n Just to see if it has enough potential of battery.\n Would make more electricity. All the averages.\n I think it should be good this way.\n Because we tested a battery and saw how much it was.\n Connect one to it. Then connect yours Lizzy.\n Maybe, did we do it wrong?\n No, I don't think so.\n Well, I think that maybe it loses potential inside the fruit?\n Maybe it--\n Try an separate those a little more Kirsten.\n Maybe they're both plus and plus.\n Maybe it's because we're using three types of fruit. If we use just two. What if we took the prongs out and replace that with this?\n Okay, try that.\n Put it in a different hole this time because we just changed it.\n Well, don't--\n What are we trying to do here?\n We were trying to make all these the same one.\n Why would you do that?\n Maybe because they need to be the same? From the, both positive and negative.\n Oh.\n And we need to make sure so those could be the plus and minus, doesn't matter which way. And that and that needs to touch, and then that one and that one, which is exactly what we did.

Who's making it?\n The plants. \n Okay, why are they making it?\n So they can live.\n Okay, what's that called? Like what process is that when they make CO2?\n Photosynthesis.\n Photosynthesis makes CO2?\n I guess.\n No.\n Isn't it cellular res-per-tation? Ms. Rutala, isn't it that?\n Respiration. You know how we talked about this? This is photosynthesis, right? Carbon dioxide plus water in the sun is going to make glucose and oxygen, right? For respiration, they're taking that exact same glucose and that oxygen, and they're making three things. They're going to make energy to stay alive. That's why those plants are still living. They're going to make...\n CO2.\n Which is why...\n They're still living.\n Uh huh.  And why there's a high number in there, and they're also going to make...\n H2O, which is water.\n Does that make sense? Do you see now why those numbers are going up for CO2?\n Yeah.\n 'Cause they're going through...\n Photosynthesis.\n No.\n 'Cause their going through the energy.\n CO2.\n Respiration. Respiration is the process. Do you see that?\n Yeah.\n All right, you're welcome. All right, how are we doing here?\n Good.\n You guys are still ready to predict the second part? Okay, how are we doing here?\n We just now got to the back.\n That's okay, you take your time. This is good. Take your time as long as you are understanding. That's the whole point of this. Okay, so move on to this one. What is a new question you have or an experiment you would want to do?\n The snail one.\n Well, what's the snail one? What's a question you have based on what you just did? Are you curious about something? What's a new question or a new experiment you'd want to try?\n How come, well, I just want to know why the snail keeps dying.\n Okay, you can put that down. Why does the snail keep dying? Did it die in every single situaiton though?\n No.\n Everyone we've done so far.\n You might want to think about why, which situations it died in, right? All right, let's see. Put your head up. All right, you guys are still in this one? Test tube C2 has plants and snails, but resulted in an unstable environment, why? I thought plants and snails helped each other live. Why did they die?\n Because they didn't have that much, what's it called, oxygen.\n Well, when they started the test tube it was at six and six. All of them start at six, six, right? So look at test tube C2. To plants, two snails. The lights are...\n Off.\n The O2 level at the end of the experiment is?\n 12, oh, oh.\n It's at what?\n Zero point --\n Zero point zero, which means there is no oxygen, so does that make sense as to why one of these died?\n The snail was the one. The snails died.\n Uh huh, and then the CO2 level is at?\n 12.\n 12, did the plants die?\n No.\n Why didn't they die but the snails died?\n Because the snails gave off their CO2?\n Um hmm And why did that keep the plants alive?\n Because they take in CO2?\n Uh huh, okay.\n But it somehow they didn't give off O2, I guess?\n Why is that somehow? Why weren't they able to give off O2?\n Because the lights weren't on?\n Uh huh, and why are the lights so important?\n To produce photosynthesis?\n Yes, they need light for photosynthesis. Remember, this is like a recipe, right? You have to have all three ingredients to make photosynthesis work. You have to have carbon dioxide, you have to have water, and you have to have sunlight. You can't just have one of the three. You can't have two of the three. You have to have all three. Do you see why that works? Okay, good.\n Um hmm.\n Okay, good. All right, how are we doing here?\n We're passing. Let me ask you --\n Yeah? I did not --\n She was in the bathroom.\n I went to go blow my nose.\n All right, let's go ahead and work over here. So let's go ahead and catchup ourselves here. What is one new question you have or experiment you would preform? So based on what you've already done is there something you are curious about? I just gave you free reign. Go ahead, do whatever you want. Do you have any questions about anything?\n Yeah, E.\n Stay here.\n Yeah, I'll stay here while you write it down.\n Why do they have to close it up? Close the test tubes up?\n Okay, so would you be curious about doing the experiment without closing it? That's a good question. What was your question?\n Every four plants and four snails. Would they survive with the lights on or off?\n What do you think?\n I think with the lights off because if they have four plants, they will have, I mean, if they had it on, they'll produce a lot of oxygen, therefore, the snails would die, but if you put it off, maybe they'll produce the right amount of oxygen.\n They'll produce a lot of oxygen, the snails will die?\n Well, it's kind of complicated.\n No, I want to try it out. You're saying that you think that --\n Because it's too much oxygen.\n Too much oxygen?\n In this one container, maybe?\n Well, who would benefit from all that oxygen?\n The snails.\n Okay.  So we know the snails would stay alive 'cause they would have what?\n Oxygen.\n Okay, what about the plants? Do you think the plants are going to stay alive?\n Nope.\n Why?\n Because they don't have carbon dioxide, maybe. \n How's the situation so far?\n Good.\n I think it's bad.\n Probably it won't survive because --\n So, in the light it's okay. It's balanced. One's giving, the other one's getting. You got that, all right? So what do you think is going to happen at night?\n They're going to die, probably.\n Who's going to die?\n The snails.\n Why do you think the snails are going to die?\n I don't know.\n Because it's going to be too much CO2.\n Too much CO2? Why is there going to be too much CO2?\n Because the snails can't get O2 'cause there's no light.\n Exactly. Go ahead and hit play.\n Whoa, whoa.  Too much CO2.\n Did that CO2, what did you notice about it?\n And the plants died.\n There was no oxygen.\n There was no oxygen, but why did the plants die? Plants don't need oxygen. Plants need CO2.\n There was too much?\n They couldn't give off --\n It already was at the max?\n Reached it's max. Here's my question. Are the snails the only ones making CO2? Who else is making CO2?\n The plants?\n Do plants make CO2 at night? How could you design a little experiment to test that? What can you do to design an experiment right now to test that?\n Take all the snails out.\n Okay, and what? \n Okay, let's see. We want to see if plants will go through respiration at night. \n We're looking for the CO2 only?\n What is that?\n A rock.  Okay, so look at your data so far. What do you notice?\n They're producing a lot of oxygen.\n I'm following.\n Okay, so isn't that weird? I thought plants made oxygen.\n I mean, they're producing a lot of carbon dioxide.\n They are? Why are they producing carbon dioxide? I thought plants made oxygen.\n Wasn't it through respiration?\n Okay, so they can't get sunlight, so they're not going through...\n Photosynthesis.\n Photosynthesis, but they are going through...\n Respiration.\n Respiration, so remember, our respiration, right? They don't have sunlight. Does respiration need sunlight to work?\n No, it needs energy.\n Nope, it doesn't. So all they need is what?\n CO2.\n No, what does this stand for?\n Glucose.\n Right, so they need glucose and?\n Oxygen.\n Was there oxygen in there before we started.\n No.\n There wasn't?\n Oh, wait, yes.\n There was, look.\n It's even.\n There was oxygen in there. There was six cpms of oxygen, so then it went through this process, and it made energy, which kept them alive, it made CO2, which you saw because the CO2 levels went...\n Up.\n Up.\n And it also made...\n Water.\n H2O.\n Which you can't really tell.\n It turned yellow.\n And it's probably still inside the cells. Does that make sense though? Okay, good. All right, how are we doing here?  Are we almost done, you guys? Are you getting, you're understanding?\n A little.\n Okay, well, let me ask you something. Do plants go through respiration?\n Uh, yes.\n How do you know?\n 'Cause they're color. It change colors.\n The plants change colors?\n No, the water.\n To what color?\n Dark blue.\n A dark blue?\n Like a darker blue.\n What does dark blue represent? Let's go back to the beginning part. What does dark blue tell you? Dark blue means that there's what? Low, dark blue means that there's low what? \n Okay, and you're telling me that respiration, sorry, that respiration. Plants go through respiration, right?\n Uh huh.\n So would there be a low amount of CO2, if it goes through respiration?\n No, no. It will be...\n Uh huh, so should it be blue?\n Yes, no, no, no, no. It'd be yellow.\n Uh huh, what kind of experiment did you do to show me that plants go through respiration? Tia, plants go through respiration.\n If you cut the lights on and cut the lights off, and if you cut the lights on, then the water turns blue because it's giving off oxygen. Cut the lights off, they won't go through respiration because they --\n They won't go through respiration?\n No, only photosynthesis because there will be no light for them.\n Stop, give me my paper.\n Okay, Tamara and Kelly O., please stop.\n And I have a question. Do you want us to do for our predictions, do you want us to do why or why not for both of them or just one?\n Even if they're different. Maybe one of your predictions your plants lived, maybe one of your predictions the plants die.\n Both of them lived\n Then you can just, why do you think both of them lived? All right, I have a quick question. Can you guys look over here for a second?  Okay, Tya, over here. William, over here. Okay, how may of you guys, I want a couple people to share their predictions. What helped your, when you had the three plants that died, right? Most of you were surprised. You were like, \"Wow, how did three plants die \"with the lights on? \"They had oxygen, they had a CO2, \"and they died.\" Right, so you were surprised. What was your prediction? What did you set up as an experiment to help them survive? What did you predict? Nacora, give me one.\n I put three plants and one snail.\n Okay, so she said she put three plants, one snail. How many of you guys did three plants and one snail? Or a combination of plants and snails? Okay, why did you do that? Why did you do a combination of plants and snails, William?\n Because the snails will produce the CO2 while the plants would produce the O2.\n Okay, so he said the plants would produce O2, the snails would produce CO2. What's another option? What if I said, \"You know what? \"I'm gonna take all your snails.\"  Good luck keeping those plants alive, Keyon. If I take away all your snails, and I said, \"Haha, \"you have no snails to keep your plants alive.\" Should that be a problem.\n No.\n Okay, tell me why that wouldn't be a problem. Why would that not be a problem, Haley?\n Because all you have to do is put three plants in the dark.\n Okay, how is that going to help you? How is putting three plants in the dark? She said, \"You can just turn off the lights.\" How would that be helpful?\n Because there's more CO2.\n Okay, more CO2. Why is there more CO2?\n I would say you can just put them in the light and the dark 'cause when they're in the light they do photosynthesis, and when they're in the dark, they do respiration.\n Okay, she said, \"In the dark they use photosynthesis, \"and in the dark they do respiration.\" Isaiah?\n Wouldn't you just turn the lights off?\n Okay, we just said we could turn the lights completely off. Here's another question. Do plants go through respiration?\n Yes.\n No. Okay, hold on. If you said no, why are you saying no they don't go through respiration.\n Because only animals go through respiration, and plants go through photosynthesis.\n Okay, Brandon, I want you to set up an experiment for me. Put one plant. Put one plant in your test tube and turn the lights off. Just one plant in the test tube and turn the lights off. How many people know what's going to happen? One plant in a test tube with the lights off? All right.\n Look at that.\n Okay, are the plants alive?\n Yes.\n Is there more oxygen then CO2?\n No.\n What is there more of?\n CO2.\n How is there more CO2 in there? It started at six and six. Why is there more CO2 in there?\n Respiration.\n Because it's not doing photosynthesis.\n Because it's not going through photosynthesis, but that means that our O2 shouldn't go up. Why is the CO2 going up? Why is the CO2 going up?\n Because in the dark the plants breath out CO2.\n Okay what is that process of them breathing out, their getting rid of CO2? What is that process? Kaleil, you kept saying it over and over.\n Respiration.\n All right, respiration. Here's another question. Do plants go through respiration in the day time?\n No.\n Photosynthesis.\n What does respiration give you as an animal? \n ATP, wait. ATP and... I don't want to look, no. And oxygen, no. Carbon dioxide.\n So, respiration gives your carbon dioxide. If you look up here, look. Elise, respiration gives you carbon dioxide, water, and energy, right? Do plants, when they're going through photosynthesis, do they make energy? Do you see energy in the photosynthesis equation?\n No.\n Okay, so how do they stay alive during the day? Do they die during the day and stay alive at night.\n No.\n Do they stay alive during the day and die at night?\n No.\n How do they stay alive the whole day long?\n They use the sun's energy.\n They use the what?\n The sun's energy.\n Okay, and then what do they do with that glucose? It just sits there 'cause glucose isn't energy yet.\n They have to turn into respoiration\n Oh, so do they go through respiration during the day?\n Yes.\n No. They have to or they would die. So they make their energy. They make glucose, but the glucose isn't energy, Isaiah, until they break it down in respiration, so do plants have to go through respiration during the day and night?\n Yes.\n Yes, do you go through respiration day and night.\n Yes.\n No. You don't?\n No. Do you die at night every time you go to sleep?\n That would be creepy.\n You reproduce every time you go at night?\n No, what?\n No, you stay alive all day long.  You stay alive all day long, Tamara. Plants stay alive all day long because they go through respiration. This is the key. Respiration. The key, Nikera, to getting the glucose for respiration is in...\n Photosynthesis.\n Photosynthesis. This is what keeps everything alive, but to get some of the ingredients for this, you need to go through this. Do you see why now we depend on each other? Ah, yes. Okay, understanding.\n So, we don't go through photosynthesis, just plants do, but plants go through both.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 293 SCI EA 293 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.278696], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["gasps"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["laughter"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["gasp"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["hushing"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW05", "TW06", "TW09s", "TW16", "TW22", "TW23", "TW24"]}, "1382": {"text": " About 33.\n 33, so 150 plus 33?\n 180.\n What'd you get?\n 180.\n 180, so is that... Did we double?\n Went a little higher.\n Went a little higher. So you guys made a good prediction, didn't you? All right, keep doing your trials, nice work. Heads up, Madison. Heads up. Ah!\n Can you stop it?\n No, you're good. All right, so what have you guys found out so far?\n We've been increasing, but then we just... It increased a little, but I think we're gonna increase a little more.\n Okay, so you're measuring... You've all, you've raised your ramp to 10?\n Yes.\n All right. \n All right. Now, what was your prediction? It would go farther based on height?\n Because, like, from all the other experiments that we've done...\n Uh-huh.\n It's gone farther, so... And it has more force if the ramp is higher.\n Okay. Man, that ambulance, that thing moves. All right, what did you guys get, Mary Robin, when you measured?\n We got 179.\n 179, okay.\n What was weird is that... Like, what's weird is that on the first trial, we got 130, and then we went to, like, the, like 50s and things.\n Okay.\n And then we went back to like the 80s and 90s.\n Yeah. All right, so now we need to go ahead and do what? You've done your three trials, what's the next?\n Average.\n Average.\n All right, let's see. We got 182, 172, and 179. \n 533.\n 533, and then what are you going to do?\n Divide it by three.\n Okay, divide by three.\n 177.666667.\n So we can round that up to?\n To 178.\n 178. Is that pretty close? So you got... Your trials are pretty close together. 182--\n 172 and 179.\n So you predicted that it would increase by raising the ramp. Was that true?\n Yes.\n So your prediction came true. Let's turn over the back side, and let's finish the rest of that lab part.\n So were there any trials that your team did not record? We only did it... We didn't do that one because it flipped off.\n It, like, hit this chip card and it just, like, went whoo!\n It went like...\n All right, that's a good one not to include. Let's write that down. We didn't include one because it hit a chip hard.\n Yeah.\n Yeah, that's good.\n It just like flew off to the side and it went all the way, like...\n Did it really?\n Yeah, it just...\n That's crazy.\n It was funny because... It was also funny because it was going straight, but then it just...\n That's weird.\n Turned.\n That's weird that it hit that... That that caused it to, you know, make such a turn.\n But then, like, . The whole time it's been going to the, the right side.\n Oh, okay. So it's been curving?\n Yeah, it kind of like tilted, and...\n That's a good idea. Yeah, that's a real good idea.\n Okay, so, question two. What was the average distance the Jeep rolled with the five-centimeter height? So the five-centimeter height.\n On the back side of that.\n We got an average of 30, 93.\n 93, all right, so write that one down, 93. Did that surprise you, it would go 93?\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n Is that farther, that's what you thought?\n I never thought we'd actually get to the end of it.\n Yeah, that's a--\n But then we actually did with those little toy cars.\n Yeah.\n And this is actually an older-looking toy car.\n Yeah.\n Because whenever I roll one wheel, the other wheel rolls just a little.\n Oh, yeah. Okay. So you thought maybe the wheels would have something to do with it?\n Yeah.\n Okay.\n But I never thought it would actually go that far.\n Okay. So you're now on number three, right?\n What was the average distance the Jeep rolled  10-centimeter height? That was 178.\n Okay. So, 178. It looks like the next question is, did the Jeep roll shorter or longer distance?\n Longer.\n Longer. Can we figure out how much farther?\n Yes.\n What would we have to do?\n The 10-centimeter average minus the 5-centimeter average, and then your answer would be how... Like, the distance between.\n Well, why don't you do that? Why don't you pull that up? The 178...  You know, it's always better when you can incorporate those into your answers. You know, it increased by one... Or it was 85 higher. It's always better when you can show your answer with data. When you can increase that it makes your answer seem more valid, right? All right, so maybe can include that, and then move on to that number five there. Okay? All right. You guys are doing a great job. Hey, have you guys gone through everything you needed to do on the front side? Did you read all these first? You gotta read this whole section of your lab first, okay? Yeah, so I would read this part first and then move on, okay? All right.  All right, how you guys doing?\n Good.\n All right, so you guys have done your first trial on this one. Now, did you do this one here?\n I don't...\n Let's look at our directions. It says change the ramp back to five centimeters high. Did you do that?\n No, sir.\n Okay, let's do that. All right.\n Sandpaper?\n And then I think it... Doesn't it say...\n It says tile floor.\n It says tile floor, so we're going to measure on the tile. \n I get to race it.\n All right, are we ready? Now I'm going to move over here. Now, what vehicle we got here?\n You should move over there because it always goes over here.\n Oh, it always moves over here?\n Yeah.\n It has a curve?\n Yeah.\n How about if I move back over here? Will that work? All right, you ready?\n Right here?\n Yeah, that's good. Oh, you're right. Good thing I moved.\n I'll hold it down. Hold that down.\n Now, in your first experiment, Annie, while they're doing this, what did it? When you increased the height of the ramp, did it increase?\n Yeah, it went faster.\n It went what?\n It went faster because it had more force.\n Okay, so it had more force.  So why do you guys think by increasing the height of the ramp on the first lab, it had more force? All right.\n It's more steeper.\n Okay.\n And the more steeper it is, the more, less friction it would cause, so it could go faster.\n Okay. What was the force that was bringing it down the ramp?\n Gravity.\n Gravity. So you can you conclude from your model experiment that when you increase the steepness of the ramp, the pull of gravity is greater?\n Yeah, because it's going more .\n Okay, all right.\n It's going down, going faster.\n Okay.\n And then when it gets, if it gets down safely, it'll just go farther because it has more speed.\n Okay. Great. All right, so we're on trial two, aren't we?\n Yes.\n Let's do it.\n Go!\n You do have that, it does have that curved roll.\n Oh, it landed on the--\n On the back of it.\n There's like a cargo of some sort in the back of it.\n Is it, is there a--\n There's cargo in the...\n 113.\n Wait, wait, hold on. Let's double check. What I would do, maybe, is bring your Jeep over.\n Yeah, but then it's--\n 106.\n No, but then it's...\n Oh, you're on the... Are you going to the front?\n Yeah.\n Okay, 113, yeah, you're right.\n No, but then you're going at an angle.\n And you don't let it go.\n Yeah, I mean, either way, I think you're going to get a... As long as you--\n That's the way we're doing it from here.\n Well, you know, as long as you do the same thing every time, then you should be consistent, right?\n Yeah.\n All right, one more roll, right?\n One more.\n And then we have it, yeah.\n One more roll, Jordan. Here we go.\n Then we have to add them all up.\n Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun! Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.\n The only thing is that... Is that farther? Don't you think it's farther? Are we ready?\n Maybe it's because of me.\n Do you think you have anything to do with it?\n Yeah.\n You do, huh?\n Go!\n Fire! \n 117.\n How far?\n 117.\n 117, all right.\n 117.\n So now, wait. Now Thiago, the math whiz, has to do his math.\n All right, so how do you find the average again?\n We do... We do... We add them all up, and then we divide it by the number of times you rolled it.\n Okay, let's do it.\n So we rolled it three times.\n You ready? Let's find our average.\n Pencil, please!\n Oh, you guys aren't even using a calculator.\n No, we haven't been.\n We only use it for the division.\n Oh, you only use it for the division. Hey, I like that.\n Sometimes, sometimes. Sometimes we still need it.\n What do you guys got?\n 10.\n That's zero.\n 10.\n To zero, add up the...\n Four, and three.\n So 340.\n So you're going to take 340, and then you're going to divide it.\n Divided by three.\n And Thiago can usually do that.\n You get 113.3333333.\n All right, well, check it out on a calculator, just to make sure.\n Okay.\n How can you do that in your head without a calculator?\n I don't know.\n Yeah, but how do you do that? What did you say the number was, Thiago?\n It was 113.33333.\n All right, here we go.\n It's 113, come on, Thiago. \n 113.333333333. He got it. All right, nice job, man. All right, so 113. Is that pretty consistent, though?\n Yeah.\n Yeah, because we had a 113.\n Yeah, you did. And that was your middle score, wasn't it?\n Yeah.\n And really, if you take the thing--\n And then we gotta do this one.\n No, never mind. I think if you take four here and you put it here...\n Yeah, if you take three here, put it here, then you have one more here.\n Yep. All right. So now what we're going to do, it says to add sandpaper to the bottom of the ramp.\n Which we did.\n And predict whether it's going to go. We'll have to redo those, won't we?\n Yeah.\n So let's erase those, because you had the ramp at how high?\n 10 centimeters.\n 10, and we needed to... We need to have an equal trial. We need to have it at the same distance, right?\n Yeah.\n So the question is... Sit up for me, Jordan. I know we got a lot of space here. What are we going to... Do you think it's gonna go shorter or a farther distance?\n It's gonna go shorter.\n Why?\n Because there's more friction. Sandpaper's rough, so it creates more friction.\n Okay.\n Slow down the thing.\n Okay, what do you think?\n When it slows it down, it may slow it down and then it says, the car starts to turn, just because... Just because it's our car, goes out to the side, so it goes more to the side.\n All right.\n Than it usually does.\n What do you guys think? Farther or shorter?\n I think it'll go shorter because... The gravity may be pulling it down, but the sandpaper is really rough like Thiago said, and it would, like, stop it to make it not move anymore. It would, like barely get off the paper.\n Okay, can you guys, like... Say you're riding your bike. And you ride your bike on smooth pavement, and then you ride it on a rough surface. Is it easier to ride on the smooth or the rough?\n Smooth.\n The smooth, right? So can we use that to help us make our prediction?\n It actually could be faster on the bumps more, because if you hit a bump... If you're going fast enough and you hit a big enough bump, you could actually go in the air.\n Okay, maybe. All right, let's go and test this thing out, and see if you guys are right. Annie, while we're setting up this lab, can you go ahead and write your prediction? And it looks like you need to grab your sandpaper there. Now, I can't sit here, can I? This is the bad seat. I gotta move.\n Well, I say you sit--\n It doesn't go very far anymore on the sandpaper.\n All right, well, let's set it up there. That one there, right? And that one there?\n Four centimeters more.\n All right, let's look. We went 113. With the sandpaper, how far do you think it's gonna go? Let's make a prediction.\n I think it'll go maybe half that, or even less than half that.\n Okay, so what would half of 113 be? What's that close to?\n I don't know. I think that would be maybe...\n 500?\n 500 and...\n No, you want half of it.\n Oh, five, okay. Half of it.\n 50.\n I think, there you go, 50, yeah.\n 50.\n All right.\n 52...\n 51 point .\n 50 point, like...\n Okay. All right, are we ready for the first roll? Let's do it. Let's get our first trial. Here we go. We're ready.\n Wait, who hasn't rolled?\n Has Emma not rolled? Okay, all right, good. I like the way your group's working together there.\n All right.\n Here we go. Oh. Should we use that trial, or should we try a different one?\n Try again.\n Let's try one more. Maybe we can get that--\n Well, scoot it right over here.\n And we could even scoot the sandpaper, like, there.\n Yeah.\n All right, you ready? All right, there it is.\n It didn't even move off the sandpaper.\n Let's give it...\n Can someone hold that down? Can someone hold that down, please?\n Here we go. This is our test. Is the prediction right?\n The sandpaper's hard.\n It is, it's rough, isn't it?\n Yeah.\n 49.\n Now, aren't you on the front?\n Yeah, which would be a 49.\n Yeah, but you mean... Or maybe you're  about 50?\n Yeah, about 50.\n You guys were pretty close in your prediction, weren't you? Half.\n It was like 50.\n Yeah, Jordan said 50 1/2.\n All right, you guys got two more trials, right?\n I said 51 1/2. You said 51 1/2.\n All right, ready?\n Yeah. Oh, man.\n Really?\n Let's like keep it down.\n Or maybe we'll hold it down next time, yeah.\n Yeah, I think that's the problem. It's scooting back.\n That was 50...\n 47.\n Yeah, 47.\n Okay.\n Almost in half.\n All right, I'll hold it on this side. Are we ready?

All right scholars, here's my question. What do you think...actually, let me start by quoting the passage. So it says, they can either trust or predict what Chacko's attitude would be, and they were trying to hide that, get rid of it all, before Chacko returned. So, what do you think Chacko's opinion of all of this chaos would be?\n Could you just be particular with... the chaos you were talking about? What's that?\n The entire situation, the steamy love affair, and the reaction on Baby Kochamma's part. And Mammachi's part.\n Got it.\n I don't think he'd be happy about the love affair, cause as it says, it's like, she had defiled generations of breeding like the little blessed one, blessed personally by the Patriarch of...\n  Antioch.\n Antioch, an imperial entomologist, and Rhodes Scholar from Oxford, so it's like she had taken what their family had worked for for so long, and just... thrown it out the window.\n I'm gonna have to disagree with that Becca, I mean, I think that Chacko is a liberal type. He is very progressive, he's a Marxist, he didn't allow his father to beat his mother as most Indians...Traditionalists, probably would be OK with. I think that Chacko would be no more angry about the whole affair than anybody would be if, some guy was having an affair with his sister. As a social ideal, I think he would be fine with everything.\n I agree because I feel like, oh God I had this whole plan of something to say and I can't remember. Sorry.\n No, it's not your fault.\n  Well, what is the only thing that made Chacko upset at Mammachi?\n Was it that she abandoned her children? Oh, I got it. Yeah, I feel like the most of this passage, though it's third person narration, it really feels like it's coming out of Baby Kochamma's mouth, and it's like her diction throughout all of the italicized stuff. The whole central paragraph where it uses a lot of dirty diction like mud and filthy and coarse and black. To quote the passage once again. So, I feel like that all really Baby Kochamma's words and not necessarily Baba's beliefs, and I feel like they have really contrasted beliefs.\n  Yeah, I mean I feel like all the diction you were talking about, for instance, when it says, \"Mammachi's rage at the old one-eyed Paravan standing in the rain, drunk, dribbling and covered in mud...\" And it repeats mud a lot, and I think it's... that's just kind of dirty and the action is really impure and they're trying... and almost like mud covers things up. So it's almost like it should be covered up. And they were trying to cover it up.\n But don't you feel like they used Chacko not being there and coming back as an excuse to do everything they do. Oh, he's coming back so we have to do this. They kind of use him as the excuse to do it.\n Well, it's sort of like Chacko could intervene, and so we have to do it now so we can't miss our chance to do it again.\n I think that's important, actually. I think that a theme of unintended consequences like it says here, \"It wasn't their fault when the whole \"thing spun like a deranged top.\" I think the theme of unintended consequences is really crucial to both the book and the movie. In the movie, for example, when Mahuditi says she thinks she knows what the consequences will be if Kayani gets married, but the unintended consequences confound the defilement that she commits by him being around.\n I think that's... this book and movie is really trying to say, is this is what happens when you set up rules and don't adapt to social conditions which are inevitably bound to change. \n I'll just go.  In the fourth paragraph, they talk about having a plan. It's very orderly, and they said that Kochu Maria was a midget lieutenant. They had this very organized and planned out, even though in the second paragraph, \"she shuddered with a school-girl shudder.\" It's like her childish emotions are being turned into or coming out through her adult form where she has the power to do stuff.\n Yeah, on that I really want to say cause it says, \"school-girl shudder\" at the beginning. And then it back in the fourth paragraph, when it's talking about their plan, they're referred to as, \"the two old ladies\". So that's contrasting in a way to be described, which obviously it's important.\n Yeah, I think that's one of the themes of the passage. Conflicts between age and which one is ultimately... I don't want to say better, but a better advantage. I guess.\n Like in authority?\n Between age and youth, you mean?\n Between old and young.\n Yeah, age and youth. Which one can have a better life according to them.\n They also play with age. When they locked Ammu up, it's kind of like putting her in time out, like they tricked her in to her room, which is also a parallel I saw in the movie when they locked Kalyani up so she couldn't get married. It was to keep them from doing stuff.\n I just want to bring up another theme of the passage. Where it's the very beginning where it's before we are completely ruined by the . It kind of presents this idea that society is not built on the basis of individual needs, what you do. In this society, at least, affects everybody around you. And it kind of contrasts Ammu's individualism with what societal hierarchy, and how these two women are higher on the hierarchy, so they have authority over her, and so they're telling her not to do this. And they're presenting their authority over her. And Chacko's even higher than them, just cause he's a guy.\n When the passage lists the life cycle events, the weddings, the funerals, baptisms, and birthday parties, it says for generations to come, so I feel like what Peter was saying, it affects all of society. That also ties in with the age because the weddings are for younger people. The funerals are when you die. The baptisms are when you are just born. So it's saying it will affect everybody at all parts of their life, that's how profound it is.\n And even that sentence that Peter was talking about, before it goes any further. Before we are completely ruined, I think that's also just family selfishness because they're just projecting what her... the consequences of her actions will be for them. Not necessarily for her. And in the movie, where the leader of that house of she's just really concerned about herself. She'll sacrifice all of the other women just so she's comfortable.\n But does she also use a we. I think both Baby Kochamma and Diti say the same thing. We're gonna be ruined by this. We we we. \n In regards to that, I think... In water, you know how all the widows they sorta put them together, and they sort of create this unity. It's all out of despair because they all lost something. In a sense, Mammachi lost her former love, and so did Ammu. Ammu had babies without... It wasn't a formal tradition. The way she had her babies. And so in a sense, she has... She's in grievance, and so those two aspects unites these women.\n Yeah, they're all widows.\n Yeah, they're all widows. and that really...\n But does that give them right to be...\n Oh understand, that's why I feel like it says, \"we\". Not \"we\", like our family, but more of like, \"we\" women who are widowed.\n  Austin, what do you think? Do you think that gives them the right to... because they've also lost and because Baby Kochamma and Mammachi has also experienced trauma, so that also means Diti, as well. Her husband died when she was young. Does that give them the right to take that...?\n I don't think so, cause that was actually one of my questions. Especially when it says, \"Her tolerance immense needs, as far as her son \"was concerned became the fuel for \"unimaginable fury at her daughter\". And then just my question was, is Baby Kochamma's actions motivated by Indian society or her own emotions? So I don't think that they should be able to from their past experience... take it out on everybody else.\n I think that what we're talking about right now, maybe be reason that Ghandi appears at the end of the film. Because Ghandi, as he is portrayed in water is a symbol of rationalism. And it's... when he shows up, nice Diti sees that  may have a refuge from cycles of hatred and of tradition conceived for the purpose of basically personal gain. Ghandi's existence in the movie is indictments of almost every action taken in this passage by the scheming old women.\n I think that Ghandi, in the movie, represents more of rebirth because they talk about how much society will change once Ghandi takes power. The widows will gain power. The untouchables won't be untouchable anymore. They'll gain more rights. So I think they look at him as, not really rationalism, because some people think that he's just crazy. The Brahmin caste don't see him as rational, so I think it's more of a hope in an idealized society.\n Building off of what she said, how Ghandi represents re-birth, I think coincides with the movie's title, \"Water\". For me, at least, the way I saw it. I felt like water was rebirth throughout the movie. They washed themselves... it was washing away their sins. Being reborn. I thought who's the girl? The one who killed herself.\n Kalyani\n I thought that it was symbolic when she drown herself. Because the way she was killing herself, she was submersing herself in water, and I thought since water was clearing away your sins and stuff, she in a sense, she was clearing away her sins. And so she would go to the next life sinless.\n I think that the drowning of Kalyani parallels to how Sophie Mol drowned. How it's like the innocent life was taken by the water. Which isn't really... innocence, too.\n But was Kalyani innocent?\n I think that if she hadn't been forced to do things  she would have been... she didn't feel right about what she had done.\n I'm gonna take the opposite view point to the water that symbols of inescapability in the movie because of the way... in both the movie and the book. It says the fisherman had already found Sophie Mol. She... They drowned trying to cross the river, and Kalyani loses everything when she crosses the river and realizes who Norian really is. The river is important in both works. It's an inescapable wall. So I don't think water is portrayed as a good image.\n I mean, it could possibly be both. I think Peter made a pretty good point about it. Sam did with Kalyani's death and Sophie Mol's death. But I think it could be both.\n I think it's a duality thing. And then going on combining what both ya'll said, where you said it's an inescapably, and the way they view it as washing away their sins. View it as a cleansing thing also, for example, emphasizes the irrationality of all their beliefs. And they're cleaning themself in this... if water is just viewed a symbol, they're cleaning themselves with something that's bad. I also don't think that...\n They depend on the water, too, to get their food from it. They wash themselves in it. Yet, it's also... it creates this... it's something that the Paravans are trying to overcome. A lot of people are trying to overcome this barrier, but they depend on it. They still need it. So it's contrasting what they believe...\n Just like a duality thing.\n Yeah.\n It's the family and God's talkings. Their immediate family. They depend on each other because when you're a child, you have to have an older figure to help you grow up. But, they are also... They cause the turmoil with each other. They create their own problems, pretty much.\n It's like you can't live with them, but you can't live without them.\n  Susan, did you have a question?\n  Yes, I did. Well, a lot of them are about similarities between characters. But one thing that I thought about was how Norian dealt with his lover's loss, and how Velutha was able to deal with being separated from... Ammu. And do you think that their status influenced how they were able to deal with the situations?\n Sorry, I missed all this. \n So she\n  I heard\n Well, Norian, because he was a Brahmin, the highest caste, I think he said we'll either going to Calcutta or India, ? to start his life.\n You mean Kolkata?\n Or, I'm sorry, or England. To become a lawyer. So he had the option of completely starting his life over wherever he wanted to go because he had education, and he could provide for himself. Velutha was an untouchable, so he had no opportunity.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 201 ELA AYA 201edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.164753], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW08", "TW24TW19"]}, "085 ": {"text": "  Ti ti.\n  Okay, why don't you come up and try that?

This stays the same?\n Yeah.\n But why would you think this stays the same and it's the acid that's changing color?  Okay, so the concentration of the blue food coloring is the same, but the amount of acid is not. So I must be changing the color of the acid. So it's the acid that's changing color.\n You're not changing the color of the acid, though.\n Anybody else got ideas about that? That something else that could explain it? That's one hypothesis.\n You put the same amount of food coloring in every time, right?\n Yeah.\n Wait, so the acid is probably likely to, maybe like lose an electron?\n The acid loses electrons?  What is an acid?  It gives up an H plus, right?\n There are more moles of Hydrogen ions...\n Right, acid's dissociate. So I got more molds of H plus in this one. Okay, Emma, you have an idea?\n Well, there are more, I think I might have gotten it confused. Basically, there's a higher concentration of acid as you go along, right?\n So more here.\n Yeah. There's more when it's lighter.\n Lowest, most.\n Yeah, I know.\n Okay.\n So that gives it more reason for a more drastic color change, then. Because there are more H pluses, if you will, that could cause it to jump in energy.\n Okay, so you got the idea of energy is some kind of, something's jumping. Because you know...\n Could it be the separation between the two sets of the orbital in the food coloring itself that's changing?\n Okay.\n Which is why the blue color changes to the, like, brownish yellow.\n So now what is your idea about what's changing color?\n The orbital, the food coloring is changing color.\n The food coloring is changing color.\n Yeah, the food, okay, so that makes sense. The food coloring is changing color, but the acid concentration is making it change color.\n Yeah.\n So the food coloring's like the dependent variable, right?\n What is in the food coloring?\n That's a good question.\n That's what we need to know.\n What is in the food coloring? The same thing that's in the cabbage indicator, actually. Well, something similar, they're called anthocyanins. And I have a little handout to show you what they look like. So, before we do that though. Actually, no, I'll show you a picture of an anthocyanin and have you hypothesize a little bit more about what might be happening here. So here's an anthocyanin. It's this molecule here. So usually anthocyanins have lots of benzene rings in them. Okay? So what is happening, what is causing the different colors? So we had the idea of something to do with orbitals and something jumping.\n In the food coloring.\n In the food coloring.\n But the food coloring isn't transition metal.\n It's not a transition metal, no.\n Can you still have that happen?\n Well, what else could there be?\n Well I think it's the O-H because,\n Is it like splitting up the p-orbitals?\n What makes you say that?\n There's like SP-3 orbitals and I guess p2 orbitals  .\n Okay, so are you saying it's that splitting of SP-3 and SP-2 orbitals or the P orbitals?\n I was thinking it's the P orbitals.\n Okay, so what here would represent the P orbitals?\n Whatever bonded with the acid. The O-H maybe?\n Oh, would it be the   no.\n Okay, so here's what we're going to do. I'm going to give you this handout, and what I would like you to do. I want you to highlight all of the double bonds in one color. Then I want you to highlight all of the single bonds in another color, okay? You should have highlighters by your table.\n Purple.\n I'll take green. \n Do you want us to do it for all of them?\n Yeah, let's just do it, let's do it for the first one to start with. Anthocyanins in red wine, we'll do that. So, anthocyanins are in lots of different compounds. Anything that has color really, wine, grapes, cabbage, red onions, food coloring.\n Are they, they're not in colorless though, right? Or are they?\n Say it again?\n They can't be colorless, because it's colorless.\n Well, kind of, you'll see. We'll explain that in a little bit, yeah.\n Is something colorless because they don't have any d electrons, or like the d-orbital is filled up with electrons? Or are there other factors?\n Yes, that's true for transition metals,\n But for other things?\n For other things that are colorless, what would explain why they were colorless?\n It would have to be a different orbital.\n Different wave length.\n Like the absorption, based on the bond. Yes to both of you. So Riley's idea is that maybe, so what did we say color came from earlier?  Color in general, where does color in general come from? Reflecting certain frequencies, and absorbing other frequencies of light right? Okay, so we can only see purple to red. So is there another explanation for why something might be colorless? Because it ...\n Probably because it's absorbing everything?\n Well, if it was absorbing everything, what color would it be?\n Black.\n Oh, it's not absorbing anything.\n It's not absorbing anything? Or not absorbing ...\n Any color.\n It's not absorbing what we can see.\n It's not absorbing what we can see, that's right. It's not absorbing what we can see.\n It reflects all the colors.\n So, you guys see a pattern yet? Can I borrow somebody's? Let me borrow yours. Let's put it under the camera as an example here. What do you notice?\n Were we supposed to highlight...\n Single bonds, yes. What do you notice about the relationships between double and single bonds? The double bonds right next to each other?\n The double bonds are next to the single bonds.\n The double bond are next to the single bonds. That's right, that's right. Okay, in the first one, where you have, What color is the first one, does is say?\n It just says colored.\n Red wine.\n But we have colored and we have colorless. Okay, so in the colored one, how many, can you count how many times it goes double-single, double-single, double-single? That's like a tongue twister. \n It's seven in colored?\n I got seven.\n Okay, so now count colorless and see what you get. What did you guys get?\n For double-single? I got like 14.\n Okay, so are you counting double and single as ...\n Yeah, yeah.\n Okay so you basically got seven, too. Okay, so do colorless now.\n Double bonds between every single bond, between the bonds with the C N-O.\n I got eight for colored. \n I got 17 in the singles, and eight doubles for that.\n Okay, what's the difference between colored and colorless, basically? And the number of double and single bonds?\n There are more singles than colorless.\n Okay, not the total numbers, oh wait, there's more singles than colorless? Okay, that's a way we can look at it. Okay, see if the same...\n We got seven for colorless.\n Okay.\n Is it supposed to be the same number?\n No no, no it's not supposed to be the same.  Alright, let's hear what Gracie has to say. Say what you just said.\n So, in colored there's more doubles and there's less singles. So that means that there's going to be more of the single-doubles. But then in colorless there's less doubles and more singles, so that means there's less single-doubles.\n Can somebody restate that? Just so that I can make sure that you understand what she said?\n Does that mean that if there are more double bonds than there are, that colors .\n So, say it again.\n When there are more double bonds there's a color, or something.\n Okay, when there's more double bonds there's a color. Does that seem like the pattern we're noticing here?\n It has to do with pi bonding.\n Why does it have to do with pi bonding?\n Because it's an overlap of p-orbitals.\n Overlap of p-orbitals.\n Which allows the delocalized electrons to like...\n Okay, so what did you say, Con?\n Delocalization.\n Delocalization, the delocalization comes from...  Pi bonds, what is a pi bond? It's the overlap of what?\n P-orbitals.\n P-orbitals, p-orbitals okay. So when it goes double-single, double-single, double-single, what's happening there? How does that create...\n It's like one big pi bond. Like when you have, like earlier you were talking about whatcha-ma-call-its, I can't articulate...\n Delocalization?\n No, like...\n One giant p-orbital?\n Yeah, like sort of, yeah one giant p-orbital. Like one giant pi bond, it like expands from like through different,\n Oh, and like a benzene shape, and then that makes a circle? Yeah, and it's not actually like here's one,  here's one pi bond, here's one pi bond, here's one. It's like they're like all pi bonded.\n They're like all pi bonded to each other, okay. So in which case, in which case are they all pi bonded to each other? The colored form, or the colorless form? \n I'd say colored because they are all close to each other. Like the pi bonds.\n The pi bonds, say it again.\n They're close to each other.\n They're close to each other in the colored form? So is there more...\n There's more double bonds.\n There's more double bonds in the colored?\n Yeah, so they would have to be closer to each other. \n There are more double bonds in colored, less double bonds in colorless.\n Okay, so how many of you say there's less double bonds in the colorless? Less double bonds in the colorless? Three.\n There's only seven double bonds in colorless and there's eight in colored. And there's more leftover singles. \n Wait, for which one, for colored?\n Oh, you're counting the far left one. \n Yeah, this one has eight.\n This is an intermediate one?\n So then it's seven and seven.\n Seven and seven, okay. So how many, if you were to try to connect. So the idea is that it makes one giant p-orbital. If you were going to connect all of the p-orbitals, which one would have the most gigantic p-orbital?\n Colored\n Colored. Is that clear to everybody? Why did you say colorless? Did you say colorless?\n Yeah, I don't understand why.\n Because there's  a bunch of single bonds.\n Because the pi bond is more in the middle of the two other things .\n Wait, for the far left?\n Does that make any sense?\n We're talking about the far left one.\n Let's look at all three. So which one of these is going to have the most giant pi bond?\n The middle one?\n The middle one.\n Because it's an intermediate.\n And they're more double bonds.\n Does anyone disagree that it's going to be the middle one that would have the most giant p-orbital? Okay. Alright, let's look at some more down here. Did you guys do, does somebody have these highlighted?\n No.\n I think Rebecca, you have them highlighted, right? \n Okay, so let's look at these two here. Can we apply our hypothesis? So what is our hypothesis by the way?\n More overlap of p-orbitals the more colored it is?\n Okay, the more overlap of p-orbitals the more colored it is. That's our hypothesis. Is it supported by these two on the side here?\n Can we highlight the exterior?\n So what do you think? Is our hypothosis supported by these two? Alright, Con, can you explain?\n Well, I mean it just looks like there's a bunch of conjunctions of single bonds where the streak of double-single is kind of broken.\n Okay, right, so there's a streak of double-single, double-single, double-single, double-single, double-single. So imagine you start somewhere. Have you guys ever heard the song that never ends?\n Yes. \u266b This is the song that never ends \u266b\n Okay, we're not gonna sing it, it never ends. So in this case, if we were to just go around going double-single, double-single, double-single, double-single, double-single, double-single, double-single, double-single, double-single, would I ever get to an end necessarily? Would I here? How about if I went double, still single, double- single, double-single, double-single,\n But that's single, single.\n Single, single. So which one's going to have a more extensive pi bond? The top one, so that sort of fits our hypothesis that the more pi bonding there is, the more colored it is. Okay, so what causes color in these compounds?\n Shared electrons?\n More shared electrons, that are shared how? \n Pi bonds. \n More pi bonds equals what?\n More area for the electrons to move around?\n Okay, more area for them. More delocalization, okay. So let's take it back to this, to our acid and blue food coloring demonstration. Why are these different colors? What is happening here?  Let's put this together.\n Oh, is it the H is taking more of the delocalized electrons because H is positive?\n What do you think?\n Because there's a higher concentration.\n So say it again.\n Okay so since H is a positive ion, it takes more of the, since there's more, it takes more of the delocalized electrons?\n Okay, so it's taking more of the delocalized electrons. So how does that explain the color change? Can somebody add onto that?\n There's less electrons so I guess there's less...\n More double bonding?\n There's less energy absorbed?\n No, there's increased...\n So, is more energy being absorbed, or less energy being absorbed when it's yellow?\n More energy is being absorbed that's why it's yellow.\n Exactly, that creates further  .\n Because there are more electrons bonding with the H plus than there is in the...\n It's about absorption.\n Ah, okay Ruth, say that...\n", "filename": ["Copy of 1082 SCI AYA 1082-2edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.110422], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW06s", "TW08", "TW24TW08", "TW24TW14"]}, "597": {"text": " Brooke, what did you choose?\n  The cylinder.\n  Why?

The sphere, and why, you need to write your words down. Okay, so write your words down so you guys can hand in your sheet.\n  Who thinks wants to cut? Who think will cut? Here, what about Samantha, then you? Okay, and then me, then Brian. Okay, but he goes, you too. You called... You want to hold and stretch? Well, that's the one you're doing, and you'll be cutting. Okay, so Katie cuts, then Samantha, then me and then Brian. He is going to roll the shapes down the hill. I'll stretch, and you can hold, okay?  Samantha... Wait guys, this is...\n  Guys, it's the sphere. Spheres. Those are spheres.\n  That's the cylinders. No.\n  This is the sphere color, you already got...\n Here, how about I'll be...  Who wants cylinder, raise your hand. Who wants sphere? Who wants cylinder? So, it's three versus one. So, do the cylinder first and then use... \n  Fine, I'll get on it.\n  You guys working it out? Alright. \n  Yes, Blake, what do you need?\n  We need more string.\n  You need more string? Okay, alright. Keep that one right there, and roll one of your other shapes and I'll get you a longer piece of string.\n  Okay. \n  Hold on, I got it right here. I'll tie it on there, how's that?  Okay, is that going to work for you? Alright, Isaac, go ahead and stretch it out.\n  How long it was?\n  We need to hang that up. \n  You can cut this tie.\n  Okay, I'll cut this time. I'll have... Don't roll it now. I can measure it. I'll cut it. Now, Leila roll it down.\n  Move the cylinder!  \n  Blue, blue, oh we have only blue?\n  When you guys are measuring, who's doing the holding? You are? Okay Foster, hold it. Who's doing the stretching? Because you're going to have to stretch it out, you can't cut it until it's stretched. You're stretching, and so Sierra's cutting? Okay Foster, you hold it, you gotta stretch it all the way out. Yeah, okay, cut it right here. Like that. Here, there you go. Open it a little bit more. There you go, okay. And Foster go put it up on the graph, and Sierra you can throw away the extra. Okay, good job. What shape is this, Hunter?\n  Sphere.\n  Sphere, alright,  and what do you know, what's special about the sphere? It rolls, and what's really special about it?\n  It has no faces.\n  It has no faces, you're brilliant.  Okay, the next one... \n  Whoa!\n  You can cut it. You may be able to... \n  I want to straighten it. Measure it. \n  The sphere went the farthest? So, was your prediction right, Jackson? Was your prediction right?\n  Yes. No.\n  No.  So, you want to circle no, and you want to circle yes. Anthony, was your prediction right? Okay, so you want to circle the check mark for yes, your prediction was right. And then you guys can get some crayons and draw your observations, and what you saw in your experiment. \n  I think... The cylinder.\n  Okay, who's letting this go?\n  Me.\n  Okay, you can't measure it till she lets it go. Ready, go Cecilia, let her go.  Look at the poor little cube. Why do you think it doesn't go very far?\n  Because it has sides.\n  What kind of sides?\n Squares.\n  And they're what?\n Flat.\n  Flat, alright, but now you've picked it up and you can't measure it.  Alright, who's doing the holding? Okay, now hold on a second Leah, so when you measure you want to turn it this way, so the edge is right up against the ramp, and then you hold it tight, and then you can cut it right here, okay? Alright, so who's holding, you are? Okay, alright--\n  You hold this, you hold that. Okay, can I go hang that up? Now, we do some... \n  Okay, hold on, can you hold this away for a second while she sends it down? Ready? Okay, ready? Alright, now are you the holder? Okay. Use the stretcher.\n  Try and stretch the...\n  So, Katie, you took Brian's turn last time, honey, so it's his turn.

Because it has rectangle.\n  Rectangle what?\n Faces.\n  Faces, and they are...\n  Flat.\n  Flat rectangles, right, so did it go very far?\n No.\n Did anybody pick the rectangular prism to go the farthest? You picked that one? Okay, so now you know, it didn't go too far. Alright, so now you're going to try your...\n  Cube.\n  Cube, okay good.\n  Who's cutting now?\n Who? Who's sliding it? Samantha!\n  No, I didn't slide it down before.\n  Samantha didn't...\n  So, were you right Leila?\n  Yeah, you did!\n  Yes or yes ma'am?\n  Yes ma'am.\n  Alright, so you can circle your prediction was correct, and then, was your prediction correct, Isaac? No, you guys said the cylinder went the farthest. Was your prediction correct? Okay, so you circle here, your prediction wasn't correct, and then, was your prediction correct, Aspen? No, and what about you Blake, yes? Okay, so now you guys can go ahead and clean up all of your stuff, and then you can get one of the crayon caddies and draw a picture of what happened. Blake, I want you to help your team clean up before you start drawing your observations.  Good job team!\n  Hey, that's mine! That's my pencil! \n  Wait, I'm not ready yet, I'm not ready yet.\n  I got it right. I got it right.\n  Yeah, I got it right. I got it right.\n  So, which shape do you guys have left? What is that?\n  Cone.\n  The cone, and what's special about the cone?  And so what happens to it?\n  It slides.\n  It does slide on its face. What else is special about the cone, Cecilia?\n It rolls in a circle.\n  Why?\n Because...\n  You okay?\n Because it has a flat face.\n  Mm hmm, and what else makes it roll in that circle, Leah?\n It has a point.\n  It has the point on it, so this is your last one to measure?\n  Yes.\n  Okay, yes or yes ma'am?\n  Yes ma'am.\n  Alright, good luck.\n  You throw that away, I'll throw it away.\n  So, was your prediction correct, Hunter?\n  Yes.\n  Yes, so the cylinder went the farthest for you guys? Okay, so Sierra, if the cylinder went the farthest, your prediction wasn't right, so now you're gonna circle the X. Does it matter that you are right?\n  No.\n  No, you're just predicting, and that means you're guessing, you don't have to be right. Circle the X, and then go ahead and draw your pictures.\n  It's orange.\n  So, you guys are gonna show the cylinder going the farthest.\n  Just do it. Do it here.\n  Now, I don't know what's going the farthest.\n  It was probably cylinder.\n  Yeah... \n  Okay, so what shape went the farthest for you guys?\n  Um, the cylinder.\n  The cylinder, so was your prediction correct? Was yours? Was yours?\n  Mm, no.\n  What shape did you predict?\n  Um, the sphere.\n  Sphere, but the cylinder went the farthest, so were you right? No, so did you circle the little X on the bottom? And then you can do your picture. Was your prediction correct, Brian? Okay, so circle the check mark and draw your picture, and then you guys can copy the graph from the board on the back, so you can show your parents what happened. Good work team!  All right, so this team's all set? Okay, so which one went the furthest for this team?\n  The sphere.\n  The sphere, okay, so was your prediction right, Cecilia?\n  Yeah.\n  Okay, was yours right, Brooke?

Society would be stagnant and Newton's hypothesis...\n Newton was actually asked by a college of scientists about the thoughts of gravity and stuff, and he didn't think it was important. So when he found out, a few months before that, he didn't publish it, until they asked him about it, and then he republished to them, so they could hang out with everybody else.\n Okay. Excellent. What do you guys have?\n There would be no uniform units, therefore there would be no real way to judge one's discovery, and you couldn't really bounce one idea off another.\n Okay. What'd you guys have?\n We said that we wouldn't have the technology that we have today because scientists tend to go off of what other scientists have done.

Okay. Split apart. I'm just going to randomly popcorn on this one. Brandon, what'd you guys say?\n We came up with, make life easier.\n Okay. To make life easier. Alright. What's something you guys said?\n Money and power.\n Money and power. Interesting. What's something you guys said?\n To decrease death. Like, medical science.\n Okay. So, let people live longer? Probably also live more quality lives? Excellent! Okay. Take the catwalk. Take the catwalk. Shift down two partners once she gets down there. Shift down two. Super! And a quick hands up! Hands.

What is an example of something the scientists we learned about today, hold on, hold on, hold on. I had a request to restate the question. \"What is an example from the scientists we learned about today, using, sensing or manipulating something that is microscopic or can't be seen?\" Okay? Now go.  We certainly cannot see that. Except on the macroscopic level, we can see the results of it.  Brandon decided to use a lifeline called phone a poster.

The person, whose last digit, in their address, is the lowest, is going to answer this question.  Okay. Here is your question. We talked a second ago about the fact that scientists are naturally curious about our natural world, but many scientists have learned to manipulate our natural world. \"What is your opinion of scientists manipulating, using for our benefit, our natural world?\" Okay. Go.  Okay. Face me! Nice and loud so everyone can hear. Brian, what did your group discuss?\n We thought it all depended on humanism. How they thought the humanism in relation to all the other creatures of the world, that they feel like they're higher than all the other creatures, then they can do what they want to the natural world.\n Okay. So, as long as it's being used for good.\n I guess.\n Okay. With the benefit of humans or the world in general? Kind of a socialist view?\n The world.\n In general. Okay. John, what did you guys say?\n Yeah, what did we say?\n Pretty much the same thing.\n The same thing, pretty much.\n Okay. So, are you, specifically, looking at human needs or more, global?\n Human.\n Okay. What about you guys? What did you partnership talk about?\n That it was okay to a point. There was a point when you should not manipulate the natural world. Like, taking a dolphin from one ocean and moving it to another.\n Okay. So, who should decide what those points are?\n I don't know.\n Okay. Alright. That segways us to the next question. \"If you were...\" Let's see, let's do this. The person with the most buttons on is going to answer this question.  Okay. \"If you were the scientific consultant to President Barack Obama, what percentage of our National Budget, should be spent on science, and why?\" Justify that amount. Go! It's a percentage. So, we're not talking a dollar amount. What percentage?  Well, it doesn't really matter. Do you think half of our budget? Do you think a third of our budget? You think a quarter of our budget?  I don't know. You could delineate that. Okay. I could tell by looking at you guys, that we've got a couple of folks that feel kind of passionately about this, so spread back apart and face me. What did you guys say?\n Well, I said that 15% is a good amount because then, it puts enough money forward to get going and leaves money for other things that we need.\n Okay. Now you guys had a very specific take on it. What did you guys talk about?\n We talked about if medical, if the percentage was accounting for medical sciences, as well, as it should and, if it is, then the percentage should be increased to help.\n Like 50 to 60%, if medical is included.\n Okay. So, we have to look at the different kinds of research. Are we just studying stuff to study stuff? Are we developing a technology that will help human need? Are we looking at medical? Alright. Very good. Take the catwalk. Take the catwalk. On the catwalk. They do their little turns on the catwalk. On the catwalk. Okay. Of the science, of the person...\n We haven't scooted.\n Oh, scoot down. I'm out of order. Thank you. Scoot down. I got so excited about the questions. Scoot down. Scoot down. We will! Okay. Here we go. We're creatures of habit sometimes. Hands up, real fast. Make sure you've got the right partner. Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. There we go. Okay. The person, whose third, no.

Like they can work and they can help our industry grow and provide opportunities for more people.\n Yeah, they're a lot more active compared to old people more, who just is gonna basically sit at home.\n I mean if we look at like the current political situation in countries that are rebelling, the rebellion is completely composed of the youth.\n Yeah.\n If we look at the political situation in America, like Obama's election, was pretty much the 18 to 21 year-old vote. It's just like clearly, they're like better at affecting social change.\n In this time period that we're discussing, why would you want the youth to come?\n Well because this is like the start of all social change in the union, and I want young people to bring a youthful energy, and determination, and some sort of hope about the country that they're moving to, and that all, my union in here.\n  They're gonna progress, they're gonna like technology, and they're gonna invent stuff.\n So you're onboard with the--\n I'm just saying we still need more money. They're going to be working and they're going to be taking money out of our economy because they're gonna want to pledge. How much are they gonna spend? Like we need old people to spend a lot, like rich people to spend.\n  But we need workers.\n Yeah, no, so it's like--\n We need workers, old people cannot work.\n  We need a combination. If only get young people--\n If we look at this list of people that we can bring into the country that we were supposed to look at to begin with, the old people on this list aren't that rich.\n Yeah, but there's\n  The bottom line is\n Gonna be more than just the old people there. the old people other countries--\n But right now we're focusing on that.\n they're going to be moving and they're rich, who would move here? Why would they move to the \"Land of Opportunity,\" if they don't need opportunities? I didn't mean to say that! \n That's honesty! Okay.\n Yeah but, I mean, I see that.\n It seems like the majority, did the majority rule on that? Because I guess, who was against having younger people come in? I know Matt was. Was Matt the only one who wanted older people to come in? Ok, and you were--\n  Also--\n  I'm a loner.\n You just went with the consensus?\n Yeah.\n Okay, good. -  Another point, another point! Also, old people coming from another country just to spend the rest of their life, aren't necessarily going to be all that interested in America\n Okay.\n as a country.\n And wait, and also--\n They're not going to vote, they're not going to, you know, try to participate in the country itself so they're just here to die in comfort? \n Okay, go ahead Darvel.\n On the way, it's already tough enough to come across the sea to get to the United States, because so many people died on the way getting there, so they might die on the way getting there.\n So don't even consider them to begin with?\n Right.\n Or if they're sick, they can't come into the country, anyway. Like, we're not going to let people who have cholera into our country, because then it'll start spreading here, so ...\n You said \"colema\" or \"column?\"\n  Isn't that more in--\n Cholera.\n  That's like--\n Okay, I was like, what?\n What else did you guys have on your cards? What about religion? Does religion matter?\n  No.\n I don't think it did.\n No, no.\n That's one thing we, I think we all could agree on.\n Yeah.\n Oh, everybody--\n What about the nativists?\n What about the nativists? Darvel, you were okay with the religious freedom happening in this group? Well, I mean, it's kind of like on the edge of the--\n He's conformed.\n But I  because most of the time, it's Christianity in the United States, so...\n Also, majority rule.\n Yeah, majority rules.\n USA! USA! \n Okay, so who did you guys decide to, wait, was that the end of your criteria, or?\n No, we had-- -  There's still reasons for coming, race, and knowledge of English, previous jobs, and--\n Oh, what'd you guys say for English? What'd you guys say?\n They have to know English.\n Yeah, we said they had to know.\n Basic English, at least.\n At least a little bit. They have to know some of it.\n Or--\n Enough to, you know, find out where the bathroom is.\n Really?\n Or enough to like communicate--\n Or have the ability to learn it.\n With other people who may not know English that well.\n And Boss, you were okay?\n I mean I feel like I'm one of the only ones who disagreed with that, because like being a boss, like I have connections like in every part of my city, and every community, and communities are often like separated by race, so--\n By race and?\n  And language.\n Mm-hmm.\n So, maybe different communities wouldn't have trouble communicating if they only knew one language.\n Mm-hmm.\n But being a boss, with my connections, I could definitely like, I could make it so that they could communicate, and I can get them what they need, help them out.\n Okay.\n I don't think now English is a necessity.\n Well you wouldn't--\n I think it's pretty, I mean how are people supposed to communicate? And it's just going to make life miserable for the people who are trying to make it. Because I mean, overall the majority speaks English.\n But we do have immigrants in this country right now that speak different languages, so they could just--\n They're getting by, though.\n Right, right.\n I don't know if \n You should know them, working in factories, you should know a lot of these people.\n Yeah, but-- -  You might even know someone--\n When I think of like different languages, I think of like the Tower of Bavel, or Babel, it's like in the Bible story, where like everybody spoke different languages, and then the tower collapsed. So like, if everybody speaks different languages, we can't get work done productively, because we don't know what each other want. Like if we say, \"Yo, go make this type,\" I don't know, just, \"Do this job,\" and then they do something else, you need communication.\n Darvel, what do you think about the language piece?\n Well, I think that speaking English is basically, it's a necessity. I mean, obviously, you would want workers to come in, because he just wants money. He doesn't really think communication is that important, but as a nativist, I believe that it is.\n Why? What will happen if we let a lot of people come into the country with different languages, maybe be different races, different ethnicities? What will happen to the country if we let those people in?\n I mean, that could create like conflict between the work, because like Matt said, they really wouldn't know what to do while they're working. Also, that could change the patriotism of the country, as well.\n But will they know why they're working?\n Not really.\n So people who don't speak English don't know why they're doing a specific job?\n Well, probably, yeah. I mean, they know that they're doing a job to get money.\n Right, so does English really matter? I'm just asking.\n I mean, they're not gonna really--\n X, you wouldn't care if they spoke English, because if they didn't speak English, it might make it easier to exploit them.\n I somewhat care. Because they have to collaborate with the people they're working with to get the job done.\n The way I see it is, they can come into the country with a, you know, as long as they have the mindset of, \"I should probably learn English to succeed in this country,\" then I think it's a good idea. Because if you're going to be immersed in a language, you're going to be able to learn it eventually, so I mean as long as they try to learn English, or try to know basic English, I think they should \n I mean, I think I agree to Darvel. Like if I was a nativist, I'm not saying I am, but if I was a nativist, I wouldn't want hoards of people who don't speak English coming, because I mean it's like, America's pure, we've got everybody speaks English, like we don't want--\n But does everybody really speak English right now?\n Not now, I'm saying--\n No, not right now in 2011, but in our age that we're discussing--\n  If I was a nativist in my--\n Even then, right?\n In my like Ideal world, you would want everybody to like speak English.\n Okay.\n The whole world should speak English!\n Oh, goodness! Yeah, that's what a nativist would say.\n I went with the English speakers, because like to properly rebel and have a voice, communication is vital, and I think that people who aren't speaking English won't be interested in what I have to say, can't even understand what I'm saying, so--\n Okay, well you guys decide, and talk about who you guys are letting into the country specifically, okay?\n Yeah.\n All right, thanks guys.\n Oh, we already did.\n  Education's not really that important to me, though.\n I think it's really important.\n Dude, it's saying that a lot of these people going into this country aren't educated to begin with.\n Well, education like-- -  You would want educated people.\n As a non-union worker, like I don't care about education. I just want to keep my job, and I want like union workers to get out of the country.\n And as a union worker, I want educated immigrants, because then they would stand up for themselves, and like change factory conditions.\n Me, being a tycoon, I just want people to work for me. I mean, they can come to this country, they can live the American way, I'll supply them with a job--\n What's the American way?\n American way is to--\n Well but you're not giving them any money.\n Wait, wait, wait, what's the American way?\n  2.5 kids--\n We are, actually.\n 2.5 kids, white picket fence.\n  Dog!\n Well that's the American, is that the American way now or then? We're talking about then.\n  Labrador!\n Basically, the American way is\n I want them to be doing better than the country they were previously in.\n Okay.\n That's my concern.\n Well, but they came here to like succeed, and you're giving them like two cents an hour.\n I mean, for me with education though, it's not that big of a deal, because then again, if they're coming to America, they're going to have to learn our customs and our way, and with them being uneducated, that's easier for us to mold them into society, and opposed to like we can mold their thoughts into like correct candidates to vote for, and stuff like that!\n But this is supposed to be like a free country, and they came over here because we like grant that, and we're just like manipulating them.\n Yeah, but like basically, the only people I want in the country are like people that are going to give me jobs. Like people who are kind of like--\n Who are those people?\n Kind of like sketchy people, kind of, because like--\n You want sketchy people to come into your country?\n Well, sketchy people are about to give me jobs, because like sketchy people are about to like--\n What do you mean by sketchy? What does sketchy mean?\n When you're saying sketchy, do you mean poor, or like--\n Nah, I mean like people that are like rich and stuff, and they'll like have a business and whatever, but like--\n They're corrupt a little?\n Yeah, they're a little corrupt, so they won't like hire union workers, and they'll keep their people ununionized so I can come in and take the work, make that cash. Know what I'm saying?\n Oh, okay. So you want it that people will have money when they come into the country, but not be on the side of unions--\n Exactly.\n So that they will--\n They'll give me jobs.\n They will, okay, they'll hire non-union workers.\n They're not people that are going to be entering the workforce, they're people that are going to be like already kind of upper, you know what I mean?\n Okay, so you want people with money coming into the country?\n Yeah, exactly.\n Okay. Did you guys decide on a criteria already--\n Yup.\n Or are you discussing a criteria?\n We have a criteria.\n This is our criteria, pretty much.\n Okay, what's your criteria?\n We said non-educated, which some of us don't agree with.\n Who didn't agree with it?\n I don't agree with that.\n  Why?\n Because--\n  I did not agree with it.\n America is the land of education. Everybody needs an education. You can't come here--\n Well, but at this time, remember education is not like going to school. It's more of knowing a skill or a trade.\n It's like street smarts, almost.\n Well, if they don't know anything, then they can work.\n  Yeah.\n Okay.\n And we decided on that--\n Do people really need to know a lot, though, to work in these factories?\n No, but like--\n  No, my business is to teach them how to use these machines.\n  We don't want them to be taken advantage of.\n I mean, but at the same time, I don't really see the importance of education if they don't come with like money or some type of, like I don't know, some type of prior knowledge with like succeeding in America. Because you may know, you know how to read 100 books, but that doesn't help you like start a business or something like that.\n Yeah.\n Yeah, but not like that kind of education. Like, education enough where they know like that two cents an hour is not okay. Like so they can stand up for themselves, and like be able to like negotiate with you.\n Why is that not okay? I mean, everyone has to get paid. Everyone gets paid that same amount.\n Yeah, but they're living in like cramped shacks and like poor conditions.\n I mean, that's in your opinion. A house is a house.\n Yeah, and then look at where they're coming from. They're coming from religious persecution, they're coming from these governments that are collapsing, these war-stricken countries--\n Exactly, and the government--\n I think it's better to work in a factory, earn some wage--\n Yeah, but how much are you earning compared to them?\n Eat or have necessities in life.\n I mean, but there's also government support, too. That's where I come in. I set them up with a place to stay, stuff like that, you know. That's what government's here for is support of people that come in here. So it's best when they're not educated, it's best when they don't have money, because that makes it easier for them to get help, and that's what we're here to do is to help people.\n But then they're relying on you and they don't know what to do with themselves, like when you--\n They're relying on him, but then he lets them rely on themselves, so they come in, rely on him, and then he kind of sends them, like--\n How?\n Helps them out.\n How does he keep people from relying on him?\n Because then, all right, so I can help them decide for who to vote for in some type of election that can help them with their lives. Like if there's a politician voting for labor laws, I can help them. If I'm with that politician, I can, \"Yo, this is the guy you want to vote for,\" \"This is the guy that will help you.\"\n That's like brainwashing, though, they like have a right to think for themselves.\n Honey, this is America.\n Exactly.\n Exactly! Exactly!\n So you're saying that nobody should campaign, ever? You're saying campaigning is brainwashing?\n No, you could campaign, but you don't--\n Exactly, he's just campaigning!\n Can I just say something?\n No, but he's like getting them all to agree with him.\n Okay, if you think about it this way, you can really have people from all spectrums of money-wise, like from all kinds of economic backgrounds. You can have the more rich people come in, sorry, the education backgrounds. The more educated people are going to come in. No matter what, they're going to help our country more than hurt it. Then for me, I can supply the people who have gotten a lesser education, and I can give them a job, I can start them off in life, and maybe they can go to the library and learn themselves.\n Why don't you better their working conditions, then, if you like are \"helping\" them?\n Because I mean, still, this is much better.\n No, because they like die in those factories.\n It's better than being killed by their previous governments.\n  Wait, have we decided--\n No, it's not! It's not the same thing.\n Have you guys already decided on this piece already?\n Yeah, we have like our set laws, we just have disagreements about that.\n You guys have disagreements? So you guys were able to a consensus on them?\n Yeah, well we kind of voted on it. We decided that they have to be non-educated, come with some sort of money. Their religion and race doesn't matter.

We are, like--\n We're starving.\n Starving.\n My needs are not being met if I'm Ashley, because I'm scrunched together, I'm uncomfortable. My physical needs aren't being met because it's crowded and my muscles ache. Does anyone agree with that?

We're not, like... \n You're in good shape? \n With your physical needs being met how does that link to emotional and social needs? How do those kind of all go together? Talk about how those all go together overall and how does that make you feel, based on this picture. You're that person, so use first-person point of view, and discuss how those are all intertwined. And then add to your conversation, as far as I know, some of you did the bottom two as far as not-- These are what are being met and these are not being met. So make sure you cover those two, okay? How they all intertwine or if they do. And then you can discuss these bottom questions, too. Even if you didn't get to them with your partner, jump in now with each other. I'll be right back.\n Alright, so...  My emotional needs are being met. I'm earning the money that I should be and I feel confident... \n All of our emotional needs, all of our needs are being met. \n Why are the clothes taken off and why are the--? Just in case\n Emotional needs are not\n they do jump overboard?\n being met. It looks like they're sad because, because we look depressed. And you can just tell it by the faces and what they look like. Our faces and their-- and our body language. And there was-- and we're scared because we see the weapons and we don't know what they're gonna do with it to us.\n So think about the cause and  effect of that.\n Our emotional kinda was being met.\n Are the people standing up--\n No.\n But how are they not chained?\n Still all of our emotional needs are being met.\n They're running away.\n They don't look worried, they look kind of like they're looking at the scenery kind of.\n They look calm.\n In their expression they look calm, yeah. They don't look worried or anything.\n These people, but the people that are sitting down... \n I disagree with Alan, 'cause they look calm and confident.\n I kinda disagree with that because they look like-- That's why they're all facing different directions. They're watching for anything suspicious.  They're all looking in different directions.\n They aren't smiling like they're looking at beautiful scenery.\n There's like little sections in between, so like Grayson said, if they do jump overboard they don't all fall over and tip the boat.\n Do you think these people are all in one group? No, let me rewind and say my question again. Do you feel that these people all everybody in this boat was represented by a perspective from your discussion you just had? Do you understand my question? I'm not saying it very well. Were roles of all these people in the boat given to at least somebody in this group?\n Yeah.\n You think so? How were the roles different?\n I think there's bosses and then there was slaves. Like slave traders and them.\n Kind of serious, like they just got their reward, and these people, they look kind of like chained--\n I don't think they're running away.\n I think they're running away.\n I think they're going to a bigger boat, 'cause these people look like--\n I think they're like--\n That's not the full canoe.\n And they're just taking the slaves to the big boat.\n So let me say my question again. Let me say my question again.\n Why would slaves take slaves?\n They're slave traders.\n They're not slaves.\n How do you know they could be slaves or they could be slave traders?\n Let me say my question again. I want you to think about your role and what was just said. Do you think that all roles that I gave this group were, I'm sorry, are on this picture?\n No.\n Oh, you're changing your mind? Discuss that. At first you said yes. Discuss that, why maybe not all the roles that I gave you were on this picture. No, do not say your role yet. Ladies and gentlemen, we have about one minute.\n I think that they are people in the tribe and they're giving their slaves as slaves.\n You know how we were doing that worksheet, the graphic organizer? It said that most of the time, they would just trade other villages for their slaves and take those ones.\n Well, I think--\n 'Cause they could still have their own slaves.\n I think this is a slave trader... well, not really like a slave trader, but like\n 'Cause the slave traders\n a slave boss kind of?\n were from England, so I think they'd have white skin.\n I think they're with the other people--\n But remember African-Americans were also slave traders.\n Because they're not chained and they're standing and the other people, like slaves, are all tucked together and depressed.\n I think that... some European traders tried to persuade other slave people to say, like \"go get your crime people, go get your crime people...\"\n Slaves.\n Yeah, \"your slaves \"in your own tribe, and then we'll trade you--\"\n Gold.\n A bag of tobacco.\n And those helped capture... So even though they don't have white skin, they might be slave traders and they give, like, \n So we have two different maybe perspectives of slave traders, is that what I'm hearing you say? One being?\n They could have also been threatened to work.\n Europeans.\n Hold that thought, David. One being?\n Europeans and one being African.\n Well not really African-American...\n 'Cause in the book it said that the African slaves, not the European slaves, but the African slaves, their slaves were kinda like maids.\n So I want you to think about the role that you were given. And I asked you to look at that picture from that perspective. Is it possible that that specific role I gave you has many different perspectives itself?\n Yes.\n Alright. I want you to wrap up your conversation if you have anything else to add, and then we're gonna continue tomorrow.\n You're not gonna tell?\n Not yet, no. I changed my mind. You think you know.

So, the first thing I want you guys to do is, I want you guys to look at number one on that task card. Can someone read it out loud?\n  I will.\n  Yeah, Drew.\n  The Angry Bird was blasted through a slingshot at the initial height of 45 meters. The bird's initial velocity was 14.7 meters per second. Write an equation that gives the height of the Angry Bird as a function of time.\n  Okay, so what I need you guys to do is I need you guys to write that equation on the white board.\n \n  Okay, so now I want people to put it up on the board. Okay.  Okay, so can you guys look around to each other too, I know you guys are gonna want to,  like, show everybody what people are getting.\n  Yay...Cool...\n  Okay, guys, these are the four things, or the three things that I saw. Okay, so right here. So, if you notice a lot of you guys, you guys had the first one. Negative four point nine 'x' squared plus 14.7 'x' plus 49. Can someone tell me in words how you were able to figure that out?\n You just did it.\n What was the question?\n  So, can someone tell me how, like, relate this general formula to the story. Since you've read already, I wants someone else to speak. So who? Okay, Jamilah, can you explain how you were able to get this equation?\n So, the height is c, and the original equation is a 'x' squared, plus b 'x', plus c. And so the initial height is b, which is the y intercept. And then b is the initial velocity? And then negative four point nine is just the random number that they chose.\n  So, you guys, is it random?\n No.\n It's the scale factor.\n  Is there any other terminology for that?\n It's the starting point.\n  Hey guys, do you think it's the starting point? Is it the starting point? Or, what else...?\n It's gravity.\n  So wait, what does this negative four point nine mean?\n That's the constant. Remember, it's gravity.\n  So, I heard...\n Scale factor?\n  Okay, scale factor, but relatively to your projectile motion, what is it?\n Acceleration?\n  Acceleration. So you guys....\n  It's acceleration. So, right now, what I want you guys to do... Oh, actually once again, right here- here are different forms of an equation that I saw. So, right here what do you think? Can someone tell me what's wrong with this particular one?\n They don't have a squared and they don't have an 'x' after the 4.2 \n Okay, so, Ravelle, what's the problem with this one?\n There's no 'y' intercept or... .\n  So, once again, I still notice, now I want to go back to the original equation. Okay, someone tell me in words. Ah, Jamilah, she did a fantastic job explaining relatively to the a 'x' squared, plus b 'x', plus c, but according to the story, can someone refer to the story back to the general equation?\n Can you rephrase the question?\n  Yes. How are we able to get 14.7 here? How did we get 49 here? How do you know what stuff to use?\n The 49 is the initial height in meters, so that one's gonna be your 'y' intercept, And 14.7 is the initial velocity, and the initial velocity is always 'b' so... \n  Awesome. So, now what I want you guys to do is, I want you to go to number two. So, I want you to put that on the white board.\n Can I read it again?\n  Well, actually, no. Let's have, Fatima, can you read number two?\n  What does the 'x' axis represent in this story? What does the 'y' axis represent in our story?\n  Okay, let's do that quickly.\n I have a question.\n  Yes.\n Did 'x', never mind, I'll wait until after this.\n  So, let's look around. So, a lot of people are getting what?\n 'X' equals time. 'Y' equals height.\n  So Markeisha, what was your question?\n I was gonna say, could 'x' be distance as well?\n  Can 'x' be distance, people?\n No.\n No. If it wanted to. \n  Why not?\n Because, it's meters per second, not meters per \n  So, does that make sense?\n \n  All right. So, now what I want you guys to do...  So, so far, let's recap what we've done so far. Can everyone generalize what we've just done in the first couple of questions?\n We set up the equation and we figured out our 'x' and y axes, in the general form.\n  Okay, right now, what I want you guys to do is, I want you guys to work on number four. Okay, someone read that out loud that hasn't read out loud yet.\n I haven't.\n  So, Leslie, you want to read? Number four?\n  From the equation that you got from question number one, show the steps on how you translate the general form into the factor form.\n  Now what I want you guys to do, I want you to turn and talk about the strategies you're planning to use to work out this problem.\n \n  Okay, you guys, I'm gonna stop class real quick. You guys, I'm gonna stop class real quick.\n  Okay, so Mary, can you just ask the question that you just asked me?\n She asked me.\n  Okay, so one of you guys ask the question that we just talked about. So Markeisha, Jamilah?\n Can we use the box to figure it out?\n Yeah, you can.\n  Why? How? Hang on. Put that back away. So, you guys. So the question is... Okay, so Autumn just asked, can she use the diamond and rectangle method as opposed to  and why?\n \n  You guys... You guys, let's listen, please. Mary. Sorry.\n You figure it out by dividing negative four point nine by all the numbers. So, if you divide negative four point nine 'x' squared, by negative four point nine, you'll get 'x' squared. 14.7 divided by negative four point nine is negative three. And then 49 divided by negative four point nine is negative ten?\n  Okay, I'll stop you right there. So, back to what I said. Okay, so the diamond-rectangle method, people. So, when you are doing this, what are you finding?\n We're finding the box.\n  You're finding the box. So, what are those things outside of the box here? What are they called.\n The factors.\n  The factors. Okay. Okay, when you're using, it seems like a lot of you guys are using the quadratic formula. What are you trying to find then?\n \n  All right. So, right now... So, Autumn. So, you have questions on that right? So, later on... So, do you mind just moving over there real quick? Because Leslie said that you got it down. So, you guys, so take two more minutes. We're gonna see both methods.\n \n So, are you done yet?\n No.\n \n  Okay, you guys stop. Okay, right now,  I'm gonna put this up right here. We're gonna put up the most common mistakes that people tend to do. Okay, so right now, so how many people got negative five and two?\n  No...no...no.\n  So, what was it?\n Negative two .\n Oh, okay, I got negative two and five. My bad.\n  Okay, so right now. What do you think was the mistake that she did?\n She didn't square it.\n  She didn't what?\n She didn't square. And then she re-fixed it.\n  She fixed it?\n Yeah, she copied mine.\n It's supposed to be negative 14.7.\n  Is that what its supposed to be?\n Yeah.\n  And is that what she's missing?\n Yeah.\n  Okay, guys, so that's one mistake that happens quite a bit. Also, let's look at... Hey, you guys, what form is this right here? What method did they use?\n Box and diamond method.\n  Box and diamond method, right?\n Okay, so, you guys, what do you call these two items right here? What is it missing?\n The number at the beginning. The negative four.\n  And what is that again? What is the name of the four point nine again? Scale factor or what?\n Acceleration!\n  Acceleration. So, you guys, if you notice, this is something that tends to be missing also. So, now we will look at...ah...\n We have the same thing.\n We all have the same thing.  So, same thing, same thing. All right. Okay. So, right now I think we looked at all the common mistakes that people tend... Oh actually,  So, now what I want is... so, how many methods do people use?\n Two?\n Okay, so tell me one what was one method? What was the method that you used?\n Quadratic formula?\n Okay, Caleb? What was another method that people used?\n The box and diamond.\n  The box and diamond, right? So, right now, I want people to explain their thinking. So, what I want you to do is, okay, since... Tiffany, since you said you did the quadratic formula, you're gonna go up and talk about it. Just talk about the process of what you did.\n \n  How are you gonna explain the process?\n  All right. So, the  \n Can we do it on this hard board?\n  Yeah. Okay. Let's do it on this hard board.\n  Make sure you talk to us, okay?\n  Okay, while you're writing things down, talk about how you're going through the process.\n So, I used the quadratic formula?\n  So, what are you doing right now?\n I'm writing it.\n  Writing what?\n The quadratic formula.\n  Okay. So you see, instead of me asking, I just want you to explain all the things that you're doing.\n Okay.\n So, you guys need some visuals... This will be your a, your b, and your c. So, you plug all this into this.\n  Okay, so let's  do it.\n  I have a question.\n  Yes.\n  What if the b is already negative?\n  That's a good question.\n \n  So, you guys, while Tiffany is doing the quadratic formula, think about what common mistakes that we just talked about earlier, and what mistakes that she may or may not have.\n \n", "filename": ["Copy of 981 MATH AYA 981 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0813072], "annotations": [["Teacher"], ["Drew"], ["Teacher"], ["Drew"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Fatima"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Leslie"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Tiffany"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Tiffany"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW04", "TW06m", "TW07", "TW08m", "TW13", "TW20", "TW24TW13", "TW24TW16"]}, "191": {"text": "  I teach in a second and third grade combination class. The students are arranged in grade-level specific table groupings. This allows students to complete any grade-level specific projects together and receive instructions in a manner that's clear to them. I also have a guided reading area. And a independent reading corner. All of the resources the students may need are located around the perimeter of the classroom leaving access to the center of the classroom, the large rug area for all of our class discussions to take place. As well as collaborative group work. Students also have available to them the reading corner area as an area for collaborative group work. They have a listening center where they access books on tape and CD. We have three computer stations where children word process completed writing projects, or they do research on the internet. But complete sentence, okay for that first part. All right, and then someone who's taking turns. So we're clear on the rubric what my expectation is when we walk around. Questions?\n If they make a mistake, do you want us to correct their English or ?\n You know what, what I think is a nice way to correct someone when they misspeak, and I do this a lot, so you might notice that I restate what someone has said. And that's part of being a good listener. So, being able to recall or restate. Something like, oh, I heard you say, and then you restate it in the way that might be more appropriate. That's a respectful way of being a listener and also a speaker when you're trying to teach and be a role model.\n I have a different idea, I think that is.\n Okay, so there's another way, \"I think that is,\" excellent. So we're going to just try this out and see how it goes. We're going to try this out again, and practice those cues.\n Are we the same number as usual?\n Yeah, okay so here we go. We're going to practice. When you get to your pictures, this is what I want you to do. Right now, I have put, I have this image of a whale on, okay can you have a seat? I need everyone sitting next to their partners right now. So what I want you to do is, looking at this picture, I want you to practice right now in your group sharing one or two things that you notice in this picture. What do you see? So I want you to share exactly physical features, and use descriptive language to talk about what you see. Question?  Hold on a second, sweetie, I just called on Jonathan. Just a second. Question? \n We're going to describe with our partner. So you're going to need to turn to your partner. Adam what did you?\n I don't really understand what that thing in black is.\n You know, it's just a shadow. It's a shadow. This one? It's just a shadow on the picture. It just doesn't look very clear the way it came out. It's the shadow on the image, okay? All right, so turn to your partner. When I ring the bell, number ones share first. When I ring the bell, number twos share. When I ring the bell, I'm going to take some of your descriptive language. Sharing what you see.   \n Number twos.  \n Okay, excellent. So I'm going to pick a stick. I'm going to go fishing in my sticks. And when I call your name I want you to share either what you saw, or what your partner saw, okay? What was the detail that was shared? And I'm going to write it up on this sticky note because I'm modeling now what you're going to do when you get to your stations. Everyone's going to get a stack of sticky notes and you're going to get an opportunity after you share to record some of your ideas of what you see. Number 10, Cesar.  Sorry? You want to ask a question? For a clarifying question?\n No, I was just making a comment. Just I don't like it when there's only like one sticky note for everyone. Because then the first group who goes there puts like every single little thing that they see. And it takes up like maybe three-quarters of the whole paper. And then the next group has like .\n Okay, so we're going to solve that problem, because each individual gets a sticky note, okay? And then you're going to choose where you're going to put it. All right, so number 10, Cesar.\n  Madelaine said that she saw white spots and one on the bottom. And she said an Orca, and she saw a very long tongue and sharp teeth.\n  She actually named the animal, which was an Orca. She saw white spots on the bottom. And what was the part about the teeth?\n  and a few sharp teeth. \n Oh sorry, and then sharp teeth. Okay, so I wrote more than one idea on this sticky note. But what you're going to do is after we do the conversation, after we walk through the stations and see the images and talk about it, then you're going to go back and record one idea on the sticky note. And put it onto the picture. So let's try one more. I'm going to turn it over. So look at the picture, and then I'm going to ring the bell, you're going to share, and I'll pick somebody else to share what they see.     \n  Okay, so who's next, number 21, Roberto.\n My partner says, oh what I said?\n  It can be what you said or what your partner said, whatever you decide. His was good?\n I said that I see a pod of Orca whales and their dorsal fins sticking up out of the water.\n  That was great. So he has two points, that he sees the pod which is how we refer to,\n  A group.\n  A group, excellent use of the vocabulary. The Orca whale, so he's named the actual type of whale. And he starts looking at the dorsal fins, which is one of the physical features. Not only of the Orca, but of what?\n The humpback doesn't.\n The humpback, that's right it doesn't have a dorsal fin. So which ones have the dorsal fin?\n All the others ones except for that one. \n  There's a couple of other ones as well.\n Blue whales don't.\n  Blue whales, good, good, good, good, good. Eyes up here. Are there any questions on what I want you to do when you go around to the different stations? Yes, Sarah.\n So how many sticky notes are we going to get? Like a couple, four or five?\n So, first I'm going to give you a chance to walk around. And then I'm going to come around and I'm going to give you some sticky notes.\n  So you're going to let us look at them and then we're going to pick which one we want and put a sticky note on?\n Yes, exactly, exactly. \n What's this? This one's cool. I see, some baleen, which means it's a baleen whale. And it looks like it has a big mouth. And the baleen looks like it is, some sort of bendy thing. And on the bottom of the baleen it's scary. And it looks like it has a big mouth which probably means it is a very big baleen whale.\n I see a baleen whale with a lot of crushed thingies. And a person's touching it. I'm not sure if it's a real whale that's alive. It might just be an exhibit.\n No, Jake.\n And , so I don't really think this is something that's underwater. \n It's part of baleen. It's like a baleen whale, there's baleen, but. \n  It looks like a Blue Whale, because it is very big. It also doesn't have any throat looms. and it has just a small bump for it's dorsal . It also looks like it's swimming very close to the top. And that also looks like it's coming up for air. \n I see a whale that a man is touching their teeth.\n I'm not exactly sure what type of whale this is, but it's a whale.\n I see someone touching part of a whale, and it might be part of a baleen . I see a whale and I think it's coming to the surface for a breath because they cannot breathe under water.\n I think that that is a baleen whale because it is, it is white and it's a little bit gray. \n I see a whale that is going up to the surface of the water, and I believe that it's a beluga whale.\n I see the whale. I think it's going to jump out the water, and then dive .\n I see a big, gigantic, beluga whale with his skin has a couple like dents and wrinkles.\n And it doesn't have a dorsal fin.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 191 LRLA EMC 191edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.221815], "annotations": [["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Cesar"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Sarah"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Boy"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW04", "TW16", "TW17", "TW19", "TW24TW14"]}, "618": {"text": "  I think that Igneous and Metamorphic, they're the least , there are two books that don't use 'em 'cause they're .\n  Well my Igneous .\n  Yeah, it . Igneous and Metamorphic cool off and react. And only a few particles came off, but I was .\n  Yeah, it's just awkward because mine was, boosting most of yours.\n  Well yeah.\n  When I did my alien, on my first try, it was 42 grade. Then now when I'm measuring it again, it was 22 grade. It .\n  Mine never changed, all it did was lost a little bit of it's rice crispies.\n  That was mine. But, I feel like Igneous rock,  like, 20.\n  Well yeah. 'Cause the weathering does a lot of things to the rock's outside. And--\n  Mine was the same as Igneous and metamorphic .\n  And so, if I'd shake it... like through weathering, a bunch of rock would fall off.\n  I haven't done anything yet. It was three. I can't wait to--\n  Oh. \n  I have to say, the one with the marshmallows 'cause it's .\n  Well for my Sedimentary, it was harder.\n  Yeah, mine too.\n  What  \n  'Cause when I did mine, only one piece of my Sedimentary broke apart, and--\n  The Sedimentary--\n  My Igneous rock--\n  It has, like almost .\n  It might be a little inaccurate since these are not real Sedimentary rocks. You have to keep that in mind.\n  Well yeah.\n  So, but what if they were real Sedimentary? Would we be able to tell what they are?\n  Yeah.\n  Obviously.\n  Do you know any Sedimentary rocks that looks like a granola bar?\n  Yes, I saw them in my yard. They're called a granola ball.\n  No.\n  That was probably granite, which is an Igneous rock.\n  For Jeanie, do we write just how many lasts? 'Cause mine must've had .\n  Okay so when I, when I did the blendering, of my Sedimentary, I lost only three grams off of my, Sedimentary rock. So I'm not sure what would happen if I add these two. \n  Because of the heat out of the, 'cause if you were to put heat to a rock like our little blue Metamorphic rocks, what would happen was the heat would melt it, and it would give pressure to stick down to the tinfoil.\n  Yeah, that's how that happens.  because this is probably the farthest off we have from a little while.\n  Yeah.\n  Like last we , and like have you ever heard of a rock that's called  Metamorphic rock?\n  Yeah.\n  It can be greasy.\n  Let's talk about why we use the models. Obviously, you're never gonna be so lucky as come across a rock that's like the taffy. Why did we use the Laffy Taffy for our model?\n  Because the heat and the pressure, the heat and the pressure would like stick together, but like a Sedimentary rock, .\n  We use our fingers to add that heat pressure. We had to simulate it somehow, we couldn't do the actual Earth process in the classroom. Do you agree with that?\n  Mm hmm.\n  Okay, so you understand why, you understand why we use that material for our model? Okay.\n  \n  Right, it probably melts. And why did we use the microwave for the Igneous rock?\n  Because--\n  What were we trying to simulate there? \n  From?\n  Magma is a really hot substance, and this is what Igneous rocks can form from.\n  Could we actually manipulate and touch magma in the classroom?\n  No.\n  No. Could we work a marshmallow?\n  Yep.\n  So we understand the connection there. We're trying to use materials, that we can bring into the classroom, but that will still simulate lava, magma, the processes. Okay? So pressure--\n  I think it has less effect of all the .\n  It had a lesser effect going through the processes of?\n  Of both.\n  Weathering?\n  And erosion.\n  And erosion, okay. Now you guys can think about this, if you didn't like the samples and examples up here that I used, you could always do it different. Food material. To make up your own experiment later. Okay?   Let's talk for a moment. Why should we measure again after our rock samples have been through weathering and erosion? Why are we measuring again?\n \n  Look at your rock samples, do they look the same as what we measured in here?\n  No.\n  No. What happened?\n  You have to measure the difference.\n  The difference, and why would there be a difference? What could we do to our rock samples?\n  \n  Changed dramatically when you did the weathering on them. \n  Let's use the same , what did you use when you pre-measured? I would keep it the same. Why would I keep it the same?\n  Because it's .\n  Can we compare centimeters to inches?\n  Yes.\n  You can? Think about that, because later when you have to come back and do the difference, how are you gonna do the difference with some centimeters and some inches? \n  How can you compare those two measurements?\n  \n  You're telling me, you wanna go centimeters here, but inches down here.\n \n  I would keep it the same. They would make it mathematically . \n  You working on your difference? Your difference in mass? This your pre-mass?\n  \n  Explain to me how you got to that.\n  Where are the books? They might add on to another sedimentary rock, 'cause it's like never ending.\n  For some reason, my Sedimentary and my Igneous rock. They both lost a half inch in length.\n  Yeah, mine too.\n  In my igneous rock grams, it lost 20 grams and my sedimentary lost 10 grams.\n  Mine lost no grams.\n  Mine gained grams.\n  Your gained grams?\n  Yeah, I had 17 grams. I had 17 grams, and then it came back to 21. And this one went up one. Because when this one went up three.\n  Maybe you should check that over. 'Cause it weathers and erodes away.\n  Well, I'm guessing that most of the bits and pieces of the other people's stuff, went into mine, and made it bigger. 'Cause, it can do that, it can. See? Right there. All around the--\n  Oh! I see it!\n  See? Other bits and pieces of other people's went into mine, and made mine bigger. \n  With mine, a bunch of bits and pieces .\n  And mine started to melt.\n  Because your observations say it crumbles apart, it's breaking apart and moving.\n  \n  Okay, what about these gaps here.\n  These gaps?\n  Yeah, how you gonna do that? \n  For some reason, my Igneous rock . \n  Into the sample?\n  It made it bigger.\n  Made it heavier? Did it have more mass after the ? Your protective sleeve's coming off. That's a good possibility, that might throw your measurements off. Did it happen to anything else? Any other sample? Now you're working on a difference in...? You gotta find the difference in length and width, and you're gonna find the difference in mass. That's interesting, you could explain that away right there. Mm hmm, isn't that the one, Igneous, the one you were saying got the strange results? You can talk to me then. \n  Well, that's probably how they make the canyons bigger. Maybe because some of the rocks, after rain and the sandstorms, they could just pound together and make a big old rock. So... Okay, so if it erodes off another rock--\n  I'm listening, are you talking about real life rocks when they really--erode away Mmhmm.\n  And it starts to rain, 'cause a lot of times it's like wind and rain. A lot of times it takes the sand away from the rain, with the rain, and here's another rock, which makes a bigger.\n  You're thinking sometimes with real life rocks, you could have actual sediment mixing in with igneous rocks? Right, do you remember how we talked about how igneous can morph back into sedimentary? Those bits and pieces are melding with igneous rock when you have that blend, where igneous is morphing into sedimentary rock, okay? So that would also cause reason for your measurements  I like where you're going with that.  Try to make that connection. You know, Unis was giving me a hard time earlier about how 'metamorphic rock's not made of Laffy Taffy. So how's this go back to rocks in real life'? Think about that. \n  Some of our videos that we were watching? About what salts quartz in these two processes. \n  You have to let the water go down.\n  'Cause the heat inside of it could've frozen. 'Cause they heat over there, we had it kinda . \n  Whoa, what's the answer? \n  19 grams.\n  19.\n  --Igneous--  \n  Igneous!\n  How could you make that? Explain it to your little sister . She's not gonna be able to understand that, she wasn't here. What could you put on your rock cycle diagram?\n \n  Okay. So you're gonna have .\n  This is 17.\n  17 for what? Igneous? What about sedimentary? \n  Tell me how Sean needs help.\n  Um, he needs help with \n  Okay.  where he's trying to find the mass of the sedimentary rock.\n  What do ya mean?\n  No, I was saying that it may have gotten darker.\n  Darker, because of the heat.\n  Yeah.\n  A lot of rocks do that.\n  Yeah.\n  But it could be jus the pink.\n  Yeah, it could be, I could write down that, it could be pink.\n  Yeah, what happened to my  metamorphic rock, is .\n  I can \n  Yeah that's because of this thing.\n   in between our finger and \n  Mine, it didn't get darker than mine though. \n  So you could add that to what you put in .\n  So how would that affect our measurements? How did it affect your width? \n  Igneous and sedimentary rock could .\n  Now talk to me though, if it's in  \n  You wanna know why those are there? Because a lot of rocks don't have protection that doesn't help them. And a lot of kids drop theirs inside their bag, which mixed with the Sedimentary.\n  It could .\n  And sooner or later if it just stays in there and rolls around, guess what it would do? It would also become a sedimentary.\n  It's just like the rocks, it's just like the rocks in life It's more similar to real life. \n  Yeah! \n  The eroded bits would stick to other rocks.\n  So I just added, like bits. \n  We have bits and pieces.\n  See, if I was to shove this in my bag and just roll it around in all of this, this would also become this, because this isn't on the mat. This would begin to stick. And when you ball it together, it makes it appear coloring to it, that show that it's inside there.\n  I think that the igneous and the metamorphic rock,  \n  After each sample, ones that were weathering and erosion.\n  So you're gonna compare your two measurements-- pre-measurement, post-measurement-- to see if there's a difference for each rock.\n  Hmm.\n  Hmm.\n  Do we have to subtract?\n  Do we? What's your key word that could tell you what to do? Difference? \n  Go show me, I know you're thinking. You just told me, what key word tells you what to do? \n  Where were we? Finding the mass? After we've done the weathering and erosion? Okay, are you gonna get started?\n  Yes.\n  Yes. Jack, are you finished with that scale? Can we use manners, please? Can we use manners? Can you say please pass the balance? \n  Talk to me guys, just for a moment, about the differences in those, in your . We've got Ashley's igneous, we talked about that.\n  I figured out for the metamorphic that changes did actually happen, because they put the sedimentary, came on to the metamorphic.\n  So we can see again, how, just, and it probably had a lot to do with our service and our bag, that's how those pieces of sediment got attached to our metamorphic rock.\n  And I think it became darker because the heat  because of the pink.\n  And because of the pink?\n  Yeah.\n  Okay, think about in real life sedimentary rock, when those levels, when those layers are smashed together. Okay, don't some of those layers change the color with all that heat and pressure? Okay, that was your metamorphic. Yes Brooke.\n  And also, you get the igneous in there, it sticks to it, and you can just put it inside there, cover the layers off, and it actually gets inside the metamorphic.\n  So you all noticed how your rock samples are very true to real actual rocks, and how they could combine with one another, and result in a completely different rock. Okay? So, on your next page where you get to make your rock cycle diagram, maybe you could use those observations and those understandings when explaining your outcome. Not the candy rock cycle, the real one.\n  \n  It says that you could use a diagram, okay? Using your textbook, Level Readers Science Journal, or the rock cycle experiment that we just completed. Anything you want to be able to explain the rock cycle. Okay?\n  \n  My igneous has gone down just a bit.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 618 GEN MC 618 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.316366], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher", "Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW05", "TW06s"]}, "192": {"text": " Okay. What objects or pictures do you see?\n I see a flag.\n A flag.\n  A sign.\n The sun.\n And the letters.\n A sign. Yeah.\n And the birds.\n There are birds over here.\n People carrying bags.\n Okay, people carrying bags.\n There's a ship.\n A ship.\n The ladies all have hats.\n Okay. The ladies all have hats on. They look like they're dressed to go somewhere, right?\n  Yeah.\n Good. All right.\n Do you want us to write it in here?\n You can copy it. I have the words spelled up here. We have Uncle Sam. We have a boat.\n Do you want us to write it?\n I'm going to have it up here. Yeah.\n Oh.\n We have a flag.\n We have this thing. What does this thing look like?\n Kind of like a witch.\n No. No.\n Yeah. It looks kind of like a witch. Something scary anyway, right?\n  Yeah.\n Broccoli.\n It looks like broccoli? Okay. Yeah, it does. It's kind of fluffy on top. I agree.\n All right.\n There are people.\n We've got people. We've got birds.\n \n Mm-hmm. So here are our objects. Uncle Sam, boat, American flag. I wrote scary devil-looking thing. If you want to put witch-looking thing, that's fine.\n I'm gonna put both.\n Traveling people and birds.\n \n I put enough blanks for a few objects, but feel free to add more than the number of lines I wrote. All right. Okay. Which of the objects-- whoops. Okay. Which of the objects do you see could be symbols?\n  The flag.\n All right. This is what I want you to do. Stop. Turn to the person beside you. Beside you, beside you, beside you. See if you can think of-- you already said flag. That's a perfect example. It is one of them. I think four of these are symbols. Not every object is going to be a symbol. So turn and see if you and your partner can come up with any more. \n \n Each pair can be that.\n \n Two different. Yeah.\n Oh. \n All right. What did we come up with?\n We came up with the top of his hat thing. It's the same as the flag.\n It looks exactly like the flag, okay? So what could Uncle Sam be a symbol of?\n  U.S.\n Of the United States. Good.\n Did you come up with one?\n The traveling people.\n The traveling people? What do you think they symbolize?\n They're from other countries.\n Yeah. They symbolize people from other countries. Good. Did you come up with one?\n The scary devil-looking thing.\n Okay. What is that?\n It's clouds in the sky?\n Okay. It looks like clouds, but why did the artist draw the clouds as a scary-looking thing?\n To get them out?\n To scare them?\n Or maybe it's the rain. They're scared of storms.\n Okay. Who is the devil-looking thing? Who is he going after?\n  The people.\n The people. What are the people running away from?\n From their other countries.\n From their other countries. So what could the cloud be a symbol of?\n Bad things.\n Immigrants?\n Yeah. They're the immigrants. What is the cloud?\n \n Yeah. Their governments from their own countries.\n Oh.\n Is coming back after them or trying to scare them, anyway. All right? Here we go. We have these four. Uncle Sam, the boat, the American flag, and the devil-looking thing. I didn't do one for the travelers, but you're right. They can symbolize immigrants. Uncle Sam symbolizes America. This is one you didn't say.\n I told you.\n The ark, this boat here symbolizes what?\n  The Bible.\n The ark from the bible. Okay. Is anybody familiar with the story of the ark in the bible?\n  Yeah.\n What did the ark do?\n It saved.\n It saved Noah, his family, and who else?\n Animals.\n And the animals.\n Oh yeah. Now I remember.\n So what do you think this boat's purpose in this picture is? What's the boat going to do?\n Save them.\n Save. Okay. So knowing that, knowing that this is an ark and knowing that this is America, what do you think? Are these people being stopped or welcomed?\n  Welcomed.\n Welcomed. And how do we know that?\n He's letting them in. He's like, come on, let's go.\n But how do we know that he's welcoming them and not telling them to stop?\n Because it's the ark.\n Because it says ark, okay? And we're connecting what we know about the ark to this picture. That is called an allusion. In English class, you talked about allusion. Allusion is when you refer to something that is famous. Some famous piece of literature. Okay? The flag stands for freedom. The scary devil-looking thing is governments from other countries. Take a second and copy that down. Okay. I'll go on to the next question. How are the words-- How do the words in the cartoon tell you what the symbols mean? Okay? We talked about this already. The U. S. Ark of Refuge are some of the words in the cartoon and they tell us that the boat is a symbol of the United States. Okay? Identify the cartoon's caption. All right. In this cartoon, there is no caption. There is no title at the top or at the bottom, but there are some words that help us understand and that's this sign. The sign says no oppressive taxes, no expensive kings, no compulsory military service. So this is the promise of the United States to the immigrants. To the traveling people. Words or phrases used in the cartoon to identify objects or people in the cartoon. Okay? What words or phrases here can be used to identify?\n I was going to say the ark.\n Yeah. The Ark of Refuge. And what does it identify?\n \n The ark.\n It identifies the ark as what in this cartoon? What is the ark?\n The boat.\n But what is it a symbol of?\n Welcoming.\n Yeah. A symbol of welcoming people, right? Or a symbol of America itself, because once you're in, you're in America. What words or phrases in the cartoon appear to be the most significant? All right? Calling the U.S. a refuge tells us people come here for safety.\n \n We'll come back to it. And here, the sign says no taxes or oppressive kings. Tell us why people left their countries.\n To get good jobs.\n Yeah. To get jobs.\n To have a better life.\n Right. What were they running away from?\n From paying taxes.\n From paying taxes. From kings. Now, any guesses about what time period people would have been running away from taxes and kings?\n 1900s.\n 19th Century.\n The 19th Century, which would be the periods were very big. Kings were a problem in some places in the world. No oppressing taxes. Even as far back as the revolutions in the 1700s, people were dealing with this, okay? So you can use clues in a cartoon to figure out when the cartoon was written and sometimes things like these signs can help you figure that out. All right? List adjectives in the cartoon and what they mean? What adjectives are in the cartoon? It's on this sign for one thing.\n Oh. The kings.\n Okay. What did they call the kings?\n Wealthy?\n What did they call kings? What kind of kings did they have? It's kind of hard to read there. Okay. Here we go. We'll do it this way.\n Controlling.\n Yeah.\n More powerful than others.\n Expensive  can't see...\n I know, I know. So oppressive means it's controlling. Expensive means they spend too much money.\n  Yeah.\n Compulsory means that you have to do something. Compulsory military service means everybody has to join the army. So some people might be running away from that because not everyone wants to be in the army.\n \n The army's a fantastic place, but not everybody wants to be there. You do understand, right?\n Yes.\n Okay. Anybody not want to be in the army?\n I want to serve my country.\n Yeah. Would you want to live in a country where everybody had to do it?\n  No.\n I want to have a choice.\n You want to have a choice. I want my army to have chosen to be there. Right? Because I don't want a bunch of people there twiddling their thumbs and not wanting to be there, okay? Okay. Describe the action in the cartoon.\n Action?\n I can't cover those.\n I forgot to put the space bar. Okay, so what's happening in the cartoon? We've already said this.\n Everybody's coming to Uncle Sam.\n And what's happening?\n The cloud is trying to get them away from Uncle Sam.\n Right. All right. What is the message of the cartoon?\n It's that we have to welcome the immigrants.\n Correct. The message of the cartoon is that the U.S. is welcoming immigrants who are trying to get away from places they don't like. What special interest groups-- now this one I remembered to put the extra thing in there so you all have to think about it. What special interest groups would agree or disagree with this cartoon? Stop and take a second. Turn to your partner. See if you can think of somebody that would like this cartoon and somebody that would not like this cartoon. Talk to you partner.\n What is it?\n Okay. A special interest group. Go ahead, keep talking. A special interest group is a group that talks to the government to try to get them to make laws for them, okay? So what kind of group would agree with the cartoon and what kind of group would not agree?\n", "filename": ["Copy of 192 ENL EAYA 192.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0409602], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW06", "TW17"]}, "115": {"text": "  Happy, tiny, small, silent, little, quiet, glad.\n  Right. Some of these words too you might not even know what they mean, but once you work with synonyms a little bit you're going to actually make your vocabulary a little better. You're going to learn what more words mean. Okay, so that'll help you read and everything. Nicolet.\n  That's silent and quiet.\n Okay, you want to come up and match those? Let me put it on pen. Okay. You have to move over a little bit. Great, okay. Is she right guys? Good. How did you know that those were synonyms?\n Because both of them mean that... Because both of them mean... Both of them mean the same thing.\n  Okay, they mean the same thing or what else, Jabril? Oh, you have another one you want to mark? They mean the same thing right. You can make up a sentence like we should be quiet in the library and then you could take out the word quiet and put silent in. We should be silent in the library. That's how you can check it to make sure of it.\n It's like a better word.\n A better word, quiet or silent. Okay, Fernando, you see one? Okay, what do you see? Oh great. Can you tell us what you have?\n Happy and glad.\n  Happy and glad. Okay, pick a sentence for those. Can you think of a sentence?\n I'm happy.\n  Because?\n Because my birthday is coming.\n Okay, I'm happy because my birthday is coming. Let's take out happy. You guys can take it and throw it away. Take out happy and put this word in.\n Glad.\n Okay, now say the sentence with glad.\n I'm glad because my birthday is coming.\n Alright, very good . Okay, you ready Jabril? You got one? Okay, what did you find?\n Smiley and little. No, small and little.\n Okay, is he right guys?\n  Yes.\n He is, very good. You started to say smiley and little, right? But then you said, wait a minute, those aren't... What is that called? Those aren't...\n Right.\n Synonyms, right? So then you remembered that word is small and little. Okay, very good. Anyone else? Who hasn't gone? Barbara.\n But there's no words.\n Is that all of them, alright good.\n  No. Tiny and little.\n Oh, small, little, and tiny, they all go together, don't they? That's right, there's three words that mean the same thing. Small, tiny, and little. Okay, so there can be more than one synonym for a word. That's a good point. Do you guys want to practice saying synonym? Cause it sounds likes it's hard to say. Let's clap it, ready.\n   Synonym.\n Let's try again.\n   Synonym.\n Let's just slow down a minute.\n   Syn, o, nym.  Syn, o, nym. \n Alright, we'll keep practicing. Okay, now we need to read these sentences and find out which ones have synonyms. Okay, let's start with this one. Nicolet, can you read that?\n The dog is angry. The dog is mad.\n  Are those synonyms?\n  Yes.\n  Which two words?\n Angry and mad.\n  Okay, you want to come on up? You're going to circle those sentences and that dog. Look at his face too. Okay, if you're writing, you could use the word mad. That's kind of, like I just call it a first grade word, sort of. You want to bet a sparkle word so you could say he's angry. You could also say he furious. The dog is furious. That's an even better word, right? A better synonym. Jabril, you want to do the next one? Okay, can you read these?\n The dog it sick. The dog is ill.\n So sick and ill, are those synonyms? Good. Oh, you're getting creative with our circles. Okay, Barbara, you want to read this one?\n The dog is sad. The dog is crying.\n Okay, are those synonyms?\n Yes.\n Well, sort of. He would be crying if he's sad. I'm not sure that they mean the same thing. Like if you said, Barbara fell down and now she is crying. Right, that's something that you do, right? Barbara fell down and now she is sad, but it doesn't really mean the same thing. It's close. You want to try this one?\n The dog is happy. The dog is glad.\n Okay, happy and glad, do those mean the same thing? What do you guys think? Yes, you agree? Okay, so then she's going to circle that one. Put a big circle around the whole thing. Okay, great. OK, who hasn't had a turn? Fernando, can you read this one?\n The dog is surprised.\n  Oh, good reading.\n The dog is--\n Scared.\n Scared.\n So surprised, see his face? Is surprised and scared, are those synonyms?\n Yes.\n Okay, who says yes? Fernando says yes. Who says no? Okay, what do you think? If I'm surprised, I just walked in and everyone's throwing me a party, I said  I'm so surprised. Would I also say I'm so scared?\n No.\n  No, I'd probably be really happy. So are these synonyms?\n  No.\n No, okay, nice job guys. Okay, let me see where I want to go. Okay. Alright, the next thing we're going to do before we do this, is I'm going to see if you can match some synonyms with a fishbowl and a fish. Who likes fish? Really? What's your favorite animal? Favorite pet? Do you have a favorite pet? Do you like ?\n Dog.\n  You like dogs?\n Cats.\n  You like cats?\n \n  Do cats eat fish sometimes?\n Yeah.\n  Uh-oh, uh-oh, well.\n They eat mouse.\n  They eat mice, right.\n Fish.\n  Well, we're going to do a fish game and you're going to do this with a partner. Okay, I'm going to ask Jabril and Barbara to sit at the back table. Hold on a minute, wait for your directions. And we are going to move those things out of the way. And you're going to see if you can match the synonyms together. The fish with the fishbowl, okay? Now be sure like when we've worked with pairs before that one person's not doing all the work and the other person is just, you know, watching. Okay, make sure if you think two words go together then you say, do you think these words, or are these synonyms? You need to talk to your partner. You need to agree, okay? So you two can go to the back table with those. Mix them all up. Mix all your fish up and put them on fishbowl pouch. Okay, and I'll come over and help you read some of the words that you might have trouble with. Okay, mix them all up. And I'm going to walk around, but I want you to try to work kind of your own a little bit with your partner. Okay, so let me help you read this word. Tease, messy, speedy, sleep, sprint. Okay, so those are your fishbowls. Run, fast, sloppy. This looks like brother, but it's bother.\n Bother.\n And doze. Doze. Okay, so you guys can sort of see what you can put together and I'll be back in a minute, okay? Make sure you're talking to each other. Do you need help reading? Stare, mad.  Friendly, scream. This is nice, angry, , yell, . So you need to talk to your partner. Says.\n  I want to put it on speedy.\n Oh, speedy, yeah that's right.\n  Hold on, she's talking to you.\n I want to put it on...\n  Friendly. Do you agree that those are synonyms? Okay.\n Can you help me with this word?\n Angry.\n Tease.\n  Tease.\n Okay, look.\n  What word means the same as tease? Did you talk to your partner about those? Make sure he agrees with what you chose.\n What was this?\n  Doze.\n Doze and sleep.\n  Are those synonyms? Okay, do you know what-- It's hard if you don't know what a word means so I can help you. Do you know what the word doze means?\n Yeah, it means that like you're tired.\n Um-hum, and you might doze off. Like if you're watching TV and all of a sudden your eyes are closed, you dozed off.\n And then sleep.\n And sleep. Okay, so do you agree with that? Which ones did you pick there?\n Scream.\n Okay.\n \n Did you ask her?\n No, I didn't.\n No, ask her.\n Is this bother?\n Yes.\n Do you know what bother and tease mean?\n They both mean like they're bothering.\n Okay, like my sister keeps bothering me. My sister keeps...\n Touching me. Teasing me.\n Teasing me, right. You can use those words kind of the same, right? Okay, so you can run around the track or you can sprint around the track. This one actually goes here. Now you have speedy and messy, sloppy and fast. Okay, what'd you find? Stare.\n This means because they both mean that they're matched and this one .\n  Scream and yell, right.\n \n  Soaked. Great. Okay, looked and stare. Nice and friendly. Angry and mad. Wet and soaked. Yelled and screamed, awesome. Okay, bring your fishbowls back over. Okay, how'd everybody do over here?\n  Good.\n Okay, everybody choose one bowl and one fish. Just one that you think you can make a sentence up with. Okay. So you can choose any bowl with a matching fish and you have to make up a sentence where you're going to use both words, both synonyms. Okay, Barbara, you ready? What did you find? Which two words? Tell us your words first.\n Friendly and nice.\n  Okay, so are you ready to make up a sentence?\n I am nice and friendly.\n  Okay, you put them in the same sentence. Does anybody have a way that she could make her sentence different, because nice and friendly could mean anything. You have an idea?\n This time I'm using friendly.\n  Okay.\n I am friendly.\n  How about a new classmate?\n Yeah, a new classmate.\n Okay, so that's using friendly. Now you're going to take out this word and use the synonym, I am?\n I am nice to everybody in my--\n  To the new--\n New student.\n  Classmate, right. You use the same words in your sentence. You just are going to change your synonym. Okay, good job, very good job. Okay, Nicolet. Show us your words first. What do you got?\n Doze and sleep.\n  Okay.\n I'm using the doze. Doze means that I am...\n  You can put I-N-G at the end if you want. Like dozing.\n I am dozing out in the car.\n   Okay. I am dozing out in the car.\n And then I am sleeping in the car.\n  Okay, did she do that right?\n Um-hum, yes.\n  It makes me think of when you're on a long trip, right?

Sort of an initial response, or something that's been on your mind, or a place we can go in the play to start this conversation?\n  In the last act, when Emilia and Iago, or Iago's been caught, and Emilia is piecing together all of these things that Iago's done, how it all works, and she's telling the others around him what he's done, he keeps telling her, \"Be quiet, this isn't your place to talk, \"you shouldn't be here.\" But, whereas most stereotypical women would have just kind of followed what their husband wanted, and just you know, kind of been in the background, Emilia actually stands up and says what she thinks is right.\n \n  Yeah, okay.\n What  also talked about was how Desdemona kind of juxtaposes that in that she's like the very stereotypical housewife, to the point at which she refuses to even like blame her husband for killing her, so we kind of, it's interesting how those two characters are just...\n  To touch on the racism part, I would have to say it's not, and at least if it is, that isn't the main focus of the play. I'd say that it's focused more on these complex characters and their web of lies, and the plot itself isn't focused on, if it is, I think  because I don't really think it is.\n  I kind of agree with Chloe. I don't think that Othello is a racist or sexist play. It does have racism and sexism in it, but that's because it was written by William Shakespeare in a time when that was the norm. You can't really look at it as a modern person, because we think of racism and sexism so differently from the audience it was intended for. They thought of it as more of the norm, so it does seem more normal. Like it seemed believable and normal to them, because that's just how their society was.\n  Then it also kind of looks at like how racism sort of caused it, like Iago hates Othello, and one reason that he gives is that he's black and he doesn't deserve his position, and he kind of uses race to his advantage to do bad things. So it's kind of looking at, it's not racist, it's looking at racism and sexism, and saying like how they can be used and manipulated, you know?\n  Yeah, I kind of agree with you. I think this play is really about like taking advantage of people any way you can. So like if you have something on them, like they're a different color, or if they're a different sex, then you can use that to your advantage by like putting that as an excuse almost, to take advantage.\n  Let's return to that. Raise your hand if Iago was your favorite character in this class. Come on. I mean, this is a, I have to say, I agree. I would raise my hand to that question, which I find troubling, because I certainly agree with some of the opinions that I'm hearing here, that we have this interesting contrast between Emilia and Desdemona, as two different ways women can live with male violence, and we also have this examination of how racism and sexism are used as part of the plot to take down Othello. But at the same time, I have to say, I think that it feels to me like the play is set up for us like Iago more. Iago talks to us, he lets us into his world, into his mind in a way that nobody else does. So I'd almost feel like we can't blame ourselves as the audience for identifying with him, for secretly making part of us rooting for him, or he even made me sort like glorying in his intelligence and his capacity for manipulation and just his power. And I wonder what we do with that, because if you walk away from this play being like, \"I love Iago!\" Then aren't you also kind of saying, in a way, celebrating what he's done? Do you agree with me? Disagree with me?\n  I think his ability to like, his like logic, and how he like plans things, like how he like manipulates a lot of situations, and how he like schemes to like use people's like baggage, I guess, to his advantage, is kind of like I guess like the way he uses it isn't a good way, but like if you could use it in a different way, I guess it like could be viewed as like a good thing. So, \n I think there's a difference between like celebrating what he's done, and just appreciating like the amount of thought and like intelligence that he has in using it in a bad way, because like you can like Iago, and like him for different reasons than, \"Oh, I like what he's done, \"I like how he destroyed this person.\" It can be just, you know, \"I realize that \"this is a very smart person, \"and someone I really would not want to be on his bad side.\" But like you just sort of, you realize like how much, I guess yeah, I'll just use the word appreciate again. You just appreciate like how much, you understand his mind, and it's just really interesting, rather than you love him.\n Yeah, I think it's more like, sometime's it's fun to like root for like the evil character. Because you wouldn't actually do it, like if you play video games like Grand Theft Auto,  Like you kill the hookers, it's not like--  you would have to do that, it's just that it's fun. \n  Oh my God! \n  Well, it doesn't surprise me that Iago's the one that most people come away from the play with being like, \"Yeah, he's so great, he's so interesting,\" right? Because like he's the only character that you actually get to know. Everyone else just kind of like dies. They get drunk and like stab people, or they cry. That's pretty much what everybody else does, and then Iago's the one who like lets you in, lets you know what he's thinking, when he's bringing specific elements, like with each person in the play, he's different from each person, and you can see that through the play.\n Well, as she was saying, like how everyone else was crying and like going crazy, or like either having an awful time or having a good time, like they still trust Iago, even though he's standing there not doing that with them. I mean, just like the way he's able to still convince them whenever he's not, he doesn't seem like he's on the, like he convinced them that he's on their side, but he's not actually doing everything they are, or he's not really doing anything to show them that's he's isn't feeling what they're feeling. Alex?\n I have a quote, I guess. It's at  around there. \"And their palates both for sweet and sour, \"as husbands have, what is it they do \"when they change us for others? \"Is it sport? I think it is. And doth affection breed it? \"I think it doth. Is't frailty that thus errs? It is so too. \"And have we not affections, desires for sport, and frailty, \"as men have? Then let them use us well, else let them know, \"the ills we do, their ills instruct us so.\" So it's kind of like talking about how the men control the women, and so I guess like that's like the sexism of the day, or like of that era, and like this is Emilia, she's talking to Desdemona, and she's talking about how like men control them, and all their thoughts are kind of implanted by the men, like Emilia, like she got the handkerchief because her husband told her to do that, and they're all just really obedient and everything. Chloe?\n  I mean, I think that, yeah it has to do with the time period, as far as the sexism in the play or whatever, but I mean because that it's just the way it was, but I think that when you look at the female characters in the play, like Emilia, she turns out to be one of the most influential characters, and she's the one that takes down the bad person. It's her that takes down Iago, pretty much, because she tells him the truth, and then something that none of the men could do, or even question. Then the other thing I would say is that the women's loyalty to each other, especially Desdemona to Emilia, because it's back earlier in the play, I don't actually have it, but Emilia, I mean, Desdemona sings a song earlier in the play, something, \"Willow, willow, willow,\" some more stuff about the song, and then when Emilia's dying, she sings a line from that exact same song, and she says, she references, \"my mistress death.\" So I think a lot of it shows how the women stick together.\n It's also kind of like, I mean, I agree with you, and I mean it's not sexist, it looks at sexism, because I mean you see how Desdemona is the stereotypical woman of that time, and she kind of does what her husband tells her to, she doesn't rebel against him, she is completely loyal to him, regardless of how he treats her. I mean, he's hit her, and she just accepts it. Even when he kills her, she takes the blame and doesn't rat him out, and it just kind of, you have problems respecting her because of it. Like I mean, she's a good character, but you just can't, it's really hard to respect someone who just accepts everything that is done to her like that. Then you have to juxtapose it with Emilia, and she was a really influential character, and is able to rise above, and kind of try to take down her own husband and go against it. It's kind of looking at sexism and saying like, you know, which is better for you? Which do you like more? Look at how the sexism and the roles of women has affected Desdemona, and then how Emilia's been able to rise above it.\n  Can I jump in?\n Yeah.\n I definitely agree with you, but my thoughts are also going back to Act I, Scene III, because I think at the beginning of the play, Desdemona is very much not a stereotypical woman. She has married the man she loves, defying her father. Knowing her dad wouldn't like it, she ran off and married him anyway. When Othello's talking about how he won her heart, it was by telling the stories of the wars, and it's actually  very interesting, because it says that Desdemona would seriously . She would be very interested in these stories, even to the point where she wished she had been born a man. Then, when Othello says, \"I have to go to war,\" and the Duke says, \"Let's like Desdemona \"stay at her dad's house,\" Desdemona says, \"No, I married this man \"to be with him. Let me go to the war, also.\" So at least at that scene, I think that she's a model of a very, very active woman who wants to go to war with her husband, she wants to be with her husband. When Othello comes out in Act II, Scene III to stop the fight between Cassio and Roderigo, Desdemona comes out, too, and says, \"What's going on, what's wrong?\" And Othello says, \"Come away sweetie, let's go back to bed.\" Right? I certainly agree that there's a passivity in Desdemona by the end, but I don't know if I see that so much at the beginning. Go ahead.\n  I agree, I think that like sometimes Desdemona wants to be the stereotypical woman, and then like other times, she wants to be the like \"rebel,\" kind of, because like Mr. Proctor said, like she completely rebels against her dad at the beginning, and then also like, she's not the stereotypical woman, because like every single man like in the play has admitted that she's the most beautiful woman, that they want her and all this stuff, and so she has some power over them, too. But yeah, I just think it's interesting how like there are scenes where she's the complete like stereotypical housewoman, and then other times, she's like completely passive.\n Even though it's been brought up that she defied her father to marry Othello, she's still, I feel like she's still very like part of that time period, as far as the role of women, because even though Othello wasn't her perfect husband in the eyes of her father, she still jumped from the control of one man, her father, to another man, her husband. So, Tanya?\n  Okay, so about Desdemona, I think that like even though she did that stuff, she still was a stereotypical woman. Like we said before, those women, they're supposed to be obedient to their husbands, so like whenever she does kind of like rebel and do something different from, or like kind of jump in to the conver- like Mr. Proctor was saying, like those examples, she's doing it for Othello. She jumps in, like she goes to war to be with him, and then she comes in like whenever he's in trouble. And then, the thing about Emilia is she's doing stuff for herself. Like in Act IV, Scene III, yeah, that's what we read, she's talking about how it's just like, she would cheat on her husband once. It's just like she says, \"The world's a huge thing, \"it is a great price for a small vice.\"\n", "filename": ["Copy of 114 ELA AYA 114edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.1381], "annotations": [["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Chloe"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Boy"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Chloe"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Tanya"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW06", "TW07", "TW08", "TW24TW16"]}, "116": {"text": "  In my classroom, each student has their own individual workbench with a set of hand tools in the drawers, where they also may store their art and they've each made a back splash of art inspirational images. In the corner of the room, I have a resource area including images of art, books and magazines, a computer with an internet connection, and examples. I have a board where I give notes and it has a calendar with the semester at a glance. I have a demo table where we meet for discussions and group demonstrations. In the corner of the room, there's acid etching done safely with rubber gloves and goggles and a rubber apron. In front of that there's soldering with a acetylene tanks chained to the cabinet and a good ventilation system above, and also, eye protection and gloves. The sink area includes an emergency eyewash station and soaps. In the corner of the room, you see a fire extinguisher, a buffing machine, a hammering area done safely with a stump to limit the percussive nature of each blow, and ear protection, a drill press done safely with eye protection and gloves, an emergency eyewash station and shower, and first aid kit. In here, we have an enamelling area above banks of labeled cabinets with ventilation. And in the front, we have a bulletin board with notices and class rules and another fire extinguisher. This is another reason why people might own jewelry or want to have jewelry. Now this isn't jewelry per se You know what these are?\n Coins?\n Coins. There's such an interesting iconography of coins. I love the patterning that happened when he cast them. I mean, I just think its... You've got the horse. You've got the man. Some sort of a symbol. I don't really know what all the symbols are, but you could really use a lot of this. And do research symbols like for the production project that is coming up. And here people have even made jewelry out of the coins. And here art is an example of, in north Africa, a lot of times women, traditional women, it's probably changing now, but I don't really know how much it's changed or not changed. This picture is from 1988 or something, so it's in the past. But they would get a lot of their wealth from their family given to them as jewelry. And they'd wear it everyday. And it might seem ridiculous to us, you can do your farming, you're going about your business, cooking and you're wearing all that craziness, but that way it's on them, they have it, if something happens to their husband, nobody can take it away because it's on their body. It's protected. It's also very obvious. If the husband were to steal the money, and take it away, they would know because she's not wearing it. So he would be shamed. So it's sort of... it's like the dowry, the money comes into the family from the woman's parents, but it's also to help protect the woman. It's not just... it's not just to go to the husband. So I think it's amusing that they're wearing it.\n I thought they weren't allowed to wear makeup.\n Well, it depends in what part of-- where you are. I mean, are you thinking who is they?\n I'm thinking Iran and stuff, and north Africa.\n Right. Iran, there's different sects of Islam and what people believe as really strict is different. In this, north Africa... Iran's more in the Middle East, getting closer... I mean, does it even... even in Asia, it might even be Asia.\n No, it's not in north Africa.\n It's not in Africa. So this is like... north Africa, there's a lot of tribal groups that were nomads in the desert. It's all intermixed. And people in southern Africa, like in Sudan are predominantly Islamic and they have a different take on it, too. So maybe in Iran it's frowned upon as vanity, but...\n The Muslim culture requires women to cover their faces. It's not Muslim religions that only...\n It's Arabian.\n That's very good, Chloe. Very, very astute.\n It's there traditions. It's not required by the religion, it's a cultural thing.\n That's good. That's a good clarification. I didn't think of it that way. So also, this redeemable investment or wealth, people like to and they have people over for dinner.\n Golden silverware?\n On the right, that was the silverware of Marie Antoinette.\n I've never heard of gold silverware.\n So gold, I know, they're eating on gold. And it can't be 24 carat, because it would be too soft. But it's probably a gold alloy. And there's also cases of people when times get tough, melting down their silverware.\n So they can have the...\n Yeah, and you use that as your... it's like people nowadays are investing in gold. They're buying gold bars, because it's like you own something. You see it. It's not just a piece of paper that says you own something.\n Yeah, I think there's commercials about buying gold.\n And this is a chalice through the church. The church accumulated a lot of wealth, specifically, the Catholic church during the Medieval times. And they would have it made into these things like the chalice for the blood. Okay, attraction and beauty. This is pretty obvious, because where do people usually wear jewelry?\n On their necks and faces and...\n Yeah, yeah, to draw attention, I think, to the face usually is a big deal. And also, this is an example of a Cartier necklace that was a gift from a man to a woman. So a lot of times, it's with the idea of love, or commitment, romantic love. Here we have Indians from India, and these are things that you can buy. This is just off of that. So this is like the traditional wedding where you've got kind of an inexpensive version, perhaps, that you can buy. There's all sorts... there's all levels of expense that you can buy. And here we are again with north Africa. Just kind of thinking about the different ideas of what is beautiful and what isn't beautiful. I don't know. How many of you have tattoos? Any of you have a tattoo?\n I wish.\n Okay, I mean you're a little bit young. Right? Do you think you might want a tattoo at some point?\n Yeah, my friend has a whole entire paragraph on her back.\n Really? Do you like it?\n Yeah, it's really pretty, but I wouldn't want something like that. Yeah.\n I don't remember what it says... Something, it has to do with swimming, I think.\n It's like swimming.\n In some way. It's a really good quote, though.\n Yeah, she looks like that girl from Avatar.\n You know, I haven't seen Avatar, but as a movie designer, James Cameron, what do you think he was looking at to get inspiration for the movie?\n Probably... \n If you, I mean, does anybody like Star Wars? That was a popular kind of thing. But you know, I always wanted the hair braids. \"Mom, mom, please.\" She's like, \"Your hair isn't long enough. That was a movie. They had... it was a wig.\" I was like, \"Do it. Do it.\"\n I braid my hair, put beads in it sometimes.\n There are cultures that wear their hair like that. So it's like nothing is sort of new under the sun. People are reinventing what's already happened.\n I always wanted it just like Pocahontas that's the entire story. \n The second time I saw it, I was like, \"Oh, this is really bad.\" One thing, they represented it wrong, that's like the reason they were there because it was very valuable...\n Oh, so you're thinking it could have been a little more creative?  \n You know, the first time you see it, it's so good. And then the second time you're like, \"Hey, now that I've seen this...\"\n So it's good to critique pop culture to determine. If you get a job in the movies, how would you do it better or differently?\n I'd do a different plot. I'd be more creative. \n Okay, yeah, we better... I'm gonna keep moving on. All right? Okay, so here we have ancient Egypt on the left and we have Miss South Carolina 2000, I can't remember, 2004, 2006, recently. Isn't it interesting how similar the eye, the eyeliner, the long eyebrow, the hair coming down, the crown? You know, I mean...\n I think the eyebrows .\n Well, she doesn't have the... \n I'm trying to create a bead kind of thing.\n Okay.\n Melting the stuff Drew was using for his corset together.\n Oh, the screen? So you're melting the screen? Oh, interesting. So how will you use that in your... ?\n I'm thinking I can use it in attaching, because I think it would look cool if there was something kind of like that, not gold and shell-ish.\n Okay. Okay, well, do you want to go look at your stuff? Or do you want to... or you feel like you need to finish that?\n Oh, no, that's fine. \n There appears to be no blue stuff.\n Oh, the pickle? It's new.\n Oh.\n It only gets blue from the copper, so it, it does have pickle in it. It's just fresh and new. So you could, you could... see that little yogurt container? You can put it in that, and that has holes in it, and then you can just kind of let that float. Just kind of put a little in there. Like tip it. Yeah, that's good. Okay, yeah, let's go look at your... Oh, should we look at those? Would you rather do those, or... Okay, let's go...  Sorry, we're going outside now.\n Okay. \n Oh, wow. What do you think?\n I like them. I really like them as not a shell color, because they don't seem...\n Can I touch it? Sorry, I touched it before I asked you.\n I think once you like...as I did, just find the shell along the stream.\n Right, you're transforming it. I really like the shell of the spray paint too, because it helps tie it in with the metal. It makes... well, it's metallic spray paint, so it seems really metal-y, yeah. Right. Cool. And it makes it a little bit more blingy. You know?\n And I like how it reflects the light, all the cracks, and stuff.\n Yes, it gives it a unifying presence instead of having all that color variation. Especially if you think about having one necklace that has many shells on it. Then this unifies them. It makes them probably a little bit more wearable with people's clothes. Do you think? About how would you, how will you attach... are you thinking of using these in one group? Or are they more pendants?\n I think they're more like pendants, and I was gonna poke a hole.\n Okay.\n Like two holes in them, and I was gonna use a bunch of different strings together. So it's kind of like. . .and they're right there. And maybe bead it, a bunch of beaded strings.\n So really, this is like one necklace that's... or is it many necklaces that people can layer?\n It's just one necklace.\n Okay, all right. Well let's... can we go look at your sketch book, too? The other thing is, next time it would be better, I think, to drill the hole first before you paint it.\n Okay.\n Because I'm afraid the paint might scratch in the process of drilling the hole.\n I was going to just poke a hole with a needle.\n Can you do that?\n I think so. I mean, they're really a lot more soft than metal.\n Oh, okay, well try it, and see if it works. But I have a diamond drill bit. It can drill and that's what Drew has been using to drill his glass and stuff.\n Okay, and also, most of these already have holes.\n Oh, yeah, because of the creature that eats the muscle.\n Yeah.\n I love the hole that's already in there, yeah, okay. All right, let's go look at that. These probably need to dry a little more.\n Yes.\n Okay, okay, let's go in.\n There's only five more minutes on here.\n Okay, that's good. We'll get this and that'll be okay. \n Oh, look at that. See, that's amazing to me, because whenever I find coquinas, I guess I find the live coquinas. I've never seen the shells, like just the shells. But they all have a hole. This is a great find.\n I got my back so sunburned gathering all of these on the beach.\n Yes.\n Because they all lay next to each other in the sand.\n And when you, I mean, now do you have sketches of how these might be transformed into jewelry?\n I'm not sure yet, because...\n Here, I'll come over... is this better like this?\n Yeah.\n I could use like... I could put them all together on one string, on one necklace. Sort of like the coral. But I don't know. I don't think I have enough for that from reproduction.\n Well, you have a lot. What might be better, right, because, you're right. Because then they would nest. Right? If you just put with cubicle, then they don't take up much space. What if you made a bunch jump rings with thin wire, and then you have a little jump ring that would go through each one. And that could put... see how you have sort of charms on your chain? You could... these could also be sort of like charms hanging down, and you could layer them maybe with a jump ring, could have a little chain. And it could hang down to vary the length or, or you said that you like to use... did you make your necklace that's woven there? That's, okay, you, but you know how to sew? So could you sew them on something?\n I could, yeah.\n I mean, I have some leather strip, and that would be keeping with natural materials. So that might be interesting. I don't know. I... well, I think what you need to do is to experiment, sew some, do some metal through some, and then maybe lay some out. And you can see how Chloe has hers laid out in that box, so that she can keep it. I think you'd need a box or a tray, and you could sort of lay it out so you can start to see the composition of them.\n Yeah.\n Now what are these?\n Those are... \n Oh, and these are a dove's feathers.\n They're so elegant.\n Yes.\n Now do you have your sketch book? Can we look at the sketch on how you thought you might do this? \n Here, I think I got it.\n Here you go. I could do this with the shell.\n Oh, because that's hanging off. And then what is this round ring part?\n I'm not sure. It could just be like a round, golden...\n It could be a soldered ring of metal, like brass, wire soldered together. Is this an earring?\n Yes.\n Okay.\n That may be for these.\n Right.\n That was... that's what I was planning to do with the shell. For that, I could do a bunch of different strings, or I could just do one string and put two of these sort of up the string, or something.\n Right, right, asymmetry. Okay, I like it. And then this is the feather?

Anassia, can you come up and show us where you think one should be? \n  Alright so, what I think is, I don't know if I'm right or wrong or whatever, but I thought kinda one is there. Do you guys see it?\n  No \n  OK back, can you give us a reason why?\n  OK, well it says David had drived back to pick up his credit card that he forgot at the restaurant, so I kinda think that from home, the restaurant must be close, that's why he took the chance to go back to get his credit card. We don't know if he has money on him, ya know? It could depend on circumstances, but I think that the restaurant was hella close, that's why he went back and went back home.\n  OK, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. wait. OK. So, honestly who has that opinion? So you think one is at the very beginning\n  Mmmhmmm.\n  of his trip? OK, can we have someone else draw another number one that is in a different place? Anassia, can you pick someone?\n  Overwhelming. You. \n  I put it right here. Right there.  Right there.\n  OK, can you give us a reason?\n  He's driving and then he goes to the restaurant, and then he's driving away. No! This is the restaurant right here, and then he's leaving and he's like, \"Oh snap, I left my credit card.\" Then he goes back and then he's driving away. That's it.\n  OK wait, so whose idea do we agree with? Sidius or Anassia?\n  Sidius\n  - OK, but we still have to convince Anassia because she still thinks it's at the beginning, right?\n  I thought it was at the beginning too.\n  You did? Who convinced you?\n  Myself.\n  Yourself? \n  OK, so if David is driving back to the restaurant, then should his slope be what? What should his slope be?\n  Negative.\n  If he's going back to the restaurant? Right, because if I'm travelling this way, my slope's getting bigger, my distance is getting farther, But wait, I turn back so my slope has to be?\n Negative.\n Negative. So do you think one is when the slope gets negative?\n  Yeah.\n So are you convinced now Anasstia? That it has to be negative for him to go back?\n  Yeah.\n So are we OK with erasing that first one?  Well I have to erase all of it anyway. \n Oh OK, sorry. OK. So one should be where he's going back, right, where he's going negative, OK? Alright.  Is there a real end to it?\n Well we're going to see once we get through them.  Alright.\n So, Sidi, can you pick the next person to show us where number two should be?\n  No hands?\n  I would put two here.\n  Can you explain why, Candy? Wait, just give us an explanation.\n  Yeah, because he said that his car breaks down so he goes back so the slope is negative. He went back.\n  Close to his house.\n Yeah, near his house, but then it's near the beginning so the bilaterals have to be near zero. Because the line there represents the distance from his home, right?\n  I've got a question.\n OK\n You know how it says he is told a way to a repair shop near his house? We're looking at his car, not looking at the tow away car, aren't we? So wouldn't it be considered constant since his car is moving?  - So I guess the car is on the tow truck, right? So now, wherever the tow truck goes, the car has to go, right?\n  Yeah\n  Does anyone have a different place for number two?\n  No\n  So we all agree that two, no, do you want to put two in a different place? Put it in a different place. Let's see what you think. Put it in a different place, let's see what you think. Go.\n  I was thinking of putting it right here. That's what I was thinking.\n  That's what I thought too.\n  Can you explain why? Why?\n  Because he says that his car broke down and was towed back to his house. So I was thinking that the first sentence, so his car broke down. So if he was not going anywhere, then the time was going then constant, so if, as you see the time, his speed never changes while the time is just going down. That's what I think.\n  That's wrong. \n  We don't say that's wrong, we say, \"Well, I disagree. Well.\" So convince him otherwise.\n  Because the car is still moving, and if you look really, really closer at the graph, the last point isn't directly on the girl so we can assume that since it says the the repair shop is near his house that the ending point would have to be somewhere near zero. Also, if it was constant, that means he would just be in one spot, but it's clearly saying that he's being towed back towards the repair shop, so he's in motion, like the slope is showing distance and not speed. Well the graph is showing that the slope is going somewhere.\n  So can I say two things? One thing, so it's a different interpretation of this problem, right? So if he was broken down and the car was just staying there, then would this be a good place for two?\n  Yes.\n If the car was just staying there because distance is not changing or is changing? It's not changing, right? Because time is going on, but distance is staying the same. However, number two says he's going to the repair shop close to his house. So is he just staying in one place? No, right? So he's gonna go back home, so if he's going back home so this slope would be negative or positive?\n  Negative.\n Negative. And it's going, here's home, right? So where does he go back home? Or very close to home? Here, right? Are you convinced Danny?\n  Yes.\n OK, let's erase the other number two. But Danny, thank you for being brave because I could understand that interpretation. Alright, Danny, can you pick someone to put number three on the graph?\n  OK, number three is over here.\n  I disagree.\n  Wait, wait.  We haven't even heard her explanation. Wendy, what's your explanation why?\n  Because it's stopped for gas and got a quick bite to eat it's kinda constant here so it can be stopped.\n  So why not the long one?\n  Because he's in the restaurant, I suppose.\n But then\n So if one is here, if one is here, it has to be in the restaurant then, right?\n Well then one is over there, so then why would three be all the way over there?\n One is here, right?\n No, no, no. One is all the way at the beginning.\n No.\n Sorry, that's \"Y.\"  But then it says that he got a three.\n Yes, but it's here.\n Yeah, he ate there, so wouldn't that be the one? Like wouldn't that be where he gets his gas?  Number three said that he went to eat, but it doesn't say where did he eat. Maybe he just eat at that restaurant that he mention about.\n  Yeah, maybe he went a bit farther, and said, \"OK, let me go somewhere else,\" so that's why.\n  So what did he do here?\n  Eat and gas. \n It doesn't take that long to eat. \n  One hour? People take a bit to longer to fill up on gas and then they can't just eat while they're getting gas. Oh let me eat while I'm getting gas.\n  OK, so are we going to take a longer time at the restaurant or a longer time at the gas station?\n  The restaurant.\n The restaurant. So do we want the slope to be zero for a long period of time or just for a short period of time?\n Short\n Shorter than wherever you pick where the restaurant is, right? So we haven't gotten to the restaurant yet, have we?\n No.\n No, OK. So could three be the place where he stops and gets gas? Could it be?\n  Possibly. We don't know if quick bite meant one hour or meant half an hour.\n Or maybe it meant  five minutes?\n Yeah you know, you never know. So if we interpreted five minutes, gas and quick bite, quick sandwich. Could we put three at that place?\n Yes.\n Why?\n  Because the slope is almost constant for a short period of time.\n  I think that at three, he went back to the restaurant to get his credit card.\n  Maybe the gas station is near the restaurant. \n  Why you make this so difficult?\n  That's possible, though, right? I'm like thinking of putting at the beginning?\n Here?\n Here is four.\n  Wait, wait, wait. Don't go on four yet.\n  But I think the three should be before one. Because you can't just eat in the restaurant and then you eat a quick sandwich, \n  OK, we're going to do this because I like the debate you're having, but I want groups to think about it individually, and then we're going to come back. but I want to put one thing for sure on the board. OK, so If, if, if, if. If, If this is definitely Let's say this is definitely where David stopped to eat. OK, so this is where David is eating.  Eating as in, in the restaurant?\n Eating at the restaurant, yes. So here David is eating for a long time at the restaurant, OK? A long, long time. So that's the longest, is this the longest time where the slope is flat? Yeah. So we're all gonna agree right now that this is where David is eating at the restaurant. So this is where David is eating at the restaurant, can you put all the other numbers in a logical place? Because I hear you guys talking about logic. Like he can't go to the gas station before he does what?\n Goes to the restaurant and gets his credit card.\n OK, so, I see that's one logical statement so, in your groups, I'm gonna give you five minutes for this. Can you put one, two, three, and four in a logical place and have a good argument for it? OK.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 111 MATH AYA 111edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.160758], "annotations": [["Teacher"], ["Anassia"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["Anassia"], ["teacher"], ["Beth"], ["teacher"], ["Anassia"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["class"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Class"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Anasstia"], ["Anastassia"], ["Anasstia"], ["Anasstia"], ["NaN"], ["Sidius"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["Candy"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Classroom"], ["Teacher"], ["Classroom"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["Danny"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Wendy"], ["NaN"], ["Wendy"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Wendy"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Wendy"], ["NaN"], ["Wendy"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW06", "TW08", "TW11", "TW17", "TW24"]}, "113": {"text": " Okay guys, yesterday we talked about three key vocabulary words that we mentioned, we studied, we found definitions for. Those words were adaptation, there's habitat and community. Okay, adaptation is the first word. Who can tell me something about adaptation? Karina.\n Adaptation is how animals act, like the howler monkeys, they howl so they can tell other monkeys that they are in danger, so they can survive\n Okay, so they can survive, right? Adaptation helps them survive. And then, habitat. Who can tell me what habitat is? Ernesto.\n Where you live.\n Okay it's the environment where they live. It's the surroundings, okay? It's the trees, it's the plants, it's the ground, and it's the climate that they live in. And, the last one is community. Okay, so, if we're thinking about animals, what makes up a community for these animals? Who can tell me? Sergio.\n The community\n What makes up a community? It's not the environment\n The animals?\n It's all the animals. Do we have just one animal in the community? \n We have many, we have many. It could be very many. Okay, we're going to on, and I'd like you to listen to this sound. Shhhh. Just listen to this sound.  Okay, you may have, and you can hear this sound at night. Okay, what I'd like you yo do right now is tell me one thing that you know about this animal, okay. If you know the name of this animal, go ahead and write that down too. First of all. let's just write it in our \"K\". Just put it under for \"K\". What do you know about that animal? Just write it down first, then we'll talk about it. I'd like you to discuss what you know also. Talk to a neighbor. Okay, this is what you know, so you are going to be looking at that. What is something you know about that animal? Okay? Tell your neighbor \"What do you know about this animal?\" Just tell a neighbor. \n Tell a neighbor what you know. \n Tell your neighbor, Eddie, what you know. What do you know? You can talk out loud, guys.  Okay, small ears, okay. All right, so write that down. Okay, now after that go to what you want to know. Go to the \"W\". What do you want to know about this animal? By the way, what animal is this?\n An owl.\n It's an owl. It's a Great Horned Owl, okay. Now, what I'd like you to do, you want to put this information. Yea, what do you want to know. So, write one thing about what you want to know. What do you want to know? Tell a neighbor, \"What do you want to know?\" Sergio.  You don't have to whisper, you can say it.  How old an owl can live? Okay, good. Good, okay. Now, one thing I want you to think about. Let's listen to this sound again, okay? Listen to the sound again.  Any predictions, and you can just tell me, without writing them down. What do you think that-- Why does the owl make the sound that it makes? Yea\n Maybe to warn other owls.\n Warn other owls? Anything else? Yea, Ernesto.\n To communicate.\n And to communicate, that's right. Okay, let's take a look a page twenty-three. Okay, we're going to look at text structure on page 23. This is the Great Horned Owl. And, I'd like everyone to put your finger on the title for this animal, the Great Horned Owl. Just put your finger so I know you know what the title is. Next, I'd like you to put your finger on the caption. Okay, and can I have one person read the caption? Let's have Karina read the caption.\n Owls have large eyes to help them see in the dark.\n Okay, very good. Then we have, underneath the title of the Great Horned Owl, We have what I call bullet points. We talked a little bit about them. And, put your fingers on the bullet points there. And, let's have Ernesto read those bullet points.\n Bird found in North, Central, and South America. Live in the canopy and understory.\n Understory, very good. And we live in what continent? Eddie, what continent do we live in?\n North America.\n North America. So, we'll find these, and actually I will usually hear these at night. And usually hear them kind of in the winter time. All right, let's have the first paragraph. Eddie, why don't you continue?\n The Great Horned Owl has no ears, but can hear anyway. It can also see very good, even on the darkest night.\n Okay, and the second paragraph, Makayla.\n An owl hunts for food at night from high in the air. When it hears a mouse move or squeak, the owl swoops down upon it.\n Swoops, okay very good. Okay, now we've read about the Great Horned Owl. I'd like you to tell your neighbor, one thing that you learned new about this owl, that you are going to put down under the \"L\". What is one thing that you learned about the owl?  Okay, so write something down that you've talked about with your partner or your neighbor. Now we're going to continue working in partners here and I'm going to give you something to take a look at. And I'm going to have you guys, just close your books for a second. After you're done writing, close your books. Okay, I'm going to give each pair or each little group one of these sticks. I want you to look at the stick carfeully and look how an animal might have changed or interacted with the stick, okay? So take a close look at it, all right? And, take a look at it, and then I'd like you to put down what you know about that stick, okay? There are, yes you can see that some insects have interacted with the stick also. But what is something, look at the ends of the stick, and let's put down something we know about what an animal might have done to this stick. Okay, just write it down or tell your neighbor. Tell your neighbor.  Yeah, he bit the stick on here. But did he actually cut it? Was he able to bite it?\n Yes Yeah he was, he was. Okay, all right, now who can tell me what animal this might be? Karina.\n A beaver.\n It is a beaver and you will find these in this area. What I would like you to put down next is what you want to know about the beaver. So, let's write that down. Just skip this and go right to \"What do you want to know?\" Tell your neighbor. Go ahead and tell your neighbor about it. What do you want to know?  Okay, tell your neighbor, guys, too once you have written it down. \n How old can a beaver live?\n Okay, how old can a beaver live? That's good. Yea, Keelie.\n What I want to know how about are they electric.\n Okay.  Okay, I want to know how long they are in their house, maybe. Yes.\n I want to know how big can they be.\n Okay good\n I have hair on here.\n It's possible. Actually, yeah that is very possible, you have hair of a beaver I would actually, I'm going to hang onto that. And actually let's put that in the garbage. But, that's good.\n It's right here. \n Okay i'll take it. Okay. Yea, you're going to find that probably, we're not going to look at the sticks too much. We need to find insects still living in the stick, but we're going to leave that for right now. I'd like you to take a look at page twenty. Take a look at page twenty. I do recommend that if you ever by chance go to Deerbro, there's a forest near the school here. Your parents can take you. You might actually see a beaver house. Okay, let's find out some more information about beaver on page twenty. Put your fingers on the title. Put your fingers on the title. You know what, I'll take that. Here we go. And you know what, let me recollect these, because we have. Let me collect those back. Thank you. There we go. Okay, put your fingers on the beaver, the title, okay? Can I have one person read the bullet again? Bullet marks. Sergio, go ahead.\n Mammal found in North America, Europe, and Asia Lives in rivers and streams near the forest floor.\n okay, and can you name another mammal? If you happen to know what the mammal might be. Can you name another mammal?\n Whale.\n A whale is a mammal, and we are also mammals Okay, the next paragraph I'd like to have one person read that paragraph. Karina.\n Beavers eat bark, twigs, leaves and roots. They have wide flat tails. These tails help beavers to clear a placement, Beavers use their split claws to comb their own fur. They also use their claws to spread oil onto their fur. This oil helps keep them warm in the water.\n Okay, before we go on, as we're going to be looking at a lot of things, think about what it is you're learning. What's something new that you're learning about this beaver? Now, before we go on, everybody put your finger on the caption. Okay, caption. Makayla, what does the caption say?\n A beaver's fur keeps it warm in the snow.\n All right, very good. So, let's take one more thing. We're going to take a look at a diagram on page seventeen. So, now let's go to page seventeen. And this talks a little bit more about a beaver. And the title, let's put our finger on the title of page 17. What does the title say? Keelie\n Graph Section Diagram\n Okay, we're looking at page 17 right here. Put your finger on the top of the diagram, And that's the title. What does it say Keelie?\n Beaver lodge.\n Okay what is, we know a beaver is the animal, What's a lodge Keelie?\n Their house, where they live.\n Yea, it's like their house. Okay, next there's a caption built into the diagram and it's green. Let's have Sergio read the caption there.\n This beaver lodge was built on a shallow part of the wood floor. If it wouldn't float, the lodge will have to be rebuilt.\n Okay, very good. Let's get some more information. There's some other things in the diagram to give us information, Makayla.\n Some lodges are two meters, 6.5' high.\n Okay, very good. And, Keelie.\n The lodge is made from logs and sticks.\n Okay, and Eddie, the last one.\n Beavers come in and out under the water.\n Okay, so this is where they live. This is how they live, and why do you think they build their house this way? Anybody? What do you think they do? Why do they build it this way? Karina.\n Because when they, when people come, like hunters, if they want to catch them It is going to be difficult for them.\n Okay, like predators? Other predatory animals?\n Yeah. So this is a way they adapt. So, how do they adapt to survive in their environment? Makayla.\n To enter from the underground water.\n Okay, can you use adapt or adaptation in a sentence? Beavers...\n Beavers adapt to\n Beavers adapt how? Yea, Karina.\n Beavers adapt by entering from a little hole under the water.\n Okay, so they adapt in that way, other predators can't see when they're coming. And as we saw on the sticks, the sticks, they just pile these sticks up on here and they move them around until they make something that looks like this, okay? So, what kind of a habitat do the beavers live in again? Using the word habitat, I'd like you to tell me. What's the habitat of a beaver?\n They live in lodges.\n They live in lodges. Okay, what's around their lodge? Yeah, Karina.\n Sticks and wood.\n Okay, sticks, but then what is this blue stuff here?\n Water.\n It's water. Yeah, so they actually go underwater to get into their home. And that makes it very safe. So, I would like you to add one more thing to what you learned on the third column of this organizer. Okay? Okay, once you've got one third, okay. And, Eddie, when you've got something, why don't you tell your neighbor? When you've got something, tell your neighbor what you learned \n Like this?\n Okay. Actually, right here, yea. What you've learned.  Okay, and if you were to go out somewhere, and you were in the woods, what would you see? What do you think you would see from this house? This is all water, so all you're going to see... Are you going to see the hole that's here?\n No.\n No. What do you think you're going to see?\n The sticks.\n Just like a stick. Just a mound of sticks, about two meters high. Which is probably about that tall.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 113 ENL EMC 113edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.061547], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW08", "TW10"]}, "112": {"text": "  who's done writing? Okay. Alright. Ok, couple of goals for this piece today. Here's where we're at here. One, clearly get the notes and rhythms down, because this Comstock piece, ok, and so is the second Middleston piece, three, the primo. So we'll do both those today, wanna get the notes learned, the notes and rhythms learned, but I also want to treat this piece today as though it were a sight reading piece, just like if we were getting ready for contest in March, do one of those little example pieces for sight singing. So we'll treat this in the same manner as that. Then I wanted to also, as we're reading the piece, take a look at how the structure of the piece can inform how we might go about learning it. You'll see some things here in a minute. Alright, so, if we take a look at the piece and we've already written solf\u00e8ge in. We take a look at the piece, what markings on the score can you see that might jump out at you that might be different?  Repeats, okay, even before that, like right up by the title.\n  Canon.\n  Canon, what's that mean?  The canon, okay, what's a canon?\n  It's a round.\n  It's a round, right, so you have one set of music, and then the same set of music follows it later, right? We do that in warm ups, okay. Alright, so a canon. So you think soprano and alto are in canon?\n  It'd probably be women and men.\n  Probably women and men, good, good observation. So we look at the structure, where might that canon begin?  After a P at the bottom of the page, okay. So pick up to measure 11, alright. Okay, so what kind of material do the guys have there?\n  It says we mix with the women's structure.\n  Exactly, that same material that the girls do. So in our rehearsal, noting that this is a canon, at least to that point, how might we rehearse this or set it up so we can have success right away?\n  Girls and guys sing their parts together.\n  Girls and guys sing their parts together, good, easy. So if we do that, then what might something else be helpful for us to do? We're singing parts together... maybe pair up? Typically we get together and we chant, so let's do that first. Let's do the chanting just like we do for sight singing, so you can practice that. Okay, so what are our pairs gonna be? Soprano and tenor, so you have to move, and bass and alto. So starting at solf\u00e8ge, girls you start at the beginning, guys you simply start at measure... pick up at measure 11, okay? Go on and move. Yes, circle up right here. Alright, who's gonna be our leader?  Who wants to start us off?\n  Alena?\n  Alena? Okay, you can start us off.  Who's going to start the... you. Okay, there you go. Okay, good, go for it. Chant it, quickly.\n  Let's start at the beginning, we are on the pick up to 4. So 1, 2, 3, and 4. \u266b So so mi fa so do re mi \u266b \n  Okay so now we got to the end of that, go to measure 11 for the girls, and measure 21 for the guys. Go right there and start it again. So now girls you go measure 11, which is right where you finished, and guys go to 21. Same thing here that's a little bit different. \n  Alright, 1 and 2.  \n  Let's all chant together in rhythm. Stay in your groups. Stay in your groups please, but we're gonna start with the sopranos and altos, and then we'll pick up with the guys at the bottom of the page. So start at the beginning everybody. 1, 2, and ready, and go.  Stop, okay, now guys you're gonna pick up there, and girls, you're gonna come in 2 beats later. Here we go, ready and go.  Okay, go right on the coda please. So we would've done the repeat, now we go back here. Go right on the coda please, right after the double bar, ready, and go.  3, 4, fermata... cut off please. Sopranos, ready, and go.  Bass.  Okay, pretty good, we'll come back to that. That takes a little bit of fordating when you get together. Okay, go back to sections, let's do right in the... not your traditional sections. Let's keep the basses over here, altos over here, tenors and sopranos over here. So do two rows, back in your sections. Okay, so we're gonna do just like we chanted, we're gonna partner up, and we're gonna sing it at the same time. Okay, at the same time. So guys, you're starting in measure 11. Girls, you're starting in measure pick up to 1. Ready, and  \u266b Do do do do do \u266b Sing that first note please sopranos and altos, and  okay, tenors and  Basses, okay let's sing all at the same time right where your canon, first name of the canon is. Here we go, 1, 2, and ready, and sing.  Okay sopranos, sorry, altos and basses, here we go, \u266b Doo doo that's a mi \u266b Here we go, start that again, 1 and beginning and go.  Okay, go back to the do. \u266b Do mi so la \u266b Fa do la fa \u266b Sing that, ready, on the do, 1, 2.  Do that again, same spot, 1, 2.  Okay good, excellent reading, good for you. Now putting it together. Canon, lots of people think \"oh canons are easy, no problem, it's the same thing.\" Except canons tend to be tricky, we'll see how it goes. Here we go, soprano and alto first. \u266b Do mi so mi do \u266b Sing your first notes girls, ready, and  Here we go, 1, 2, and ready and go  Okay good, I was gonna stop you before then, but you did so well, so we kept singing. Good for you. Okay, so what happens at 21 for the girls? Well not, sorry, measure 11 for the girls?  Does what, something different, so what would we call it? B, or the counter melody of this. Okay. So it's kind of the same shape, but it starts on what pitch class instead of do? No, sorry, what did we first start at the beginning? So and mi, and this starts on do. So different pitch class, same shape, but it's singing the fifth lower, okay, for soprano. Okay good, let me hear the guys please. You did really well until we got to the B section. Let me hear, actually let's hear everybody do the B section. So guys, you're gonna start at 21, girls, you're gonna start at 11. Basses, it's just... No it's not, it's not different at all. \u266b Do here is do \u266b Find your first pitch.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 112 MUSIC EAYA 112edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.232042], "annotations": [["Teacher", "inaudible"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW06", "TW07", "TW13", "TW20", "TW22", "TW23", "TW24"]}, "142": {"text": "  So, who can tell me, in this group, who can remind me, what is our objective? What are we discovering today in science? I'd like to see a lot of volunteers. Lindsey?\n  We're seeing what soil holds water better and...\n We're seeing which soil holds water better. What's the term for that? Holds water? Chris.\n  It's absorbing the water.\n What's absorbing the water?\n The clay and the sand absorb the water.\n Very good. So we're trying to figure out which absorbs more water. Clay or sand, today? Very good. Who can tell me what was the first step that you did in this project? Cameron.\n  First, we poured in the sand.\n What did you pour the sand into?\n We poured it into a funnel.\n Okay. What's that thing on the funnel?\n It's a coffee filter.\n It's a coffee filter. Why do we need a coffee filter on the funnel?\n Because when it's on the funnel it makes it so that the sand doesn't run through the funnel.\n Okay. All right. What's the second step? Can somebody tell me what the second step is? Cameron said you dump the soil sample, whether it was clay or sand, into your funnel. What's the second step? Caleb.\n  The second second step is to pour in the water.\n The second step was to pour in the water. Who can tell me what the third step is? What's the third step? Chris.\n You record how long it took for it to drip every last drop into the cup of water.\n What's it?\n The water.\n The water. Good. You're recording how long it took for all of the water... what's that word called? What did that water do to get from here to the surface to the bottom of the cup? Cameron?\n It drained.\n It drained. Very good. What are you measuring in? Are you measuring in seconds? Are you measuring in minutes? In hours? Lindsey?\n Measuring in minutes with the seconds.\n You're measuring in minutes with seconds. Okay. Can you tell me how long your clay is up to for draining out the water?\n Two minutes and a half.\n Two and a half minutes. Good. Can you tell me, Cameron, how long it took for your water to drain through your sand?\n It took 28 seconds.\n Twenty-eight seconds. Good job. Keep up the good work. I really like all the diagrams that I'm seeing. Lindsey, you did an excellent job at paying very close attention and following the steps, in step-by-step order. You can give yourself a point for science. Good job.  Ladies, can you tell me did your sand hold water?\n  Yes.\n It did hold water. How did you know that?\n Because it absorbs some of the water. I poured it in here and it had into the water, so the sand holds 11 milliliters of water.\n Good. So you're saying that the sand held 11 milliliters of water. You said that when you poured the water in through the sand then you dumped something in this graduated cylinder. What did you dump in this graduated cylinder?\n  We dumped all the water that was in there.\n What's there?\n In the cup.\n So you dumped all the water that was in the cup after what? What did the water do in order to get in the cup?\n It drained through the funnel, through the sand, down into the cup.\n So it drained through the funnel, through the sand, down into the cup. So then you took your water and you poured it in your graduated cylinder. Luana, you said you did 40 minus 29 to get 11 milliliters? Why did you do 40 minus 29?\n Because that's how you find out how much the sand is holding.\n That's how you find out how much the sand is holding? How did you know to start with 40?\n Because we poured 40 milliliters of water in the cup to start.\n Oh. To start, you poured 40 milliliters of water in. You took the water that you had to start and took away the amount that was left, which you got 11 milliliters. Very good. Excellent. Gentlemen, what are you noticing about sand and water?\n  We're noticing, about the sand, this time it took us two minutes and eight seconds for it to stop dripping. We started out with 40 milliliters and...\n What did you do with that 40 milliliters of water?\n We poured it into the strainer to drain it down into the cup and when we poured into the cylinder we had 28 and a half milliliters.\n Very good. How do you figure out how much water is in the sand. What subtraction sentence would you do?\n Forty minus 30.\n So you're rounding up. You said you had to 30?\n Yes.\n That's a very good choice. You're going to do 40 minus 30 so that tells you how much water is in the sand, which is?\n One, 10.\n Ten what?\n Milliliters.\n Ten milliliters. Very good. Do you think some of that water's still in the funnel? Because this funnel is still dry. This funnel feels wet. Do you think some of that 10 milliliters of water is in this... not funnel, in this filter?\n Yes.\n Do you think so? Why do you think that?\n Because it's soaked and some of the water might have stopped in there because it was so thick and sandy.\n And now it's a little bit thinner? Keep up the great work.  Sam and Madison, what are you noticing about water with your sand and water with your clay?\n  The sand drains the water faster than the clay.\n The sand drains the water faster than the clay. Have you figured out yet which one holds more water?\n Clay.\n The clay holds more water. If you were a gardener and if you were planting a garden, what would you rather garden with? Would you rather garden with sand or would you rather garden with clay?\n Sand.\n Why's that?\n Because it drains water better and the drainage would get to the plants faster.\n Okay. So the drainage would get to the plants faster. Where do the plants need the water?\n Roots.\n At the roots. What do you think, Madison?\n  I would do a mixture of sand, clay, and humus because mixed together it's loamy and loamy soil is good for the plants.\n Great observation. That's wonderful. So you said you'd mix all of them together because that would make a loamy mixture which would allow the gardeners to get the best soil for the plants to grow. Very good. Nice job. What are you three noticing about water and sand and water and clay?\n  Water and sand, it can absorb through the sand, the water. And through the clay it soaks and  at four minutes.\n You're almost at four minutes for your clay. Wow. What do you think this shows you about what happens on a rainy day whether it's outside in our soccer field? Or what happens on a rainy day in your backyard? Does anybody want to tell me what happens?\n The clay, it gets very muddy because the water is pouring down on it. It might make a puddle because some of the soil on the ground can't hold itself so it might make a puddle.\n Good. So Matthew, when you poured your water into your clay, did you have a puddle at the top of your clay?\n  Yeah, we had a puddle at the top of our clay because it was leaking little drops and it stayed on top of the clay. We had to wait a long time till we could pour more water.\n What stayed for a long time on top of the clay?\n The water did because it didn't have small particle sizes so it was hard for the water to get through.\n Oh, so the clay has small particle sizes so it's hard for the water to get through. Wow. Good job. What does that mean about the particle size for the sand?\n It means that the particle for sand is bigger and it has more space for the water to drain through.\n Good. Excellent. Did any of you draw diagrams of what your experiment set-up looked like?\n What it looked like?\n I think you have a diagram on the previous page. Did you draw a diagram?\n Yes.\n Okay. What did your diagram show?\n My diagram, for sand, shows that the water is going right through the funnel and it's pouring to the bottom. And for my clay it's little drops because the clay is stuck together once it has water.\n Good. I can easily tell, in your diagram, which one's sand and which one's clay. One suggestion that I can make to you, though, is I would like a few more labels. If I were to never see this experiment before, how would I know that this is sand and that this is clay? So if you could label those for me and tell me what these drops are. I don't know if they're water, or  or milk. If you could do a little bit more labelling for me, that would be excellent. Good job. Nice work. Very impressive.  How long are you guys up to for your water being through your filter, through your clay?\n  Five minutes and 45 seconds.\n Five minutes and 45 seconds. I can tell that both of you are working very hard. And Xavier, you're doing excellent job at staying in your seat the whole time. You can give yourself a point right now for being on task. Nice job. Good. What are you noticing about sand, clay and water?\n  I noticed that the clay held less water than the sand and I was really surprised by that because I thought that water can go through sand fast.\n So you were really surprised because you didn't think water would go through sand that fast? And how much water did your sand hold?\n Our sand held 11 milliliters.\n Eleven milliliters. Good. And how much did your clay hold, do you know?\n  Five.\n Held five milliliters. Wow. What number sentence did you do in order to figure out how many milliliters were in the clay and how many milliliters were in the sand?\n We did 40 minus however the milliliters were left in the cup.\n Okay. And why did you do that?\n Because we had 40 to begin with and we needed to find out how many were left and... I forgot.\n You forgot? Kendall, can you help her out?\n We got 29 in this and it began with 40. So we had to do 40 minus 29. Forty minus 29 is 11 millimeters.\n Milliliters. Good. Remember millimeters is when we're using rulers and milliliters is when we're measuring water. Okay? Excellent job. Which soil would you rather garden with? Would you rather garden with sand or would you rather garden with clay?\n I would garden with both of them so I could get a  loamy soil and loamy soils are better for the flowers.\n Okay. So you would mix them together so that you could get a loamy mixture. What about you, Kendall?\n I would do sand because water can get through it easily.\n So water can get through it easily? Why would that matter?\n Because the soil and everything else, and the grass and everything, needs water but if you use clay it just stays on top and it can't get water.\n Very good. Excellent. Looks like you girls are ready to move on to your graphing. What are we going to graph? What are we graphing today?\n How much water is in the...\n", "filename": ["Copy of 142 GEN EC 142.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0860133], "annotations": [["Instructor"], ["Lindsey"], ["NaN"], ["Chris"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Cameron"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Caleb"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Luana"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Sam"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Madison"], ["NaN"], ["Student", "inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Matthew"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["Xavier"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Kendall"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW09s", "TW15"]}, "031": {"text": "NFL Yeah... So here's like... you can see that the professional players who  can pay that money. They're really rich, so there's so much sponsors  that they pay for their helmets. But like in... high school football what they want is long pass  cheaper material So they don't  care much about The health about the guys,  they want to go just... Their problem is  the money of the helmets. How much cost of helmet is... like helmets with  Kevlar or that stuff. like they use in  the military equipment.  So how can we combine your thoughts and your thoughts so that we can  save these thoughts? So what kind of  ideas you guys have? How could you design a helmet so it's not this big or really neat and super expensive? The type of padding we use So what ideas  do you guys have? So what kind of...  So you play football... What kind of padding right  now is inside of the helmet? I mean they're not soft. It's like it's air glove. It's almost like a hard  balloon stuck to your head. So it's just one on the side  and the whole top is full. and one on the other side  and one in the back. But that's it. I mean, you could  actually feel the hit. But it... you just  don't get a concussion, unless you're heavy. So have  you ever been hit? Have you ever had  a helmet to helmet contact? So where did you get hit? My head Almost like right here. On top of your head.\nRight, but there's padding there. Oh, but you said  you could still feel it. I mean, I could feel it for like  a quick couple of seconds or so. Then it just goes away. It's because of  the padding, I guess. It's... umm... It's like  So is there any  way that you would change the design of the  helmet that you have now? Um...more cushion. Okay. So that's  kind of going back to what Angel was talking about. So how can  we change the design to make it more cushiony, but... Because if you have  something that's too cushiony, right, is that going  to decrease the time? or increase the time  and decrease the force? if it's really cushiony? Oh, that's really cushiony? \nYeah Oh, you mean  like it will just go... Yeah.\nNo. Right. So you're saying  you want it more cushiony, you're saying you want it cheaper,  you're saying you want it smaller. I think like what Matt's kind of saying is more  for comfort than for safety. -Right. Right. So why... So can you relate sort of to what  Angel's saying and why if it is more cushiony it would be more dangerous. Umm, with the head rattling? Like if it hits on this side,  it's quicker to hit the other side. Is that what you mean? what? So how...? So think about how  the padding is right now. How it's stiff compared to something  that kind of gave. So think about  relating this back to force times the change in time. You can ask... If it's built too soft, it's  going to hit you with a stronger force... So what could  happen to the time? It's going to be slower, it's going to be faster. It's going to be faster, so what's  going to happen to the force? The force is going to increase...  So it's going to hurt even more and it will  be more dangerous. So what you need is like a stable material that not too soft, but at the same time So besides Kevlar, which you brought up which is I was thinking like  like for example  when you are hit and you're hit you want that like bulletproof  that the force spreads in  all the space of the body of the helmet. So is you are hit here, all the force is not concentrated in this place,  but is moving over all the helmet. So it displaces the  force so it's not on one area. So I was like  thinking like maybe like this big, the helmet then in the middle like like a wave like when it hits,  it spreads to all the helmet. So that's you versus less  you spread all the  force on your head so you have like less  Something that will  transfer the motion Yeah. I like this idea. But what I was thinking is that we could put layers so instead of hitting the helmet right away you hit something cushiony first so have something  cushiony on the outside so that it takes time  for you to hit the helmet. And once you hit the  helmet, the small cushiony so that it takes  time for that to hit the other hard part which would then hit cushion again  and then hit you. So kind of  like an atmosphere. Yeah, it will have  like little layers It will probably have to make  the helmet a little bit like bigger. But not like...  Don't make it like huge, but have layers on there. and then incorporate his idea  when you're making waves. So something  like that first layer could help  dissipate the force. So we have cushiony  against cushiony like boxers use. And then they have the  hard part on the bottom when they do little wrapping. So we have the cushiony part first. So it's going to take time and  I think that's what they use. They put cushion on there, so that it takes time for you  to actually feel the force. So that the force will be less. And if you have  cushion with cushion It's because you  are increasing the time. Yeah, because if you have two  helmets that are hitting each other, that are cushion and cushion, it will take longer for  them to hit each other. And then the force  will be decreased. My question for Matt is-  How big is the helmet? Oh! The padding? It's like thick.  It's kind of thick. That's just the padding  and then you have the helmet, which is like that  much more. -Yeah. It's like that thick. How heavy is the helmet? Like when you're wearing it,  does it feeling like it's weighing you down? Yeah, it takes time to get used to it.  And that day, you're neck will hurt. That's how heavy it is. Another version of like  what we are trying to do. I think it'd also be cool. Maybe like helmet  were like it was fitted to like the head and then it'd have like inbetween kind of like a net structure. which is a part of uh... kind of like what he had but something that is hung. I want to kind of  imagine it like the bridges. How they have like a whole bunch of  little columns But just a whole bunch that is attached to the  outside of the helmet. I will draw it, and I'll show you guys. You had your hand up, do you want  to share while he...? Yeah I was wondering, since  we're talking about the injuries and can you guys give an example of the  type of brain damage that you can get? Just like an actual name. Like I heard concussion. Other injuries, other names. Can you tell... What a concussion is? What is a concussion? Ask the group. Well, a concussion is when... It's when you... your brain between your  actual brain and your skull There is a liquid,  like Spinal fluid, is it? and that's supposed  to cushion your brain from touching the, or hitting, your skull. But a concussion is when it's  hitting and it's going back and forth. I mean gradually it will go back to normal but... That's my understanding  of concussion. And you would have lost like feeling for like one or two seconds on the biggest  areas of the impact So what part do you think  is the most dangerous part to hit of your brain,  on your brain? The sides. What do the sides control? Well, it wasn't like that. I thinking like in  the structure of the... of the skull. So the sides, where  the nerves enter, like Your optic nerves?-Yeah. So I think that's like less pain. It's like a really big hit here   can kill a man. So I think that hit is worst. You're saying the skull  is thinnest right there? -Yeah. It's not as thick  as the other parts. It's thickest, like right here... What does your  frontal lobe control? So that's what  kind of separates us from other species is that we have the most  developed frontal lobe. And then on the sides is  more of your sensory stuff. and then in the back is your actually your Occipital lobe for your eyes is in  the back, a long with your movement,  your cerebellum. So different spots,  that's why you have padding here, and  here and back here, is to protect all sides of the brain. So a concussion is just like your  brain keeps vibrating, basically, after the blow? So I like to think about it, and I meant to bring this in  and I apologize. So if you have...  Think about your Tupperware. and inside the  Tupperware you have an egg. You just cracked  a nice egg inside and then you shake it. So imagine  that egg is your brain. And that Tupperware is your skull. So the harder you rattle it,  what's going to happen to the egg? It will break. It's gonna break, right? The yolk's going to break, right? I mean your brain doesn't really break. But you can think that It's just kind  of the movement. Because if you think about  what does Newton's first law say? An object that's in motion will stay in motion  unless acted upon by outside force. So if the brain... If you get hit here, which way is your  brain going to go? That way. Until it hits the  skull and then it's going to *thunk* So that's what they  call rattling your cage. I was thinking of like  when I play baseball, when I swing the  bat and I hit the ball, and my hands keep like, I can feel it inside and like even after  a minute it will keep rattling. So now take that  and think about how that would... Okay! So David, can you uh... Explain what you  have so we can... This is kind of like the bridge  idea that I had where like there's like different columns that go around, like the frame. So in this, it would kind of be like,  the head goes right here and the helmet's right here. And these would be like some kind of material that's bendable. So, when something  hits it, they would bend in so, to absorb kind of the impact. Kind of like a cage  in the racing cars. Like how racing cars have a cage inside of them. Just in case they roll over,  the cage still protects the person. Yeah kind of... No, but... Yeah kind of like that  but these are like cushions. Yeah. So they  absorb the momentum. So like a coil? Like for your bed.  The bed spring that when you jump up on it,  you rebound back, so... Wouldn't that be  more dangerous if it's...? elastic? Yeah, it's elastic, and when we did the little  cars When it was elastic,  it completely transferred all of its momentum  to the other car. So when you get hit,  it will just like swing and then all the  momentum will hit you. instead of both  of you sharing it. So if you share,  it'd probably be better. But I don't know if that's...  Because I was also  thinking of mattresses. A little sleep mattresses. and how they talked about the coils  and how they give you pressure points and it will be stronger  over here than over here. and then they have the new  ones now that are like foam. The Tempurpedic ones, Yeah. So I was thinking also   if you like spread out... where the momentum goes. Saying if you spread out where  it won't be in one certain area. Then you won't get hit  really hard right here. And if you get hit  hard like over here, it'd probably be better  than getting hit hard just right there. -Yeah. It will probably  be less of a force. So when they  design like a helmet, they've got one piece thing  where it's like your body their shoulder pads  connected to their helmet. So your body absorbs some of  that too, instead of just your head. So that depends  how you turn your head And would it be  good if your body... have you guys ever heard that people who  are like drunk drivers they kind of walk  away from a car crash and it's the passengers or the victims are the ones  that get hurt the most... So think about what's different between their body in motion and  the other person's body in motion. So they're looser, right? They're not tightening their muscles  compared to someone who is trying to absorb the impact. We flex, right?  Just waiting for it, and  so, by being more rigid your body doesn't move. You're trying to  fight against the motion. So you get more of the whiplash and stuff like that. Because you...  It hurt your body more because you're  trying to fight against what you're body is  actually going to do instead of the other person  who's just like really loose is moving with it, so there's not as much impact. Well, I've been playing football and how you play like you want to win. You hit someone you want to. After that you're still going and if you are like losing the other person is stronger than you can beat you up like... I know. What he  is saying is like if you see someone  about to collide with you, you want to hit  him back instead of... Yeah. Why is that?  Related that to momentum. Because momentum  is vector, right? So you have to think  about the direction and of the way  that things are moving. So think back to... When we were playing  with different cars. So you had the greater mass  in one car going this way. And had the smaller  mass going this way. Right? So what would you want to  do to the smaller mass car to make sure that the impact of the.... Raise his speed Increase the speed, right? And so by knowing that  you're going to get hit you're going to  run a little faster. So then what was the... what is the ending result there? So like if you have more speed you hit the other object that has more mass Mean like....  how do you think is like... Inelastic, I don't know, like So what's going to happen? Are they going to  stay stuck together?  So it's elastic so it comes off, right? Think about it  like a rubber band, an elastic rubber band. You can stretch it, so... elastic is, is saying, something  that's going to rebound. whereas inelastic  you're just rigid. There is no motion,  I guess, you should say. I thought that was inelastic, when you  hit something, it will both go off completely and  elastic it will stick together. And inelastics magnets.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 031 SCIAYA031.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0619546], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW06", "TW08"]}, "118": {"text": " Spanish, and you would know if, I mean, you would know what they're saying because you learn English, and you talk, you learn English and you know how to talk Spanish.\n  I agree with you, because like, because like if they when you said that they had to read, write, and speak English, like they put something that, they put something that's English on your paper, you'd probably understand it more, so that's why I agree with you.\n  But when they fill out the application, what if the application didn't \n Well,\n  The application is about like where you're from, why are you coming here for, like they want to know a lot of information about you.\n  I think we should, I think we should keep it at one, because if you fill out the application, you'll know more about people, and their birthday and stuff, like and then they usually bring them a present, \n Okay, so it's important to know about somebody.

So let's move onto the next step and see what you think about the next one.\n That you have to live in the US, United States, for five years.\n  I don't believe that you have to live in the United States for five years, because like if you're like, I'm  five years, if you're married, you're going to have to live for three years, but then like the reason why you should live in it five years, because like you could get used to the country and everything, that's what I think.\n  I think that you should live in America for five years if you come from somewhere else, because like some people, they come here, and they see that they don't like it, and they try to move back to where they came from, and when they try to move back, somebody already took their house or something, and if they go, they ain't gonna have no money to come back because they're just gonna be outside homeless.\n I think there will be some changes to live in the US. Two years, because if you're real old, if you're old, then they say that you might die in a couple years, then if you're staying here, if you have to stay here to become a citizen for five years, then it takes longer, then you wouldn't get the chances to make choices before you die.\n  I think you should change, you have to live in the US, United States, for five years, because what if if the house is dirty, and it's not clean? Like if it's like the tub still got stains in it \n  Explain that a little bit more to me. So you said that you would change it to how many years?\n  To one year.\n To one year, becase if you got in a house that was dirty, you might want to do what?\n  If the walls was still had stains on it--\n Well what would you want to do then?\n Move.\n Okay, where would you move? Still in the United States, or back to your country?\n  Still in the United States.\n Okay, so you would still be there, so would you want to just stay, even though you move from place to place--\n  I will--\n Do you think you would change the number of years they're gonna be in the United States, or just not make them stay in the same place?\n Not make them stay in the same place.\n Okay, so we need to make sure that Ariel knows, do we have to stay in the same place for all five years?\n No, not really.\n No, okay.\n  I think that if they I think that they should give them at least one year to figure out if they want to stay in that home or go back to where they used to live. So I mean, if they don't like it on the first day, so they won't have to go back again, come back to see, or come back, somebody else at your house. At your old house.\n  I disagree with you, and I agree with you. The reason why I disagree with you, because they said still living three years just like if you're married, and I agree with you, because like when you said that they come from the first place, I mean, the first day they may not like it, and they could probably go back where they came from, that's why I disagree and agree with you.\n  Okay, I think we should change it so if they look at their choice to go back to their home country for like two months, because then they'll miss their family members, then like when a couple days in their country, and nobody was doing it in America, then they could just go back to their country for like a month or something.\n  So maybe you guys need to discuss how many years they should stay here in America, and maybe if they could, how long they could go to visit their relatives in other countries. Although I think those are all good things to keep discussing. So maybe make that decision on how many years, and then move onto the next one and I'll come back and see you.\n  Here, but you you trying to become a citizen here, but you like want to, like you're trying to vote, like say if you lived in Germany, you're trying to go back to Germany. You can't, that's not being loyal to the US, because you're trying to become a citizen to the US, and you're trying to go back, if you was living in Germany, you're trying to go back to Germany. What do you think, guys?\n Well,  because they have to want to say that, A, if you don't, then they won't have to send you back, because you have to be community and jobs so they can get you jobs and what to do and--\n  I think that we should keep the rule, because say if your old country got in a war, you would say you tried to take up them, and you're already trying to become a citizen of the USA, and you take up for your old country, that makes you not become a citizen.\n That don't mean if you're born in your like regular country, that don't mean like you can go back, go back and forth and take up for them, and then when we're having a war, you want to take up for us, you can't do that. You can't like, if you grew up in Germany, you can't take up for Germany, because you'e trying to be a citizen in the US now. You can't take up for Germany, even though you were born there. You got to take up for the US.\n  Do you think that's hard for someone who came to the United States to forget about their old country? Woudl that be difficult?\n  Yeah. In my opinion, I think that'd be difficullt because like with me, I can make a connection because when I went, when I had, when I used to live with my grandma, me and my momma, we used to live with my grandma, and I couldn't forget about the things that I did at my grandma's house, so my grandma and my cousins, but we still were around, but I couldn't stop, I couldn't forget about what the fun things that we did.\n  Yeah, \n  So what should we put here?\n  Well, I think we should keep it, because like you can't go back to your like regular country to do like, like you can't fight for the army, the army, they're trying to stay here to protect us, and you're already trying to become a citizen for the US. You can't like go back to Germany.\n  Then we should keep that, because then so we should learn how to be nice? I don't know.\n  Like, we could put, so that if like you grew up in Germany, you can't fight for Germany. So we're gonna put that.\n  Okay.\n  You have to be true to the US.\n Be true to the US.\n  How about the next one that says, \"Have good moral character.\" Is that one that you would keep or get rid of?\n  Get rid of. In my opinion, I'd get rid of that, because people, like that's like, that's like having like you gotta be like nice to people. Some people, they can't take it. Like, they can't take that, they can't like, people, like I can make a connection because my cousin, she got like ups and downs, because when people, they just like irritate her, and they be aggravating her, she can't take it no more, she just like, she just gotta get mad and stuff. Like people, they can't take having a moral character. Like my cousin, she can't do that because people, they be like bullying her and stuff, and she can't like keep like, she can't keep on standing right there and people keep on bullying her.\n  Brittany, do you think we should keep it or leave it?\n  I think we should, I think we should get rid of it. When I was in the suburbs with my godmother, she said that my godbrother was getting picked on in school by a bully, and he just felt like beating him up. What do you think, Adune?\n Well, keep it, because like, why would you let some  people get away with most of that stuff? You're just gonna let them keep doing the same thing? And without the rule? Without that rule, everybody, people would just keep getting beat \n  So what I hear all of you saying is that you don't want people to get beaten, but you also said that sometimes it's hard to control your anger, so you can't, you're not always a good person all the time. Sometimes you make bad choices. Do you think we could maybe change that rule so that everybody would be happy with it?\n  Yes, I think we should change it to like, like, when you're like around like older people, like elder, like older people, and like they're real old, you can like, like you can show like good moral character around them, but then when they like go and stuff, like when they're not gone, like when we was talking about immigrants on the, like they was on the boats, you don't know what type of people is on the boats. It can be like elder people, you never know. Like you can have good moral character around them, but like when you like, when you're like around your mother, don't she want you to respect you? Don't she want you to respect her?\n  But, we should change the rule to like sometimes people can just like have a chance to get some people back that really did something really bad to them, or caused them to get hurt or something, so we should change the rule to like, it's kind of like hard for a name, but we should think about it.\n  I think, I have a cause and effect for a good moral character. That's why they have like, if you have to fill out an application, that's why they're trying to like, that's why they're trying to like fill out an application to see if you got good moral character, or if you're cra--\n", "filename": ["Copy of 118 GEN MC 118edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.0468169], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Boy"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Boy"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Boy"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Brittany"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Adune"], ["NaN"], ["Adune"], ["NaN"], ["Adune"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Adune"], ["Brittany"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Adune"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW09", "TW24"]}, "034": {"text": " What are his tools?\n \n Is that your hose?

Is she adding one eighth together a bunch of times? Where do you see that? Can you come up and show us?\n You have to get seven of them.\n Okay. Katriana could you add that number sentence up above your picture also? So I like how you're all thinking while she's writing this. There's a couple different ways we can represent this. I think Anielli and lots a groups had their hand up were right that she did. I can see she took seven pizzas and divided it into eight pieces for eight people. And I also see where, and when I talk to Katriana, she said, \"Well I got one eighth, plus one eighth, and one eighth, and one eighth and one eighth. How much is that gonna add up to equal? She's got one eighth, plus one eighth, plus one eighth, plus one eighth, plus one eighth, plus one eighth, plus one eighth.\n Seven eighths.\n Seven eighths, okay. And that's how much pizza she told us. What about seven divided by eight? A bunch a groups kept their hand down after Anielli shared that number sentence. But it's not a complete number sentence until we can finish that equation. What would seven divided by eight come out to equal do you think? Talk at your group for just a minute again I think we're just a little bit unsure. \n What are you thinkin' for seven divided by eight?  Let's come talk it over with this group. You check with this group, I'll check with this group. What are ya'll thinkin' up here?  Well, what do you see in her representation?  You see how many pizza's?  Okay, seven pizzas.\n Eight people.\n And eight people.  Did she divide those seven pizzas into eight groups? Okay, so we've just gotta figure out how much then, that's gonna come out to equal. I'm not sure. Talk about it as a group. You can draw it on the back. Okay. Yes, thank you, ma'am. Okay, thank you so much for talkin' with your group. What did you or someone at your group think again? If we've got seven pizzas divided by eight people. Katia?\n We've got 56 divided by eight because there's 56 pieces, and it's kinda .\n Okay, so you noticed there's and it's cut into...\n Eight.\n Eight slices. So you were thinking something a little bit differently. Savannah?\n We, I thought the same way except I thought that it was gonna be 56... Divided by seven. because... Each one of them is shaded in, and they're all going to  eight people.\n Okay.  Let me ask us all this. I love that we're relating this back thinking about some of our math facts, and how that can tie in and help us. But what did Katriana start with here? What do you think the first thing she did was?  What did she do, Steven?\n Drew seven or eight pizzas.\n Did she draw seven pizzas or eight pizzas?\n Seven.\n Seven pizzas. Is that what she did first? Okay.  She drew out her seven pizzas. So we wanna know, or we need to know that that's what she started with. What did she divide those pizzas into?\n Into eighths.\n Into eight. We see she cut 'em into eight pizzas. Brennan.\n I did  I was thinking either 700, or seven tenths.\n Okay.  So we're thinking back to fractions. I think since we don't have a definite answer, we don't need to yet. Let's leave this kinda open-ended, but I'm gonna circle it so that we remember to come back to it. So we've gotta a great number sentence that one thing Katriana did was add up one eighth, plus one eighth, plus one eighth, plus one eighth, plus one eighth, plus one eighth, plus one eighth, and she got seven eighths and we're gonna keep thinking about... I saw a bit of agreement that seven pizzas, she divided by eight people. But we need to figure out, ladies, how much that would mean each person gets. So put a big arrow. So as we continue let's keep that in our mind. Okay, thank you. Can I have... The person who put this one up in black. Faith, was that you? Will you come tell us what you did, and what you think the answer might be here. How much pizza each person got.\n Well, I knew there was eight soccer players, so there were seven pizzas, so I did seven pizzas. Then I divided six of 'em up in to fourths, and then I numbered 'em all. And then when I got to eight I started one, two, three, back over again when I got to another eight, I did it again but then I realized that there wasn't enough, or more, so I split the last pizza up into eighths and that equals up to eight people.\n Okay, and that equaled up to eight people. So how much pizza do you think each person gets?\n Well, I think that each person would get at least one fourth, and .\n Okay, so let's write this up here. So you said each person gets, let's put it up in black. How much? Like let's say person number 1. How much pizza do they get? Will you show us?\n They would get one, two, three... They would get three fourths.\n Okay.\n And then one eighth.\n Three fourths and one eighth. Like this? Okay, do you know how much that is all together?\n That would... That would equal up to four .\n Okay. So let's think about this one for a minute. Do you have any questions for Faith about how she figured this out? Okay, I think she did a great job explaining her picture. So she showed us where each person gets three fourths plus one eighth. Will you talk at your group? How much is that? How much is that total? Thank you, if you wanna join a group. Good explanation.  Okay, group what do we think?\n Four twelfths.\n You agree with her four twelfths? How did you come up with four twelfths?\n By adding those two together.\n How did you add them together?\n Three plus one would equal four, and then four would be the numerator because you added the two top numbers. And if you added the two bottom numbers, it would equal twelve for the denominator.\n Okay, so is there a picture, or is there a way that we could show this with pictures that that would come out to equal four twelfths? \n See, on the back of your paper once will you draw a representation of four twelfths?  How come?\n Because. I thought that if the denominators were different, we couldn't add them up directly.\n Oh.\n So, we tried to get the denominators the same.\n What do we call that?\n Equal to fractions .\n I like that your thinking back to remember your vocabulary.\n I tried to tell Katia that if it has a different number on the bottom then we're supposed to add the  on the bottom to--\n I don't know. Have we learned to do that before?\n Well no, but I just thought about it, and I've been practicing.\n Okay. So if we haven't learned it yet we've gotta think about how are we gonna figure it out, right? Okay, so keep thinking. It's okay that we're debating between a couple different answers just tryin' to explain to each other why you're thinking four twelfths, and why you're thinking something different.\n I thought it was  because... Whenever you add it up  And the denominator .\n Okay.  So I understand where you got the four slices. But what size are those slices? Would be my next question. Because we wanna make sure every soccer player gets the same amount 'cause I would be upset if I didn't get as much pizza as you did. I like pizza.  Okay. \n Okay, well it says four twelfths, so we're shading four--\n Do you have 12 pieces there?\n We have one, two, three--\n Okay. If I can have your attention back. I know some of you are still discussing, and doing a great job. But I wanna make sure that we've got time to get through the rest of our solutions before we're out of time for the day. Hailey, if I can have you close the door again for us. And can I hear what a couple of your groups came up with? I heard three or four different things as I was going around. Three fourths, Hannah said each person gets three fourths of a pizza and one eighth.\n Faith said.\n How much is that? Yes, I'm sorry, Faith said since ya'll sat next to each other I still mess that up. Three fourths and one eighth. How much did you or your group think that came out to be, Nathan?\n We came up with seven eighths.\n Seven eighths.\n Because when you take three fourths, and then you take another circle that shows one eighth, then you divide the three fourths into eighths, then add the  the ones that used to be three fourths and that equals seven eighths.\n Can you come up and show that to us? I think, I think I followed in my head, but did you all have trouble making that picture in your head?\n Yes.\n A little bit, yeah. Can you show us? You can draw it here, or over here we've got lots of room.\n Nathan, you're right. \n Shhh. Okay, let's see what he does. Okay, can you step to the... step to the side so everybody in the class can see you. There you go.\n And then if you divide that into eighths, then you add one of the eighths then you add this over here. It comes out to be seven eighths.\n Can I just get in.. agreement or disagreement somebody who had shared with us. What do you think about what he just did? I saw him draw three eighths at one pizza, and one, or three fourths of one pizza, and one eighth of the next. And then I saw him cut this one into eighths. How many eighths was three fourths? When you cut it? Six eighths. And then he put one more eighth over and seven eighths. What are you thinkin' about that, Brazy?\n I agree with him.\n Why?\n Because our group said that we know that four eighths is equal to... twelve fourths is equivalent to seven eighths, and his picture we can see that it's two and when he was workin' it out we could see that it was right and so I agree with him.\n Okay, Brennan?\n I agree with him, but I have a different explanation.\n Okay.\n One fourth is equal to two eighths, but then you take--\n Oh, I'm sorry. Let me write this as you're saying it so we can follow it. So you said...\n One fourth is equal to two eighths.\n Okay.\n So... We multiplied the three and the numerator with three fourths.\n Okay.\n By two, which comes from the two eighths and it would equal up to six eighths plus that one extra eighth it would be seven eighths.\n Okay, so you said three fourths is equivalent to\n Six eighths.\n Six eighths, okay.\n And then just add the other one, seven eighths.\n Okay, so then you did six eighths, plus one eighth, equals seven eighths, like that? Okay, can I just see a quick, on your remotes, do you agree or disagree with Nathan and Brennan? So, A is I agree. B I disagree, or I'm confused.\n What's confused?\n We'll just do A and B. A is I agree, I understand, or B is I disagree, or I'm confused. How are you feeling right now about what Brennan and Nathan just said? They're two different explanations. I just wanna see right now, do you agree or disagree with what Brennan and Nathan just said. And again they were saying that three fourths, plus one eighth is gonna come out to equal seven eighths. And they each kinda explained it a different way. One with words and one with a picture. Need a couple more people to vote if they agree or disagree. Number three, number eleven we need a vote from you please.  Where is remote number three? There it comes. Okay. What do we, what do we know by looking at this graph?

Layla?\n But, well, I agreed with Devon on the pink one, but I would rather have the white one because it could carry more popcorn, but it also is harder to hold, unless you were to like, since it has more area, the white one has more area than the pink or the green one.\n More area you're talking this way?\n Yeah.\n Okay, so you're saying...\n You take the popcorn and you could like, you could make it even on the bottom of it, so it wouldn't necessarily be overflowing unless you were, when you walk, for the popcorn thing.\n Okay, all right. Brittany?\n Me and Lani had the same answer, we would think that, it sort of relates to what Devon said, if we picked the green one, because, and related to . The pink one's gonna be hard to reach down to get the rest of the popcorn. And the green one is wide enough, and it can hold, it can still hold as much popcorn as the pink one. But it's still gonna be hard to get down the pink one, and the white one's just gonna spill.\n Okay, all right.  Tiffany.\n We thought that the green and pink one, it doesn't matter because they're probably gonna hold the same capacity since they're the same shape, it's just one's taller and one's shorter, but the short one's wider and the tall one's skinnier, it's tall but we thought that both of them can hold the same.\n So you said either one of these two? It didn't matter, okay. Kylie?\n I would want the green cup because it's easier like to get your hand down it. The pink one looks like really skinny, so if you have big hands, it would be hard to get your hand down it.\n Okay, all right, Amani?\n I think the green one becuase when you look at it, the old popcorn container, and the green one, they're kinda the same, although the green one is a little bit bigger, so then you could get more.\n Okay.\n I said the green one also because the pink one is skinny, and it if went to the same size as that, with the same amount of popcorn, it would be less popcorn in the pink one than the green one. Do you know what I'm saying?\n Say that again.\n Okay, I picked the green one because, say you fill them with popcorn, and then you take all the popcorn that was in the pink one, and you put it in the green one, it's gonna be less popcorn in the green one than the pink one. And the white one, it's just gonna fall over 'cause it's too small, it's too flat.\n Okay, hold on Josh. Now, Tiffany said that she felt they held the same amount. Did you say that?\n Mm-hmm.\n And why did you say that?\n Because they're the same size paper, except one, they're just folded different.\n Okay, she said that because they're the same size paper, they're folded differently, but she thinks that they're gonna hold the same amount. And you are disagreeing.\n Mm-hmm.\n Okay, she's disagreeing, saying that the green one's going to hold more, is that correct? What you said?\n I said, yeah, the green one would hold more.\n Okay, Josh what do you think?\n I said I would rather have the green because it would be a lot easier to get the popcorn out, and because it might have more volume than those two. Yeah.\n Okay, so let's change our thinking here. Some of you did think about which one is going to hold more. It didn't matter whether your hand could get easier into this one, or Devon liked this one 'cause he could tilt it up, he didn't even have to have his hand in it at all, which is an interesting way to look at it. A lot of you said you didn't like this one because it would spill easily or whatnot. Yes ma'am?\n But unless you did what I suggested, and you like evened it out on the bottom.\n Yes, because you said you liked this one, 'cause you thought it held more than the other two.\n But you'd have to like flat, not necessarily like, squish the popcorn so it's flat, you'd have to like shake things sideways, so that it would even it out. Like food in a pan, you would shake it to even it out on the bottom.\n Okay, all right.\n Well it's kinda like with the little kid packs, there are things shaped like that, and it has like, gummies and popcorn in it, and I don't like it 'cause like, everyone would get the other ones, it would have like more popcorn in it.\n Okay, Tiffany?\n What I would suggest the white one is like, even it's the same shape as the other two pieces of paper, but it's folded so it's taking less up space, but it's folded.\n Because it overlaps here, it does overlap here, with the white, you're right there.\n But I disagree with Molly because the popcorn amount that's inside of the, inside the square ones at Newtown, is the same amount as one of the plastic ones. The exact same amount of popcorn, 'cause they actually use those as measuring cups. I've watched them do it. And I've watched them actually use those cups, those hard ones, to fill the other cup, to fill the other ones.\n So you think that this is going to hold the same amount as this?\n All of them are gonna hold the same amount because they used the hard plastic ones, as measuring cups.\n All right, Devon.\n I agree with Layla, like they're all the same. I think it just depends on like who you are, kind of, like which one you want.\n Okay, but do you think it would be unfair to say a certain gender would have to have each one?\n Yeah.\n So if you could choose, that would be a good thing. Right, hold on a second, let's move on a second, and I'm gonna have MK come up here and help me. We're gonna see if they hold the same, okay? I want you, however, on your paper, to write down, you know, which one you think holds the most, do they hold the same, or if you think they hold a different amount, put 'em in order, like which one is least, middle greatest, why don't you do that real quick. Why don't you put 'em in order, which one do you think? Okay, this is what she thinks, she thinks least, middle greatest. Here's what we're going to do. I do not have popcorn, but I do have cereal. And hopefully, hopefully, MK can pour this. Hopefully, okay, so you're, I'm gonna hold it. Or would you rather hold it and me pour?\n Wait, yeah, you might wanna pour it.\n Okay, and just make sure that the bottom stays. Okay. We are smellin' the sugar up here!\n Yeah.\n Okay, can you all see that it's at the top?\n Yeah. All right. Now, what we are going to do, so this is, this would be a full thing of popcorn for the girls. We're gonna put this over top, and you're gonna lift it up and see what happens. And some of you have predicted that it's going to be the same, right? How many have predicted that they're all the same? All the same? Okay. How many are predicting that the green is bigger? Predicting that the green is bigger? Okay.  What about the white is biggest? Anybody predict the white is biggest? Okay, why don't you lift this up, I'll hold this this time. You gotta make sure that.\n Pink's bigger.\n Ooh!\n Can you see? Can you see? So there's more room, right? There's more room in the green one. Why?\n Because the more space it has, the bigger around it is, the more cereal that could fit in it.\n So what is that called, around here?\n Circumference?\n Well this is circumference, but at the bottom.\n Volume?\n It is volume, 'cause we're measuring volume. But what is at the bottom of this.\n Base?\n A base, is that what you're saying? That the base, it depends on how big the base is? Well let's look to see whether it'll fit in here. Okay.\n There it is. Exact same room as the pink.\n Well, do you think there's the exact same room as the pink?\n No.\n I think the white has more.\n You think the white could fit more?\n Yeah. Okay, thank you MK, have a seat. But what do we know about this one now?\n It's the smallest.\n It's the smallest.\n Do you think we could come up with a formula to figure out what the numbers are here, and figure out what the formula, or the volume is?\n Like the length of it, the length of the pink one?\n Does anybody know what a standard size sheet of paper measures?\n Eight by\n Is it eight by 12?\n Eight by 12, eight by six?\n Eight by 10?\n Eight by 10? Eight by 10?\n A foot?\n A foot?\n Eight by 11.\n Okay, it is actually eight and a half by 11, okay? Eight and a half, by 11. So our standard size paper is eight and a half by 11. Okay? So for our pink one. What is, when we do this. What is this?\n The circumference?\n Its' the circumference. What do we know about the circumference then, for the pink one?\n That it's 8.5.\n It is 8.5. So circumference equals what?\n 8.5.\n The circumference equals 8.5. Are we then able to find out the diameter and the radius if we have the circumference?\n Yes.\n No.\n You say yes?\n Yeah, I know what you could do, you could divide it by 3.14 'cause that's how you get, 'cause you know how it's the opposite of times, so that you would do it, and you would divide that by 8.4, no, 3.14, and then you'll have the diameter, and then you can just take half of that, and that'd be the radius.\n Okay, all right, tell me Brittany, what is the formula for circumference?\n Pi times d?\n Circumference equals pi times d. I'm gonna ask someone to restate what Kiki said. Does anyone agree with Kiki?\n Yes, I do.\n And what did she say?\n She said that you can divide the circumference by 3.14.\n Okay.  So we know the circumference is 8.5, correct? And we know that pi is what, Molly?\n 3.14.\n 3.14, and we're trying to find the, the what, Devon?\n Diameter?\n The diameter, okay? So both Kiki and Maya say you divide by 3.14. Is that what we do? Treyshawn?\n Yes.\n So if I divide this side by 3.14, and I divide this side by 3.14, what happens to this right here, India?\n It would get smaller.\n It gets smaller.\n Yes, if you divide it.\n Okay, what is 3.14 divided by 3.14?\n One.\n Sure. \n", "filename": ["Copy of 796 MATH EA 796 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.0264975], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["laughter"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW06m", "TW07", "TW08m", "TW11", "TW13", "TW17m", "TW23", "TW24TW08", "TW24TW13", "TW24TW15"]}, "837": {"text": "\n What if it comes from like a polluted creek or something, or some kind of bad water system in the ground?\n Number three... .\n I say crystal clear and filtered.\n I said how dirty the water gets.\n How good the water is for you?\n\n It doesn't have stuff dying in it, it's crystal clear and it doesn't smell.\n  Okay, class, if we can pull back together please, as a group, I was hearing excellent discussions between each of the three questions, and I think we have some very valuable points to go ahead and talk about. So, what we're gonna do is kind of create a little bit of a list up here, to help us remind later when I go to show you something. So, we're gonna start again with that first question, and I'm looking for you to participate and share some of those questions together. So, it says again, how do you know if water is safe or not? And I heard wonderful responses, so can I hear some of those please? Brandon, please start us.\n Color and odor.\n  Okay, so you know if water is safe or not depending on again, the color and the odor. Good, what are some other responses? Brandon?\n Remember where you got it from. Like, if it was in a creek that looks fine, it's probably safe to drink, but if it's from a polluted creek that has a really weird color to it, or it's in a weird location, don't drink it.\n Okay, so I'm commenting here, I have, it depends on the source you're getting it from, and so if it's a creek that looks to be clean or clear, then you know it's probably okay? And if it looks to have like a weird color, I think you mentioned again to it, or polluted or in a weird location, then maybe it's not safe. All right, what were some of your other responses? Jack.\n Um, if it goes through a quality filter?\n Okay, if it goes through a quality filter. And Jack, can you maybe think of an example of a quality filter?\n A Culligan filter for the drinking water?\n Okay, so a Culligan filter that you can use to filter out the water. Okay, good. Madeline?\n There's no large pieces of trash or anything in the water?\n  Okay, so you can look for visible signs of large trash, and Madeline, what was the second part of that?\n Nothing that looks unnatural in it.\n  Okay, so nothing that looks unnatural. Great. Anybody else, any answers for number one? Again, how do you know if it's safe or not? Lexi, I think you had another answer that may have been covered up here. What did you say when I was talking with your group about... ?\n The smell?\n  Okay, the smell, again, the odor of it. Okay, great. Brandon, you thought of another one?\n If there's something dead in it.\n  If there's something dead in it, so again, we're going based on those visual aspects of it. Good. Well, we're gonna come back to that here in just a moment, so we'll move on to number two. When are times when the water might not be safe? Walker?\n After an earthquake or another disaster?\n  Okay, so after an earthquake. And Walker, can I have you expand a little bit? What would be so significant after an earthquake or another disaster that would make the water not safe?\n Because maybe something fell in the water, or, I don't know, I just heard that before.\n  Okay, so you heard it before, and if something fell in the water. Did you happen to see at all, in Japan after the tsunami came through there? Do you remember any of those images?\n Yeah kinda, they were different colors and yeah...\n  Okay, and I think I heard somebody else say that they remembered seeing a point that maybe we can add onto. Elvis?\n  At the beach.\n  At the beach? What do you mean by \"at the beach?\"\n There's different times where the water might not be safe.\n  Okay, can you think of a specific example, like have you experienced a time when you weren't allowed to be at the beach?\n When somethings dangerous in the water.\n  Okay, if something's dangerous in the water. Sometimes they might tell you that it's not safe to be there. Okay. Any other times that might make the water not safe? Amelia, can you think of any times where the water might not be safe?\n I have, after storms, like um, Walker did.\n  Okay, what are some things then, because this is something I'm hearing so far. What are some things after the storm that might be in the water besides, I think you said some stuff can fall in the water. What are some of the things that might be in the water that would make it not safe? Aashi, can you think of something that might get in the water?\n Um, like tree branches or animals?\n  Okay, so tree branches and animals, that's good. Can you think of anything else that might get in the water that maybe wouldn't normally be there? Kris?\n Trash?\n  Trash, okay. Can you think of a specific kind of trash? Lexi?\n Glass?\n  Glass. And what would be the danger of glass getting in the water?\n It's sharp and can cut yourself.\n  Okay, so there's a chance of getting injured if you cut yourself. What else... think outside the box a little bit more. What else could get in the water that you would not normally want in your water? Madeline?\n Plastic bags and then you can suffocate animals.\n  Okay, so plastic bags that they suffocate animals, something along those lines. Elvis?\n Oil and gasoline?\n  Oil and gasoline, good. Brandon?\n Toxins.\n  Toxins, okay. Jack?\n Plastic six-pack holders? Because it strangles the fish and everything.\n  Okay, now lets think... I'm glad you guys are all concerned about the fish and the animals and all of that, but what about we as humans, can you think of anything that would get in the water that would be potentially harmful to us afterward? Go ahead.\n Pesticides?\n Pesticides, okay. Brandon?\n Fertilizer?\n  Fertilizers. Elvis?\n A car? What is it again?\n A car.\n  A car, okay. All right, well we'll come back to those in just a minute. So, looking at... we've kind of come up with a list here of how you would determine if things are safe or not. So, then I guess my question would become, if you look at it's color and you look at if it's in a source that looks safe or not, how would you be able to determine if something is safe to drink? So, maybe that might change your perspective a little bit. So, is there a difference between being able to drink something, and maybe being able to swim in something? In fact, let me give you just a minute to talk about that with your partner for a minute. so, my question to you again, is it... are there different things we should look for in water that we drink, versus maybe water that we swim in or take a shower in? And I want you to talk about that with your partner and jot down a couple notes about that, so go ahead.\n \n\n  That's interesting to hear you saying shower water isn't as filtered as your drinking water.\n Our pool is safe, they put a water cover over our pool so it was different. At our pool they changed from... too much chlorine can burn people's eyes, so they changed it. Yeah, definitely a bigger job, but they put a small amount of chlorine in it, so all the bacteria that's on us, if you go swim in the pool it wouldn't matter, as opposed to in the shower because it's different.\n Even if you do have a water cover, still it could seep through, and that's how they clean it.\n When they open the pool it takes like a month, because they have to go through the water thing, and all the filters.\n  Okay, we'll come back together as a group one more time. Thank you all, again I hear great discussions going on. So, let's talk about this. There's some very neat ideas of whether you think something is safe to drink versus whether or not it's okay to shower or to swim in. So, what were some comments you were talking about in your smaller groups? Again, I heard some great discussions going on. Mikenna, what did your group talk about?\n Shower water isn't as filtered as drinking water.\n  Okay, so in their group they believe that shower water was not as filtered as what the water is that you drink in, so if it's not as filtered, where would your drinking water be coming from that maybe your shower water isn't coming from? Okay, is there a reason that maybe you thought along sometime where the shower water is not as filtered as your drinking water?\n No.\n  No, okay. It just makes sense to you that maybe the stuff that comes out of the tap to drink, is not necessarily the same thing coming out of your pipes for the shower? Okay, what were some other comments about that? Larry, what did you guys talk about?\n \n \n  May I have your attention please?\n Would all Spelling Bee winners please report to the auditorium at this time for the Spelling Bee. Again, all Spelling Bee winners please report to the auditorium at this time for the Spelling Bee. Thank you.\n  Okay, so Larry, to expand upon that, and I think he brought up a really good point. He said that maybe the water that you... were you saying, Larry, swimming or showering?\n  He was saying that the water we drink...\n Hold on just one second, Isaiah, just one second.\n \n Okay good, I wanted to make sure I wasn't saying it incorrectly. So, what he was saying is, in other words, when you shower or when you are going swimming, that water is not necessarily going in your body, you're not consuming that water, so there would be a difference possibly, between the water you're swimming in versus the water that you're drinking. Walker?\n I said that you would swim in darker water than you drink or shower in.\n Okay, so sometimes you think that the water you've been in when you swim is darker. So, going back to the color difference that talked about here. Okay, interesting. Lexi?\n The shower water and the water that we drink I think is sort of the same, but they go through a different process, but if we go swimming at our community pool, it's different because there's more chlorine and stuff, so you have bacteria on you and you're just swimming, you not really intaking it. But at your house when you drink or take a shower, it's different.\n  Okay. Would you say that... Because I think it's probably safe to say you guys mostly agree that there is a difference between drinking water and water you would shower in versus water that maybe you would go swimming in. So, what are some of those differences? What might be... what might they have to do to that water? Lexi was talking about maybe it would have to be treated differently, or that there would be chemicals added to it. So, can you think of what they would do to the water in a swimming pool, versus water that you drink to make it different? I think Jack mentioned about filtering, and Mikenna also brought up the point about it being filtered different. Brandon?\n Well, they put more chemicals in the swimming pool, because there's gonna be more germs and when people swim in it, so that will kill off the germs. As in drinking water is not as much chemicals because there's not really any germs, you're just drinking it, so...\n Okay, good. So, what I'm hearing is the amount of something..., so would you all agree, as a class, if we were to drink swimming water, would you die?\n  No.\n No, probably not, right? But the amount of the chemical that is in the water might be something that would cause some effects or cause some harm to you. So, do you think that there is chlorine in your drinking water? Because we said it's in the swimming pool probably to help kill off bacteria. Do you think that... and I'm hearing a little bit of a disagreeance here, so I'd love to hear your conversation in just a minute. Elvis, what do you think?\n There is chlorine in the drinking water, but then they purify it, so...\n  So they purify out the chlorine after they put the chlorine into the drinking water?\n Yeah.\n  Okay, good. And Isaiah, what were you thinking about? I think you were saying no, that there isn't the chlorine.\n My question is, if there was chlorine in drinking water, I mean, you can purify it, but it may still stay around that water, then why would you drink it? I mean, sure, it can knock out the bacteria and germs, but why drink it if it has chlorine in it? Because that's not good for you.\n  Okay, and going back to the amounts of it, and you're thinking that even the smallest amount might not be healthy for you to put in your system. Okay, Jack?\n Well, for a normal tap system, I think it's the last, or second last step they do, is they insert really small amount of chlorine into all tap water, usually in a normal town. And, so then a lot of people have chlorine in their drinking water, but for some people who have specialized filters for drinking water, they're designed to filter out all of the chlorine so that it's mostly just water that they're getting. So, some people have a filter installed.\n Okay, and would you be able to tell based on the color, because that seems to be what a lot of people are using as their indicator of good water. Would you be able to tell just by the color whether or not there's a lot of chlorine in it?\n  Maybe, maybe not. I don't know if this contributes to it, but sometimes I look at my drinking water compared to the tap water, and the tap water is a lot more foggy, so I don't know if that's because the chlorine or because it's aerated or something, but I don't know.\n  Okay good, thank you for sharing that. Elvis.\n You can buy those little filters that you can screw onto your taps so that way it filters down the water. I have one and it filters out tap water.\n  Okay, and it's filtering out more of the amount, or maybe none of it at all. Okay. Let's go back... oh, go ahead Madeline.\n I would just like to say to Isaiah's comment, we sort of have to have chlorine in our water because there would be more bacteria if we didn't, so there's a reason for it, and it's not that much. So, it would do you less harm to have the chlorine in the water than to not have it.\n  Okay, so the benefits of what you're saying is that you would at least have to have a little bit to kill off the bacteria, and that would outweigh the fact of you not having anything at all, and then being exposed to maybe whatever is in the water that the chlorine is not killing off, right? Okay, very good. Let's look at... We've used, again, some criteria, and let's look at that final question of, what is your definition of water quality? So, in other words, I think Jordan, I heard in your discussion, could you read your answer for us one more time about what you think water quality is to you?\n Water quality is how good the water is for you to drink.\n  Good, how good the water is for you to drink. Can I hear another definition of water quality? Kris, what did you decide?\n  How clean the water was?\n  How clean the water was, okay. And how would you determine if the water is clean or not? What was your number one indicator?\n  When you drink it.\n  When you drink it, okay. So, if you drink it and you know that it's clean, then it has good water quality to it. All right. Isaiah?\n My definition of water quality is how much of the water is polluted, and how much of the water is pure.\n  So, polluted versus pure and then kind of a ratio of if it's polluted and more pure then it's better water quality. Okay. Rachel, how about your definition of water quality?\n We said that water quality was how much of the water is pure water, and how much of it's polluted.\n  Okay, so going back to that same definition together as you all talked. And Ashani, what did you think water quality would be?\n How good the water is because some water, it like tastes different, you can tell.\n  Okay, so the taste. Have you ever experienced where water might taste a little different, can you think of an example?\n My aunt's house, when we go to her house it's always different from our house.\n  And what kind of taste would you say?\n It's gross.\n  It's gross water. Maybe back to when we were talking about well water in here versus the regular city water, and it has a different taste to it. So, what we're gonna do, is using your ideas so far, you guys have told me again based on color, and you mentioned about the smell of it, and you've mentioned about tasting the water. So, I have here three different liquids that I'm going to go around and show you, and on your paper, you're going to determine if these liquids are safe or if these liquids are not. And since we have already discussed that there's probably different qualities for your water versus the water you drink versus the water that you swim in or the water that you are going to take a shower in, so when you comment upon whether those liquids are safe or not, I think it would probably be a wise decision to comment if you think they're safe to drink versus safe to shower or to swim. So, I'll start here with cup letter A. So, you can go ahead and mark \"A\" on your paper, and then I will walk around so you can just take an observation of the liquid. And you determine, again, if you think that it is safe.\n  All right, so what do you all think? Logan? Do you think that this is safe to drink? So, if I gave this to you right now, you'd go ahead and drink it because it would be safe?\n  No.\n  No? What would make you change your answer then?\n", "filename": ["Copy of 837 SCI EA 837 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.079269], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Elvis"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Isaiah"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Elvis"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Kris"], ["Teacher"], ["Kris"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Logan"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW08", "TW17", "TW22", "TW23"]}, "173": {"text": "  Okay let's get busy. \n  So before we change the car we have two more times. \n  Okay let's look Jacob, let's help.\n  It's 9-3.\n  What is 9, three?\n  93.\n  93.

It might need help, for you holding the ramp, how bout you, do you think that's a good idea?\n  I'm gonna roll it back.\n  Alright.\n  Oh. \n  Is it gonna stay you think?\n  Yeah, I bet.\n  Awesome. Let's see how far it went. \n  Watch your foot.\n  105.\n  What is 105?\n  105.\n  I love the way that you're making sure that that goes nice and smooth on the way in. So let's take a look Jacob, let's look over here. Let's look at our data, we have the roll one, with just the normal way, we had 101 inches. And then the roll two which was again the same way at 93 inches. And roll three at 105 inches. Which way went the furthest?\n  103, roll three.\n  Roll three. Why do you think that is?\n  Because it's 101, that one is 101, and that ones 105.\n  Well why do you think roll one is different from roll three?\n  Because ones higher then the other.\n  ...higher then the other.\n  Because ones higher then the other. Okay, so do you want to try to add in or take away something from this vehicle?\n  I think we should--\n  What do you think we should pick? \n  Take away the girl.\n  Take away the girl?\n  Nothing. \n  What do you guys think about Hailey's idea? What did she say?\n  Jacob S.\n  Hold on, what did Hailey say? Say it again. \n  We shouldn't even try?\n  Okay, \n  Okay so how about Jacob, since Jacob was trying to make the other car, how 'bout Jacob tries to put on bigger wheels? We should see what happens then. \n  Here Jacob. Well look at this, look at which one would we need bigger wheels on?\n  That one\n  That one.\n  Okay.\n  So  that car. Go farther, that one will go farther.\n  Probably will go farther you think, with bigger wheels?\n \n  Yeah.\n  'Cause the bigger the wheel, the easier it has balance.\n   Did you hear what he said?\n  Bigger wheels have balance.\n  The bigger the wheels the more balanced it is.\n  I'm saying like, let's say you're \n  Is that gonna work? Is there anything else you guys want to do to this car? Or do you just want to change one thing?\n  I just change one thing.\n  Okay, it's your car. So what about your ramp? Ashley, what about your ramp, how do you want your ramp to be?\n  Maybe we can take this off and do it in the normal way.\n  Okay.\n   76.\n  You want to try that way? Alright. \n  That's true.\n  Whoa.\n  That wasn't go far.\n  Alright, let's measure.\n  It goes a little bit. She needs a little bit of help. \n  72.\n  72.\n  We're gonna put this vehicle--\n  Alright, so we're not going to change the car, but what could we do?\n  32.\n  Whoa look.\n {Student] Guys this is going to be affecting weight okay?\n  That box could stay here instead of-- \n  Alright, you guys try it. You guys got it now?\n  91 times 2. \n  Well that's up to your group.\n  Can I make my car now?\n  No, not yet. That's not weight three yet.\n  Split weight right now so--\n  How you guys doing? \n  Did you guys try to move the weight in different ways?\n  Ok.\n  Alright, back.\n  Let's do it together  \n  56.\n   Look at that, let's see what happened.\n  No it's 67.\n  Where's your data at? Put the data over here so we're all in the same place.\n  83.\n  Okay let's take a look. What do you have here?\n  67. \n  This will be so much fun.\n  Okay, you roll it.\n  Ashley, can I work on it, can I have it?\n  Should we take something away first?\n  No.\n  No.\n  42!\n  I think we should put a little one. Gimme that.\n  You think we should--  \n  I'm not sure.\n Cause the blue one \n  Wow.\n  Cool!\n  Oh. Oh my gosh.\n  Here I'll--\n  \n  Yeah.\n  And without these wheels. Now? Are you ready?\n  Go!\n  Here, here we go. Ouchie.  hold the end.\n  I'll hold it.\n  77?\n  No, it's 67.\n  Jacob \n  67.\n  Might be 77.\n  What is 77?\n   We did it for two ways so they can do it last way.\n  That was way more.\n  Yeah but \n  How many inches was that second roll?\n  Look--\n  Three feet so 3 F.\n  So what, three feet equals\n  36 inches.\n  We're going to be focused on the inches so we don't get confused.\n  \n  So hold on, wait a second. When we had that ramp the first way, what did you do with it, the same way as the first way?\n  No we did... this way.\n  Just that?\n  Yeah.\n  We haven't done it like that.\n  I know just re-adjust this.\n  Yeah.\n  So when did it go, when you did just that? \n  30 seconds, no it went that.\n  What is that?\n  73.\n  73. So then we moved it, to make it, which way did we do it the second way?\n  Higher.\n  We did it this way, what happened to the numbers?\n  It went lower.\n  It went lower?\n  So if we go it lower, it goes higher.\n  I don't know, let's try. So what's another ramp that we can make? Have you tried that way before?\n  Nope.\n  Alright, let's see. Hold on a second David, we have to measure.\n  \n  Nope, your group can help you measure. Let's see.\n  35. Ooh, that's seven.\n  Okay, let's take a look again, let's make sure. What's that?\n  \n  There we go. So roll three, let's try. Now let's take a look at our data, hold on.\n  That's not gonna work.\n  You don't think so? Well let's first take a look here and then we can see if that will work.\n  It's probably gonna fall.\n  What happened with roll three, where's the data? Look at roll three, what is it?\n  35.\n  And what's roll two?\n  I don't know.\n  36. So what do you think happened, whenever we made the ramp a little bit higher? I mean a little bit lower I'm sorry.\n  It changed?\n  It changed. What happened when it changed?\n  The number.\n  I see, let's focus.\n  It goes more...faster.\n  It might go more faster. There's not another roll four but you made a very interesting ramp, and you guys wanna try that?\n  Yeah.\n  Okay let's see, let's see what happens Taylor.  What happened?\n  \n  It fell.\n  I knew it would.\n  --my box.\n  Well how about you hold that, so we can try it again. Try it again. Oh no! Fix em and let's see if it does that every time, do you think it'll do it every time?\n  Yes.\n  Yes.\n   Let's try again.\n  I'll measure this time.\n  You'll measure?\n  Yeah.\n  Oh.\n  Oh.\n  We have to do it again.\n  Taylor, you can go on the carpet.\n  This time I made it lower. \n  Oh\n  So he just said something, what did he say?\n  He made it lower.\n  He made it lower.\n  So what's happening, every time he makes it a little bit lower?\n  It falls off.\n  When it falls off, it still can roll. I mean just keep it rolling when it falls off.\n  Uh oh .\n  I'll measure it.\n  Okay.\n  We don't have enough space to measure that one, how about we change the car and try again. But what did you guys notice every time the ramp changed? What happened when it was super high?\n  It fell apart.\n  It didn't work so well, can you imagine if you were in a real car, and you were going down something that steep?\n  Yeah.\n  No.\n  That would be kinda scary wouldn't it? But, as it kept going down, what happened?\n  It didn't go off.\n  It didn't fall apart, you're right. Alright go back and try to make a different car. Okay go back and try to make it, be careful your gonna make me nervous. \n  Alright let's see Jacob, what do you have? Come on over. Nope, Jacob come on over. What in the world did you make? That looks like a Mack Truck. Girls do you see this?\n  Yeah.\n  Tractors, throwing in something.\n  Now take a look roll it and see if that one feels good to you.\n  Big.\n  Girls are you watching? Look at how that rolled. Girls, you next.\n \n  Okay.\n  This was all my idea.\n  That was your idea? I love it.\n  Could we try it this way?\n  We could, keep a hold of that you might want to try it. Let's see.... Well we should be working on-- Correctamundo.\n  See? I got a good review.\n  What do we got Jacob?\n  93.\n  93. So what can we do to change it?\n  I guess we could maybe...\n  We're learning something.\n  We are learning something, what did we learning?\n  We learned the car, the littler it is, the harder for it to fall.\n  That is true?\n  It's your turn.\n  Is that what you're finding out, the smaller the car?\n  Yeah.\n  The smaller the car, the more it picks up.\n  Picks up?\n  Cars go over.\n  Oh were we going over?\n  No I--\n  It's your turn Preston.\n  Oh, did you guys hear him? Let's take a second and listen. He was talking about yesterday's experiment, what did we do yesterday?\n  We tried rolling little cars on the carpet.\n  Why didn't it work out so well Jacob? Little cars on the carpet.\n  Because the wheels stopped them.\n  Why did they stop, you think?\n  Because the carpets too rough.\n  Because the carpet's too rough. Did you guys find that too? So what are you finding about today?\n  That the bigger the wheels, the \n-on hard surfaces.\n  It's faster on smoother and hard surfaces, it goes further So what are you finding out about the ramp?\n  That--\n  You guys are finding that? How about you decide that for this last one, you tried one way with the ramp. And now we're going to try, two more ways with this ramp, and I want to see if guys can figure out, how this works better with a ramp.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 173 GEN EC 173 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.144128], "annotations": [["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["David"], ["Teacher"], ["David"], ["Teacher"], ["David"], ["Teacher"], ["David"], ["Teacher"], ["David"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Student"], ["David"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["David"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["David"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["David"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["David"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Taylor"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW09", "TW09s", "TW15"]}, "838": {"text": "  So just leave your clicker on your table guys. I mean you can put one in front of you, just don't turn it on yet, they're not activated. Please don't play with them because then the batteries can stay charged through the day. Thank you for the help. Excellent, thanks. All right guys, so let's get started with our discussion here. Set the clicker down please don't play with it, just leave it on the table, thank you. I asked you today to get our thinking going to answer this question. Danny DeVito is between 4'9\" and 5'1\" tall. So, i'm 5'10\" so Danny DeVito is either between this tall or about this tall. We're not sure on his height. His wife, Rhea Perlman is 5'0 tall. How tall do you think their sons and daughters will be and why? All right, so please raise your hand to share your answer, and I'm going to ask you why you think like you do. So, I'm going to start back there with Alex. So, turn this way so that I can hear you,  okay?\n  Okay. I think their kids would be around 5' because their mom is 5' tall and their dad his middle height is 5'?\n  Okay, so you're looking at the middle estimated height of Danny DeVito and his wife's height is 5', so you think together then all their children will be 5', boys and girls?\n  Mm-hm.\n Okay. Great, thank you. What else do you think? J.R.?\n I said 5' too. I said 5' as well because that's about how tall they are, so their kid would be around that.\n  Okay, so you're looking at kind of his average height and her height, so you think the kids will be around that? Okay, anything different or you want to explain it further? Michael?\n  I just said that you get your height from your parents, so whatever the parents were right around 5' the kids will be about 5'.\n  Okay, you get your height from your parents. So, since the parents are about 5' the kids will be 5'. Boys and girls?\n  Yeah.\n Okay, great. What do you think?\n  Well, I think  the daughter could be 4'9\" and the sons would be around 5'2\", because both of the parents are shorter, and so they could be a little bit taller or even a little bit shorter than one of their parents?\n Okay, so even though the parents are shorter they could be taller or shorter than the parents, and you said that the daughters could be about 4'9\" and the sons might be about 5'2\"?\n Yes.\n Is there a reason why you think the boys would end up being taller than the girls?\n It's just kind of a normal thing. Normally boys are taller than girls.\n Okay, so a normal thing, boys are usually taller than girls. Okay, great. Any other ideas on the height of their children? Adam, what do you think? Well, what do you think about...\n I think that they'll be around, I think boys and girls, will both be around 5' because it's right inbetween the parents.\n  Okay, good. What about me and my family? I'm 5'10\". So, I'm tall. What do you think about my family members? How tall do you think they are? I'm 5'10\", how tall do you think my mom is? How tall do you think my dad is? What's your estimation? What do you think? Raise your hands everybody, let's participate. Mackenzie what do you think?\n I think your dad would be around 6'2\" and I think your mom would be around 5'11\" or 5'9\"?\n  Okay, so my mom is between 5'9\" and 5'11\", so close to my height, and my dad would be taller, about 6'2\". Brian, what do you think?\n  I said that I think your dad would be taller than you, but then your mom would be around the same height.\n  So, my mom is about the same height and my dad is taller?\n  Yeah.\n Anybody think anything. . .  Pardon me?\n  Or like around 6'.\n  My dad would be around 6'?\n  Yeah.\n  What if I tell you my little brother...  my little baby brother, is 6'4\"? And he is. This is true, he is 6'4\". So, he's a tall guy. Does that change your ideas about the heights of my parents? You guys are nodding \"yes.\" What do you think now? Travis?\n  Maybe your dad is like 6'4\" and your mom is like 5'8\" or 5'9\" or something?\n  Okay, so Mom is about here, Dad is taller or 6'4\" like my little brother? Michael, what do you think?\n Both of them are about 6'.\n Both of them are about 6'. Okay, great, what do you think?\n Well, I know that a lot of people get their traits from their dad, from dads. So, that your dad is taller around 6'5\" and then your mom is shorter, like 5'8\".\n So, you see my height, and my mom is about 5'8\" and my dad is 6'5\",  so for my brother and I, you're figuring about our traits? What do you mean?\n That you get your traits from your dad.\n So, my dad's genes are coming through. Why do you think that? Why do you think I have only traits from my dad.\n Because I know a lot of people who get their traits from their dad and more than their mom.\n So, more traits from dad than from mom? Do you think that's pretty much general?\n  Yeah. Okay, great. Do you guys have anything to comment on that? What do you think?\n I think your dad's probably like 6'2\", because my brothers are both taller than my dad already and they're still in high school?\n  Oh, interesting. Well, I'll tell you my mom was 5'11\" at her tallest. Now she's shrinking, she's like 5'9\". You know how that happens as you get older and my dad, he's only 6' tall. So, my little brother is the tallest in the family and my other brother, he's 6'1\". So, height does come from both sides, but my dad's not as tall you guy's might've thought. Let's talk about Danny DeVito again. Here he is, our favorite actor, right? Notice his lack of hair, he's bald. The question on here says \"Danny DeVito is bald. What do you think his son's hair or lack of will look like when he's older, and why?\" His son, Danny DeVitto has a son. What do you think about his hair? Nice and loud so I can hear you. Matthew.\n It said that their son would have bald hair on the top, but some on the sides?\n  Some will be bald on the top, but he'll have some hair around the sides. Why do you think that?\n Because usually if somebody's dad's bald they're not always bald.\n  If somebody's dad is bald they are not always bald?\n  I've seen that.\n You've seen that? That's a good observation, Matt. What do you think?\n  Well, the mom has a lot of hair and the dad is bald, so I thought,  he will still have a lot more hair than his dad. He wouldn't be completely bald, but bald on top.\n Okay, so mom has a lot of hair, dad's bald. So, you think the son will have hair, but just bald on top?\n Yeah.\n So, when you see the traits being passed down, how do you see it?\n I'm not really sure what you mean by that question.\n You're kind of saying that he'll have this trait, but he'll also have this trait. So, how do you see that happening? Did he get all of his traits from one or all his traits from another, the son, or do you think . . .\n I think they were combined.\n They were combined. The traits are combined. Good, Sean?\n I thought he would have like a blackish-brown hair, because that's what the mom's hair color is.\n  Okay?\n He probably wouldn't be bald, but he'd have a receding hairline.\n  Okay, so he would have a receding hairline, and for those of us that don't know what that means, that means when a person starts to lose their hair, and it kind of inches back and they're losing their hair. That's what a receding hairline is. So, the hair falls out as it moves back. Are you ready to see what Danny Devito's kids look like? Here they are for our predictions. We have his son in the middle standing taller than everyone else in the family. He's about 5'5\". So, he's taller than both mom and dad. This is Danny Devito's wife, Danny Devito and his son. Here's his daughters. This daughter is about the height of the mom, but she has big shoes on. The other daughter is taller. But notice their hair, what do you notice about their hair? Ryan, tell me what you notice about all three kids.\n Well, they all have hair, they're not bald.\n  They all have hair, they're not bald. How would you describe their hair?\n Curly?\n  Curly hair. What color?\n Black.\n  Black or dark brown, yes very good. All right, so we see that. Now, when we think about these bunnies, another question I asked you is this, look at the picture. If they had ten offspring, what do you think the coats for each bunny would look like? The fur in what respect, that was the question. Nathan, what do you think?\n  25% would be white, 25% would be black, the remainder would be gray with a little white? So, part of them will be black and part of them will be white... So, half of them will be gray... ?\n  Okay, so here's what we have. I'm going to use abbreviations. and 50% will be gray. Nathan says that because one parent is white, one's black they'll combine to form a gray color, just like mixing paint in art class. Any other predictions? What else are you thinking? Let's hear from somebody new. What else do you think? Omar.\n  I think 40% of the bunnies are going to be black, are going to be half black and half white, like a black bunny with white dots, or a white bunny with black dots.\n  All right. So, you're saying 40% black, 40% white, You will see both colors. We'll see black and we'll see white. Why did you choose 40%, 40% and 20%?\n  Because I think that it's rare for bunnies to have dots . . . It might be rare for them to have dots.\n  Okay, so you see that a solid colored bunny more likely, the probability is higher for a solid color. So, that's why you chose 20%? Great, great thinking. Great explanation. Sean, what do you think?\n I had 20% white, and the rest are gray. I would have said 25%, but you can't have two and a half babies being white.\n Okay. All right, so you would've said 25%. So, you were thinking similarly.\n  Yeah.\n Why do you say 20%, 20% and 60%?\n Because most of them would be a mixture of the two, but a few of them would have to have more of one of the parent rabbit's traits.\n  Okay, so because they have offspring, the majority will be a mixture of both of their traits? So, mom and dad will blend together to create gray, but some of them will look just like the father, some will look just like the mother, so some will be black, some will be white. Great. One more idea.  Kasey what do you think?\n  I know in health  that everyone has a dominant feature. I think white is, so that the majority, so like 40% would be white, and 20% would be black, and then the rest would be gray.\n 40% white, 20% black and 20% gray. And you said, because in health you were learning about dominant features and you believe...\n  That's only 80%. Oh, what did you say for the last one?\n I said the rest.\n Wow, well thanks for paying attention Good check there guys.\n  It would be 40%.\n ...60%, we need 40... Did you say 40?\n  I said the rest.\n I was just making up too many different numbers. Well, I'm so happy that you guys are paying attention. I'm going to tell your math teacher, good job. Okay, 40% white, but here's what Kasey said that was really good.  She said that 40% will be white, because white is dominant. You used that word. You talked about that in health a little bit. So, let's talk about dominant and what that means. What does it mean? What do you think dominant means? And be nice and loud for us. John.\n Most of?\n  Most of. Good. What do you think Sam?\n Main?\n  Main... Sean?\n The majority?\n  The majority...Alex?\n Beat out all others?\n  Beat out all others. Nice.  What do you think, Sean?\n  Strongest?\n  Okay. Let me show you a little example here. So, where do we get our traits, first of all? Where do we get traits?\n  From parents.\n From where?\n  Parents.\n Your parents. Okay, it's passed down. Traits are passed down and some come from each parent, right? Dominant, recessive, some come from both mom and dad. If you received a dominant trait . . . See I labeled this cup dominant and colored it pink and you received a recessive trait. So, half and half, mom and dad. They come together, which trait do you see? The dominant one or the recessive one?\n  The dominant one.\n The dominant one. What if I put it this way. Which trait do you see? The dominant one. What if I put two recessive traits together?\n  The recessive.\n The recessive, okay. Either way I pair them, mom or dad, dad or mom. If I have two dominant traits that go together, what do I see?\n  Dominant.\n Dominant, okay. So, if the dominant trait is present, then... finish the sentence. If the dominant trait is present in your genes, then what?\n  It will show.\n It will show, Kasey says. That's right, if the dominant trait is present it will show. Are you guys remembering this from yesterdays little intro? Okay, let's check this then real quick. Yesterday you filled out this concept map. Let's make sure that your answers are correct. Jsut take a look. So, read this with me.\n  \"Genetics is the study of heredity, the passing of traits from parent to offspring\" and if the offspring has the same alleles, we call that?\n  Purebred.\n And if they have different alleles?\n  Hybrid.\n What that means, allele, that word say that, allele.\n  Allele.\n It's the fun word to say during our genetics unit. That's the form of the gene, so is it a dominant or is it a recessive. Okay, so let's go back here. Genetics is the study of . . .\n  Heredity.\n The passing of...\n  Traits.\n I don't hear everybody. Controlled by...\n  Genes.\n Made of...\n  Alleles.\n Say it again. Alleles.\n  Alleles.\n So genes made of...\n  Alleles.\n Shows when present. We call that...\n  Dominant.\n And can be masked...\n  Recessive.\n Recessive, all right, very good. Any questions on the concept map? Any corrections if you need to make them, please do so. All right! Well, let's get going with our lab. Are you guys ready? Okay, please take out your lab paper? We're going to go back to some of those reflection questions later on. Notice the top of the paper. It says \"Problem\". This is what we're trying to solve. This is the point of our scientific investigation. \"Are traits controlled by dominant alleles more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles.\" I'd like you, on the lines, to create your own hypothesis, or your prediction for this. \"Are traits controlled by dominant alleles more common\" that's the question \"are they more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles?\" So, write down what you think, write down your prediction. If you can write it in the if-then format of how we do hypotheses, that's preferred, but if that confuses you at this point, just write what you think is going to happen. Are dominant alleles more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles. Whatever you think, it's your thinking. We will talk about our hypotheses in just a moment. So, once you've written down your hypothesis, reread it and make sure that it answers the question. Then we're going to get to work using our clickers, which i'll explain in just a moment. I'd like to hear you share some hypotheses before we begin. The question again, \"Are traits controlled by dominant alleles more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles?\" Please share your prediction, your hypothesis. Ronnie.\n I said yes, because dominant alleles, it shows over recessive alleles?\n So, you believe dominant will be more common because they show over recessive alleles. Okay, great. Girls, one of you share your hypothesis for me. Who would like to share? Everyones looking at you Kate. What do you have on your paper?\n  I said that I thought the dominant alleles were more common?\n You believe the dominant alleles will be more common. Okay, great, thank you.  Another one. Alex?\n  I agreed with it. I said that I believe that dominant traits were more common than recessive, because there's more combinations to get dominant one's over recessive.\n You believe dominant traits are more common than the recessive, because there's more combinations...\n  To get that?\n To get to that. To get the dominant traits to show. Good. One more. Matthew?\n I said that the dominant traits are less common, because in the picture with Danny DeVito? His son and daughters didn't look much like him?\n Okay, so you believe that the dominant traits are less common, because in the example of Danny DeVito, his kids didn't look much like him.\n  Yeah, and how your younger brother is 6'4\"...\n And how my younger brother is 6'4\", but he's taller than the rest of my family. Okay, so you're making connections to our earlier conversation, good. We're going to revisit our hypotheses after we do this lab.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 838 SCI EA 838 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.00928657], "annotations": [["Teacher"], ["Alex"], ["Teacher"], ["Alex"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Michael"], ["Teacher"], ["Michael"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Brian"], ["Teacher"], ["Brian"], ["NaN"], ["Brian"], ["Teacher"], ["Brian"], ["Teacher"], ["Travis"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Nathan"], ["Teacher"], ["Omar"], ["Teacher"], ["Omar"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Sean"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Kasey"], ["NaN"], ["Kasey"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Kasey"], ["NaN"], ["Kasey"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Sean"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Kasey"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Kate"], ["NaN"], ["Alex"], ["NaN"], ["Alex"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Alex"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW06", "TW13", "TW16", "TW22", "TW23"]}, "839": {"text": " And one more.\n There's this one spider and he's around all day and then he comes and comes out.\n  Oh, so it's waiting for him. You know, i'ts like a trap.\n It covers itself in the flower and like it sets in the flower. It sits perfectly still in the flower and then when something lands on it, it attacks it and eats it.\n Wonderful, so they're not really attracted to flowers, they're attracted to the insects in order to ambush them. Is that what you're telling me?\n  Yes.\n Okay, all right. So, and we talked about what is it that attracts these? Well, we see a lot of bugs, we see humming birds, and Jack mentioned this word, pollen. Do you know what pollen is? Do you know what pollen is?\n  Ah...\n  Do you know what pollen is? Are these things attracted to the pollen?\n  Yes.\n  Well, not really though.\n  No, not really?\n  Sometimes.\n  Sometimes.\n  I guess.\n  Say that again please?\n  It's an ingredient to make honey.\n Pollen is an ingredient to make honey?\n  Oh, nectar? Yeah.\n So bees are attracted to flowers because of their... blank.\n  Nectar. Go ahead, Jimmy.  How would you fill this in? The bees are attracted to flowers because of their... blank. Go ahead and write your answer in.\n  Oh, okay.\n I see some people writing pollen. You have color. They're definitely attracted to their color. We have nectar. And we have, we actually have all of them here. So, which one is it? Is it one of these or all of these?\n  All of these.\n  All of them.\n All of them, tell me more. Tell me.\n  I think it's pollen  and nectar because the nectar's in the pollen and the bees take the pollen and then use the pollen to make stuff, or honey out of it. So, it's kind of like taking it to its'...\n So, we say that flowers attract insects, so we can connect these two ideas here. And we've talked about their color. The insects were attracted because of their color and they're also attracted because of their...\n  Nectar.\n Nectar, okay, let's put nectar right here. And they're also attracted because of their good smell?\n  No.\n  Yeah.\n  Yeah.\n  No?\n  The nectar smells good, that's why butterflies go to them.\n  Maybe look that up on Google. Why do you think flowers take all the trouble to make them smell good?\n  So bees will go to them.\n Why do people go to trouble to smell good?\n  \n Why not?\n  Because, it would be gross.\n Say that again.\n Attention?\n You want attention? You want to be attractive to other people too?\n  Heck no.\n Maybe you're too young for that. Yeah, when you get older, don't you want to attract other people?\n  Sure.\n Don't you want other people to find you pleasant?\n  Yes.\n You know, it's not a big thing, but are these fragrances signals to these insects? They're attractive right? And we'll talk about, I agree, they are useful, but that's not going to fit into my process just yet. But all of these things do attract the insects, right? But what is it that keeps the insects coming back? It's sort of like the color, the smell, you know, the, maybe the shape of the flower. All of these things are like advertisements to the insects. Why?\n  For the nectar?\n For the nectar. It's the nectar that's going to keep them coming back. All right, you see this bee here? What's all this yellow stuff on the bee?\n  Pollen?\n Pollen. Does the pollen attract the bee?\n  No.\n Does the bee want the pollen?\n  No.\n  Yes and no because the pollen helps all of the flowers to stay alive.\n  The pollen is definitely important to the flower, right?\n  Mm-hm? The bees just spread it around.\n  The bees spread it around? How many people are aware that bees spread pollen? I see just about all your hands go up. So the insects are spreading, let's put that up here, they're going to spread the stuff called pollen. Right? Of course, the insects are really getting what?\n  Nectar.\n Yeah, so let's put they are taking or they obtain this nectar here, right? And nectar is another word for what?\n  Food.\n You all understand that nectar is their food?\n  For the bees.\n  For the bees? Just the bees?\n  No, and hummingbirds.\n And insects?\n  Us.\n And hummingbirds?\n  Us, us, we have honey. Nectar is technically honey.\n So, nectar is actually a food for us, because we steal it from the bees, right?\n Yeah.\n And we hide it from the bears, yes?\n  Isn't there this one point where it has saliva, or something in the bottom of it, and it's in the shape of a picture, and all of these flies and everything are attracted from the sweet smell and everything, and they get into the water, they can't move and everything, they're paralyzed?\n Okay, it's a trap.\n  Yeah. \n  Like the venus fly trap.\n Just like the venus fly trap.\n  Yeah, I don't know what it's called.\n Do venus fly traps have flowers?\n  No, they have clear white.\n  The mouth smells really sweet.\n  That's because it catches flies.\n Okay, we're going to talk about that in a minute. A lot of people, when I was reading your paragraphs, a lot of people told me that venus fly traps were one of the many kinds of plants that don't have flowers. All right, but let's look at this thing about pollen for a minute. Why is it that the flowers want these insects to keep stealing their nectar? What's going on here? They want them to spread the pollen, but why?\n  To make more food?\n  To make what?\n  To make more food?\n  You think it's to make more food. What do you think Olivia?\n  To make like honey.\n  The flowers want the bees to make honey?\n  No, they like  need it to make more food.\n  Pollen is an ingredient for nectar to make.\n I understand that, but why does the flower go to all this trouble? Do flowers just like bees?\n  No.\n They say hey, you're a nice guy. We'll make you some...\n  To keep them alive, I think?\n To keep... the flowers are making the food to keep the bees alive?\n  No.\n   I don't know.\n  That's okay, that's okay. What do you think, Joe?\n  To fertilize other flowers?\n Fertilize? What's fertilize? You mean to like give them like fertilizer on the ground? Or are you talking about a different kind of fertilizer?\n Different.\n You're calling it a different kind of fertilizer. Interesting. How many people understand that flowers are related to fertilization? How many people have heard that before? Hands up here, okay. So, if you want to ask what pollen is, you might want to ask what flowers do. All right and to answer that, I first of all, let's make sure, this dandelion, is this a flower or is this a weed?\n  Flower.\n  A weed.\n Okay, thumbs up or thumbs down. Who says it's a weed? Okay? I see most of you thumbs up, a couple of you have sideways or down. Next, how about this one, how many people think it's a flower? Okay. How many people say it's a weed and a flower? Now I see some people who don't know. Well, let me ask you this. If you're to look at this, here's a pretty good picture of it, what makes you think it's a flower? Are there characteristics about this plant that make you think it's a flower?\n  Yes.\n  I don't think it's a flower...\n That's not my question. Are there characteristics about this that make you think it's a flower?\n  Yes.\n What would those be?\n The petals?\n The petals? Excellent. Anything else?\n  It's color?\n It's colorful? Anything else?\n  It has some nectar, maybe?\n You think it has nectar?\n  Maybe a little bit.\n Have you ever seen insects hovering around dandelions?\n Yes.\n Who have seen... who have seen? Yeah, it's very common. Well, you can actually see bees on top of, on top of flowers. Here's a close up of the dandelion. What do you notice there?\n  That looks a lot more ugly?\n It looks ugly?\n  Yeah.\n Really?\n  No it looks cool.\n  It looks like water spouts goin' like...\n It does look like water. What do you see on the side here?\n  Pollen.\n Does that look like pollen? What does pollen look like?\n  Just tiny balls of... stuff.\n Of stuff, yeah?\n There those tiny little, like, they look like little leftover pieces just hanging off the side of the stem and it's with the bees and it sticks to the bees when they land on the flower, so it stays with them for a while. A ball and then it sticks to the bee, like if you want to see the bee, it's got all the yellow stuff on his leg?\n  Yeah, we had the picture earlier, yeah.\n  Yeah, I saw a bee on a flower in the summer and he had a bunch of that yellow stuff on his body?\n  Cool.\n  Actually, that's the pollen.\n So the pollen, so it is picking up pollen. So, it sounds to me that, I guess what I want to convince you is that dandelions are flowers.\n  They are?\n Yeah, they're definitely flowers. Let me show you a picture of a dandelion. A little video, it's about one minute long, and let's go ahead and turn the lights off. And as you're watching it, just tell me what you observe happening in the video. Just go ahead and shout it out.\n  The flower is opening, it's blossoming.\n Okay, this is time lapse, so this is happening a lot faster than what it really normally, but you saw the flower open?\n  It's dormant, dying now.\n  And now it's closing up and it's dying.\n  It's going dormant.\n  It's dead. How many people think it's dead?\n  No, it's still growing.\n  It's dormant.\n  It's growing into that white stuff.\n  Say that again?\n  It's turning into that thing in the ball.\n  That's like, Marissa's making a prediction.\n  It's gonna grow taller.\n  No, it's going to break up.\n  Do you see the insects all over it? Every now and then you can kind of see an insect on it.\n  Oh, yeah.\n  Yeah, there's one down at the root.\n  At the very base of it.\n  Yeah, something's happening.\n  Something's happening.\n  It got taller on the screen.\n  Oh, the bottom petals are starting to die.\n  \n  What's that?\n  It's starting to look like an onion.\n  What's that thing on the top?\n  It's going to blow away.\n  It's going to grow into a dandelion.\n  That was the flower, wasn't it?\n  That's the thing you blow on.\n  What's that?\n  They're seeds, they're seeds!\n  Yeah, you blow on them and it's really fun.\n  It's reproducing.\n  I'm hearing Steven say they're seeds. And Brandon, oh that thing disappeared. That whole top blew away.\n  That's the stuff that you like to blow.\n  How many people think these are seeds?\n  I know they are.\n  Ah, Andrew's thinking. So the flower turned into what?\n  A seed.\n  A reproducer.\n  A big seed?\n  No, they're all little seeds.\n  No, they're all individual seeds.\n  Are they blowing?\n  Yes.\n  Make a wish. Can I have the lights on please. So you have... \n  Like a month period.\n  Yeah, that took a while. And I think you've seen dandelions, you may not have, you've probably seen the dandelions in two stages. Sometimes they're like gel flowers and later they turn into these little white, puffy, seed pods, right?\n  You puff on them and they blow in the wind.\n  Yeah, what does the wind do?\n  It blows them away and it starts reproducing.\n So each seed is like a little parachute?\n  Yeah.\n And it's dispersed to new lands?\n  Yes.\n All right, so if I were to say flowers, if I were to make a connection between flowers and seeds, what would you say about that? What will you say? What is the connection between flowers and seeds? McKenzie?\n  They both reproduce.\n  They're both  related to reproduction. Okay, uh-huh?\n  One makes another?\n Okay, so one flowers make seeds or flowers produce seeds, and there's that word that McKenzie was using, reproduce because seeds grow into...\n  Flowers?\n Flowers which then...\n  Grow into seeds?\n  Which then...\n  Grow into more plants?\n  What does that sound like?\n  Life cycles!\n Wonderful, wonderful, these are life cycles. What I'm going to ask you to do right now, is we're going to look at a seed very, very closely. I have some, you know what these are? Lima beans?\n  Oh, I love lima beans.\n You do, really?\n  Yeah.\n Oh, I don't like lima beans.\n  I've never tried them.\n  I like them in my favorite dish, chicken pot pie.\n My dad loves lima beans, anyway. I have some. They have been soaking overnight in some water, and they're going to look a little bit different because they've been soaking under water. What I want you to do is, when you get one, I want you to open it up, like a book. Dig your thumbnails into the side of the seed and open it up very carefully, and I want you to look inside. That's what the magnifying glasses are for. I want you to be able to tell me what do you find inside the seed? Everyone clear? Go ahead, one person from each table come up and get a couple of seeds?\n  How many?\n Oh, you know what? Get maybe three of them in case one of them doesn't work. We have a spare. Three not unbroken, nice plump seeds. Take them to your seat. I just want you to look at them.\n  They're bigger.\n  They are bigger, aren't they? What else are they?\n  They're sort of hard.\n  They look like mandarin oranges.\n   Why's that,  what makes you think they're like oranges?\n  They're not hard anymore!\n They're no what?\n  They're not hard anymore.\n They're not hard.\n  We grew them last year.\n What's that?\n  We grew them last year.\n Oh, you grew these last year. What do these turn into?\n  Farmer's .\n  They turn into plants?\n  What are we supposed to be looking for?\n  Well, you tell me. Don't break them open. Here's how I want you... Can I borrow this? Okay, I want you to go to the round part here, and you notice it has like a seed coat?\n  Yeah.\n Okay, you know kind of peel that back.\n  Oh cool?\n And then open it up like a book. Okay?\n  I'm looking at the skin.\n  Like this?\n  Yeah, open it up like a book and look inside and see what you find. There's a little surprise there.\n  What is this?\n  It's a bug!\n  It's located... yeah.\n  Oh, gross.\n  Mine's already broken so.\n  Well, you have a good one right here. This is perfect.\n  Oh I see it.\n  Look at that. That's a really good one.\n  I don't see it.\n  Yeah, go ahead break it. Just like you did.\n  I can't open it.\n And oh, yours is right here. Yours kind of fell apart. Do you have another seed? Be there in a second.\n  Okay.\n Oh, there it is right there. Do you see that?\n  I don't have one.\n Look at it very carefully with the magnifiers. What do you have? Let me see what you got. Yeah, right there. There's actually part of it right here, broke in half and that's attached, and there's also a little bit here. Perfect, look at this, Patrick. That's what you want to look at.\n  I can't open mine.\n  See it, see it there? What do you see?\n  I don't see it.\n  Oh, there is a little bit of green there, isn't there?\n  Yeah.\n  Who else is having trouble?\n  Me.\n  I already opened mine.\n  Yes you did.\n  Are they supposed to smell bad?\n  Yeah, they do kind of smell, don't they?\n  Yeah, they smell.\n Did you see that whole thing right on the tip? Look at that under the magnifying glass. Okay, okay look at my photograph up here. Here we go. This is kind of what you're looking at. You have these two like little half circles, little kidney shaped starchy figures, but what is this thing right here?\n  It's a seed. It's starting to sprout.\n What is it?\n  It's a start of a lima bean.\n I thought this whole thing right here.\n  It's the start of a lima bean plant.\n  This is like a plant sprouting out. Is that what you're trying to say Steven? What's that? Is there anything about this that makes you look like a plant or makes you think it might be a plant?\n  Like that, like the big parts might be like, maybe like the soil or the stuff that needs to get bigger? Like when we add water to stuff it starts to get bigger?\n  Well, did you notice there are two parts to it?\n  Yeah.\n  Yeah, it like goes down?\n  There is, what's this right here?\n  It's the sprout.\n  Okay, I heard you say it looks like a stem. Anybody think it looks like anything else? Uh-huh? Go ahead, McKenzie? Why are these pointing here? Why are these pointed?\n  It's kind of new.\n  That makes sense.\n  Looking to break through.\n  Break through the...\n  The soil.\n And what breaks through the soil? What part of the plant breaks through the soil?\n  The seed?\n  The root?\n Does it look like a root?\n  Yeah.\n How many people think it looks a little bit like a root? And this looks a little bit like a stem. What does this look like to you?\n  A flower.\n Let me see, it looks like this and there's another one that kind of looks like that. What does that look like to you?\n  Leaves.\n Leaves. What do leaves, okay. Do you ever see anybody draw pictures? Whats that?\n  It looks like a carrot.\n  It looks like a carrot,  doesn't it? Okay, look at those leaf like structures very carefully with your magnifier. I want you to look for a detail. You see a little characteristic.\n  Oh I see it, I see it!\n What do you see?\n  I see like the veins of a leaf.\n Wonderful.\n  I don't. Oh yeah, I do.\n Wonderful, you have little veins there on the leaf? Yeah, you can see.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 839 SCI EA 839 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0473276], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Jimmy"], ["Jimmy"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Olivia"], ["Teacher"], ["Olivia"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Joe"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Marissa"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Andrew"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["McKenzie"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Steven"], ["Teacher"], ["Steven"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["McKenzie"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW05", "TW06s", "TW13", "TW16", "TW17", "TW22", "TW23", "TW24"]}, "1857": {"text": " A prediction on the weather temperatures.\n Okay so maybe they can predict something that's going to happen.\n Yes.\n  Okay. So, based on the information that you collected is there any information, let's say you could go out the next day. What do you think, based on what you saw, what do you think might happen the next day?\n It might go back down into the 30s or the 20s.\n  Okay, and what makes you say that?\n Because there's more 30s and 20s then there are 50s and 40s. And, then there was a large spike so.\n  Okay, so it got warmer. But you're saying because most of them were cooler, it might get cooler again?\n Yes.\n Okay, so you're making a conclusion. You're using your data to support that. Shaun, what are you thinking?\n I was thinking that maybe they might want to track it, because maybe weather can, not evolve over time, but how much it's changing and predict what's gonna happen.\n Okay, so you're thinking like a meteorologist or a scientist might make a forecast, make a prediction, so you're thinking sort of like Hava. And were your temperatures similar to her, or were they very different? because you might have been at two different stations. What do you think might happen on the next day?\n I think it will drop down to the 30s, because I see that it's dropping down, it's going up, and then it's dropping down. I think it's gonna go up and then drop down again.\n Okay, and it does look like you had kind of a trend here. So, what do you think if you had a day that went down, do you think it might go up again?\n Mhm.\n Might peak up again? Okay. Is there anybody else who's looking at their data thinking of what else might happen with that temperature change? Madison, are you looking at something? Yeah, what do you think?\n Well, with the wind speed and it would be like 8.5 for quite a few times a day. Sort of shot up into\n So what do you think that was indicating?\n That it was a very windy day.\n A very windy day, okay. So you guys, some of you look at your charts if you were, Madison was in Group A, and can you make a connection, or H. Madison, can you make a connection to your wind speed really spiked. On that same day did you have any difference, or did you have something happen in your temperature?\n Well, the temperature was about 20 degrees and because of the wind was making it cooler.\n Okay, so you're saying that you think that the wind also has an effect on the temperature?\n Mhm.\n Okay, so was there anybody else in Group H that recorded that sort of thing? You had a big windy gust, you had a very windy day, your temperatures went down? Did you have a similar thing happen to you Hava?\n Yes.\n Yes, okay. So you guys, why would we want to track something like not only temperature, but also the wind speed? Jada?\n So that they can know what tomorrow's gonna be like, or what another day's gonna be like. Or for them to know if it's gonna rain or,\n  Okay.\n What the temperature is gonna do.\n So they want to think maybe more, you guys now your thinking, Jada, you're even putting together precipitation? So maybe there's a consequence of precipitation?\n No, with low temperature and maybe heat can evaporate some water and then the next day it can get dropped down and get colder.\n Okay, so maybe a connection with the precipitation, temperature, those sorts of things. Okay, Katie O. What are you thinking?\n I would think that they wouldn't just want to track the temperature, but they'd also do the wind speed because wind speed can change how, what the temperature is, and how it changes.\n So why do you think wind speed makes a difference with temperature? What are you making the connection with? What's your evidence?\n Well wind speed I think would change like it wouldn't make it warmer, it would make the temperature feel colder.\n Okay.  So why do you think that?\n Because the wind...\n Well you go out to the playground a lot, right?\n Yeah.\n And when you guys are on the playground and it's really windy, is it warm?\n No.\n Okay, so maybe are you thinking like when you go out there and it's really windy and you don't have a coat, does it feel cooler to you?\n Yes.\n Does it on sometimes?\n Yeah.\n  Alright, so maybe they're maybe a prediction. And so you were saying they, so are you thinking scientists and meteorologists are trying to put those two together, those phenomenons?\n Yeah.\n Okay, so Katie O, let me ask you, if this was a hypothesis that you were saying, if it's windier, then it may be cooler. You guys agree as a class? Okay thumps up, thumbs down, what do you guys think? Yes, no, maybe, a little bit there? Alright, Josh, what are you thinking?\n I was saying that if people are always looking at the temperature so we know what's gonna happen, when it's gonna happen, what we can expect, what we need to do.\n Okay.  So we're taking that forecast even further maybe? So let me kind of pose another question real quick before I keep going you guys. Let me ask you, you guys remember when you went on the computer and you watched the hurricanes? And you tracked the hurricanes? So was that data indicating the speed or the movement of the hurricane?\n Yes.\n Yes? So, does a meteorologist even track something like that to be able to maybe help people?\n Yes. Okay.  So do you guys remember when the meteorologist came to visit us? You guys remember that? And he really talked to us a lot about tornadoes, didn't he? But, he was also giving us situations of how we know a tornado might be forming, right? So, yeah, does that make sense, that that might be another reason that they start tracking? So think and talk to your shoulder partner. Besides a hurricane, what else might they track to, like Josh was saying, to prepare us for, to let us know. So talk to your shoulder partner. \n The weather because some people can know what to like my hands.\n Yeah, or like tornadoes.\n Yeah, or maybe even thunderstorms.\n Or the normal weather. Very intense temperatures, we can already know.\n Maybe even like snow, because that can be a really heavy and or kind of get everywhere like snowbound us.\n Or it could like be rain, snow, hail. \n  So what do you think Emily, what else can we determine? \n Snow storm. Or a tornado.\n Or a earthquake.\n So what were you thinking first Alexis, and then we'll come back to Nick?\n I was thinking either a tornado or blizzard snowstorm.\n Okay.  So what kind of weather do you think they're tracking in order for us to be prepared about weather. What do we?\n Wind.\n Wind, maybe.\n And temperature.\n Snow.\n  Okay, so if we're looking for just a tornado, maybe temperature, maybe the wind.\n Yeah, what kind of wind is it, is it cold or hot, yeah.\n Okay, hot and cold fronts. And then we were thinking about, what else Nick?\n I would say a flood because maybe maybe the clouds are coming and there's going to be a bunch of rain. Like you said, that we could get a flash flood.\n Okay.  So and are you making that connection to maybe our area that had a fire, and so we have to think about would there be, because it can't absorb the moisture. Okay, so that's another idea. So how would meteorologist or scientists, how would they Austin, how would they predict maybe a flood happening? What do you think they'd use? What kind of information would they be looking at?\n Well if a rainstorm was coming, because that rain would cause a flood.\n  Okay, so a large amount of rain, that would make sense yes.\n Or snow.\n Or even if we had a lot of snow. So if we had large amounts of snow, what could we possibly be warning people of, if that was the case? Alexis, what do you think?\n Stay inside or wear warm clothes if you go somewhere or something so they don't get so cold.\n  Okay, so would you guys say, would one of you formulate some sort of a hypothesis about snow coming if there was?\n If there was enough cold air. And some times when it's raining it starts to hail, and then it starts to, sometimes it starts to snow.\n So, if there's cold weather and clouds, then we might have consequences.\n Snow, or rain, or yeah.\n  of hail, or heavy snow?\n Yeah.\n  Okay, so we'd wanna keep that in mind. And does that seem to happen in our areas?\n Sometimes.\n  Sometimes. And sometimes when we make that forecast, and then maybe it doesn't come.\n That happened on Saturday.\n  Okay, so if it does come, what happened on Saturday, Austin?\n I think it was really humid out at first,\n  Mhm.\n And then, it started to rain, and then a lot of times usually rain starts out as ice and then it melts. And it started to get colder and then it started to hail.\n  So then we have the consequences of a hailstorm. Didn't last Saturday, did it start out really nice first?\n Yeah.\n Yeah, and then also happened yesterday too, because when I got picked up it was nice and warm and everything. And then when I got to my house it was all windy, and then it started raining. So I was like, I thought it was supposed to be hot today.\n Right. So is it possible to use forecasting information and still be wrong?\n Yes. \n Well in the weather book, it explains the rating of tornadoes. So I'm thinking tornadoes, or something to track like the wind speed if it's gets too crazy, it get like wind miles per hour, and how bad it is. Like if the wind speed's really high, then it can cause a tornado. Like the scale. \n So they use that information. We were just talking and showing the things that they might be using for information that they're collecting to do what now? To give to the what?\n They're doing it to give us warnings. They can't tell us that a tornado's happening prior to it,\n  Right.\n So they have to warn us about them. And so I think they collect the data from that to do that.\n Okay, and then Reagan, what were you connecting that with?\n I was connecting it with a blizzard or snow storm, because if there's a delay and you need to go somewhere, you can know that there might be delays. And if you're gonna go outside you need to wear a coat, a heavy coat.\n Okay, so how do we respond, how do we react to it, good. Okay, you guys I was going around, and I heard some excellent conversations. And so I think you guys made strong connections with your data. And probably with your meteorologist visit, what they were telling you, and how you were putting that information together. So I want you guys to go ahead and pick up your pencils. And write underneath your graphs, I want you to answer this question. What does your data tell you? So write there on underneath your graph, or write on your graph, you could even write right in the middle of your graph, I want you to write what is your graph actually telling you? So is it telling you that you had a series of cold days? Make your prediction. So go ahead and take a minute or two, write down what your data tells you and then what changes did you observe? What was the most significant change that you observed? If at all possible, while you're writing that, you can come up with a hypothesis about your data. It could either be your wind speed, or it could be your temperature. Write down what it is that actually took place. Yeah, you want to answer the question, what does your data tell you? What changes did you observe? On either graph or you can even write a sentence that combines the two of them together.\n So mine says, I added a little more. It says, it is telling me all about my wind speed, and how it's going high or low, or high. What does your say Austin?\n Mine is, it had cold and hot days. And it went from 44 degrees Fahrenheit to 20 degrees Fahrenheit.\n  So go ahead, just like Alexis and Austin shared, go ahead and share with your face partner this time, so that you change who you're talking to. So Emily and Madison, you can also share what you wrote.\n It tells me that some times it can be hot, and then go down to a little bit colder, and then it goes back into hot.\n Yeah, that's what I was kinda saying when I told the wind speed, because it's not always wind speed. Yeah, it's not always wind speed, but most of the time when we took it, it was mostly in the winter so it would mostly go down. Like, it was 40, then it was 25, then it was 20, and then it was 30, and then it was 30, and then it was 40, and then it was 50. So, that's what.\n  So John what did you figure out from your data?\n I figured out that it was colder the week we were doing this.\n  Okay.\n And the wind speed was not very high.\n  Okay, oh yeah, yeah. So you were in an area that maybe was more protected by the wind, do you think?\n Yeah, we were behind the building.\n  Oh okay, so that might of had an effect too?\n Yeah.\n  Okay, did you draw any conclusions from that?\n I forgot to do that.\n Okay, great. Braden, tell us a little bit about what you observed from your data?\n Well, I observed that I did not get much wind speed.\n Okay, so where was your station? Were you at a protected area as well?\n Yes.\n Okay, so that definitely had an effect, didn't it?\n Yes.\n So as a meteorologist, would you want to be able to put your anemometers somewhere where you know you're gonna catch the wind?\n Yep.\n  Okay, so that was a really important lesson right there, too. So what about your thermometer readings, since those weren't dependent necessarily on being protected from the wind. What can you observe from your thermometer reading?\n Well, that it was and then on Tuesday and Wednesday it got colder.\n Okay, so it got colder on Tuesday and Wednesday. So if you were making a prediction, what do you think would happen on this day, based on your data? Do you think it's gonna change, stay the same, what do you think?\n Stay the same.\n Seems like it's gonna stay the same, because you have that pretty consistently?\n Yeah.\n  Okay, alright. Tariq, what do you find from your data? What did you discover observing?\n I noticed that for my temperature I had up and down weather.\n  So your temperature was, would you say it was fluctuating?\n Yeah.\n  Okay, why do you think that was happening?\n Because, well it was cold on the days we went out, but where we were the sun was kind of coming towards us, at the times we went out.\n  So do you think that had an effect on your thermometer as well?\n Yeah.\n  Hm, okay so then that's another thing as a meteorologist, you might want to think about where your thermometer is, right? Are you just getting straight sun? Okay, was there something else you were gonna say about your wind speed?\n Well, my wind speed. On Monday we got a lot. And on Thursday we got a lot. On the other two days we didn't get any wind.\n  Not too much, okay.\n Then.\n Then I also had,\n  Go ahead.\n All three of us were in the same group.\n  You were in the same group, alright. So there you go.\n And, I also had to say that my wind speed was never below 20 degrees.\n  You to pull out your sheet, right there that you have about your temperature on the moon. I want to ask you one more question. And I want you to think about your temperature on the moon. Now did you actually go to the moon to get your data?\n No.\n No, but let's look at the scientists who recorded that data. Why was it important for them to find out the temperature on the moon? And as you look at it, did it change very much? So why was it important and did it change very much? Okay, Jaime.\n I thought that on one of the missions that it was different temperatures. Like it would be and then it dropped down to about 200.\n Okay, and so you're specifically talking about the day?\n Yeah.\n  Okay. And so you're saying is it pretty similar? Is that you're saying?\n Pretty similar, but not very.\n Okay, so.\n The main thing is that it didn't stay the same.\n Okay, it didn't seem to stay the same.\n No.\n  Okay. And then we had, not only day temperature, but was the other temperature that we looked at on the moon?\n Night.\n Nighttime, okay. So what were you thinking about that Shaun?\n I kind of had the same data as Jamie did.\n  Okay.\n Because it switched every single mission. So on mission 11 it was well 200 and about 13 degrees.\n  Okay.\n And it just kept on going down and up each mission. So it changed significantly each mission.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 1857 SCI_EA_1857_Video_Recording_A edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.262852], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW03", "TW09s"]}, "052": {"text": " Love the many questions that you're asking. Asking questions is a great way, especially if you're wondering something. Feel free to ask it, even if you go in a little bit different direction. Also, the more you reference the book, you can give us some things going on in \"Brave New World\" and the more specific you can be, the better that helps us understand somebody actually connected to the book and maybe how it's connected to them. So two things to be thinking about. But if you give examples, the more specific you can, of real world examples also the better off. You guys are doing a fantastic job, though. Talking, having a natural conversation, letting each other speak and all that. So, continue with the next question.\n Are we doing that on here?\n What's that?\n Are we doing what we're supposed to in here?\n Yeah, and my outside people, ya'll are doing fine continue with whatever you want to put on here. As long as it's related to the conversation, obviously.\n Ya'll want to talk about Bernard & John now?\n Yeah.\n Absolutely.\n Alright, how do these characters show a variety of ideas about individualism and conformity? I'll just kind of start out. Here's my answer, I kind of said that they were like, the Russians who wanted their blue jeans. They knew what they wanted and they kinda went for it. And in the end, society pretty much pushed them back into their place. And was like, \"No, don't stand up and rise up against us.\"\n Well, I would say, I see a similarity between, like, Bernard and John because they both had individual ideals but I definitely that John was a lot stronger in his beliefs than Bernard was because I think about how Bernard had, at first, he was all individual and he had these individual beliefs and then when he, when they got in trouble, kind of in a way, all three of them, with the uprising and all that kind of stuff. He kind of went back on what he was saying. And John, he stuck to it, like he actually did something about it. When he actually kind of protested and he was able to go back to being an individual. And he went into doing his own thing, with his own beliefs. So, I just feel like John was a lot stronger in what he believed throughout it than Bernard, who was kind of allowing people to look at him, put on him, worried about what other people thought about him and all that kind of stuff.\n That's true. Cuz like, whenever Bernard was more of I guess a weirdo, he does always, like, question society and why everybody acts the way they do. But as soon as he started being popular, he started bragging to Helmholtz about how, like right here it says, \"And I had six girls last week: one on Monday, \"two on Tuesday, two more on Friday, one on Saturday.\" So, as soon as he became just like everybody else, he started to like it far more and it mattered much to him that people like, people did what they did, like not explicit relationships and everything. So, you're right, John was stronger than Bernard.\n I don't think John ever conformed, he stuck to his beliefs pretty much the whole time.\n Yeah, he always stayed an individual like, he made sure he didn't conform.\n Was Helmholtz conformist or individualistic? Because he did a lot of the same things that, you know, normal people do but he also read as an idealism at times. \n I think he's somebody who he conformed to what he had to, just to get by. But at the same time, he had his own thoughts and believed what he believed. I just don't think he really stood up for what he believed in.\n So we're \n Yeah, I think so. It's almost like it's almost like a fair weather friend. He did what was best for him, to keep him going got hit and suffered trouble.\n I feel like, I don't know, maybe I'm crazy but I thought Helmholtz was like, reminds me of, this is stereotypical, but he kind of reminds me of like an old professor, you know? He, like, just like goes to work. Helmholtz has, like, good thoughts about stuff but then he didn't like, live the life.\n Wasn't he some sort of,\n He was like a top guy,\n professor. A psychologist, or something?\n He was a scientist. \n Alright, so kind of sticking on that topic. What about the books and how they, nobody really read how they kind of, all of the books related to, I guess, individuality and the whole world, what life was like before  was locked up. \n I can say the same, John was reading Shakespeare and how Shakespeare is all about, like, love and tragedy and there's like sorrow and there's also, you know, the aspect of love with \"Romeo & Juliet.\" And how the people didn't really, Helmholtz would, his job was reading it to them and he started laughing about it because he was trained not to. So, I think if people actually read about it, you know, the feelings and how love is supposed to be. Then people wouldn't go along with how their relationships would be because they'd wanna, maybe wanna experience falling in love with someone or having that one person would cause a lot more problems with that knowledge along with seeing how people, how there's tragedy. People are becoming sad and how in the New World people are always supposed to be happy and everyone's getting along. Then in these stories, there's like love conflict and everyone is fighting and it would cause problems because from that, people could form their own individual problems and then they start to have their own individuality and form opinions and start asking questions, which leads to a lot of things.\n Books are they pretty much written to express those emotions in which the whole state is trying to block up anyways? That was why they're there.\n So, the book, do you think that the books are kind of what drove Bernard to be a nonconformist and then as he got away from reading, and he started conforming back into society?\n What I think happened, cuz they were saying, I think he was like bipolar or something and everyone else was like  something. He was shorter than everyone else and, I think, he was already kind of like put aside 'cause they were saying that they think he had alcohol given to him as he was a baby so that made him weird. So, all along, he wasn't like everyone else. So, he wasn't a, like, no one accepted him for who he was but whenever he got famous, or whatever, people began to accept him. \n Huh?\n He wasn't able to conform, is that what you're saying?\n Yeah, I don't think he was able to conform because no one accepted him for who he was, except for Helmholtz.\n I think if someone else was in his position, like read, even like saw a book, they probably wouldn't even try to read the way he did. They were so used to not, I don't know, not having books. I don't think the same thing would happen to somebody else. It kind of reminds me of, I don't know if you guys have seen the movie, \"The Book of Eli\"? How, the entire time, he's trying to hide the Bible because that one guy wants the Bible because he wants control over everybody. Because like, if he has, like everything in the Bible, he could like tell people certain things and they would just listen to him so he could be a master. Like, in this book, how everybody, like the Controllers just want control over everybody and without books, like, I think it's just another type of their control.\n That's a good example.\n Also, if you think about it, present day, a lot of people don't even read books anymore. They mostly know that they can  and you can watch the movies instead. There is also technology where you can learn about something without even actually having to read the book. So, do you think in a way, that's kind of like the same way of eliminating, how they did in the story and how they eliminate books and there's more technology is like a weakness? Today, you know, we're all about technology so we eliminate more books and there's more movies and more technology.\n Real quick, I wanna throw in one scene that I want you guys to think about, also. You just brought up a point about if people in the world today saw these books, would they even know what to do with them? What would they think about them? We do have a point in \"Brave New World\" where someone does see a book that isn't used to seeing these type of books and responds to it. When Helmholtz looks at the Shakespeare that John has. So, what did you make of Helmholtz's response to Shakespeare? And what do you think that maybe suggests about people's attitudes in the World State? Especially since, the Helmholtz would represent, I guess, an enlightened view point in the World State. You remember the scene that I'm talking about?\n Yeah .\n Yeah, he started off by laughing at it and didn't, later on in the scene, he kind of hid the fact that he had read it and that he knew what was going on?\n I'm just wondering where it all\n It's page 183. \n Page 184 says, the second paragraph, like third or fourth line, \"Helmholtz said listen to the \"scenes of the world first meeting with a puzzled interest.\" I mean, I guess being the enlightened thinker, Helmholtz is kinda curious about it, and wanted to know more. But at the same time, he had that conformity which was kinda scaring him away from it. Cuz he didn't want to get in trouble, I guess.\n He doesn't really seem to understand what's going on in \"Romeo & Juliet\" because at the bottom of page 184, same page we saw him laughing about it because he didn't understand why the mother and father are trying to force the daughter on someone she didn't want. So, I mean, it just kind of shows how different things were.\n I guess that goes back to the differences in society between then and now. For now and the future.\n Like to do the last comments about John or Bernard comparing and contrasting?\n I come up with something that didn't really get mentioned John, the reason he's an individual is 'cause he was born, he was like literally, born and grew up on the reservation. Bernard, the reason he's an individual is because of his physical stature. So, Bernard is an individual because of physically, but John is different because of who he is. He was born like that, so that's what makes, they're two different people in individuality standard. And that's why, I thought that Bernard was so easy to go back to conformity, because the only thing that made him different was his height. And that's why John couldn't because of who he was.\n I thought Bernard was the person that John would be if John had been born and raised in his World State where Bernard had. The only thing that made John different is that he spent so much time on the reservation where everyone's different. They value individuality.\n You had some good ideas, just to kind of wrap up with that last question. Something to think about also, you guys kind of hit it on this, essentially what we have is two characters in Bernard and John that both do not fit into their communities. Right? And the world is saying everything is designed to fit exactly, and if you don't fit, then you're removed from that situation. And, the Savage Reservation, you are basically shamed out of that group. Now, that's the way John, he's trying to interact but because of his mother and because of his birth, he is shamed out of it. But notice whenever John goes to the World State, and Bernard takes him and becomes a celebrity because of it. All the sudden, Bernard is very happy to be part of the World State. So, once Bernard can actually conform and gain advantage from that type of society, he's more than happy to continue on in it. John, though, being the way he is, he's never had the opportunity to conform to any kind of society and he still has that shame culture inside of him that he continues to live by the whole time he's in the World State, right? So, that's something to think about too, is not only are they isolated when they are born and different. Then what happens, when all the sudden, one of them can conform and can be a valued member of that society, which John sort of is, but it's more for him being strange and weird and exotic, then it is him being a person and being brought into it. Guys, that was a great first half. What I need you guys to do in the center circle is go ahead and log in to your computers. Outside circle people, jot down any last minute ideas you want on your paper responses. And then in just a minute, we'll switch. \n So, now we're taking notes, as well as having the competition on there?\n Correct, and did that go ok for outside folks?\n Yeah.\n It was ok to do both?\n We can still take notes while we're on the inner circle, right?\n Oh, sure, absolutely.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 052 ELA AYA 052edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.225254], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW06", "TW08", "TW13", "TW15", "TW16", "TW17", "TW24TW07", "TW24TW08"]}, "1015": {"text": " Three.\n Oh, it makes like a cubic graph.\n It's like a cube.\n Oh, whoa, that's pretty cool.\n What about... what if only two of them are the same?\n It's like a quadratic. \n All right, so as we go through the investigation now we're gonna look at, try to come up with conjecture for that. Numerically, why do you think that happens? If two factors are the same.\n Because it makes... like,  because if you have two factors are the same that's the same as, like, squaring one of the factors.\n What happens if you square numbers?\n They become positive, I believe. So, it's always positive for that section.\n Very nice. Okay, keep on, keep on going with that.\n All right.\n  Just say A, B, C, D, E, etcetera. E is the zeros of the law.\n I'm on the first one.\n Why are they the same? They're squared.\n \n Go to Google Docs. See if you can do files. \n The file is gray.\n Okay, so what's gonna happen is you're gonna have a factor formula. Unlike the other one we had it instead. And what you want to look at is look at the factors, and look at the zeros. What's the relationship between the factors and zeros. You may already know what the relationship is. Can you predict what it's gonna be?\n That the factors tell you the zeros? Like the numbers and the factors tell you what the zeros are?\n And why would that makes sense to you?\n Oh, because when it's X and you have a number after that, that's where it is on the X axis. So, that could be where the zeros in a set right, maybe?\n Teresa, does that make sense to you? You look kinda confused.\n Like, so X minus one is... No, that is wrong then.\n Well here, look at your flag. Look right here. It's sittin' right here. So X minus one.\n So that's one. So, there's one one. And then X minus two is the there too.\n Oh, so it's the opposite of the form.\n \n So, if you haven't factored form then you know that it's even zero.\n \n  Yeah, yeah. It would be equal to zero right?\n Yeah, you're right. Remember in algebra one the zero chronic thing?\n Yeah.\n All right, so that does make sense. Does the end behavior make sense? It's in factored form, but what's the degree of that?\n It's three.\n It's the third degree.\n And what does a third degree, what did we learn last time.\n It can intersect three times.\n It can intersect three times. Does it?\n Yeah.\n And what's the end date?\n Down and up.\n Down and up. And it is, right?\n Yup.\n So, that makes sense.\n That does make sense.\n Why don't you try it with quadratic factor here. And why don't you put in an extra factor.\n Just edit that.\n Just add that X, whatever something we've not used yet.\n What's the F in this one?\n  The eraser.\n But you added this one, right?\n Yeah.\n So what do we except's gonna happen? How many zeros are we gonna get this time?\n  Four?\n  What's the degree? So, what should the end behavior be? Because you weren't here last time, so let's see if you pick it up. So, if it's fourth degree, what's gonna happen on the right? What's gonna happen on the left?\n  Both... \n  Good.\n  Yay.\n  High five.\n  Get rid of the space after the parenthesis.\n  Which one?\n  Between the parenthesis and the F. Yeah add a space.\n  There's not an F. See the sliders here?\n  This F was there to start out with. So, just delete it then. Yeah, just delete that. So, X minus E is just that.\n  So we expect... did it come out the way you excepted it to come out?\n  Yeah, there's four zeros.\n And if you slide those zeros, go ahead and slide some zeros and see if it still makes sense.\n Oh, that's good.\n Oh, because it changes whatever the final one would be at.\n So, if we had, like, X plus something, where is the actual zero?\n Oh, it is X plus something, it's the actual place that it is instead of the opposite of the place.\n So if we say X, X plus three, where's the zero?\n Negative three.\n Does that make sense? Because X plus three equals zero.\n Yeah.\n All right, what's the next question on there?\n Does the Y intercept change?\n All right, so let's look at your zeros and look at your Y intercept. As you change the sliders, does the Y intercept change?\n  We can't see our Y intercept, you gotta scroll out.\n Mr. Dillard, would you get me me the mouse over there? The silver one.\n Yeah, it's a lot easier to do this with a mouse.\n  I got it.\n  Other way. Because the Y intercept is...\n Now it might be really...\n Yeah, it's right there.\n Why don't we try making some of these factors smaller, so that we can see it a little better.\n  I got it.\n  Oh, fine. I see how it is.\n  Okay, can you see it?\n  It's like at negative 15.\n Okay, is there a relationship between that Y intercept and the factors? Or the zeros? Why don't you guys talk it over.\n  What are the zeros?\n  So, the zeros are, what are the zeros? And the zeros are all the numbers that are, they're the opposite of this. So, it would be negative two, four and a half, and one.\n  Wait, what's the Y intercept? It's 15?\n  Two.\n Yeah, it's down here. It's actually 18.\n And it's negative 18.\n Four and a half times two is nine, times two is 18 times one. It's 18. You multiply all the end numbers together and you get the Y intercept.\n Well, that's nice.\n That is cool.\n  But, why does that make sense? Why would that work?\n Why does that work?\n  Oh! Because to get the Y intercept, the Y intercept doesn't have an X value so you just, in order to factor this equation, you would just multiply all the end ones to get it.\n Oh, yeah because it's the numbers after X, like, almost...\n zeros... zeros?\n  Well, are the numbers after X the actual zeros? If it said X plus three.\n The roots.\n  X plus three, what would the zero be for that?\n  Negative.\n So, they're the inverse of the zeros.\n The opposite.\n The opposite, yeah.\n  You have to be careful with the word inverse because it has a lot more meaning. All right, so, if we know what the zeros are, and we multiply those and we got the Y intercept, right?\n  Yeah.\n  What about A? What happens when you slide A around? Does that change?\n  Slide A around.\n  I already know what should happen.\n  You can just use the mouse.\n  I can't click it.\n  Move.\n  Oh, that's why.\n It changes the middle one.\n  Did it change the zero? Start with that. Does it change the zeros at all?\n  No.\n  No.\n  No, it doesn't change the zeros.\n  Well, okay, go back to...\n  It's not changing the zero. Well actually...\n  Well, it's just changing it's steepness.\n  Yeah, it's changing it's steepness and the width, but it's not changing the zeros.\n  Well, yeah it does, because when it's flat then every number's changed.\n  But when its flat, but that's only\n  If A is zero, since they're multiplying everything by A, then if A is zero, everything is zero.\n So, yeah, you have a zero degree polynomial at that point.\n  Yeah.\n  Yeah.\n Okay, so other than when A is zero...\n  All it's changing is the steepness of the graph. And not changing the zeros.\n So, does that change the Y intercept?\n  Um, yes, it is changing the Y intercept. But I think it still works out as, um, you can still multiply all of them together.\n  Does that make sense? Check and see if it still works.\n  Oh, whatever A is, is A is the opposite of the Y intercept. Because if A is four then the Y intercept here is, or that might just be...\n Well, that's a good conjecture. Check some of the other things and see if it still works.\n  Um, try changing, yeah.\n \n  Yeah, no, that's not right.\n That would be cool.\n  It was just the way I had it.\n And, that's one of the nice thing with the sliders, because you might see a connection, but you can quickly see if it works for all cases and not just one case.\n  The Y intercept is six. Yeah, it's still, ah, when you change A, it's still going to effect the Y intercept, and as changing, as multiplying all the numbers together and then multiplying by A.\n  Does that make sense?\n  Yeah.\n  So, all those numbers multiplied together is still... six. Keep going with this, because the next thing we're gonna look at is what happens when some of the zeros are the same. When we use the factor more than once. Okay? Keep going.\n \n  Are we on six now?\n  Yes.\n  What happens when two or more factors are the same? So, make E and E.\n  I'm gonna make them all three.\n  I work hard for you guys, you criticize me.\n  Um, the E, the E. Oh, it makes the, when they're the same...\n \n  Try changing one of them. Try changing one of the sliders.\n \n  We figured that one. It just turns out to be the opposite.\n  So, go ahead and change one slider. Just pick one other than A. Pick B or something like that.\n The opposite of that variable becomes the...\n Y intercept.\n That doesn't explain the zeros.\n  Now, something we want to find out,\n Is there a relationship between the zeros and the Y intercept?\n Oh, there is. When you change the Y, then the zeros equal the opposite of the Y intercept.\n Okay, what happens if you change two?\n  No, it doesn't. Oh yeah, yeah it does.\n Oh yeah, zero does. The one that isn't the same numerical I think.\n  The right most zero becomes it.\n When you move them, the Y intercept and the zero both change at the same rate.   Because if you move, like, C steadily to the left, once C is two, negative two...\n  Jacob said, \"Half the time, when you multiply them all together you get it.\"\n \n  Yeah, that's what we're discussing.\n \n  The absolute value of the Y intercept and then the absolute value of the zero, if two of the factors are the same that's in.\n  If all of the variables are the same except one of them, it becomes the zero, it becomes the zero and the opposite of the Y intercept.\n  So, now as you slide, you'll actually be able to see the Y intercept.\n  If you set all the variables the same and change one of them, it becomes the zero and the opposite of the Y intercept.\n  Okay, so on Dave's right here... \n  Yeah the multiplication,  in case you, like, if you multiply all the zeros together, you get the opposite of the Y intercept.\n \n  Does it have to do with the factor formula?\n  Yeah.\n  Yeah.\n  So, the absolute value of the...\n If you multiply the zero,\n  So, does it make sense algebraically?\n  Yes.\n Why does it make sense algebraically?\n When you find the factor with that new grouping you have to, it becomes the opposite.\n But Y intercepts, algebraically.\n  Because the Y intercept is when all the X's are zeros, so you're just left with the one that doesn't have an X on it. And that is the multiplication of all the factors.

We've found today's date, so we know where we're going to record today. It's Wednesday, March Ninth. \n I know what numbers  down of zero mean. They are negative numbers. That's what are numbers that are down from zero.  \n  OK, I have most friends with their hands on their heads, I want to make sure everybody's listening and ready to move on. We can keep all of our materials out so we can actually use them. Excellent. I'm waiting on a few more people to have their hands off of their materials and on their heads, so we can concentrate on the teacher. In each group I have one team member that will be measuring temperature. If you are measuring the temperature, please hold up your tool that you'll be using. Those of you measuring the temperature, what tool are you using? Everybody?\n  Thermometer!\n  Very good! The people that are measuring the temperature with the thermometers, please line up at the back door of the classroom. When you get out there, boys and girls, are you going to be able to see the temperature as soon as you get out there? What are you going to have to do?\n  Look at the thermometer.\n  And you can also compare it to the thermometer that's been outside, so go out there and you can let your thermometers adjust to the temperature of outside. If you have a windsock and you are going to measure the direction of the wind, I would like you to line up quietly at the back door of the classroom. You guys can use the compass and work together, go ahead out and see what you observe. If you have an anemometer to measure wind speed, you may line up. If you have a ruler to measure precipitation in our rain gauges, you may line up. You may all go. And last but definitely not least, if you are measuring the . \n  When we look at this , our thingy goes away!\n  No, yours is 61!\n  No, it's the Fahrenheit, not the Celsius.\n  There's something in there.\n  What team are you?\n  66.\n  You guys, we need to wait for how many seconds?\n  It's not ready yet!\n  You've been doing it at home. What is it that you've been waiting?\n  How can it be 110? How can it be? \n  Now we are going to set the timer for 10 seconds and we are going to count how many times it went around. OK? So see where your  is and get ready to start counting. \n  Look at the bee! \n  I've heard both of these ladies say two. What you need to do is you need to use that chart in there and see what it means. What is the wind speed if the anemometer goes around two times in 10 seconds?\n  Look with your eye, with one eye, look at this one.\n I can't see!\n  I think it's going West.\n  When you have completed measuring, you may walk back to your group to record your data. Quietly.\n  I got 66.\n  Can we compare it to what's on the wall there, and see what we have?\n  It got 66, then it got 65, and then it got 64!\n  Victor, could you explain it all to me, why you think you thermometer keeps going down?\n  Because it gets colder.\n  And where has the thermometer been sitting all day?\n  In there.\n  And do you think it's cooler out here, or is it warmer out here?\n  Cooler?\n  Exactly! So our temperature is going?\n  Down!\n  Good! So let's go ahead and look right here to make sure we can tell the temperature from our thermometer that's been staying outside?\n  It's getting brown!\n  What do we think the temperature is there?\n  It says the temperature is 46 degrees.\n  That's probably our most accurate reading since it has been staying outside all day long. All right. You can head back in and record. \n  I don't know which number to choose!\n  The one on the outside, the whole time. \n  What's your --\n  Gym? It's on Wednesday, March Ninth.\n  It was West! \n  The wind direction was West.\n  The wind direction was West.\n  Very good. I think that you have an accurate reading.\n  What's the wind speed?\n  It's cloudy.\n  Wind direction, temperature!\n  Team Three is working together, and Team Two, and Team One! Nice job working together!\n  I think you have to change it.\n  Temperature! Victor! What was the temperature?\n  40 degrees.\n  46 degrees Fahrenheit.\n  It was 50!\n  What was the wind speed?\n  It's not raining.\n  So what did you guys think the  was?\n  I agree with you. Why would we forecast that it might rain? \n  What's the weather?\n  The weather is rainy!\n  West! Put West! \n  It was West.\n  It was West?\n  We found out that the wind speed, we said it went around about that many times, so how fast is the wind actually going?\n  Minutes!\n  Miles per hour? We don't go anywhere in a minute. We travel, like we said, in cars, in miles. Right? Go back to your group, they'll tell you on the chart.\n  My thermometer's higher than the one outside.\n  We discussed that while we were standing out there. Why do you think that that may not have dropped as far down or might even be going back up as you're holding it inside right now?\n  Because inside of you it's warm. Because you told us that it was, when you're holding the thermometer, the thermometer only feels what's around it. And if we're covering the thermometer it can't measure any more temperature, only how our temperature is.\n  Very good. So, Linda, if that answered your question, that's why we compared it to the thermometer that's been staying outside that we check each day. What are we going to say that the temperature was from that thermometer reading out there?\n  46 degrees Fahrenheit.\n  Excellent, so make sure you're sharing that, and each person in your group, use your data! Linda.  I think you've done an excellent job.  \n  OK! We have a few minutes left, and some groups are getting to the point where they have finished recording their data after working with their team members on each type of weather and using the different weather instruments. I am going to pass out your follow-up questions and you're going to use data from last week and compare it to today's data to do some equations on here, and you do not have to finish today. We will do this in our follow-up lesson in our next science lesson. OK? You may continue working. Thank you. \n  Write your name and date and you can put it back in your packet when you clean up.  OK, the wind direction? Who should you be asking that to?\n  Today's? \n  Last Wednesday the temperature was What is the degrees between today's temperature and the temperature last Wednesday? Write an equation. Show your work. Last Wednesday the wind speed was eight miles per hour. What is the difference between -- \n  You already have your paper!\n  I know!\n  We can do it by ourselves.\n  But it says to work as a team! \n  I like it! Good job! \"Keep working with your team,\" I hear her saying. Excellent! I like how I see Brianna using her data! And Grace starting to write an equation, and Abby and Samaya have the date on their paper! You guys are all doing an excellent job!  Who is the person on your team whose job was to measure what direction it went? You should ask that person as soon as he comes back, he should have his data on his chart.  What number did you put there?\n  We worked together and we figured it out.\n  I know this one! I know this one! I know that one!

So once you guys finish with your observations, you guys can start working on collecting your data for the canyon and for the delta. \n  See, this part is completely dry.\n  It's pretty much almost half.\n  Water's above the side.\n  Watch that,  watch that, it's gonna fall.\n  Look at that.\n  It's like a boat  going down a waterfall.\n  That was sand.\n  I know. \n  The water has stopped going.\n  One minute's passed.\n  Thirty?\n Oh.\n  \n  There's a--start to get ready. It's not done playing.\n  It's still not done .\n  Well, the water--\n  Look at this, look at this.\n  I know, we're still dry.\n  There's a pool of water at the end.\n  There's a pool of water at the end.\n  Look at this, there's a dent, there's a dent.\n  Oh, wow.\n  Right here's dry.\n  Okay, why do you guys think this part didn't get any water?\n  Because it probably went under?\n  So Cameron says it went under, Xander, what were you saying?\n  It was going too fast and it didn't--it was probably right here, so it didn't decide to go all the way over here, and it went right here.\n  It formed a lake right here.\n  It went the easiest route. So it's got eight or nine minutes.\n  So, now ten, nine minutes.\n  Is water still draining?\n  Yeah, the water's still there.\n  When are you guys gonna decide when the end time is?\n  When this goes.\n  There's been nine minutes, right? And the water is dripping.\n  Last time we got 15 minutes.\n  The water's dripping into basin.\n  Last time we got 15 minutes.\n  So how does it all compare?\n  Because, um, it compares because it's almost the same, and look at, it like poured a pool or something.\n  Cameron, you were saying this one is almost the same? Like it took the same amount of time?\n  No.\n  No.\n  No, I'm saying it's getting there.\n  No, the other one's longer because it drained a bigger whole.\n  Yeah.\n  So Elondra, how was the time different for this one?\n  How it was like similar?\n  Let's hear what Elondra says.\n  This one went faster.\n This one went faster?\n Yeah, way faster.\n So you're saying it's similar, not too different? But Elondra's saying it went faster. Do you agree with her?\n  Yeah, and the deposition it's like way over here. Way across there. \n  You guys are, I think, pretty much done with your water draining now.\n  Okay, so--\n  Nine or ten minutes and it's done.\n  So you guys want to record your end time?\n  No, no, it's still going.\n  It's okay if there's still a little bit of water left in. Once it stops draining, you guys can put the tape over here and you guys can start taking your measurements.\n  Where do we get the toothpicks?\n  Don't we have to know what time it is?\n  10:30, right?\n  Was this when the chocolate melts?\n  When's the chocolate melt? Elondra.\n  What?\n  It looks like chocolate--\n  So are you guys ready to start taking your measurements?\n  Yeah.\n  Why don't you guys open up your science notebooks so you have the table in front of you, and I'll bring by a toothpick so you can get started on the writing.\n  Yeah.\n  I think the widest part is right here.\n  Can I do the poking?\n  Huh?\n  Can I do the poking?\n  You guys have your measuring tape out?\n  We have to go get the measuring tape.\n  Tape that back up.\n  Here, our widest part is right here.\n  Widest part is that.\n  No, no, no, you're not supposed to poke it.\n  How long is that?\n  It's about to here.\n  Okay, we got what we need.\n  Go from centimeters.\n  Centimeters.\n  Aw, Cameron. Cameron, you messed it up.\n  That's not our longest part. Our longest part is this.\n  Okay, we have to redo it. Wait, where does we start?\n  Right here.\n  Here, you do the poking. Don't poke it into the thing, but how deep is it? Here, grab it.\n  \n  No, you're not supposed to do that. Remember what she did?\n  Okay, this right here.\n  It's about three centimeters.\n  Three centimeters.\n  So, depth of straight channel is three centimeters.\n  Okay, what do we measure next?\n  Okay, time to do the width.\n  How much was it?\n  Three centimeters.\n  Three? Okay. What's the widest?\n  Where's the measuring tape? Around six centimeters.  - How much?  - Six.\n  Six centimeters.\n  Six. Okay, now we need to do width of soil drop to end of stream channel. It's all this, it's all from right here.\n  It's from here to here. You guys, we need the tape measure.\n  Yeah, width, from here to here. No, it's this long. I've got it with my fingers. This long.\n  It's about 15.\n  No, it's 14 and a half.\n  No that's 15.\n  Yeah, 15.\n  Oh yeah, 15.\n  Same with the other one.\n  15.\n  It goes all the way to the end.\n  Yeah, length.\n  Okay, 29.\n  How many?\n  29.\n  Yeah, and depth of soil dripped at the end of end of the stream channel. Where's the toothpick?\n  So right here...\n  Right there, yeah.\n  Okay, where's the time?\n \n  \n  \n  Okay, so, can you hold that there? \n  How much is it?\n  Five centimeters.\n  How many?\n  Five.\n  Five c-m.\n  Okay, width of the soil dropped at the end of the stream channel. So right here.\n  We're gonna actually move to here.\n  No no, width.\n  Oh, width?\n  Looks about...\n  11 centimeters, maybe?\n  11 centimeters. Alright, length of the soil dropped at the end of the stream channel. So now we're measuring that.\n  Here, you can do it.\n  So what're you guys working on measuring now?\n  Length.\n  We've got a long length.\n  27.\n  28.\n  28, yeah.\n  28 centimeters.\n  Jorge, you can measure--\n  Now what do we measure? Depth of soil dropped at end of the--\n  Wait, what was it?\n  28.\n  Depth of soil dropped at the end of the stream channel.\n  Where's the toothpick?\n  I'm letting Jorge do it.\n  Okay.\n  Jorge, you can do this one.\n  So, maybe poke it here.\n  Poke it in there.\n  Now put your finger down. Put your finger down where it is.\n  Slide it down until you feel the dirt.\n  Good.\n  Bring it over to Kendra.\n  So you can kinda see the dirt right there. That's not even a centimeter.\n  You start here.\n  Okay. That's not even a centimeter.\n  That's three millimeters.\n  So we round it down to zero centimeters.\n  Okay.\n  Zero. Okay, we're all done.\n  No, we still have to--\n  \"Work on your bird's-eye view picture in your notebook.\" \n  Up in the big can.\n  Oh no, they're over there.\n  Okay. The same bird's-eye view or a different view?\n  That's what I was going to-- \n  I'm especially gonna draw in here, because that's really interesting.\n  Really interesting.\n  \n  Did Cody just go get something?\n  Yes, he did.\n  Oh my gosh, he's so nice.\n  So did you guys finish taking your data?\n  Yeah, we're gonna do our bird's-eye view.\n  Before you guys look at your bird's-eye view, I want you to share. What'd you guys find from your data? So let's look at your data tables for a minute.\n  Okay.\n  It kind of made like a cave.\n  No, right here.\n  Yeah.\n  So I see the  difference right here. In the depth of the stream channel, the basic stream was actually more than the rushing river.\n  What was more?\n  Like, in centimeters, so one centimeter off.\n  So, Alejandro's looking at the depth of the stream channel, and the last time it was three centimeters deep and this time it was only two centimeters deep? So last time it was actually deeper. How about which one was wider?\n  The rushing river.\n  So the rushing river made a wider stream channel?\n  Yeah.\n  I think the reason why it was wider is because more water came in.\n  It basically didn't spend enough time going in, it basically just went--\n  Yeah, and it made it more curved-inish and stuff.\n  Okay. Jorge, what'd you notice?\n  I noticed that, right here, it made a little cave, and I think something like water, I think there was a little whirlpool there.\n  Yeah, there was.\n  There were a bunch of whirlpools.\n  Yeah, there were doubles.\n  There's one right here and here.\n  So I think it broke the water  .\n  I saw one little whirlpool right there, and another one over here.\n  I saw one here.\n  So the water was kinda doing some different things in some of these places?\n  Yeah, I think it's 'cause it curves like that, so the bubbles keep on spinning if the water's coming through.\n  Yeah, so the water's-- \n  So what about the delta? The deposition? How is this different than your first experiment?\n  Oh my gosh, it was five centimeters bigger.\n  Five centimeters bigger? What'd you notice, Jorge?\n  The biggest part was that it was only this part right here.\n  Okay.\n  Yeah, that was the longest part that was part of it all.\n  So Cody, I noticed that, this time, how deep was your delta?\n  Our delta, which would be to get that soil?\n  Yeah.\n  Zero centimeters.\n  So does that mean there's no delta? So how did you guys come up with zero?\n  'Cause it was three millimeters, so we had to round down.\n  Okay, so you guys have your data.\n  And the length of the soil--\n  It was a lot wider, wasn't it?\n  Yeah, the length of the soil was like four centimeters bigger. It was from the end right here and it continued down.\n  So you guys, remember, we're gonna take this data--\n  Someday are we gonna put more of that stuff in here?\n  Oh, put more of the earth material in?\n  Yeah.\n  And see what it would be like if you added more material?\n  \n  Okay, maybe that would be a question we could investigate.\n  Maybe the delta would be thicker because there's not enough room for all of it.\n  You know why I'm asking you that? Because I think it would be deeper, because right here it only makes little ones here, but the other one would probably make it bigger because it has more space.\n  Okay.

Find our averages probably on Thursday? Right now, you guys are going to be working on-- you want to make sure you get the runoff sample, draw what that looks like today, we'll see what it looks like when it settles out later, and then you guys are going to work on your bird's eye view, and think about where's the humus, where's the gravel, where's the clay, so you can add that into the picture.\n  Hey guys, I'm gonna like--\n  Yeah, I was thinking the same thing, like rip this up.\n  Whoa, there's the biggest--\n  Oh, that's cool!\n  Ms. Maher, it made a big dip.\n  I'm guessing that some water's still down there.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 610 GEN MC 610 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.248762], "annotations": [["Teacher"], ["Rileen"], ["Chris"], ["Teacher"], ["Rileen"], ["Chris"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Elondra"], ["NaN"], ["Cameron"], ["NaN"], ["Cameron"], ["NaN"], ["Cameron"], ["Xander"], ["Cameron"], ["NaN"], ["Cameron"], ["Both"], ["NaN"], ["Cameron"], ["Xander"], ["NaN"], ["Cameron"], ["Xander"], ["Elondra"], ["Cameron"], ["Xander"], ["Cameron"], ["Teacher"], ["Cameron"], ["Teacher"], ["Xander"], ["Cameron"], ["Xander"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Cameron"], ["Teacher"], ["Cameron"], ["NaN"], ["Cameron"], ["NaN"], ["Cameron"], ["Teacher"], ["Cameron"], ["Teacher"], ["Cameron"], ["Elondra"], ["Cameron"], ["Elondra"], ["Cameron"], ["Teacher"], ["Cameron"], ["Teacher"], ["Elondra"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Cameron"], ["Teacher"], ["Cameron"], ["Xander"], ["Teacher"], ["Cameron"], ["Teacher"], ["Xander"], ["Elondra"], ["NaN"], ["Elondra"], ["Cameron"], ["Elondra"], ["Cameron"], ["Teacher"], ["Xander"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Xander"], ["NaN"], ["Xander"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Xander"], ["NaN"], ["Xander"], ["NaN"], ["Xander"], ["NaN"], ["Xander"], ["Cameron"], ["Elondra"], ["NaN"], ["Xander"], ["NaN"], ["Xander"], ["Cameron"], ["Xander"], ["Elondra"], ["Xander"], ["NaN"], ["Xander"], ["Cameron"], ["Elondra"], ["Elondra"], ["Cameron"], ["Elondra"], ["Cameron"], ["Elondra"], ["Elondra", "Xander"], ["Cameron"], ["Elondra"], ["Xander"], ["NaN"], ["Xander"], ["NaN"], ["Xander"], ["Elondra"], ["NaN"], ["Elondra"], ["Cameron"], ["Elondra"], ["Cameron"], ["Elondra"], ["Cameron"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Cody"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Kendra"], ["Kendra"], ["NaN"], ["Jorge"], ["NaN"], ["Kendra"], ["NaN"], ["Kendra"], ["Kendra"], ["Cody"], ["Kendra"], ["Cody"], ["NaN"], ["Cody"], ["Kendra"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Cody"], ["NaN"], ["Cody"], ["Kendra"], ["Cody"], ["NaN"], ["Cody"], ["NaN"], ["Kendra"], ["Cody"], ["Kendra"], ["NaN"], ["Cody"], ["Kendra"], ["Cody"], ["Kendra"], ["Cody"], ["Kendra"], ["Cody"], ["NaN"], ["Cody"], ["Kendra"], ["Cody"], ["Kendra"], ["NaN"], ["Cody"], ["Kendra"], ["Cody"], ["Kendra"], ["NaN"], ["Cody"], ["NaN"], ["Kendra"], ["Kendra"], ["NaN"], ["Both"], ["NaN"], ["Kendra"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Cody"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendra"], ["NaN"], ["Kendra"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Jorge"], ["Cody"], ["NaN"], ["Cody"], ["NaN"], ["Jorge"], ["Kendra"], ["Cody"], ["Teacher"], ["Cody"], ["Jorge"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Jorge"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendra"], ["Teacher"], ["Cody"], ["Teacher"], ["Cody"], ["Teacher"], ["Cody"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Jorge"], ["Teacher"], ["Jorge"], ["Teacher"], ["Jorge"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendra"], ["Jorge"], ["Teacher"], ["Jorge"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Jorge"], ["Teacher"], ["Cody"], ["NaN"], ["Cody"], ["NaN"], ["Kendra"], ["Cody"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW08", "TW17"]}, "302 ": {"text": " ...confusing for people to understand, but we're looking at density today. We're looking at how much stuff is packed in a certain area. So, if you flip over to the back of your paper, you've got that little box at the top. And it tells you one of the reasons some of the objects float while the other objects sank is because of their density. If you could write down the definition of density in your box, I would appreciate that. The amount of matter, when I say stuff, like when we were learning about solids, liquids and gases at the beginning of the year, stuff is matter. So the amount of matter that's in a certain area is an object's density. It's not its mass, it's its density. So the marble is more dense than the Styrofoam ball. Okay? So now that we know the word 'density,' we're going to start using the word 'density' for the next part.  The amount of stuff packed in a certain area, or the amount of matter. The marble had more matter in that small area than the Styrofoam ball. The Styrofoam ball is spread out and have all those air holes, making that matter more spread out, less dense. Krayla?  Yes, right now. Okay? All right. So that was simple.\n, I want you to go ahead and put a \"C\" over your 10 at the top of this if you haven't. And I want you to take a look at the part one on your paper. Yesterday, we looked at how pressure could effect the mantle, but now we need to look at something different. I want you to answer number one and two first and then we'll talk about it. This is just what you know before you come in my room to get you into the lesson. So, number one wants to know list a few things that you have seen float before. Number two wants to know what do you think might cause these things to float. So, first just make a little list of two, three things that you've seen floating before and then tell me on number two, if it's a hypothesis you may not know for sure that's fine, but what do you think causes them to float. Nathan.\n Are we allowed to write both?\n Yeah. Yeah, so right now, you're just going to make a little list on number one and then number two, you're going to tell me what do you think actually causes these things that you wrote down to be able to float. We're going to start with that first. This is just to get us thinking about what we're doing today. One and two, please. What do you think causes them to float? You might not be sure of the answer to number two, but I still want you to make a hypothesis. You don't have to write \"I think because,\" but you can tell me what you think causes that. Number two's going to be harder than number one.\n Yeah.\n Let's take four things, tell me four things that you've seen float before. We'll take four, because we can probably sit here and name like 100. Cole, give me one.\n Ice cubes.\n Ice cubes. Sadie?\n Boat.\n A boat. Alex.\n Shoes.\n Shoes. And Emily?\n Dog toy.\n Dog toys, okay. Now, we know things can float and that's great. But, what do you think causes these things to float? Why do you think dog toys and a boat and ice cubes and things like that, why are they are going to be able to float. Ebony, what do you think?\n The air in them.\n The amount of air that's in them. Anybody else? Dylan?\n They are less dense.\n Okay. Sean?\n Surface tension.\n Surface tension.\n Little air pockets that are in them.\n Okay, air pockets.\n I was thinking like the less density inside of it.\n Okay,alright, we're going to take a look at that today. So, you've got a kind of idea, we're going to look at what causes something to sink and what effects if something floats. Alright, we have two parts that we are going to be going to our last stations for. So, let's take a look at part two last station observation. You have two setups at your lab station. You have a black tray that has three objects in it. You've got a bouncy ball, a marble and a styrofoam ball, alright? You also have a setup at your lab station that has liquids in cups. This is for part three. Alright, I don't want you touching this stuff yet. We're going to come back later and you're going to look at that stuff. I don't want any of the cups knocked over, I don't want any of the objects put into the cups, okay? These two things are separate, your black tray and the piece of paper with the cups are separate. What you're going to do first is use the black tray and the objects in it. You're going to tell me with the marble, the bouncy ball, and the styrofoam ball if we were to put these in water, which we are going to test them, but if we were to put these in water, do you think these objects would sink or float? So, you just go through and if you want you can just write an \"F\" or an \"S.\" You're going to say what you think and I want you to wait until you get to your lab stations so you can pick them up, feel them to see, that might make a difference in your guess. Then, I also want you to tell me why. While you are at your lab station, float or sink in water and why. You're not going to do the did it actually float because we're going to look at that when we come back. These are our results. So, you're going to do the first two columns, float or sink, why, float or sink, why, float or sink, why.\n Then we are going to come to that?\n And we are going to come back, and we're going to do an observation together. So these two columns have got to be filled out before you get back to your seats. Got it? Let's go.\n Marble, sink. Rubber, float. \n Rubber, float. Styrofoam, float.\n The marble will probably sink, it's heavy.\n It has no air in it.\n Bouncy ball. The bouncy ball probably can float.\n Yeah.\n I mean it's not light,\n It's gonna float. Bouncy ball, same thing.\n Bouncy ball, heavy. Marble, heavy with no air pockets. No--\n This one will definitely float because it's lightweight and it has these little pores.\n This bounces a lot,  his bounces a little bit and this bounces not at all.\n Yeah, but this one, but this one \n If this one can float, then why not think that one could float?\n Okay.\n If you don't go with your group, that's okay, but you still need to a connection. If you are finished before the timer goes off you need to come back to your seat.\n This will float.\n This will fall. \n Fail.\n If you finish, you need to come back to your seats. You guys all finished? I want to go ahead and take a look, before we see the results. Before we look at the results and test this, I want to see what we think. So first off, let's start with the marble since it's at the top. Raise your hand if you think the marble will float. Okay, so we're all together on this one, it's not going to float. Who can tell me why they're thinking it's not going to float? We'll take like three guesses, three explanations. JC?\n It's heavy, with no air pockets.\n Heavy with no air pockets, good. Frayla?\n It can't capture air, it can't float.\n Can't capture air, can't float. Alright and Emma. Heavy and solid.\n Heavy and solid. Alright, now what about the bouncy ball. Raise your hand if you think this is going to float. Alright, there's a mix.\n What, that's heavier than the marble.\n Well, let's hear --  Somebody give me an explanation for why it would float. If you guessed float tell me why you thought that. Sean. Because there's air inside.\n Okay, there's air inside. Alex.\n I dropped it in the pond and it still floated.\n Bouncy ball floated in the pond when you did it before. Ali. I've seen it happen.\n Okay, you've seen it happen. Now, some of us said it would sink. Why did you say it would sink? Matt Weaver.\n Because it's heavy.\n It's heavy.  Frayla.  Okay, Jared.  Okay, so prior experience. Now, last one is our styrofoam ball. Float, raise your hand. Alright, somebody give me a reason why it's going to float. We're all together on this one, too. We all agree the marble is going to sink, we all agree the styrofoam ball is going to float. Matt Cook.\n It's light and has air pockets.\n It's light and has air pockets. Alex?  You're talking alot of things, the pond was last time, okay. Frayla. It's very lightweight \n Okay, alright, let's test it out. We're just going to test it out upfront here, so I'm just going to use this big beaker. What do we want to see first?\n Marble.\n Bouncy ball.\n Alright, record sink for your actual. I guess we'll do bouncy ball, we'll just go in order. Alright, bouncy ball, ready? The moment of truth.  And styrofoam ball.\n Yeah.\n A different bouncy ball didn't float.\n But you saw the bouncy ball I was using, right?\n Yeah.\n So, it was fair, right?\n Yeah.\n Very simple, but let's take a look at what's going on. For number four, I'd like you to tell me, I want you to answer first and then we'll discuss. What I'd like you to tell me, why do you think some of these objects were able to float, while others were able to sink? And I want you to be specific. At the beginning, I asked you the same question on number two in prior knowledge. Why do you think some of these things float. I want you to revisit that question again. So, why do you think the marble and the bouncy ball sank and the styrofoam ball was floating. I want you to be specific on number four. I want you to answer first on your paper and then we're going to share, okay? What kinds of things did we say for number four? Now that we've looked at this in a different way. Before, I just asked you to think of things in your past that you've seen float. Now, we've looked at our marble, our bouncy ball and our styrofoam ball. What did you say? Nick.\n Bouncy ball didn't have enough air to keep it up and it was too heavy.\n Okay, anybody else say anything. Nick said, bouncy ball didn't have enough air to keep it up so it sank. Anybody say something different? Ebony?\n Density and buoyancy.\n All right, what do you mean density and buoyancy? Okay, Frayla?\n I said that some objects had air holes and some were just solid.\n Okay.  Now let's think of this in a different way. We've got this really small marble and we've got a much larger styrofoam ball. So, normally if something's smaller, you think it's going to be lighter, it should float. Something heavier, this is much larger, but it didn't sink. If I have one book, if I'm carrying one book versus carrying five books, that's different because five books are bigger than one book. So, what is going on with the amount of stuff in the marble and the amount of stuff in the styrofoam ball. Is it the same amount of stuff in the same amount of space? Does the marble have the same amount of stuff in the same amount of space that the styrofoam ball does? Which one has more stuff, more matter in a smaller space. I want you to talk with the person sitting next to you for one minute. Okay, so, we've done this before. Okay, so, marble's number one, styrofoam ball, two. Which object has more stuff, more matter, packed in a smaller space? On the count of three, right here, marble one, styrofoam ball two. One, two, three.\n Marble. Good, marble. So, let's write that down. This is pretty much what number five is asking you. So, when comparing the marble to the styrofoam ball, which one has more mass, more matter, more stuff in a smaller amount of space, which we call volume. That would be the marble, alright. People today, if you flip over to the next part, I've heard the word density a couple times and density is kind of.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 302B SCI EA 302 B edited.srt.txt", "Copy of 302A SCI EA 302 A edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0364659], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW03", "TW05", "TW06", "TW13", "TW17", "TW20", "TW22", "TW23", "TW24", "TW24TW06", "TW24TW08"]}, "448": {"text": " Can you make some shadows?

Okay, can you do the measuring? Okay, go ahead and measure it. Put your hand down here so we can see the top. Can we measure that stick? No we're gonna measure the shadow. You wanna measure the stick first, and then compare it to the shadow? Okay. You gotta hold that real still, don't you? Is your light high or low?\n Low?\n It's lower-- what happens if you put it lower, what happens to the shadow?\n It turns big.\n It grows.\n It grows? It gets longer. What if we put it high?\n It's gonna be fat.\n Gonna be short? is the shadow longer or shorter than the stick? I need to you to measure it. Okay, let's record it. You measure the shadow. Measure the shadow. Whoops! 'Scuse me! Let's measure the shadow, measure the shadow. Is that long enough or do you need another? Hold it still Bristava. Is that long enough? Is the shadow longer or the stick longer? Let's compare. There's the shadow measurer and there's the stick. What do you notice?\n It's the same size.\n It's the same size, it sure is.

What have you got, Takori?\n A tissue.\n It's what?\n A tissue.\n A tissue? Is the light going through it? Or did it stop the light?\n Stopped the light.\n It stopped the light, so it made a shadow, didn't it? Did it make a light shadow or a dark shadow? A dark one. Okay Trayshawn, your turn, what are you trying?\n The box.\n is it stopping the light? Get back here so you can see. Put it down here. Can you see it? What do you see about it?\n It's making a shadow.\n Which part is making a shadow?\n The whole thing.\n is that a dark shadow or a light shadow?\n A dark shadow.\n Is this part dark or light?\n Light.\n Okay why is this part light?\n Becuase it is a light shadow. Can't hear you babe.\n Because it's a light shadow.\n Why is it a light shadow? Why isn't it a dark shadow? What's happening to the light? Some of the light going through it?\n Mm-hmm.\n What do you think, Cooper? What's making that shadow?\n Um, the light.\n Okay, the light is making the shadow. What are we using, what is this?\n A box.\n Okay, is it clear or colored?\n Clear.\n Okay, so what happens to the light?\n It goes through.\n Okay, it goes through it, doesn't it, so it only makes a little bit of a shadow. Good job. Did you guys write the things over here, did you find anything new to write down? Let's try that Shelby. You and Cooper come over here and try that. Okay Cooper, you may go to the bathroom. What do you see, Shelby?\n Sorry.\n You see a light shadow? Why is it light?\n 'Cause it goes right through.\n Is any part of that dark?\n This part.\n That part? Why do you think that part's dark?\n 'Cause it has a wrapper.\n The wrapper, and what's the wrapper doing to the light?\n It's stopping the light and it's making a shadow.\n Exactly. Very good Shelby, thank you.  Go right here, okay? What's our time?\n We have two minutes left.\n We might wanna go back and see-- Hey what'd we find out? Raja, what are we doing here?\n Measuring.\n What's your shadow doing? Can you change your shadow? How do you change your shadow?\n By moving.\n By moving? By moving the object? How else could you change your shadow? What about the light? What would you do with the light?\n Move it?\n Move it? I'll hold your stick, and you move the light. How is your shadow changing? Getting bigger? What else could you do? Move your light some more. Move it up or down. Ooh, what happened to the shadow? It got shorter? Oh, now what's happening? Got longer, didn't it. This is making a shadow that's easy to see. Look at that shadow. When the light is high, the shadow is?\n Shorter.\n Short. And when the light is low, the shadow is? Alright now measure that. Measure that. How many cubes lie on that shadow?\n One, two three, four, five, six, seven.\n Is the shadow longer or shorter than the stick? Longer or shorter than the stick?\n The same.\n Oh it's the same!

Your recharge is high. \n  Trial number one, why do you say runoff had more water in trial number one?\n  I think because it, clay's more harder, so it's kind of more difficult to go through with .\n  So what is this number?\n  790.\n  What is this number?\n  62.\n  And which is greater?\n  790.\n  Yea, 790's greater than 62. Good for you, honey. How did you get this number dear?\n  I think, we added them up.\n  What did you add up honey?\n  790 and 600. I mean 62.\n  To get this total?\n  Yeah.\n  Great. I have a question for this group though. How much water did you pour in on trial one? 1,000? 1,000 what?\n  Milliliters.\n  1,000 milliliters? But your total is only 852 milliliters.\n  It's still in the zone of saturation.\n  Oh.\n  Or it hasn't collected off the first.\n  Alright.\n  But it's interesting maybe, the water from last time, since we only had 852 ending last time? Maybe this time, the second , sort of. Maybe it, some might  against the window, if the water from last time, I wonder if it came down, in the aquifer.\n  I wonder.\n  Maybe it's just holding it in there.\n  I wonder, it'll be interesting to measure this time. So what part do you have in your lab note?\n  We're adding, we're have to answer question two, and then we're measuring . \"Describe what you observed when you poured the water over the ground water the second time. What changed? Taylor, you go first.\n  Um, well, I think what changed is, since the clay sort of got use to the water the first time, and there wasn't very much water on the recharge water the first time, and it got used to, the clay got used to the water, that there are little cracks, or the water slipped through the sides and it went, and now we've got more recharge water than we had on our first one.\n  Do you think that could happen in real life? Do you think we could have an impermeable surface like clay, and then, it could crack and let water through? Why do you think that could happen in real life? Some place that might happen for real?\n  A bunch of pressure? If it rains for like, millions and millions of years, maybe like cement, or gravel? It would break it down, and it would have like a little.\n  Do you remember the term for that?\n  Weather rock.\n  Yeah!\n  Weather rock.\n  Like, what's in the middle of the road?\n  Yeah, sure, yeah.\n  Because when people drive on it, it gets so much pressure. And people keep driving on it, and it cracks sometimes.\n  Sure. And I'm sorry, I interrupted you when you were answering question number two.\n  I wonder if the, I doubt anyone would do this, but if we put pollution on clay,\n  If you put what, honey?\n  Pollution on like, cement of something, I would wonder if it would get through. Like, sort of like water sometimes, and since the clay's impermeable, water can't get through it easily, but I wonder if pollution would.\n  That's a good question, you might want to do that experiment when you're done with this one. That'd be great to check. Good job.\n  The clay became more permeable the second time we added the water?\n  Yes.\n  And then we should probably measure how much is in here.\n  Yes.\n  Oh, that's kind of... \n  Yea because it's like, soapy.\n  It is sort of soapy.\n  I think it's because of the clay being wet. Look on this side.\n  Oh yeah, I can see some of the white. \n  So why is the  about 120?\n  Because it's not quite at 150, but it's a little bit over 100.\n  Is close, close enough for this? Or how do you know when close is close enough for this?\n  Um, we know when it's close enough for this, because it doesn't really have an exact measurement for 120, so we know that it's kind of half way between 150 and 100. little bit lower than 125.\n  There's a lot more recharge than last time.\n  A lot more recharge?\n  Yeah.\n  We had 760, now we have 435.\n  Holy cow! The first time you did this, you had 760,\n  Milliliters.\n  Milliliters of runoff.\n  And this time we had 435 milliliters.\n  Oh, that is a big change! I wonder, I wonder what will happen with your recharge, have you measured that yet?\n  Yeah, what was it?\n  It was, I think it was 871.\n  Oh my goodness! Why do you think you had so much more recharge the second time you did this? Christian?\n  Probably because the ground probably got more moist, so it would make it easier to slip right through.\n  Do you remember the term for that? When the ground gets all wet with water?\n  Soil saturation.\n  Great.\n  Well yea, I mean the water level must have gotten higher.\n  Why do you say that?\n  Because the bigger the saturation is, and the higher the water table is, the more moist the ground is. The ground is so the water can go through easier.\n  I think the first time we did it, the water went through, which made it easier for the second time to go through. 'Cause it made it more moist. And the rock pebbles were kind of scattered around probably mixed with the water.\n  So that's the pattern you're seeing. What do you predict will happen on your third trial?\n  I'm thinking that there will be maybe, maybe possibly, more recharge than runoff.\n  More recharge than runoff? Did you have more recharge than runoff the second time?\n  No, but we always have the tape on, and it's less than 100.\n  So they started like this, and now they're equal, and now you think the third time they'll,\n  Yea.\n  Oh.\n  Because probably, since the soil's even more moist now, that it will make it go through the cracks.\n  And Jasper, what did your group discuss, that you observed the second time you poured in the water that was different from the first time you poured it in?\n  The runoff water was kind of even with the recharge.\n  But before you measured it, before you were just making your observations and watching, what did you observe?\n  That the first time, that there was there was more runoff because the dirt wasn't that moist.\n  Oh. Great, so that's what you wrote down for your number two? And I have a question for you Christian. How much water, are you the drain person?\n  Yeah.\n  How much rain did you pour in on trial number one?\n  1,000 milliliters.\n  So this is interesting. How much did you measure after trial number one?\n  900.\n  So what happened to the rest of the water?\n  It stayed into the soil. \n  Oh! So that's why the soil's all wet. 'Cause there's still water underneath it.\n  So it's like\n  How did you get 100?\n  Because 900 plus 100 equals 1,000.\n  Good job! Alright, I'll leave you to it. \n  Four three five, would equal... Okay, we need to have less water than the last time.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 616 GEN MC 616 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.189604], "annotations": [["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Cathy"], ["Teacher"], ["Cathy"], ["NaN"], ["Cathy"], ["NaN"], ["Cathy"], ["Group"], ["Cathy"], ["Teacher"], ["Cathy"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Ashlyn"], ["Teacher"], ["Ashlyn"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Group"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Jade"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Jade"], ["Teacher"], ["Ashlyn"], ["Teacher"], ["Ashlyn"], ["Teacher"], ["Ashlyn"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Ashlyn"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Group"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Taylor"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Taylor"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Taylor"], ["Teacher"], ["Taylor"], ["NaN"], ["Taylor"], ["NaN"], ["Taylor"], ["NaN"], ["Taylor"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Christian"], ["Teacher"], ["Christian"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Group"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Boy"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Christian"], ["Teacher"], ["Christian"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Group"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Jasper"], ["Teacher"], ["Jasper"], ["Teacher"], ["Christian"], ["Teacher"], ["Christian"], ["Teacher"], ["Christian"], ["Teacher"], ["Christian"], ["NaN"], ["Christian"], ["Teacher"], ["Christian"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW08", "TW10", "TW24TW07"]}, "245": {"text": " Okay, so ready to go here? Okay. I'd like to take you back to the fifth century. To a time when Attila the Hun was uniting the barbarian tribes and he was leading his great dark horde to conquer the lands of Gaul, or Western Europe, much to the chagrin of the Roman Empire. \"But where,\" I hear you ask \"Is Attila the Hun himself?\" Well, I fear he has perished. He died in a drunken brawl, would you believe on his wedding night? And who am I, I hear you ask, to be telling such a tale? Why, I am Mrs. Attila the Hun and it has been left to me to guide the dark horde as we continue to conquer the lands of Gaul. Javelins, and bows and arrows, those were very well and good for tacticians such as Attila the Hun, but what do I know about tactics?\n  Not much.\n So I need something--\n  Very little, you are right! Josh the Hun is right! So, what I need is to get some sort of a war machine. Now, let's first think about what characteristics do I need in a weapon that would help us against-- to help us conquer the lands of Gaul. What characteristics do we need in the weapon? What do we need it to do?\n  Hurt people.\n In other words we need to have some sort of damage at the end of property or\n  Force.\n something else. So, a force, we need to have some sort of force.\n Range.\n What else, I'm sorry, Jackie?\n Range.\n Range, the range would be a good thing, especially if we can get beyond bow range, right? That would help out to get some of the castle walls destroyed before we even get far, right?\n Steph.\n  Efficiency? Efficiency, can you tell me more about what you're thinking?\n  Well, being able to complete said task without much power used in maneuvering?\n All right, we need to be able to move the machine around to be able to get the job done. We need to be able to not, perhaps, use every single Hun for it. So efficiency in being able to load it and being able to use it. Anything else that we need in a weapon to help us in our destroying and pillaging of towns and villages? Yes, Katie.\n  Possibly something that you could use again?\n  Oh yes, if we only use it once that's kind of a problem, isn't it? We want to be able to use it repeatedly. Good idea. Other things we want to think about? Joe.\n  Something that's mobile.\n  All right, so maybe wheels might help, or being able to be something that could be lifted or carried. Okay, those are good thoughts. Jackie.\n  Accessibility, like making sure it's easy to use and not like difficult to set up?\n  So if it takes a bunch of people and they're struggling to reset it, maybe not a good idea. Something that perhaps a few people might be able to handle. All right so we've had a good deal of ideas so far. That's really good. So, I need some sort of a war machine. Something that would have all of those properties in it. Hmmm, why, what is this?\n  Message for you Mrs. The Hun.\n  A message, okay, let's see. Why, it is news of a new siege engine called a trebuchet.\n  Ooh.\n We have a picture of our new war weapon, but here's the challenge: I need to build the best trebuchet, the best war machine that I can and I'm not certain what properties, what characteristics, what parts of this machine, I should emphasize. How big they should be, how strong they should be. So I'm going to need you to help me out. I'm going to make little groups of Huns in order to create a model of our trebuchet. Each group can then test a different quality. What sorts of things could we change to test our trebuchet, to see what would be the best one? Caroline.\n [Caroline} The weight on the opposite end?\n  All right, the weight, the counter weight and the load. Both of those things, and perhaps the ratio of them, could be rather important. Josh.\n  Like the ratio of the arm on either side of the axle.\n  All right, the lever arm and how it changes, that could be an important idea. Other things that we might be able to change, to vary or test? Anything else we might be thinking of? Kate.\n On the angle, right there.\n Ah yes, the angle and the angle of launch has a lot to do with. There's a little pin that holds the sling in position until the lever arm releases it. So the angle of launch and changing that could be important. Anything else we might try? Anything else we could change? We've had some really good ideas. All right, so I'd like to break you into your small groups and I'd like you to decide on what exactly your group is going to test. We'll come back together in several days in order to share the ideas and information. So I need you to prove your loyalty me, Huns. Build this trebuchet and test it and if Attila the Hun were here right now, he'd say, \"What are you doing laying your duffs?\" \"Get to work, Huns!\" Let's get into our small groups and see what you can decide on for your trebuchet.  And you can choose whatever it is that interests you. You can choose something that we did or something different. But what you want to remember is that you have to decide what to do before any work. You have to decide \"I'm going to change this part of it\" \"and keep everything the same\" until we take data.  Remind me, first of all, what it was you were changing.\n  Counterweight.\n  Counterweight, so you're leaving the same object that you're launching?\n  We're just changing counterweight.\n So, what, is that your weight?\n Yes.\n  Okay, so what challenges did you have, if any, in building this to test your counterweight?\n We had problems with the sling and the pouch. Like, at first we made it really long, so like, that didn't really work. It didn't go anywhere, it kind of just fell apart and then the pouch itself, it's kind of like too long. So like it--\n So a little engineering before you could quite get one to work, but you did then eventually get one by changing the-- shortening the string and shortening the sling?\n Yeah.\n All right. So, at that point then, it looks like you had some data and you took several trials. Was there anything, just off the end, any pattern you happened to notice, just as you were taking the data?\n We noticed that if the counterweight was too heavy, it would just kind of smack down and then if it was too light it would just of like, it would float and then just kind of fall. So there is an ideal weight to counterweight that would make it ...\n Yeah, like, our data, we went from light to heavy and then it went from like not so far to like, really far, to like back again.\n What if I wanted to know, not 600 grams or 650, but 625? How could you analyze your data to allow me to interpolate between your data points or to go beyond, if I wanted to know what's going to happen at 775?\n  Make a graph or an equation.\n Yeah.\n  Actually, either of those would work, coming up with an equation or coming up with a graph. To me the graph is a very visual way of doing it. You could determine then whether or not it is a parabola or whether it's some other sort of a curve. All right and that will allow us to look at other data points which I think would be very helpful. So, your job then, between now and Wednesday, is to come up with how you want to analyze this so that you can explain what the results were, from your trebuchet, without sharing all of the numbers, but just by giving the ideas of what it is you found. I think this is actually very fascinating that you found your limit and then it comes back down. I think that's very interesting, the fact that it's consistent. So, help everyone else figure out what would be the ideal conditions according to your data.\n  Okay.\n All right.\n  We can do that.\n  Hello!\n  Ready to share trebuchet.\n Here's our data.\n Okay, so first remind me what it was that you were changing or testing.\n  We were looking for the angle.\n  The angle, okay, and when you were trying to build your trebuchet, what challenges, if any, did you have in trying to test this angle?\n Well, when we were doing it, we tried to make the arm in a way that it would be really easily changeable. So it couldn't be like super secure. It had to be-- we ended up doing it with rubber bands and like popsicle sticks, so it was really easy to move.\n  Okay.\n  It wasn't a super intense trebuchet, but it works.\n Yeah, we built the whole thing out of popcicle sticks.\n Now, I'm not certain they had popcicle sticks back in the fifth century, but I think . . .\n No, like twigs.\n  Twigs!\n We'll do it with twigs, that's a good idea. Alright, so, then it looks like you took some data at different angles, and you figured out then the range that it went. Was there any pattern or anything that you noticed while you were taking the data? It's okay to say no.\n Yeah, we noticed you'd want to start it like farther back, like there'd be really no reason for you to start it at a positive degree angle.\n Right.\n Because then it's--\n Because if it was positive it wouldn't really go anywhere.\n Starting with angles that made sense, that you knew would give you enough energy to start it. All right, and then what did you discover about the angles that you did try?\n That the farther back you went, the greater length that it would go.\n So the very farthest that you took it back did get the longest range.\n Yes, that was the negative 45 and that was the largest one.\n Now, what limited you, or was there a limit? You stopped at negative 45, could you have gone negative 50 or--\n No, that was when we hit the ground because ours was so small. It wasn't like high up to go all the way back.\n Ah, okay, all right, You were commenting on being high up. When we get together on Wednesday and we talk about conclusions, we'll also ask about what could we try in the future and that sounds like another something that you could potentially do. Where if you took the same model,\n but just lift it up?\n Lifted it up, adapted it, see if that would matter. All right that sounds good. So we've got several angles to comment on. If I wanted to make a guess as to what would happen at 35 degrees, or negative 35, or at negative 50, is there some way I could interpolate between data points or extrapolate beyond? Is there some way that you could analyze your data that might allow me to choose a different angle than the ones you actually chose?\n Yeah, you could probably think of an average, you wouldn't assume that it would be like 100% accurate, we wouldn't guarantee that, but it would give a good idea.\n  All right so if you did some averaging work, if you did some, been thinking of--\n Actually, not so much averaging.\n You could even set it up like ...\n Like side by side, like triangles.\n Okay, okay. So, figuring out, maybe the ratios.\n Yeah, that's --\n That you should get here, using your, when you say your size and dimensions. All right, and that is an analysis that is so legitimate. These are equations you can come up with. You do have the option of doing it visually, that is with a graph. Where you have your angles one direction, and your range the other. Just see what would happen now with just the three data points you have so far. You may find that there isn't enough data to be for certain of what would happen but you're certainly welcome to attempt that in case there is a direct linear relationship or something that's easily recognizable. So you get to choose however you want to analyze your data. When we come together on Wednesday, I will ask you to come up with a conclusion if there is one. Some groups will find that there's no conclusion that the  So that everyone else could know what the results were without looking at actual data numbers. So that's your job for Wednesday, and any other potential questions or things that you might consider for the future if you were to do another test. Also a bonus that we can measure data.\n Okay.\n All right, thank you, good job. The farthest range.\n It was 650 grams for the counterweight.\n Six five zero?\n  Yeah.\n  Alrighty, so that's good. So we did discover that there was a maximum and then we have lesser returns after that. All right, very good. Fifth group, tell us about your data and your trebuchet.\n Okay, our variable was the angle of launch as well.\n  Angle, okay, that's good.\n And we analyzed it visually, basically, and we found that the larger the angle or the higher it was, the larger the range was.\n  The larger the angle equals the larger the range and did you have any limits to that?\n Not really, it just kind of continues.\n  As long as you continue to increase the angle, you increase the range.\n So you mean like the angle of release of the sling? Or the like, how far back the arm goes before you let it go?\n  How did you measure your angle?\n Oh we measured the distance from the counterweight to our platform and like the farther that we raised it up, the larger the distance was.\n  Okay, so the larger the angle to platform.\n Like what other angle, could we have used?\n  The back arm.\n  Okay and this one was how far we pulled it back?\n  Yeah.\n So isn't that the same angle then?\n  Yeah, but we just measured it inside.\n  All right. All right so slightly different perspectives we've all found angles on. All right, our sixth group.\n We varied the counterweight also.\n  Okay, counterweight and how did you choose to analyze your data?\n We made a chart and a graph.\n  Okay, so you had a chart and then the graph and when you graphed, what did you graph?\n We graphed the weight of the counterweight versus the range.\n  That's reasonable. The counterweight versus ... range. All right and as you examined your chart and the graph data, what did you come up with as a conclusion?\n The more weight we put on, the further the range was.\n  Was there an upper limit or not?\n Not from the amount of weight that we tested. I mean I would suppose that if you put more weight than the trebuchet could handle, then it would probably would have bad results.\n  So that actually gives us a place to go in future. If we were to try to add more to the slab, that might be something kind of interesting to find out, is what is the upper limit and at what point does the equipment fail? That might make a difference with our big trebuchet. We want the biggest one that was successful. Were there any other questions that came to mind or any other things that occurred to you while you were either taking data or analyzing it or building your trebuchet? Josh.\n The angle at which the sling was released mattered a lot.\n  All right and, in fact, if we were to combine that with your counterweight, we have a couple of variables we might examine at the same time for the same trebuchet. Other questions or things that you thought about that maybe you would've liked to have added to or varied? Steph?\n When the sling did release, we could never really tell where it did, and we couldn't really tell if it released it after the object was launched or if it released at the point in time that it's supposed to. So you could never really tell--\n", "filename": ["Copy of 245 SCI AYA 245edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.096446], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["Josh"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Steph"], ["Steph"], ["NaN"], ["Katie"], ["Teacher"], ["Joe"], ["Teacher"], ["Jackie"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Josh"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW04", "TW09s", "TW15", "TW17", "TW18"]}, "244 ": {"text": " Dan do you have any background knowledge about density?\n Like if someone says, \"It's dense out,\"\n Yeah.\n Then it would be kinda wet.\n So if something's really, like if there was a dense fog\n yeah, it'd be...\n So if there was a dense fog, what does that mean to you?\n That there's a lot.\n There's a lot of it, okay.

If it's absolutely packed full, what does that mean for the luggage? Yeah.\n That the particles are so close together that it's leaving them in...\n Is the volume of the luggage changing if it keeps its shape?\n Or is, the mass of the luggage changing, because you're adding more stuff to it.\n The mass\n So you change the mass, because the luggage is staying the same. Okay, your mom says, \"You can only bring one swimsuit, \"one flip-flop, a pair of flip-flops, and one t-shirt.\" So I take everything out, now did I change the volume by it, or did I change the mass of the luggage?\n The mass.\n I just changed the amount of matter, right? So then, the luggage with tons of stuff in it, we said was... what dense or not dense?\n Dense\n And dense, and so the luggage with a little bit of stuff in it was?\n Less dense.\n What changed the density of the luggage? What are the other conclusions to what changed the density of the luggage? Peter, what changed the density of the luggage?\n Less amount.\n Less amount, and in science, which word do we use?\n Umm\n Volume or mass on that one?\n Umm... mass.\n Less mass, less stuff, less matter in the luggage.

Right so cheese A or cheese B. Alright, and if you need to see the cheese again, walk around. In the meantime, I'll put this question up. I want to know is cheese A the densest? Or is cheese B the densest? Okay, so this is multiple-choice, A or B. There we go, go ahead and click it. And let's see what you guys think about which cheese is the densest.\n So the Cheddar is B?\n So A is the Swiss, B is the Cheddar.\n That doesn't make a lot of sense.\n A is the Swiss...\n Are we each going to be able to get a piece?\n Please don't talk while we're doing this.\n My clicker isn't working\n It's not working? Which number are you?\n 83.\n Is it on?\n Yeah \n Are you pressing the right button, \"Send?\"\n Oh there it goes.\n Okay. good\n It probably didn't power.\n Alright, make sure you clicked in please. And then, let's look at what we think. Okay 92% of you, said that the cheddar was the densest. So, we had another 8%, so two people said that this was the densest. So here's what I want you to do, I want you to pull a partner, who's just the person next to you. So you guys are gonna be partners, you guys are partners, you guys are partners, and you're gonna be a group of three. Partner, partner, partner Mattie and Grayson, and you guys will partner. Sydney and Jackson, and it's kinda gonna go crossways here. So you guys will be a partner. You guys are a partner, and you guys are a partner. Right, you're going to turn to your partner, tell your partner which cheese you thought was the densest, and then I want you to come up with a conclusion, that you could say, \"Cheese A was the densest because...\" or \"Cheese B was the densest because...\" So take 30 seconds to talk. \n Less mass,\n Cheddar\n So what is the definition of density, from here to the cheese? Which one is denser, the one with more stuff or less stuff?\n More\n So which of these has more stuff\n Ooh\n Nice of you guys, and you're not very nice.  Okay that was 30 seconds. Okay, choose which person in your group is gonna be Swiss cheese, and which person gonna be Cheddar.\n Swiss! \n Cheddar\n Swiss Cheeses, raise your hand please.\n Woo!\n Swiss cheese? And I need a conclusion from you, so make a statement for me. \"We thought \"cheese A was the densest because...\" so Erica,\n We thought cheese B was the densest because it didn't have any holes.\n Because it didn't have any holes, okay. Does anybody have a different explanation why they thought cheese B was the densest? Matt.\n Well, because cheese A had holes, the holes don't take in the part of the, technical isn't part of the cheese.\n Okay\n So...\n So the inside of the holes, what are the holes actually made up of?\n Air.\n So there's air in there, but it's not part of the cheese. So then, what's true about the Swiss cheese then Reily?\n It has the less cheese.\n Less cheese, compared to its what?\n Compared to has all of it.\n So it's all cheese and this is part cheese. What can we say now about their volumes?\n Umm, they're pretty much the same.\n Okay, so the volume is the same. Jackson, what can we say about the mass of the Swiss compared to the mass of this guy?\n The Swiss has less mass than the Cheddar cheese.\n So the Swiss has less mass then the Cheddar. But they have the same volume, can we figure out then which one's the densest? Which one's the densest? \n What's both, alright. You had a chance to talk about it, let's vote again. Do you think cheese A is the densest or cheese B is the densest? After our little discussion. Cheese A or cheese B. A is the Swiss, B is the Cheddar.\n So we want to know who's more dense\n More dense yep, Which one is more dense. More dense. Is A more dense or is B more dense? Let's see if we get an agreement on our inference here about which one's denser. Look at that, we were able to change two people's minds just through discussion. That's pretty awesome.\n I thought it would be eight people.\n Well we went all the way to 100% here. So that's good. That means that everybody agreed, at least in terms of the cheese. So, as a demonstration...\n What!\n Well I need a snack, this is really hard work being a teacher.\n It's hard to be a student.\n That's true. Okay, ready for demo number two?\n Yeah\n So cheese number one, number two, first we need to talk about, what sinking, floating, and suspending means.\n I know it\n So in order to talk about this, I have these fun objects. I don't know, has anybody stayed up late enough to see David Letterman?\n Yes!\n Oh gosh, I lost an animal.  has anybody on David Letterman ever seen the game show he plays called, \"Will it float?\"\n Yeah, I've seen it happen.\n Have you Wyatt? What does he do? Do you know what he does?\n Well I saw it a while ago, so I don't relaly remember.\n So you're not really sure? Anybody wanna guess what he does on the show?\n He throws stuff in water.\n He takes some stuff, then he puts it in water to sees if it floats or not.\n That's pretty much the gist of the game show. So I have, for your viewing pleasure, recreated a game show. So I have objects, we're gonna play a game called, \"Will it float?\" And the first object, you're going to predict this through the clicker. Is I wanna know, if our little dolphin friend, is it going to float... okay sink... or the third option which is tricky, you might not know this word, suspend. And suspends means hang out kinda in the middle of the water. So you have three options, alright. We're gonna vote on this with the clickers. Do you have a question before we do that?\n When you put it to the test, can I move forward?\n Absolutely, so if you can't see, you can either stand up or you can squeeze up into an aisle, yeah absolutely. Yes sir.\n Which one is it, A, B , or C?\n Oh I'm gonna tell you right now, okay. So we're gonna see if the dolphin floats, sinks, or suspends. And if you can't see when I do it, we'll count and you can stand up and watch. So A is gonna be sink, so do you think it's gonna sink. B, answer B will be float. C will be suspend, Okay, so sink, float, suspend which means hang out in the middle of the water. Okay, so this is an A through C option. Okay, A sink, B float, or C suspend.\n Well that was fast.\n Yeah, that was really fast. So let's see... everyone...oooo object is going to sink. If it sinks, what will you observe? If it sinks, what will you observe.\n How fast.\n It falling into the water\n Well, he's going to fall into the water one way or another but where will he end up?\n On the bottom.\n At the bottom of that okay? Some of you, one person said that it's gonna float. Okay, so raise your hand if you're the person who thinks it's gonna float. Okay, thank you for taking a risk, that's okay. You don't know yet right, it's for fun. So if its floating, what will that mean, what will you observe?\n That's she right.\n When I put this in the water, what will it look like when it's floating?\n Like... I don't know\n Will it will be sitting on the bottom?\n No.\n Where will it be located.\n Floating on the.\n Floating, right on the top, okay. And then we had, oooooh three whole people said it would suspend right in the middle. Raise your hand if you think it's gonna suspend.\n Oh yeah!\n Okay.  Leia, why do you think it's gonna go right in the middle.\n I think it's too light for it to totally sink, and I think it's took heavy for it to float, so thought it would be right in the middle.\n Okay, so you're making the hypothesis it has something to do with its weight. Okay, alright so that's one idea. Too light to stay at the top. But too heavy would go to the bottom. Is that what you said? Okay, yes.\n So does suspend mean it stays in the middle.\n Yeah, suspend means it literally hangs out right here.\n Yeah.\n Okay, that's not true.\n Okay, are you guys ready?\n Yes.\n So stand up if you need to be able to see. Here's the game show, there's a little song that goes with it like, \u266b Will it float, will it float \u266b Okay, there's my game show, you ready? Alright it's very suspenseful. Can you see?\n Okay, here it goes. \n Yes!\n Aww yeah! \n So, it sank. So go back and have a seat please. Now raise your hand if you have any explanation for me why that sank. It did sink, oh no! We've all been down to the bottom of the pool. Why do you think it sank?\n I thought it wasn't flat enough, or didn't have enough space enough to float up.\n So now we've got two different ideas about sinking and foating. So Leia brought up the idea of heaviness, you brought up the idea of surface area. See if I were to put something that has a bigger surface area, is it gonna float?\n No\n Yes\n Maybe, did you tell me that if it had bigger surface on top of the water. Okay, should we try this?\n Yeah!\n It's gonna sink\n Oooh\n Okay, so maybe\n Aaaaw\n It got swamped. Now it floated for a little while right? So maybe the shape does have something to do with it, and maybe weight has something to do with it. Or what it's made out of might have something to do with it. So we have all kinds of ideas now about sinking and floating. Yes sir,\n Is it because it's denser than water?\n So here's another idea, it has something to do with the density of the object.\n It's denser than water.\n So here's a tough question, so think about this one. What is the difference between how dense something is, and how heavy something is? If Leia talked about heaviness, now we've got density, and now we've got shape, and what it's made of and all these different things so. I just want to know this one thing. What's the difference between the weight of an object and the density of an object. This is a really hard question, take a second. I want you to rotate back to your partner, talk to them about what you think the difference between density and weight is. \n Okay, when we talked about number of particles, it's later than mass.\n Mass.\n Mass, so the relationship between mass compared to the object. Okay. Okay who spoke last time, 'cause I need a cheddar. \n Oh yeah\n A cheddar who's willing to talk. Emily, what did you guys come up with?\n So, density is like how much mass or how many particles are in the object. And weight is how much gravity is pulling down.\n Okay.  So would that mean that something...\n,  That's heavier automatically sink. Hang on one sec. And then, we'll try to work through this one. If something is heavier than something else, will it automatically sink? Are ships heavy? Do ships sink? Occasionally, right? Especially if you're on that cruise ship, like last week, did you hear about that?\n  It depends on the--\n  Okay, now we're talking about depends what it's in. So, now we've got all these different ideas working. Holy cow. Yes, ma'am, anything else to add?\n I was gonna say, I don't know why, I'm just gonna hook on this whole list of things, but, like, a tin can will float if it's empty, because of the air that's stuck inside of it holds the object up. So, if that was hollow, I'm guessing that it would most likely float. So, the ships are hollow in the bottom, the air that keeps it up, but the bottom, how part of the ship goes in water is because part of it isn't hollow. That part sinks, but the air in the boat will keep it up and that's how things float.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 244A SCI EA 244 A edited.srt.txt", "Copy of 244B SCI EA 244 Bedited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0691763], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Sighs"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW06s", "TW13", "TW16", "TW22", "TW24"]}, "196": {"text": " Think out loud, what are we doing?\n OK, you know the area of the square is 196 so you want to \n How do we do that?\n Take 196, divide it by four. \n Hold on, let me hear from somebody that I haven't heard from.\n Need to find the square root of 196.\n OK, why are we taking the square root instead of dividing by four?\n Because all sides are equal?\n Well, if all sides were equal, that's why we would divide by four. \n Because to find the area of the square you have to square it.\n So the opposite of squaring is square root.\n So, we would divide by four if we were given the... perimeter. If we were given the perimeter of the square we would divide by four. But we were given the area, so we need to square root.\n  14.\n OK, so the side lengths are 14.\n Multiply times 4.\n It's 56.\n Anybody see a problem with this?  OK, so this side is on the inside of the figure. So it doesn't count, so instead of doing 14 times 4,\n  We do 14 times 3. \n How do we find the perimeter of a semi-circle? \n 2 pi R divided by 2 .\n 2 pi R divided by 2? \n How do you find the perimeter of a semi-circle?\n 2 pi R divided by 2.\n So the radius, that means 7, 7 is 14. 2 times pi times 7. So that should be 2 times 3.14...  So the whole thing is 53.38. \n So then, 2 pi R divided by 2?\n I got 2 times pi times 7 divided by two cause the radius is only 7 cause that line was supposed to be 14. So 14 divided by 2 is 7. \n Here, Skye, can you take this? Thank you. Put the final answer on there and then quick to the next problem. \n C squared.\n OK, all of the line segments in the diagram of the bathroom floor shown below are either vertical or horizontal. How many one inch square tiles would it take to cover the figure? \n Don't you got to work it into two rectangles?\n I think it'd be easier of you did it the long way. \n Does it matter which way you split it?  Either way you're going to have to split something, right?  You can determine either of the missing sides.\n In order to find the area of a rectangle you must apply . 7 times 6 is 42.\n Where is...I don't see a 7 in my problem.  OK, but what does 7 represent? I don't see a 7, what is...?\n It represents the length of this.\n What length?\n From the line on down to 6.\n OK. Could you label that with a 7? Cause I still don't see 7. \n It said, how many one inch squares .\n OK, so you want to multiply what by 12?\n 87.\n 87 times 12?\n  Why?\n But you made the 12 into a 7.\n OK, so you want to do\n Where are you all getting 12 from?\n A foot is 12 inches.\n There's one inch, not twelve.\n Oh, because I found the 87 feet squared. I found the area of it, but then you've got to find how many 1 inch, so you multiply it times 12 because there's 12 inches in a foot.\n So what are we multiplying with?\n  12.\n So we're doing 87 times 12? \n Shouldn't you divide though?\n Try dividing. What do you get when you divide? \n Say that again.\n In one square foot, there are 144 inches. Instead of going by 12 which I said originally, shouldn't we be doing it by 144? Since one square foot is how many inches it is?\n But I've got 87 square foot.\n But I'm saying in each foot, there's 144 inches. So instead of 12, there are 144 square inches. So instead of multiplying by now that I think about it, we should multiply it by 144. \n OK, let me ask you guys this: what if we converted all of the feet to inches before we found our area?\n Could we do it that way?\n  Yeah. OK, let's try it that way. What would 9 be in inches? 9 feet in inches?\n  108.\n 108? What would 5 be in inches? 7 in inches, 7 feet?\n 84.\n 84, thank you Kashmir. And 6?\n 72.\n 72, thank you Sierra. OK, we know what all our units are in inches. Now when we find the area, we're going to be finding square inches. Somebody want to take over from here? Skye, do you mind if you continue writing?\n Uhm yeah. No, I don't mind.\n Thank you. You can erase all of it. My eraser got stolen.\n So, do we do this the same way but multiply the length and the width, right?\n Yeah. \n It's what?\n 6,480. \n It's multiplying.\n But that's wrong though. Don't you still have to subtract... I mean, like 84 minus 60 because they're part of the...\n No, we didn't convert the 12. We converted the 7.\n Oh, OK.\n So it's still already changed. Good question though.  What's the total?\n 12,528. I just checked it originally with the 87 times 144 and that was correct. You are supposed to multiply by 144.\n Good job.\n What did you say it was?\n 12,528.\n How'd you get that? \n OK. Next problem. No? You have a question? Yes. \n When you get 1000? When did you have 1,044?  Oh, and then you multiply by 12 again. Because guess what 12 times 12 is.\n  144.\n So that's what you're doing. You're multiplying by into 12 and 12, right? \n They way you get 15 from when the outside is 10 before the 15.....\n From the very, very top to the very bottom.\n Thank you, because now we know that that's 1 inch.\n Can't you break it up?\n Now that we know the basic triangle in the back.\n That means you're breaking it up into... a triangle and a square?\n Yes. The square on the bottom.\n I'm sorry, Jacob? The base of what?\n The base of the triangle in the back. \n But what's the base?\n 5.\n The height is 5 and the base is 15. \n Well yeah, but I was asking Jacob what the base of the triangle was. Can you explain why the base of the triangle is 18?\n Because the width of the rectangle is 10 and I have to add the sides of the triangle.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 196 MATH AYA 196edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.303267], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Several"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Several"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Several"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Several"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Several"], ["Several"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Several"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW08", "TW16", "TW24"]}, "243": {"text": " What I need you to do is, you're going to be looking at both sets of data, the one from October in the morning, and the one from last week in the afternoon.

So I want you to work with your shoulder partners, want you to talk about what is in common with both days of data.  Okay, where are you all standing? What is the same between those two days?

In order from the heat.\n Okay, does everyone agree?\n Yes.\n You all see the same thing? Now, what does it mean that black covered had more of a change than white uncovered?

What do you think, Nick?\n There's different air temperature.\n Okay, there's a different air temperature. Okay, what else? Just looking at the overall graph, Justin? Just looking at just the picture of the graph, how does the picture look different from the morning to the afternoon?\n All of the temperatures went, got decreased.\n In the?\n In the um, at 2:30.\n Okay, and when you say decrease, which graph looked like this? The morning or the afternoon?\n The morning.\n The morning, which one looked like this?\n The afternoon.\n Okay, so overall, the graphs look a little different from the morning to the afternoon.

And Kristen's saying that the morning time the sun's here, okay. Where was the sun in the afternoon, Anthony?\n It was like barely...\n Okay, okay, Semijah.\n It was in the clouds.\n Okay, it was, sometimes it was going behind the clouds. Where was it, Alex, where was it in the sky? You don't remember?\n Behind the school.\n Okay, behind the school. So this was our morning experiment, and this was our afternoon experiment.

What does size mean?\n If something is bigger.\n If something is bigger or smaller. Now which measurement, which size are you going to sort by? Big or little?\n Big.\n Okay, so all your big leaves, put them in the middle. Okay. \n You decide how you want to sort them. So if you want to use both baggies, that's okay. If you want to just use one, that's okay, too. Okay, that's okay, that's okay, too.\n I noticed that you haven't started sorting yet. So which one do you want to sort by? Or do you want to make up your own?\n I like to do this.\n Yeah, color.\n Color? Okay, so ok, what color are you going to choose?\n I'm gonna choose brown. Jennifer is that ok? You have to ask your partner. Sort by brown. So put all the leaves that match, the brown, in your work space. Ok, let's see what's going on over here. Ok, well let me see this. Let me see that, please. Ok we are going to work with partners. I know sometimes it can be hard to work with partners, because you're trying to make a choice and maybe one person wants to do one thing, and maybe one person wants to do another so we're gonna work together to figure this out. Well, let's get working.\nShe's laughing. How do you want to sort your leaves now. Let's get our workspace in the middle. I notice you already sorted by color, so now how do you want to sort? By shape? Ask your partner if that's ok. Ask your partner if that's ok. Ok, is this the shape you want to sort by? Oh, this is pretty tricky. See if you have any more leaves that match this shape. How can you describe this shape? How can you describe that shape? So you're going to look for ones that have little points? So you're actually sorting by points. Yes, am I hearing that right? So look at your leaves, and look for ones that have teeny tiny points. Look at your leaves, so look at your leaves here. Ones that have teeny, tiny points. It has points, its very tiny. Does it have points? No, no side points? Yes, does it have some side points? Do you think that belongs here? Oh, really! I loved how you used your magnifying glass to find those little details. Keep on looking through yours, Jennifer because I have a feeling that you are going to find some more. Take a look at these points and take a look at these points. You're sorting by points, right? Are those little points or big points? Little or big? Little? Are they little like this? Are you sure? So you think this belongs here? Okay.  Don't worry about your name for right now. I've noticed that you've sorted by every way. Now, are you ready for the challenge? Can you make up your own way to sort? Something that we didn't talk about on Friday? Oh, I bet you could. Yeah, well let's think a little bit more. Now I want you to look very very closely at these leaves. What's something that's the same about some of them? That's the question that you should be asking yourself. What's the same about some of these leaves?\n They have dots.\n Really, they have dots? \n Remember we had colors up here. Andrew just said something. Some of these had dots. Do you see dots on some of your leaves? Yes, do you think that's a good way to sort? So wow, see I thought you said you couldn't figure out another way. So, I want you to put all of the leaves with dots on your workspace.  Okay, how are we sorting here?  That's okay. The way you're doing it is perfect. All you need to shoot for is to keep count of what you've done so far. So let me come to you. I've noticed that you had sorted by color so far. Which one is next, which one would you like to do next? Okay, which one do you want to do? It's up to you. Do you want to sort by big leaves? Is that okay, Monica? Okay, so look at your leaves, and sort by size. Now find all of your leaves that are big. Uh oh, does this one belong there? Does this one belong there? Okay, wow. Amazing. I like how you're really looking at your leaves. Absolutely, that one's very big, nice job.   I really love how children stopped working. They put their hands up. Friends, can I share something that I noticed? Is that okay? When I was walking around, I noticed children using their eyes and sometimes their hands to explore their leaves. Some of you figured out new ways to sort your leaves. And I can't wait for those kids to share their ways. Some of you went ahead and you looked at what we talked about on Friday. Which was also a really great way to use a resource in our room to help us sort. I just want to remind everybody that your job right now is not to touch your leaves. Your job right now is not to touch your leaves. Your leaves are down. Because it's important for scientists to stop what they're doing and share what they have noticed. Let's take a peek. This is a graph, does anybody recognize this graph? Does it look like something we already do? What is it, raise your hand if you want to share. It kind of looks like you use something, it's something we do every, almost every day. Brian?\n  Um, the calendar.\n  Yes! And what in our calendar, sweetheart, looks like that?\n The weather.\n  Oh, I love how you're thinking. Absolutely right, our weather calendar looks like this. Today, friends, we're going to share how you sorted. And then, I'm going to go ahead, I'm going to color in boxes. and then at the end we're gonna see. What was the most popular way to sort? What was maybe not the most popular way, and if anyone had a different way to sort. Okay? So, just give me a thumbs up if you sorted by size. Look at your sheet, look at your sheet. And give me a thumbs up if you sorted by size today. Let's see. And actually, I'm only going to ask one partner to put their thumb up. Because I'm only counting partners. So, one group, two groups, three groups, four groups, five groups, six, seven, eight groups, nine groups, ten groups, eleven groups, twelve groups. Uh oh. Do I have enough spaces?\n  No.\n Oh my gosh, I'll have to add them. Eleven, twelve, so there were twelve groups\n  There's thirteen.\n that wanted, that sorted by this kind.\n  Mrs , you forgot mine. Okay, anybody sort by shape today? Anybody sort by shape today? Okay, keep your thumbs up. One, two, okay. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Wow, ten groups sorted by shape.\n  Mrs  you keep forgetting mine. Mrs  you keep forgetting mine. Okay friends, before we continue going on with that, did you sort by another way today? Did you sort by another way, that wasn't something we talked about on Friday? Emma, did you sort by a different way today? Oh sorry, you're two. Joel, and Emma, I'll come to you. \n What's another way you sorted?  Okay, did someone sort by a completely different way that's not on your chart? Andrew?\n Dots.\n Dots, did anybody sort by dots today? Yeah, okay. What's another way you sorted your leaves? Catherine? Counting the points. Okay, now that was a way that we sorted on our sheet, but that's okay. How's it different?  So you were looking for nine points, okay? So friends there's so many different ways you can sort, and I just want you to put your hands down.. Because there's so many different ways you can sort, and there's many more ways than just what we practiced today. As scientists and mathematicians, we're gonna continue sorting and looking for similarities, things that are the same things, and things that are different. Give yourself a pat on the back. Thank you so much, friends, for doing your best job today.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 048 GEN EC 048edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.0631151], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["child"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["children"], ["NaN"], ["Child"], ["NaN"], ["Child"], ["Child"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW11", "TW17", "TW19"]}, "046": {"text": " Today I'm going to introduce to you our new project, and it's based on the concept of surrealism. When you look at this word, you should recognize a smaller word within it. Does anyone recognize the smaller word?\n Real.\n Real, that's right. The word \"real.\" And we know real is the way things really look when we see them, or the way they appear. But the word \"sur\" transforms that word. And because this is a French word, \"sur\" means \"beyond.\" So now what the word \"surrealism\" implies is beyond reality, or the way things really appear. So what does that look like? It looks very dreamlike. It doesn't necessarily make sense. A lot of different things go on in surrealism, and I'm going to show you a few examples right now. These are the three characteristics that we're going to focus on. The first characteristic is out of place objects. If you look at this example up here, what's out of place in this picture? Can anyone tell me? Trevor?\n The guy's face.\n What's over his face, just floating there? Can anyone tell? You're up close, Matthew. You see what that is?\n An apple.\n It's a green apple, okay? And that is an out of place object. Definitely surreal. These are examples of surrealism. This example right here. What's in here, Jordan?\n Train.\n There's a train coming out of a fireplace. Okay, again, an out of place object. These are two examples of one of those characteristics of out of place objects. Another characteristic that you see are unreal scenes. Scenes that do not make sense. They're beyond real. What's going on in this scene? Kurt?\n There's, like, giant butterflies.\n Yeah. The butterflies grew. They're huge. Now they're like the props on the windmills. What's going on in this? Can anyone tell? What makes that surreal? John?\n Like, huge makeup.\n Yeah, the si-, again, the size of such little things grew tremendously, and they're filling up the room. Also, the interior of the room is now looking like the sky. So what made these unreal is the artist changed something that was small and made it really, really big. The last characteristic that we see in surrealism is... there it is. Normal objects acting abnormally. So in these examples I'll go through real quickly. Do you see these clocks? They're not acting normally. These clocks are melting, they're dripping, they're stretching, they're falling down. You can see that. In this one, the artist drew a person looking into the mirror, but does he see his reflection?\n No.\n No. The mirror's not operating normally. It's surreal. It's beyond real. What it's doing is it's showing the back of his head. And again, in this one, it's kind of hard to tell, but there are three swans, and the reflection is of three elephants. So the reflection in the water is not acting normally. These are three characteristics of surrealism, all right? So why surrealism? Why this style of art? Does anyone have any guesses of why anyone, or why these artists created something like this? Yeah?\n Because it's like a modern form of art.\n Okay, yeah. That's actually a very good definition. Cara?\n Maybe to make it look interesting.\n Okay, good.\n To make it look funny.\n Okay, good. Guys, those are all excellent, excellent answers. Here is another thing that went into surrealism. Like lots of art, it's influenced by what's going on around it or what happened before it. So these three boxes represent three other styles of art that influenced the ideas of surrealism. And the first style of art is known as Dada art. This type of art is where the artist took things, and they tried to make something that wasn't considered art. They took random objects, like a bicycle wheel and the stool, and put it together and said, \"Okay, this is not art.\" And that was an example of the style. They also took a famous painting like the Mona Lisa, scribbled mustache and a beard. There it is. That's not art. And that was really the whole idea of Dada. It was like anti-art. Another thing that influenced surrealism was symbolism. Symbolism was a style of art in which the artist tried to depict an idea of something. And in this example, it's the idea of death. There's this dark angel depicted over this man, who's already halfway down in the ground. All this white snow that symbolizes life around him. And it was just the idea of what that might look like using symbols. And that's what that one depicts. The other example, or another influence of surrealism, is metaphysical painting. This one's very, very hard to understand, and that's what the idea was with the style. It was to kind of paint an unreal or illogical situation. Basically one in which you do not know what you're looking at. You don't know what the objects are. You might know something, but you don't know why it's there or what part of it it is. And it's very, very illogical and doesn't make sense. These three styles of art in the boxes influenced surrealism. So when you look at these three styles of art, you can kind of see what they led to. They led to this style of art, which is known as surrealism. So now... where to start. Here's what's going on today. Today, you are going to start with... and you can open your folders up, and you'll see this slide. What we're going to do is we're going to start drawing today. We are going to start by making a connection, all right? And if you look at this example up here on the board, or, and you can look at your slides, too. What we're going to do... you can just take your stuff off, Leann, leave it back there, and then join your table, okay? What we're going to do is I want you to come up with something that means something to you, and that's like your theme to start with. Maybe it's a hobby, an activity, a memory, anything that's meaningful to you, that's your starting point. Then what we have to do is we have to give it an element of surprise. So these are our options that I just discussed. Those are the characteristics. Do you want to move it around, change the location of it? Do you want to make the sizes different and create an unreal scene? Or do you want to make objects in it doing something that they shouldn't be doing? Let me give you an example. Lily, what's your favorite food?\n Strawberries.\n Strawberries. What's your favorite holiday, Joe?\n Christmas.\n Jacob, what's your favorite animal?\n A dog.\n Okay. So this is my surrealist example to you. You have a Christmas tree, but instead of a Christmas tree, you have a big strawberry standing up with decorations on it, and then you have dogs putting those decorations on it. So that's kind of an example of taking things that are meaningful to you and putting them into a surrealist example. These are some examples that I have that I did. These are some of my drawings. This first one, and sometimes you don't even know where these drawings are coming from. I wanted to take an object and stretch it. I wanted to make it act abnormally. So I chose a spoon. And what I did was I thought, well, a spoon needs to catch something. So this spoon is stretching out trying to catch the raindrops. Why? Because it's really dry wherever it is. You can see all the cracks. So that was kind of like my first idea. The second sketch that I did was I wanted to do something with a tropical type of a setting. An unreal scene in an unreal place. So what I thought was, well, pineapples are tropical. Why not cut open a pineapple, and there is my tropical beach with all the little palm trees, okay? You're probably wondering what we're going to do with these. Today is sketching, but what's going to happen is this is going to turn into a watercolor painting. This is an example of what the painting might look like when it's all done. I chose the pineapple one, all right? So we are going to be doing a watercolor painting, but today we need to kind of come up with ideas of what that painting's going to look like. Up here on the board, I think this is going to help you a lot. This is a bunch of different examples of surrealist paintings, and there's a variety of different things that the artist has done. They might be food, they might be animals, they might be instruments, they might be people, they might be landscapes. There's lots of things to look at. I want you to use this as your primary resource to help you and guide you through your drawings. I'm going to give you paper right now. Use this sheet. Start with making a connection, all right? Start with making a connection, and then look at the different options and ways that you can make it surreal, all right?\n How do you draw hands?\n Hands? That's... okay, hands. You know what? This is just a sketch. So this is a detail that doesn't... or this is a part that you don't really need to worry about. So tell me what's going on. What makes this surreal?\n Um...\n That's what I want to know.\n Because it's the birthday party in the present.\n Okay. So which of these options do you think you're focusing the most on?\n This one.\n Okay, and why?\n Because a present usually doesn't open.\n Okay, so the present, so the party is within the present. So the present gets opened up, and then there's a party. Okay. What else can we do to make it, like, maybe a little bit more, like, bam, something going on? That's the only thing I was thinking about, you know? Like, maybe...\n Like balloons and...\n Yeah, balloons. Like, they're com-, they're flowing out. That'd be really cool. All right, that's good.\n What should I, like, do for, like, for, like, the face? The face on a...?\n Baseball.\n Baseball. And what are we using for the parts of the face?\n So this is a baseball bat.\n Okay.\n And I...\n Okay.\n These are the baseball bases.\n Oh, the bases, okay.\n Yeah. And this is , and this is...\n Okay. So you're combining, you're combining...\n A lot.\n ...a lot of different things. So why freckles?\n Because, like, I thought putting more into it would make it more interesting.\n Okay. You know what I think would make this really more interesting is the background. What's going on around the face?\n Um...\n Think about it. Think about it. What could we do? Where could this be?\n In the sky?\n I don't know. So what would represent the sky? What could you draw to represent the sky?\n Clouds?\n Try that. Maybe draw some clouds. I think, I think that's going to make your picture more interesting. Something like that.\n Because, like, someone hit a home run.\n Yeah, okay. And maybe some action lines around the ball. You know, like a little--\n Yeah.\n That looks really good. I like that. I like that one a lot.\n A dog eating pizza.\n Okay, Brittney. Yeah.\n I don't know how to draw horses.\n A horse?\n Yeah.\n Why do you need a horse?\n Because I want to draw, like, a horse .\n What were you going to do?\n Like...\n A horse...\n A horse with a farm inside of it.\n Inside of it. So what do you mean inside of it, though?\n Like, in here, do, like, a farm, and cows, and...\n Well, here's a suggestion, because I like your idea a lot. Why don't we... we can use this as a resource. Why don't we draw, I'll help you with this, just the back of the horse, okay? So we'll just work, we'll focus on, like, the neck and the back, and then the tail kind of coming down like this, okay? So you see where I'm going with this? Now what I'm thinking is why don't you draw your farm scene on the back? Like, almost that it's, like, kind of been placed on there, like a little miniature scene. Like, so maybe on here, you could draw the silo, the barn, and everything on there. Good? Eyes on me.\n One, two, three.\n Okay, guys, you're doing a really, really good job with your sketching and everything, and I don't, I want you to keep going. But we do need to stop for a minute. And based on the drawings that I'm seeing, I see some really good examples of surrealism, and you're showing me that you understand it. I bet you that if you saw an example of surrealism with some other styles of art, you could pick out the one that represents surrealism. Take a look up here on the board. I have three Tabasco sauce posters, okay? One, two, three, and four. Show me with your fingers, holding them up in the air, which one of these is an example of surrealism. Think about it for a minute. While you think about it, I'm going to wiggle my mouse so I can... okay. What's an example of, which one is a... Jess. Okay, everyone had four. That's good. Why? Why that one? Why'd you pick that one?\n Because, like...\n Nope, hold on. I was going to let Jessie answer first. What makes that one surreal? Think about it. Michael, go ahead.\n The sides are, like, coming off the bottle.\n Okay.\n And the pepper's, like, putting out the sauce.\n Okay, good. Anything else? Erin?\n It's, like, out on this, like, island.\n Yeah, definitely, definitely. Like, a lot of things make this one surreal. What does surreal mean again? Who remembers?\n Me? It means, like, not, like, like, not real, but, like, in a different form.\n Right. Beyond real. Beyond real. Okay? And this is a great example of that. Beyond reality. Okay? Here's what I need you to do now, okay? I have one more... Oh, I might have to re- ...I have one more slide that I want to show you up on the board, and if you open up your folders, you'll see this. You'll see this slide. And I printed it out for you. What I'm going to have you do right now, in the next couple minutes, I'm going to have you switch your drawing with someone at your table. You might have to switch three ways, or four ways, or one way. And I want you to assess the drawing that you get. Now, if you get one that has lots of drawings, just pick one of them, okay? Here's what I want you to do on the sheet. This is easy. First thing. What's the first thing that you notice about the drawing that you just received? Write it down. Maybe you noticed a big basketball. Maybe you notice... whatever it is, write it down. Then I want you to check these little circles. Whichever of these options that you see that that person used, I want you to check them out. Okay, Michael? And then I want you to write. This is the one that everyone stumbles with. They're like, \"What does this mean?\" All I'm saying is, what do you think that person meant in that drawing? What do you think the meaning is? If you don't know, put a question mark. All right? And then what suggestions do you have for that person? Maybe they, you know, if you did a background, it would look really nice. Or maybe, you know what? Maybe you've got to lose something. You've got way too much going on. I can't tell what it is. So this is not going to take you very long, but it's important because it shows that, shows me that you understand what you're looking at, and it also helps the person get a better drawing, which is going to be used for the painting. So I want you to switch drawings right now. Everyone switch. And I want you to use the sheet, and I want you to fill it out based on the new drawing that you're looking at, okay? So you're going to do this independently, and I'll come around and I'll check with you in a little bit. That's the first thing that you see. Write down the first thing that you see, all right? So, Lily, what's the first thing that you see in your, in this picture?\n .\n Okay. What do you think it is?\n .\n Okay. What do you think this is as a whole? Don't say anything, because I know it's yours. But this is good, because this is going to help you to make it better if you need to. So what's the first thing that you know? That you th-, what do you see? Just maybe you recognize it just as water. Anything else?\n Maybe a blanket .\n Okay. Write that down. Okay, that's a good start. What's the first thing that you saw? Almost everything is crooked. That's a good ob-, that's a really good observation. Because everything is crooked. Good. So what options do you think were used in this? Now, which one did you select?\n Normal object acting abnormally.\n That's right. It's clearly these objects are acting abnormally. That's good. That was a good, that was another good observation. So you just keep moving through. Did you write down your first reaction?\n Mm-hmm.\n Okay. And... okay. So normal objects acting abnormally.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 046 ARTEMC046.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.0855182], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW03", "TW04", "TW06", "TW11", "TW13", "TW16"]}, "045": {"text": " Yeah, the oil. Okay, so we discussed that one. So Maddie is going to write  down about the peanut butter.  What the observation was. At the first observation it was 9  centimetres.  And it has grown. In Joshua's words, it has grown.  Good. And you're gonna do that for all three of them.\n Okay, um, The peanut butter, \n No, we just did the peanut butter  Oh no, I mean the banana, it's... it's... It's grown like 4 inches taller Its like 1, 1 and a half inch taller.\n Its like one and  half inches. \n Okay what is that? Look. Its like 9 and a half.\n 10 and a half - 9, 10 and 12. That's 1, 2, 3  \n We're looking at the bananas, yeah ... wait that's half an inch Alright, so did you get that? Were the Cheetos  recorded? Okay, good. Alright, so now we've got... let's look here. Josh go  ahead and read number 9. Compare and record the results from all three fat  absorb- absorption- observations. Observations Observations, okay, so we're going to look at all three  here we've got our data laid out here. Look at your Cheetos. Um the first time Cheetos was eight and a half inches,  the second time it was 10 and a half inches, and the  last time it was 12. 12 centimeters. So what does that mean? Joseph what do you see when  you see those numbers going like that? Um its like growing because every time you check one its  like  a little bit bigger and it gets a little more inches on  and it gets a little bit more big.  So basically the longer that the Cheetos sat on the  paper towel,  the more fat and oil is absorbed into the paper towel,  right? Okay? So um Josh, if you'll just go ahead and write that down  about the Cheetos.  And Hailey, what did you notice about the next food?  The apples? Um, two times it stayed the same and one time it got  a little bit smaller.\n Just got a little bit? \n Yeah Okay, it says two are the same and one is just a little  bit different.  And that could have been just, um where is our centimeters?  It could have been just human error where we just sort  of measured a little bit off.  Okay? Um, 'cause if you look at this apple sample here,  there isn't really any coming out of the green  circle, is there?  So nothing was absorbed from the apple. Did you see that? Okay, alright? So if you'll add that to our list  that we've noticed, we observed.  Shemaire you look at those potato chips.  I'm going to leave that one here.  Tell us what the overall pattern was with the potato chips. The potato chips Talk real loud for me. Um ok, the potato chips, they, like, changed each time.  Like, the first time, it was 5, the second time it was  eight and a half and this time it was 7. And what are those that you are talking about?  what units of measure? Centimeters\n Centimeters, okay. So we want to make sure we get  centimeters written in on there okay? \n uh-huh Alright, so what does that tell you about potato chips? Um, that its not like that fat, it doesn't got that much  grease in it 'cause, pretty much it showed like, it was lower and then it got a little bigger  then it just got a little bigger. Okay, so comparing the three here, what do you notice?  Pretty much that this one has more fat than these two. It looks like with this observation, just this one here  in class today,  and later we're gonna do- we'll look at the food labels of  potato chips and Cheetos. But right now, just on our observations, it does look  like the Cheetos have more fat right now, okay?\n But when we start reading, its gonna be potato chips? \n Oh that leads us in \n  It's gonna be Cheetos! So go ahead, so um let's look at number 10,  read that for us Josh. What can you conclude from the observations and recorded  data?  Which snack has the most, or least amount of fat? So you all will come and discuss that together and then you can answer that question right there.  Put most and least. Fine, okay? I'd say the apples have the least amount of fat.  And the potato chips have the least... ... the apples have the least amount of fat, then the  potato chips second and the Cheetos is last. And why do you think that might be? Why do you  think the banana has expanded the most? Because its... - I don't think its because  of the fat in the bananas and getting in... Talk loud I don't think its because of fat with the bananas that's  getting oil on the paper towel, because bananas are pretty healthy and they don't really  normally have fat in them. Yeah, yeah Okay, so that's your background knowledge. You are aware  of that. What were you gonna say?\n It's like, its not fat or oil, its like its just water \n Maybe water   absorbed in it... What prediction would you make, if we were to let this sit  over night, to where like, the water would have time to dry up.  What would you predict this paper towel would look like  tomorrow? Let me go with Tray? It would be all wet and soggy.\n So you think it would actually be more wet? \n Yeah. \n Okay, Emily what do you think? Well I would think that the way it is now, that the paper  towels are gonna end up like that  and the bananas would get all... and more disgusting and... Okay, does anybody think that the banana might-  that the wet, watery part might dry up? Maybe I think it would expand a little bit more and then  start drying until the water is out of the banana and then the banana starts to dry out too. Okay, well alright. We'll actually leave that one  out and see, and we'll check on it tomorrow. And see what it's doing. And we'll kind of answer  our own question there, okay? Okay, wait we're not finished,  what do we say about the banana? You have to talk louder though The banana I guess - the banana, like expands  the wetness.  It expands a couple centimeters, like a half a centimeter. Good use of centimeters. I like how you're using  the actual mathematical term there.  The centimeter is good.  Okay while she is writing that, I'm going to let Tray  go ahead and read that next question,  Well, if you can see it.  Maddie, will you let him read that so we can kinda  be thinking while your finishing up there? Um, what can you conclude from the observ-  observation and recorded data?  What snack has the most most and least amount of fat? Well, um, as my opinion, I would think that, the  banana has more fat than the peanut butter and the least amount of fat would be the fudge. Okay, Josh? Well, I would think that the fudge has the least amount,  'cause it has the least amount of absorbed like, grease and fat. But the banana has like  ... all this oil, water and all that, like, sinking into it. Okay, Maddie? I think that the peanut butter has the most  amount of fat because um  like I said earlier, the bananas are more healthy  than the peanut butter and  it's probably just water and this is like oils and  salt and stuff,  making it more greasy and that's probably more  fat absorbing into the paper and  then the fudge hasn't had very much at all so  I would say it has the least amount of fat. I would agree with like most of y'all because the banana  and the peanut butter is like,  has like, a lot of wetness in it. And the fudge  has like, a little bit of wetness.\n Like a centimeter \n Yeah, about a centimeter. But also the bananas could have the least amount of fat  because they are healthier and that's probably just water. Compare the results to the original group hypothesis.  Our hypothesis is that the potato chips will  have the most fat. \n Talk loud Our Hypothesis is that the potato chips will  have the most fat.  Our group decided this after discussing Cheetos  versus potato chips deep fried and  adding salt and Cheetos are made out of cheese so  cheese is made out of milk from cows, which is healthy. Oh, wow, lots of thought went into that. Okay, so read that question again, how do we compare  our original hypothesis to what we've discovered  now in our research?\n We were wrong. \n Say that again. \n We were wrong. Okay, so according to our data, what did you find?  Why do you say we were wrong?\n Because, like the Cheetos, they had like  a bunch of fat, grease and stuff. \n  Talk louder And the potato chips, they like barely have any. They had some, but it wasn't quite what you were  thinking, right?\n What were you gonna say Josh, we're gonna  come right back to you. \n  No\n Yes Joseph?\n She thought it was the Cheetos,  which we thought it was that and afterwards now since  we found out that it was probably the cheese ... \n Talk loud\n When it gets stuck on you fingers, it's all wet and  oily and everything.  -  Okay\n No, she's the one that said cheese was healthy.\n Okay well think about it, some cheeses are healthy,  this is more of a dehydrated powdered cheese  added to the Cheetos, right?  Go ahead, Josh, what were you gonna say?\n She said that maybe the salt from the potato chips  could've dried up the grease, maybe. \n  Okay, Hailey? Pretty much what Josh said. It's the same. Okay, so you just agree with that?  So Josh, maybe  you could all just write down some of what you all discussed. About the change from what our prediction or our  hypothesis was to what we found now? Okay?  And Hailey if you want to go ahead and start some  of our discussion questions. Okay? Based on our discoveries from today,  what snack has less fat? Joseph?\n Um apples\n Claire? \n  Definitely apples.\n Josh?  \n Apples\n Yeah, apples.  When you go home today, what snack would you choose based on the data collected today and why? Joseph? I'd probably do the apples because it pretty much has  no fat which we learned, and  I'd probably want to eat no more Cheetos  since I found out how many fat was in them now. \n Never again? \n  Never \n Oh, you wouldn't live would you? \n Very good Hailey, say that again?\n  I wouldn't eat Cheetos very often You wouldn't eat Cheetos as much, but in  limited quantities, right?  Okay, very good. Shemaire which snack would  you choose? I'd probably have to say apples too because  they are healthy either way and  I love Granny Smith apples, they're my favorite. Oh good, good, healthy snack eater! I'm going to have to say now since we found out Cheetos,  how much fat it has.  Then we start thinking about how much fat is actually in there,  we probably don't know how much fat is in there. Right. Well we're going to look at those food labels  closer now that we've investigated these and see  which one really does have more fat,  the potato chips or the Cheetos.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 045 GENMC045.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.148177], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Shemaire"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Shemaire"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Josh"], ["NaN"], ["mumbles"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Claire"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Joseph"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Hailey"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW05", "TW08", "TW09", "TW15", "TW22", "TW24", "TW24TW09"]}, "101": {"text": "  Like, learning is supposed to be a privilege, not a burden. It's like... Supposed to be... Like, that's why we're America. We have the choice, you're not supposed to be forced to... do it.\n  Okay.\n  Um, but like, about them picking a random person, they might, they might not just go pick a random person if they have to vote, because, if they have to vote, then they're gonna go see that candidate, candidate's political beliefs are, and what he or she is gonna do for the country.\n  Okay. Trevor?\n  But, if um... they're not gonna know which one to pick if they're not educated, or, don't know about the person.\n  Okay.\n  What if they don't know how to read? In their researching. They don't know how to read.\n  Okay.\n  Do you want me to say my question?\n  Yeah, go, ask your question.\n  Okay, um... If only, like, when we don't have... the law, only 60 percent vote, so, how is that supposed to show what America really wants? How is that supposed to show what president we want, and what choices we wanna do?\n  But, if, we do get the other 40 percent that already don't wanna vote, then they would just pick one, and that still wouldn't be the, the will of the big United States.\n  And outta the 60 percent votes, you could just make your, uh, votes outta that.\n  What do you mean?\n  Like, the people that did vote, just, choose a person who did get the most votes.\n  But we wanna see what America as a whole really wants, not what a little over half of America wants.\n  Um, our founding fathers vote for the right to vote, for, for freedom, and so, I think we should use that wisely.\n  Okay, elaborate on that a little bit. Say that one more time.\n  Um, if our founding  fathers vote for the right to, or fought for the right to freedom, then, I think we should use that correctly.\n  So, you think, that, if the founding fathers looked at this law, they would say, 'this is not what we meant, when we said, you know, we want people to vote for our leaders', they didn't want us to force people, they still wanted it to be a freedom.\n  Didn't we like, like, have the law, for, like, trying to get the opinion of the whole population of America? The other 40 percent, it still, wouldn't be like, their decision, because they would just, pick one, they wouldn't really care. So, they're not really getting any difference, by not having the law.\n  But we're not forcing  them to do that, we're forcing them to help America.\n  So, you're forcing them...\n  Okay. Jackson, can you respond to that point?\n  Um. Yes, if you, like, if we don't force people to vote, then, maybe the poor, just can't make it there. And if we say, 'oh, you have to vote', then we, then we could like provide them transporation to get to there. Also, if poor people won't vote, that means rich people will vote, and they'll just... vote for the person who they believe is gonna keep them rich, and that they'd not go against that.\n  Do you think that that represents the majority of Americans, if only those, wealthy, or, at least, middle to upper class people are voting?\n  No.\n  No.\n  Because if the poor people don't vote, they're already poor, that's already bad enough, and they don't get to voice their opinion, and in a democracy, too. That's just even worse.\n  And that's a big segment of people, right? So, you're saying that, really, a lot of these people, maybe it's that it's not that they don't want to vote, it's that they don't have the opportunity, we need to provide some more... public, um, opportunities, like, opportunities like public transportation to allow them to vote, to make it easier. Okay?\n  'Cause it's, not only poor and uneducated people, it's just people that really don't care that much, and like, when making those people vote, like kind of what she said, they could... most, a lot of 'em could try and break the law, if you force them to vote. Because they just don't want to and they really don't care, and like, if there's somebody who has... who doesn't care but, they're being forced to vote, and they have a really busy job, and they have a lot going on, they wouldn't have time to research, or anything, and so they could, they would just have to go out there when they did have to vote, they'd just vote for someone, 'cause they never had any time to do any research or look at something about the... people to vote for.\n  Okay, let's come back to that point, 'cause I think we still have some questioners, who haven't... asked their question, who's, who's up next? Jaylen?\n  Um... you say there are, different ways to... give them their complete and to vote, but, what are those ways?\n  What'd she say? \n  Well, if you have, things...\n  Hold on. Let me, let me make sure they heard what you're saying. Say it again, but say it louder.\n  Okay. Um...  I say, it's different ways, to get them to vote, but what are those ways, that you get them to vote?\n  Does anybody have a ready response for that?\n  I can't hear her.\n  She's saying, you guys are saying there are better ways than compulsory voting laws, there's other and better ways, so, what are those ways?\n  Like, just because they're poor, doesn't mean they can't know that like, you can like, hang up posters, or like, get someone to hand out flyers or something. It doesn't have to be all electronic.\n  I'm not talking about poor people. \n  Well, she's saying...\n  It could help anybody, really, but...\n  Okay. Respond...\n  Well, but there are poor people that wanna vote, they don't have a chance to.\n  Excuse me? \n  Well, hold on, hold on a second. Hold on, hold on, 'cause I, I'm not sure that y'all are understand what her point is. Say your point again.\n  Um...\n  With some passion.\n  With passion? \n  'Cause that'll make your point.\n  Just scream at her.\n  WHAT are different WAYS that  you can get the American people to vote?\n  Besides.\n  Besides posters, because a poster's not gonna...\n  It's compulsory voting.\n  And besides these laws, what are some better ways to make people vote?\n  Well y'all keep sayin' go and like, pick up people, and providing transportation, well instead of doing that to make them vote, you might as well just do that so that they might have the opportunity to vote rather than having to vote.\n  So you don't necessarily have to have these laws, to still provide some public services to encourage people to vote. Okay.\n  And like, we all know that we get those like, very long phone calls that are like, vote for this person because, they're gonna do all this stuff, and like, that then, like, someone who gets that phone call could actually think about it, and then like, 'maybe I should vote for that person', and you see the big... billboard thingies that have the big names on it, and all the signs in the yards, and so, that could make you think, 'well, maybe I should go vote, since... all these people are saying we should vote for that person.\n  So you, you think they should have an increase in... in publicizing elections, we should, we should have more advertising when elections come up? Okay. Okay, \n  Well, if you were to like, have election...  um... that would like, cost a lot of money, to have like a lot of, um... transportation going around. So, um, and it's like, not a lot of people are gonna use that transportation, then why, just like,  so, why not just make them vote, cause, they already have public transportation out there.\n  Okay. Let's top on that one, we'll come back to it, because we've got one more question.\n  Uh, if we didn't  require people to vote, what would happen if... what would happen if like, nobody voted... decided to vote?\n  Say that one more time.\n  If we didn't require people to vote, what would happen if like, nobody decided to vote?\n  Or a small majority of people.\n  Okay.\n  Well, people have different opinions, like, some people think that we put a voice out into the government, and say what we want, and then, some people think, like, that, we... that every vote counts. And... basically, there's... like, five... three million people in America, and I don't think every single one of them would not vote.\n  Okay. Any other responses?\n But we already have 60 percent voting. I mean... and, so... we know every, some--people are going to vote. It's just the people who... don't care about politics, and, just, like, when we had the survey, people, a lot of people didn't vote for the midterm election. But, on the other hand, some people did. We're always gonna have a group that doesn't vote, and a group that is voting, and if you make them vote they're not gonna care. Even, as more, as they did when they weren't voting.\n  Okay, I'm gonna go ahead and open up the floor, because we've asked all the questions, so, pretty much anybody can answer or ask, but let's try and keep it on the same topic, so, if you are raising your hand, make sure you're responding to what the last person said. Okay? Uh, let's see. Connor.\n  Oh, like you said, every vote counts, but like, we need more people to vote so we know that, like, we know the exact number, of like, who is going to be the president, or, in the House of Representatives, or the Senate. So that theres a better chance that they will get elected.\n  Okay, so, we need a more accurate portrayal of what people think. We need more people to vote so we really know what Americans think. Okay.\n  Well, I agree with Connor, but, going back to what everybody over there is saying, they're all saying, 'oh, they, they won't care, they wont, they wont care or anything and, they wont pay attention to what happens', but, I mean, if we can... make like... some kind of exception for like, special needs people, for the deaf and blind and... then um... also, we can get people to stand out in front of a booth, and once they'll go, get there, you can do a speech about... both candidates, and their ups and downs.\n  Okay, so you're saying actually have, people at the voting polls that are kind of breaking down the two sides. Maybe for those people who didn't take the time to research it. Okay.\n  Um, one of y'all keep sayin', we keep sayin' that they might not care, but like, in actuality, if you, if someone doesn't care, and you force them to care, not only is that kinda like, convincing, like, brainwashing them, it's also, if you force someone to do something, they're not going to want to anymore. So that wouldn't be helping anything.\n  So you're saying it's, it's gonna actually make them more bitter, toward voting, if you force them to do it. Okay.\n  And, someone said that it's gonna be for the good of the country, for making them vote, but, if they could choose a bad, a bad person, 'cause, it wouldn't be for the good of the country then.\n  Okay, so if you force them to vote, and then they go and vote for a bad person, that's not gonna be helping the country at all. Okay. Jason.\n  Um, like, um, you could, um, for those people that can't vote, or um, you could... put the... they could put the polls, the voting polls near... where those people, uh, live, and um, so that, they could like, if they can't drive there in a car, they could just walk there, because it'd only be like, maybe a block down their way.\n  Okay.\n  You could like, open a public train, like, so they don't have to pay to go as much.\n  And then make it free?\n  Yeah.\n  For that day? Okay. Alexandra, what do you think?\n  Alright, um, well like, making people vote is gonna make them more interested in like, the country, and then they'll actually care, 'cause like, they're not gonna wanna like, break a law, and so then they're gonna actually care about the country, and so they won't just be choosing a random person, they're gonna actually start caring and, start thinking about who they should choose.\n  You really think if, if we force them to vote, then they, they will become more interested in politics and they'll go out and research it. Okay.\n  Like, just like, if you make some, make everyone vote, then it's really not gonna change their opinion, they're still gonna have... like, they're still gonna... not really care as much as the person that would go out and vote without being forced. So you're really not getting an accurate... number of what they think they want, because they still... just because you're making them vote doesn't mean they're gonna... necessarily pick the right person.\n  Okay.\n  Um, they're always saying like that, we still have this 40 percent that haven't voted, well, everyone, like even the poor people and the uneducated, well everyone knows that there's a presidential election, or some kind of election going on, you can't, it's like, impossible to not know about it, and so really, it's their choice... that they didn't vote, most of the people who aren't poor but they're like middle class  like, they won't make the choice to vote, if...\n  Okay. So you're,\n  A lot of people have made the choice to vote.\n  So you're saying, the presidential election, everybody knows about it, everybody probably has an opinion because it's all over the place, so, and 40 percent are not, obviously those 40 percent know that they don't wanna go and vote.\n  They've chosen not to vote. Most of them have chosen not to vote.\n  Okay.\n  You know, I have to disagree with you, when you say that if we just tell people to vote, they'll just pick a random person. What I think is that, if people are being told to vote, they'll just go in there and say, 'well, if I'm being told to vote, I just might as well just pick someone good'. You'd think that they would actually try and think about something before they vote, like the term 'look before you leap'.\n  So you think, if they have to go to the effort of voting, they're at least gonna think about it. They're at least gonna form an opinion. Okay.\n  Um, like, you put, of, um, you  you could like, make the offices, make the person take the day off, and like, sort of give them the day off.\n  And that's...\n", "filename": ["Copy of 101 SSH EA 101 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0468017], "annotations": [["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Jackson"], ["Teacher"], ["Jackson"], ["Teacher"], ["Jackson"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Jaylen"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Jaylen"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Jaylen"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Jaylen"], ["Teacher"], ["Jaylen"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Jaylen"], ["Teacher"], ["Jaylen"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW08"]}, "106": {"text": " Why do they keep getting colder? Why do they keep getting warmer?\n They add water to it.\n Maybe they add water to it. Okay, what else?\n The thermometer?\n What about the thermometer?\n They could have lights.\n Lights, well did they turn off the lights afterwards? Okay, at this point, at that point?\n Maybe after they took their first temperature they took out the thermometer.\n Maybe they took out the thermometer and that has something to do with it. The thing is, ultimately are we gonna know what they did? Unless I was video taping you during that whole process. There are a couple things I wanna point out here in a second. I think several of the ideas are possibilities. What happens if you put your thermometer into the water initially. What do you need to do? As soon as you put it in there what do you need to do? Do you immediately start taking readings?\n Yes.\n Everybody agrees? We immediately start taking readings. As soon as we put it down in there, like the first second we start taking readings? We take a thermometer, put it in hot water and immediately start taking readings? \n Like, what's the starting point and the next temperature would be whether it increased or decreased from that point.\n Okay, so we need a starting point. What were you going to say?\n If you put it in there, like if you had it at a certain temperature and you put it in cold water it would still be reading room temperature. It wouldn't change immediately...\n Yes, so it goes 22, 21, 19, 18... It's going down \n So, what could have been the issue here?\n They took it at the very beginning.\n Good, good. They just didn't wait long enough. Look at this one. I saw this in one particular group. Because, by the way, you guys realize you were doing some very, very different things, right? As we were doing, and collecting this data there were some major differences. What could have happened? What was going on here? Just the obvious stuff. Observation, what's the difference in the pattern? Yes, Ma'am?\n The hot water is like consistent like it's just gonna stay at the current temp.\n Hot water stays hot? Right? Cold water is doing what?\n Increasing in temperature.\n It's increasing in temperature. The room temperature water is doing what?\n It stays the same.\n With this same group I just happened to catch this. Cold water. Luke warm water. The person was doing this. This is the warm water.\n Oh *laughs* body heat.\n Keeping it warm.\n Insulating it.\n What was happening? \nTransfer of heat.\n We're gonna be doing a lot of labs over the next several weeks. This doesn't seem like a big deal, right? I mean, would you have noticed somebody just sitting there going like this? You've gotta start thinking like scientists, though.  Because that could be a huge deal if we're doing something with temperature, right?  Okay, good. Well, the obvious - or the observation. What's going on with the cold water?\n It's increasing.\n It's increasing, okay. Luke warm water?\n Staying the same. The hot water?\n It's getting cold.\n It's getting cold. Okay. What's different from the first slide?\n Yes?\n The hot water went past the room temperature of the cold water.\n Did it actually happen to somebody?\n Did it actually happen? Yeah. Let's do this first. Let's go back to here, what word would you use to describe what's going on here? What's all this heading towards?\n Room temperature.\n It's all headed towards room temperature. There's a fancy word that starts with an E.\n We may have talked about this last year.\n The fancy word - The idea, there's a word I want you to walk away with. The word is?\n  Equilibrium.\n Okay, how does this show equilibrium? Rebecca, how does this show equilibrium? With the hot water, how does this show equilibrium?\n Rebecca.\n It's Sierra. It all goes toward the same, it's kind of like the hot is increasing and it's temperature-\n The hot is what?\n I'm sorry I meant the cold. The cold is increasing in it's temperature and then it's going towards the room temperature.\n It's going towards room temperature. The hot is?\n Decreasing in temperature and it's going towards the room temperature also.-\n Is this what we would expect? All right, so what happened? Because I don't have any idea. What happened here? Yes?\n In some places of the room there are places where there is a lot of air coming out? So maybe that one cup was under a lot of air.\n We do have some powerful air vents. What do you guys think? Is that-- that's a huge amount. Any other ideas? Yeah?\n I think they accidentally read one of the cold cups and marked the temperature  down for a hot cup.\n Is it possible there's human error here? And they just... they looked at the wrong thing?\n Maybe when they were pouring the water into the cups maybe they accidentally mixed the cold up with the hot.\n So there's mixing the water, thermometers--maybe just read them wrong. So you guys think some kind of human error, then? Yes? Yes?\n Let's go back to this and let's go to the next step. Kind of like what we've done in the past. I want you to think of this at an atomic level, a molecular level what's happening here. In order to do that, we're gonna play with BBs. I've got enough sets of BBs here, each group is gonna have a set of BBs. All right. So group up a little closer together. Alright, so you two maybe go around... you guys. Here's what I want you to do. Within your group one half have one set  Actually, the two of you can...  Marcus... Good, here's what I want you to do. The BBs will be what?\n  Atoms.\n Atoms and molecules. Okay, are atoms and molecules just sitting?\n No.\n When we add energy are they gonna go faster or slower?\n  Faster.\n When we take away energy they're going to?\n  Go slower.\n Or, rather than take away, when they release it. I'm gonna give you a couple minutes. I want you to talk within your groups. I want you to be able to do three things. I'm gonna call people up here in a second. I'm gonna stick you on the overhead so everybody can see your BBs. I want you to be able to simulate the top line, the middle line and the bottom line. So, getting cooler, room temperature, staying the same and getting warmer. I also want... kind of a bonus would be to use both how would you show something going into equilibrium? All right, talk to each other real quick. Some are getting cooler. Some are getting hotter. Some are staying the same temperature, and how would you show equilibrium? I'll give you about a minute or two. \n All right everybody. Take a look at your BBs. Hands off BBs.  I got a volunteer. What were the BBs again?\n  Atoms.\n Atoms. And we're trying to show what?\n Movement towards equilibrium.\n Movement towards equilibrium. What? Energy-- energy and movement how those go together. Energy transfer is kind of a fancy way of saying it. Okay, everyone take a look at the chart. Here's the graph. Show me the top line.  And tell me what you're doing.\n Make it faster, because it's hotter. It decreased because it's going down and getting less heat.\n Okay, so it's gonna start-- the BBs are going to start going fast and then...\n Slowing down.\n Slowing down. Could you show us... Yeah, we're in an awkward spot.  Getting warmer, the bottom part of that chart.\n At first it goes slower and as it gets warmer the molecules move faster because it's getting warmer.\n Thank you. I'm gonna do room temperature. I think room temperature would be this, and it stays the same. Kenny what? Well, it's gotta be moving, right? Room temperature would just be this and I have to do what? \n Oh, I probably should have picked the same group. The two of you working together, how could you show us equilibrium? Of going towards equilibrium.\n She's going to do cold.\n Okay, and you're going to do hot. Okay good now, time out. What did you do? Or were you not done?\n I started out fast and she started out slow.\n Why did you start out fast?\n Because I was hot.\n And you were?\n Cold.\n Cold. And Lauren, what did you do?\n \n The same speed, which was getting close to equilibrium.\n Show us one more time. Good. Who disagrees? Nobody? Good. Thank you. Here we go, keep going. A couple more things real fast. Most of you guys had this going about six, seven, eight, nine... anywhere from six, seven to 15 minutes of data. If we did this for an hour, what would this look like?\n They would eventually all be on the same line for a while.\n And it would be pretty boring. So this would keep going-- well, what would be the lowest point?\n Room temperature.\n This would be the highest point? Then this would still continue the same. What's the word?\n  Equilibrium.\n Here's how all this started. This whole lab that you guys put together and created. It's a demo. Here's how it all started. I asked you a question yesterday-- a couple days ago. Jar, bag with some water in it, scarf, although I told you gloves, and then aluminum foil. We came up, we felt all four of these things. And you made a predic... Well, the question was, \"If we put these outside, left them there overnight, you look outside your window--\"\n", "filename": ["Copy of 106 SCI EA 106.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.166954], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW05", "TW06", "TW16", "TW18", "TW22"]}, "042": {"text": " Guys ready?\n  Yes.\n Okay number one, start, give your idea. Read the word, give your idea of the definition.\n Okay what's your word? \"Soldier,\" okay and okay you're gonna give your idea? What's your idea of soldier?\n I think tax is like when you buy something like, the extra, yeah.\n One person at a time, it goes in order, so what's your idea?\n Like a government, so\n Okay you need help. Have you ever seen a soldier before?\n Taxes for me are...\n Where?\n Money or something, I don't know.\n And what does a soldier do, do you know? Okay, he fights for freedom, very good. So it's someone who fights for freedom, that's your definition. What's your definition?  Very good, you guys keep going, you're doing great. Let me see how this group is doing over here. Where are you guys at? Have you already given your definition?\n Yes.\n Okay did you already give yours? Did you already give yours? Did you give yours yet? What do you think it is? What's the word?\n Patriot.\n Very good, patriot, and did you listen to their ideas?\n Yeah.\n Okay and you need thinking time? Okay. And remember, you can build on their ideas too. Louder, a little bit louder.\n I think it means to... I think it's\n You've heard it in a song, that word?\n Yeah.\n Yeah? So someone was a patriot in a song? What did it mean, in the song, if they were a patriot? How did they feel?\n They feel sad?\n Sometimes sad, you can feel sad if you're a patriot. On 9/11, when the planes crashed through the buildings, people were sad because they were patriots, they loved their country, right? And they were sad to see that. Can you be happy if you're a patriot too?\n Yeah.\n When would you be happy if you were a patriot? You're a patriot for the United States, right? Or even for the country your family originally came from. How do you feel about that country if you're a patriot?\n Happy.\n Happy, and do you not like them or do you love them, that country?\n I love them.\n You love them, okay, so a patriot is someone that what?\n You could be more excited or happy?\n Okay and how do you feel in your heart about the country? Do you dislike it or do you like it a lot?\n I like it a lot.\n Okay, alright. And I didn't hear your ideas but can you guys get together and agree, or do you want to look it up first? Should we look it up, to make sure we have the right idea? Okay everyone let's get into our books and let me make sure you have your papers too. There are your papers too, goodness Miss Bryant got ahead of herself. Just in case you forget the direction, the page is 493 to check, go all the way to your glossary page 493 to check.  Let me see what you guys have, let's see. Okay and where does that money go to, do you guys know?\n The government.\n Oh, did you look it up to make sure that it was perfect, your definition? Okay let's look it up real quick and make sure because it looks pretty good but let's just make sure. That's my fault because I got busy with table one and didn't give you this paper so on page 493 there you go, 493 it starts but then you have to go in ABC order, right? And let's look it up and make sure you have the right definition. You guys are looking up tax, that's right.\n A \"T.\"\n \"T, T, T,\" tax, good, like the way you're using your resource, 'cause that was one of the things we said we're gonna do, is use our resource.  Okay, what did you get? Do you know where to read it?  Good, I like the way that you worked together and helped, so, Les, what did you have?\n  Taxes for new money\n To where, where does that money go?\n  The government.\n Okay so let's add that. Who started this?\n Her.\n Me.\n Okay so you wanna add that? You guys all agree?\n  Yeah.\n You feel good? 'Cause it's not just any money for anybody, it's money to the?\n  Government.\n Okay, so let's add that, go ahead. Good, I like the way you used your resource and checked it. \n A patriot is a person who loves and supports\n their country.\n And that's kinda what you guys said anyway right, you said they love, is that what you guys said 'cause I wasn't here earlier, did you say stuff like that? Oh great. Are all of you patriots? Do you love your country?\n Loves and supports their country. \n Okay, now what happens? It goes to person\n Number two.\n Number two, you get to read it and they're gonna repeat the question, right? Okay there you go and here's the directions just in case you forget.\n What is it like? Describe it.\n Okay, let's repeat.\n  What is it like? Describe it.\n You guys, did you repeat? Let's repeat.\n  What is it like? Describe it.\n Okay so before we write, you get to start, so what is it like? Can you describe a patriot?\n  Yes.\n Okay what is it like?\n  It's like\n Or who is he like, 'cause they're a person, right?\n  Is like someone who will respect their country.\n Who's that? Can you think of a person? Oh I'm sorry honey. Can you think of a person? Who's an example? Let's see, describe it, so when you think a patriot, okay they support their country, what else?\n  Respect the government.\n Very good, those are good words, so you could put that there, but we're not gonna write yet, right? Because we're gonna give everyone a chance. What would you say? What do you think of when you think of patriot and you would describe it if you had to describe it to someone.\n Patriot is soldier.\n That's a great example. What about you?\n Someone respect every city everywhere and respect to everybody to not be...\n Very nice.\n Can it be also honoring?\n I like that vocabulary word, honor, how do you guys feel about honoring? What do you say about respecting? Okay, alright, you get to write first. You write one then it'll go around and each of you can write one in a box, okay, every one of you write something in the box. If you need help, ask your table for help, right? Okay, good. How's it goin'? \n If something costs $7.99, it's plus, like, tax.\n Plus like, a dollar.\n Yeah, a dollar.\n Taxes come in like, a dollar or two dollars.\n Just put taxes like, extra money.\n Great, okay now you. Alright so we said it protects the country, fights, what did you say when you gave ideas?\n Fights for his, risks his life for others.\n What do you guys think, risks his life for others? Should we include that?\n  Yeah.\n Yeah? Okay, that's good. Good, okay and then you're gonna write one too, right? \n  What else makes that \"kuh\" sound, a \"C\" and what else?\n \"K.\"\n You guys agree? Okay let's put it down, a \"K.\" Risks. I like the way you're helping each other, that's great. Alright. Very nice. Okay and you get to put an idea down too, we wanna make sure everyone gets a chance. So put your idea down, you can put it in any of the boxes because there's room, here, here, or here. No that's fine because we're all gonna keep going, yep, so I want you to put your idea that you said earlier here, here, or here for describing the soldier. Do you remember what you said? What'd you say?  Very good, so put that down. \n Tax is more money for the government.\n You can just look in the book.\n Just put tax is extra money for the government.\n We already have that.\n Oh I know, tax is extra money for the government. Tax is, I-S for extra money for the government. \n Okay so has everyone given an example? Okay so whose turn was it to write, your turn? So you write first and make sure everyone gets to write one in.\n Tax is extra money for government. Money, money, money. M-O-N-E-\n Yes, did you guys give your examples first?\n Yeah.\n Before you wrote? Okay good. Do your parents pay taxes?\n  Yes.\n They do. Everyone pays taxes, that could be an example. I have a question. Do your parents pay taxes? Everyone pays taxes, don't they? Do we have to pay taxes when we get gasoline?\n Yes.\n Yes, do we have to pay taxes when we buy a video game?\n Yeah.\n Everything.\n Yes, everything except for food. Food they don't tax, isn't that nice of them?  Okay and what does the tax go to support?\n The government?\n The government and the schools, right? And the firemen, the policemen, good, okay so now you have some more. Great conversation, great conversation. \n Was Thomas Jefferson a patriot?\n Martin Luther King.\n Martin Luther King was a patriot, good. Who else was a patriot?\n Abraham LIncoln?\n Yes, okay let's take turns though, who's turn is it now? Who's a patriot? Someone who loves their country.  Are you a patriot? Could you say \"I am a patriot?\"\n I'm a patriot.\n Very good, there's an example. Can you think of someone who's a patriot?\n A soldier.\n A soldier. Why's a soldier a patriot? Why do you think they love their country so much? What are they willing to risk?\n Their heart?\n Their heart and their what? They could, what could happen if they got shot?\n They die.\n Yeah, they're risking their lives, so they really love their country, they're really patriots aren't they? Very good, so you ready to write? Who's turn is it? No that's okay, so whoever's next, so if it's your turn you go. Oh okay, so it's your turn so you get to write an example of a patriot. Try to write in a complete sentence, I bet you can. \n You just draw pictures. \n", "filename": ["Copy of 042 ENL EMC 042edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.135186], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Boy"], ["NaN"], ["Boy"], ["NaN"], ["Boy"], ["NaN"], ["Boy"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02"]}, "041": {"text": "Okay. But before you check over what  you need to make sure you do? All of it. Get it completed, right?  Okay, awesome. So your goal would be to... Get homework completed. \nWonderful! Okay! Excellent! Okay! Now I brought  some extra markers and stuff here because  I know you're a visual learner, that you do a good job remembering things that you figured out on your... learning styles test. So this is for you to do. You can choose any colors to make  it look however you want. Okay? So you've got your goal and then we need to figure  out why is that goal important. So your goal is to Get all homework done. Excellent. And why is that important? Because when  you're in fourth grade you don't get all  your homework done and you on fence and when you get on the fence, I've been there  a couple of times and is not very fun, and for the good achievement you get to go to Hot Wheels. hmm... So if you don't do your homework, You're on a boring fence. Okay! You have to stand  by the fence at recess. And if you do do your homework, you go to Hotshots. Homework Hotshots. And that is... What do you have to do to  qualify for Homework Hotshots? Do all your homework for all the...  Oh! Wow!! So... All your homework  throughout the nine weeks and then you get to go.. get to be a Homework Hotshot, which means you  go to Hot Wheels and enjoy the day skating. Excellent! Okay! So you just brought  up a good point. umm... So this goal is important because not only do you  not want to stand by the fence, and you want to  be a Homework Hero. What's going to happen  if you do your homework? You go to Hot Wheels. You go to Hot Wheels and what do you think... What effect is that  going to have on your report card here? If you're doing all your homework,  what's going to happen to those grades? You get all the grades go up. like the 100 - 200. That's right. Very good. All right. So, go ahead, write that down. Why  you think homework is important. Excellent So this goal is important because  you can always get good grades. and homework is  a way that teachers help the students  reinforce the things that they are learning in class. So that's an excellent  way to get good grades. Okay! So we know our goal  and we know why it's important. So let's think about what kind of rewards we're  going to get for reaching that goal. You get achievement awards. You go in a limo with the principal. And you go out to eat. and Hot Wheels too, right? So those are some long-term goals over the next nine weeks. You get to complete your  homework the next nine weeks. You get to go to Hot Wheels and might even be on  the principal's honor roll to take the limo ride. Pretty cool, huh? Okay! So that's here.  We've got Don't forget one thing, that you get to drink soda while you're going. You do? I didn't know that. I've never been in there. I've never been in the limo, but I heard. Oh, my goodness! Well, that certainly is a nice incentive, something to motivate, huh? Good! So that's kind of  a long-term motivation. We've got to work  hard all these nine weeks to accomplish that, right? Okay! So we've got here. When I meet my  goal for the quarter, Quarter is another way of saying  the nine week time period. you will what? What do you get to do if you do all your homework  over the nine weeks? I will go in a limo. Well, that's for principal's honor roll, which is definitely an option. What's specific for homework? umm... When I meet my goal, for the quarter,  I will go to Hot Wheels. Go to Hot Wheels.  Awesome! Excellent. So the nine weeks sometimes it can feel like long way away, can't it? Okay! Because nine weeks is not easy. They are not easy  to do your homework Because it's a long  time before you go to Hot Wheels and we only  have eighteen weeks in school. So it's easier sometimes to stay motivated  and work towards a goal if you have some incentives that come on  more of a short-term basis. Meaning that instead  of waiting all nine weeks to go to Hot Wheels,  which you will get to do, if you meet your goal. Let's think of something that  we can do maybe, once a week. That would be  a good incentive for you Study. Okay! Well, studying is  part of your homework plan. Let's say that you study and you turn all your... you do all your homework and at the end of the week  when I check in with you, when I check in with Miss. Butler, and I check in with your granny, and I'd say, So how did Annamarie do? Did she  get all her homework done? mm hmm.. And they say- Yes, she did. What do you think might be something that you're willing to work towards here at school that would be  a reward once a week? I will come to you  and I will help you. You'd like to help me?  All right. So could we agree that let's say, I check in on Fridays with your teacher and your granny and you to find out-  did she do her homework? What are they going  to tell me? -Yes. Yes And then on Fridays you  get to come and help me. mm hmm.. That'd be wonderful. Now I teach a first grade class every day at 12:10. I know you do a really good  job helping out at home with your niece But she... I do not get to see her Monday, Tuesday,  Wednesday, Thursday But on Friday, I do. Because my mom...  My mom watches her. And sometimes when my sister and I and the baby's not here we actually look at photos of her because we really miss her and  we talk to her on phone. Awesome! She's lucky  to have an aunty like you. Awesome! Well I know because you do  such a good job caring for her that you'd be  an excellent helper for me and my first graders. Will that be  a good goal for you? Okay! So our next section here. Can you read this? When I meet my goal  for the week, I will get to go to... go to Hot Wheels, I think. Well, Hot Wheels is  for the whole nine weeks. But each week.. Remember our... What we're working towards on  Friday, that you get to come... Help you. Right. So you get to  come help Miss. Charles.  on Fridays Okay! You have very nice handwriting. Thank you. Okay! \nSo do you. Thanks. Okay. So this goal is something that you're in charge of, right? You're in control  of achieving this goal. But you're not in it alone. Because there's of a lot of people  who want to see you reach that goal. and to see you doing an awesome job at school. So who are some of the people the adults in your life  who are on your team who can be helpers for  you as you reach this goal. My grandma, my aunty,  my uncle, my mom and my sister. Wonderful!  You have a lot of people. So these are people at home that can help you  reach your goal, all right? So let's go ahead and put those  down for supporters at home. Awesome! All right. So you've  got a lot of people supporting you at home. I've got five. And how about here at school? Who's on your team? Miss. Butler and Miss Charles. You've got it girl.  I can't wait to support you on this goal. Okay! So the people  who can help me at school is Miss. Charles Is it okay if I put in Miss. Ficker? my assistance teacher,  because she helps too. Definitely. That's a great person to add. And so are you. Thank you. Okay! I just realized something. What's that? All these teachers  name has a \"R\" in it. Miss. Charles,  Miss. Butler, Miss. Ficker. It's a good attention  to detail you have there. Okay! So we know  that our goal is to get all my homework completed. Okay! And it's important because you can always get good grades. Excellent. Now on the short-term if you're doing a great job getting  your homework done every week. Each week you will get to come help... come help  Miss. Charles on Friday. Excellent. And I will know that  you're doing a great job because... you can ask Miss. Butler, my grandma and me. That's right. Okay. And over the whole nine weeks when you do a good job getting all that homework done what's your reward? I get to go to Hot Wheels. Awesome. And then although you're  the one in charge of this goal, there's a lot of  people on your team. Who are those people  on your team from home? My Mama, my granny, my sister, my Uncle TJ and my aunty  People on you're side. All right! And then when you're  here at school, who's on your team? Miss. Charles, Miss. Butler, Miss. Ficker Awesome. All right. So what do you think? How's the school going to go? It's going to be great,  because I will follow all of these. Good. and I'm here to help, okay? All right.  Well, I think the first step towards achieving this goal is to make sure that we  manage our time really well. And I know we  talked a little bit before about kind of your month. We looked at  the month of February and figured out what big things you have coming up. What portions of  the day you spend here at school or at Church, and what you do, how you help  out taking care of your niece. So that's the month of February. So what we're going to do  today is really focus on this week and make a plan. So what I've done here is based on the information  you told me before, we've got this week starting with today Monday, February 7th and you will notice I've the time of  day all the way from 6 in the morning throughout the day till Yeah, 10 at night. So I have these spaces blocked off So what are you usually doing Monday, Wednesday,  Friday from 7 to 4? Come to school. You're at school, right? So this whole area Is school? Is school. That's right. You're here at school. Will you write school? \nSure. Sometimes it's easy for  me if I just draw a line to show that. Like that. Okay. School. Okay! So knowing that you're in school  from 7 to about 4 O'clock, and we also need  to think about some other regular things that  you do during the week. So you told me before that...\n", "filename": ["Copy of 041 SCECYA041.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.305872], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW10"]}, "040": {"text": "  Okay. Look at your music. We are doing four parts, obviously. With them, take just a general idea for the whole thing. Raise your hand if you see or have any eighth notes in the whole song. Raise your hand if you ever sing eighth notes. Sopranos, where do you have eighth notes? Shelby, tell me.\n  Measure nine.\n  Say it really loud so they all hear you.\n  Measure nine.\n  Measure nine, very good. Audrey, where do you have eighth notes?\n  Measure thirteen.\n  Thirteen, good. Reese, where do you have eighth notes?\n  Measure nine and measure...\n  Measure nine and thirteen.  Hey, what do you notice about the soprano part and the bass part, then? Same rhythm. Almost the same rhythm all the way through. Tenors, where do you have eighth notes? Braden.\n  Twenty-one and twenty-two.\n  Twenty-one and twenty-two.  So, getting toward the very, very end. Altos, tell us something about your part rhythmically. Raise your hand. Give me a summation of what you do. Jamie.\n  We don't have any.\n  You don't have any at all? You only have quarter notes, half notes and some whole notes. So, how many beats does a half note take up, everybody?\n  Two.\n  Two, make sure you last long enough through that and then look up at the whole notes. Solf\u00e8ge, what key are we in? Where is Do? Brady.\n  F.\n  F major. So, the first pitch that the altos have is...\n  Do.\n  Do. Sopranos, what's your starting pitch?\n  Mi.\n  Basses, what's your starting pitch?\n  Do.\n  Tenors?\n  Sol.\n  Very good. Look at it for a second, there are some jumps in the very beginning. They don't mess around, right away we've got some eighths and some intervals. Chant on solf\u00e8ge, your part. One and two and three and four and... \u266a  \u266a Very good. Go on. \u266a  \u266a Two, three, four. On the second to last measure on the first page, bassists and altos will move. Stepwise, motions, so you'll--  they both go up one step. Be aware of that. Notice that we have some repetition. Do you see some patterns that are coming back? So, if you miss it the first time, you get a second shot. Where if you get it right the first time, remember what it sounds like so you can do it again. Continuing, second page. One, two, three and chant. \u266a  \u266a Freeze. Let's go back and join the basses with us at measure nine. Do, re, mi. Everyone, measure nine, and... \u266a  \u266a Okay. Sopranos, careful, it might screw up your voice. Why did you have an issue there? Why did you miss it?\n  It's a skip.\n  Because it's a skip in the melody? And why else? A practical reason.\n  Here to here.\n  Because it's hard for you to look from the edge of the page down to the next one. Top of the next page, measure seventeen. A little faster, and go. Sorry, seventeen. Sopranos, fa; altos, la; tenors, fa; basses, fa. Ready? Hey, everybody has fa, that might be a good place to find the measure.\n  La.\n  This will help. You're right, sorry, except the altos. Listen right there when you're actually singing, for that, and go. \u266a  \u266a You'll have to hold this for a very long time. Go back to the beginning. The rule is number six. Jesse, repeat the last step. The last step.\n  Oh, never quit singing.\n  Never quit singing. Look up, find your keys points. Okay. Second key. \u266a Do mi so mi do so do \u266a \u266a  \u266a Sing your starting note. \u266a  \u266a One, two, three, four. \u266a  \u266a Good. Now, I have two minutes to try to fix and try to correct, to do as much as we can to do a little bit better with this. Take a second and look through the piece and hear it go by in your heads. Do a quick run-through, because it's hard to know. I cant remember what I missed, I'm still freaking out about the whole thing. Take a minute, replay it in your head. Find areas where there were problems for you. Overall, you did extremely well. You listened to each other. You could hear that it sounded like music. If you weren't sure about an interval, you would sing it and then you would go, \"Oh, this is right yes,\" and you were affirmed. And I think you got more confident as you went along. Problem areas. Raise your hands if you had one. Chelsea.\n  My problem I had was with measure seventeen.\n  Seventeen. Sopranos, do to fa, that's a like a little bit of a tricky leap and some of you hesitated a little bit there. So, then you heard it, and you were able to go on, and then I liked when you got it again when you got back to nineteen. Finding fa, that's a strange function in the music. Yes, Patrick.\n  Measure nineteen, fa to la.\n  Okay. nineteen, fa to la. Just making sure that you know where you're moving. Fa to la? Where? Oh, nineteen. Yes, sorry. My eyes were at seventeen. Good. Bass hands. Excellent, thank you. Grant, where?\n  Twenty.\n  Twenty? Yes, and what did you do?\n  I couldn't figure out the notes, I mean I couldn't figure out the .\n  I think it surprises you because you move up by a step. You were fine, so, la, and the ti, you weren't willing to actually sing ti, because it's not very often that you sing it. Stepwise motion, so, la, ti, do. You did an excellent job, basses, throughout, then returning to so and do when you had it. You had some issues with fa and la. Colin.\n  Six and seven. Where we were going from la to fa, and then back to do, and then we had an eighth notes. Because of that...\n  Okay. So, being aware of when you have eighth notes. And, chances are there isn't ever a point where you have eighth notes that other people don't. So, when you hear it, then you can move with them, and it's always by step when you have eighth notes. And it's always ascending. So, you don't have to worry about going down anywhere, but, yes, fa and la continue to be icky. I didn't time it. We have to sing it again. I'm so sorry. Okay, so we fixed the things that we missed. We're going a little faster, so it sounds like music, and not just this exercise. Listen across the room to each other.  \u266a Do, mi \u266a  You stayed very well in tune. \u266a Do, mi, so, mi, do, so, do \u266a Set your key. \u266a  \u266a Remember, you always sing with the very best tone that you possibly can. If you look up, basses, I'm trying to help you out some with my hand signs every so often. Sing your first note please. \u266a  \u266a One, two, three, four. \u266a  \u266a Have a seat. And now evaluate yourselves comparing the first reading to the second. That means you need to think about how well you did the first time versus how well you did the second time, and if you haven't had any thoughts or wanted to share anything yet, it's time, because this is opinion time, and there's no wrong. The room is going to tip over from the hands on this side. There are four sections. Jamie.\n  Well, sometimes they're like a step away from each other, but something, like, I know they're like one long  and sometimes I .\n  Okay. So, there are a couple little slips with stepwise motion that time. Okay, Hannah.\n  I thought the sopranos the first time did a lot better than the second time.\n  I would agree. The first time you did better than the second. There are a couple of reasons for this. Raise your hand if you feel like, when you think back on how well you've done both times you did better the first time. Why? Why? Emily.\n  Because you were so focused and trying to get it right, so the second time we've already gone through it, so we relaxed a little and little things slip up.\n  Okay. Some of you may have relaxed just a little bit too much. What else possibly? Colin.\n  I think some of us got a little too over-confident.\n  Ohhh, that's an excellent thing to check. Just making sure some of you don't get a little over-confident. Although, basses, the fa's and la's were much better this time as an overall section. Amanda.\n  If the first time usually there's a few problem areas for me then I try to focus on them way too much and then I see the spots where it might have been tricky for me, like that jump from la to do. So, I freak myself out about that even though I got it right both times.\n  You get stuck in your head a little bit.\n  Yeah.\n  Okay. So, doubting yourself and then not being sure. What else can happen? Ariella.\n  Along with what Emily said about how we sometimes get over-confident because we've already seen it and we just fly by it because we're not really trying to pay attention to it too much.\n  Okay. Ryan.\n  Measure nine. It's the so, so, mi. I went back to the so because that's what we did on the first page.\n  Oh, okay, because you're remembering, now, the patterns that you had. You get the patterns mixed up when you actually start to sing it the second time. That's a good thought, too. Michaella.\n  Between the  and  because we to sing notes over and over again. over and over again. I didn't like it. It's kind of hard. I didn't get the first two notes right and finally on like, the third note. I think I just figured out what we were doing.\n  Patrick.\n  I think that sometimes  because we've already sung the music and now I think that we kind of know what's going on.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 040 MUSIC EAYA 040.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.115176], "annotations": [["Instructor"], ["Shelby"], ["Instructor"], ["Shelby"], ["Instructor"], ["Audrey"], ["Instructor"], ["Reese"], ["Instructor"], ["Braden"], ["Instructor"], ["Jamie"], ["Instructor"], ["Together"], ["Instructor"], ["Brady"], ["Instructor"], ["Together"], ["Instructor"], ["Together"], ["Instructor"], ["Together"], ["Instructor"], ["Together"], ["Instructor"], ["Student"], ["Instructor"], ["Student"], ["Instructor"], ["Student"], ["Instructor"], ["Jesse"], ["Instructor"], ["Chelsea"], ["Instructor"], ["Patrick"], ["Instructor"], ["Grant"], ["Instructor"], ["Grant", "inaudible"], ["Instructor"], ["Colin"], ["Instructor"], ["Jamie", "inaudible", "inaudible"], ["Instructor"], ["Hannah"], ["Instructor"], ["Emily"], ["Instructor"], ["Colin"], ["Instructor"], ["Amanda"], ["Instructor"], ["Amanda"], ["Instructor"], ["Ariella"], ["Instructor"], ["Ryan"], ["Instructor"], ["Michaella", "inaudible"], ["Instructor"], ["Patrick", "inaudible"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW06", "TW07", "TW13", "TW15", "TW24"]}, "846": {"text": " All the water goes into the jeans and this water dripped out the bottom.\n Mmhm. So, it'll drip out the bottom as it dries and go into the ground. Okay. Other ideas about A? Other ideas about A? Okay. How about B? It disappeared. It no longer exists. It's gone forever. Maybe not forever, but it's gone. Anybody choose B? No choosers for B. Okay, how about C? It's in the air in an invisible form. Kyle.\n I think it's evaporated into a gas, and you can't see it.\n It evaporated into a gas and you can't see it. Okay, other ideas about C?\n I just have similar to Kyle's, but water vapor, you can't usually see it.\n Okay, so it became water vapor, which you can't see. Alright. How about D, it moved up to the clouds? Lots of Ds. How about Mina? What do you think?\n Well, I think it evaporated, and then it went up, so.\n It evaporated and went up. And when things evaporate, they form clouds?\n Mm, no.\n Okay. So who? Can you explain your ideas?\n Well, it was like, actually, it did go into the clouds, because the water's still wet, so...\n Okay, so when it evaporates, it goes to clouds. Alright. Other ideas about D? Moving to the clouds. Luke.\n I do think that it turned into water vapor.\n Okay.\n But I think that maybe clouds are there and then it gets soaked up by clouds, sort of.\n Okay. So, okay. Let's talk about some of these ideas. So, I'm hearing the word 'evaporate' from a couple different people. What does that mean, to evaporate? What are your ideas about that? Emmie.\n Doesn't it mean to like, when the water gets at a certain temperature, it turns into a gas.\n Okay, so when water gets to a certain temperature, it changes to a gas. Other ideas about evaporate, or what that means? When it changes to a gas, what's happening? Ideas about that? Mitch?\n Well, maybe it first comes out of the machine, maybe the sun could make it heat a lot and sort of the bubble question, like maybe it could be a heat bubble under each town. Not be an actual bubble, but go up to the water cycle and then go, come back down .\n Okay, so when you say 'go up to the water cycle' what happens to it?\n It's evaporated up.\n It's evaporated. And where is it when it evaporates?\n In the clouds.\n In the clouds. Okay, other ideas? Jake.\n Well, when it evaporates, the way it works is the heat makes it so the atoms get, go farther apart, and that makes it change into the state of gas.\n Okay, the atoms go farther apart. So, is it still water?\n Yes, but in a different form.\n Okay. Okay. Other ideas about evaporation? And how about clouds? So, some people are saying when it evaporates, it turns into a cloud. What is a cloud? Ethan, share?\n I think it's like a gas.\n Okay.\n But then I think when it evaporates and goes up to the cloud, and then I think it will be turned into rain.\n  I agree. Yeah.\n So, first it's a gas when it's a cloud and then it turns back to rain.\n Uh-huh.\n Okay. Jamie, other ideas?\n I think a cloud is, like, water turning into mist, and it gathers in the cloud. So, when it gets dark, it builds up with more water, and then when it rains, all the, the cloud gets too heavy with water, and then it rains.\n Okay, so it's a mist.\n Yeah.\n Is it a liquid or a gas?\n A liquid slash, a liquid slash gas.\n Okay, a little of both? Okay. Okay, alright. Let's move on. How about E? It changed into a new substance. No takers for E, new substance. Okay. How about F, it went to the sun? It went up to the sun. No takers for F either? There's a lot of hands I'm not seeing up. How about G? It broke down into atoms of hydrogen and oxygen. Alex?\n I said that because, well, it goes up into the sky, and it must be really humid because it like, I can't remember, is it when the atoms separate, or, and because we're humidity-ing it? Yeah.\n Okay, so it becomes more humid, and that makes the atoms separate? Is that what you're saying?\n Well, not exactly. It's hard to find the words.\n Okay. Can you try? It separates and that's what makes it humid?\n Well, I don't know, I guess.\n I'll come back to you. Keep thinking about it. How could you explain your ideas? Joey, what are your ideas?\n I, can I go off of Alex?\n Yeah.\n Oh, so when hot air rises, so when the water gets to a certain temperature, I forgot who said that, but it, the atoms spread apart and change into a gas. And it would be more humid because hot air rises and the gas rises into the clouds.\n Okay, so as the hot air rises, the gas rises with it? Is that what you're saying?\n Mmhm.\n Okay. And the water becomes hydrogen and oxygen as it goes up?\n Mmhm.\n Okay. Other ideas? Dylan?\n Well, so, there's oxygen and hydrogen in the atmosphere, and the atmosphere is gas, and gas doesn't sit at the bottom. It's in the air, which means it's obviously floating, I guess. And so if water turns into vapor, which I think most of us know, and vapor can float, and obviously it's turning into a gas, like oxygen and hydrogen. And so how would water be able to float if it's turning into gases, it's breaking down into atoms of hydrogen and oxygen? It's still almost like a liquid gas, but if it wasn't a gas that consists of things like hydrogen and oxygen, how would it be able to float? How would it be able to turn to clouds?\n Okay, so it can't be water still if it's going to be floating around in the air.\n Well, yeah.\n Is that what you're saying?\n It's still water, but it's in a different form, that it has components that make up, it's pretty much a liquid gas, almost.\n It's a liquid gas.\n Yes, yeah.\n Which makes it float in the air.\n Well, yeah, gas. Gas can float, and hydrogen and oxygen.\n Okay.\n So, it becomes hydrogen and oxygen in the air?\n Well, as it heats up, then it breaks, because as it heats up, then it creates vapor. Water evaporates, and so as it heats up, when it gets to that point, then it breaks down into atoms and everything else.\n Okay, when it gets to the air.\n Yeah, when it turns into vapor.\n Okay, when it turns into vapor, that's when it becomes hydrogen.\n Because yeah, that's how it, when the atoms of hydrogen and oxygen break down, I'm guessing that that means that that's when it's turning into vapor.\n Okay. Okay, okay, great. Luke, other ideas?\n I think it might become the combination of the two, because I think more than just one, because I think it does split into different atoms, which makes it a gas. And then, um, and then also it could go into the clouds, or something like in other parts of the answer.\n Okay, so maybe it turns into this hydrogen and oxygen gas, but then goes to the clouds.\n Yeah, because I think that that's kind of the only way to go to the clouds, and I think its probable that it would, so...\n Okay. Okay, okay. Lots of different ideas. We're going to move on so that we can get to the others. How could we observe this? What could we do to know if some of these options are the right option, or be able to eliminate them as possible options? What could we do? Turn and talk to your partner, quickly. What could we observe?  And see what happens? Okay. Would we be able to eliminate any of these if we agreed with Owen's suggestion?  Eliminate F? How come?\n Because the sun's very far away.\n Okay.\n And it's really, really hot, so.\n Okay, if we did it in the classroom, would it be able to get to the sun? No, it'd be stuck in the classroom, right? Okay. Are there others that we might be able to eliminate if we did that?  Good. Okay, let's hear your ideas. What could we do? How could we observe this scenario?\n Trenton, I haven't heard from you today.\n Okay, so to eliminate some of them, if soaked into the ground, you could check if the ground was wet or anything, and it moved up to the clouds. You could check if there's any clouds.\n Okay. See if a cloud forms. Okay, Miley, other ideas?\n I agree with Trenton, but I think I've seen them where the area's curved over, like our roof, and the sun is out, you can see mist kind of stuff coming out. And I think if we did that, then maybe we could observe something that could be useful.\n Okay, what would we have to do, though, to set this up? What do we need? Owen.\n You can wet a paper towel and then hang it from somewhere and then heat it by a light, and then, or you could have a fan.\n Okay, heat it with a light or a fan. So, perfect. I like your idea. So, we have a cloth. It's wet. Is it wet?\n Kind of.\n Kind of? It's not wet enough? Should we make it a little more wet?\n Yeah.\n Okay, let me make it a little more wet. That better?\n Yeah.\n Okay. And in this scenario, this is hanging outside, right? Well, we're going to hang it in our classroom. And since we don't have a lot of sun today, we're going to make our own light energy with this lamp. So, don't look at the lightbulb because it's real bright. There we go. And we're going to set it up here. So as we watch this, which one of these, or which ones, might we be able to eliminate? So as we observe, what can we, how will we know which ones are true or not true? Let me give you a minute to think. I want to hear from someone new I haven't heard from yet. Who haven't I heard from yet? Augustine.\n A, because I wasn't sure if the ground was wet or dry.\n Perfect, yeah. It can't soak into the ground, right? So, we'll see if the counter is wet, if there's a puddle there, then we'll know that A is the correct answer. Excellent. Others that we might be able to eliminate just by observing? Jake.\n B, it disappears and no longer exists, because nothing can't disappear. Something can't disappear unless it goes into a black hole.\n Okay, will we be able to observe that, though?\n No.\n Not really, yeah. So, that one might be tricky, but that's good prior knowledge. Jamie, others that we might be able to eliminate?\n We can tell if it moved up to the clouds, because there's no way it can move up to the clouds because there's a ceiling.\n Yeah, there's a ceiling. Well, so if we saw a cloud forming in our classroom, right, then we'd know that it makes a cloud. But if we don't see a cloud, then we'll know that we can eliminate that one. That one's wrong. Good. Others that we can eliminate? Miley?\n F, it went up to the sun, because it can't, we don't have a sun in the classroom.\n If we saw it, right, gathering up the light, right, that might tell us that maybe F is true. But it can't get to the sun because it's stuck in our classroom. Good. Any others that we might be able to eliminate? Emmie?\n We might be able to, well, C, because if the cloud isn't wet anymore, and you can't see anything or feel anything, we would know that that's true.\n Okay, okay. So, if it disappears, we can't see it or feel it in the cloth, but we can't see it anywhere else, maybe we'll know that C is more likely. Okay, good. Very good. Excellent. So, we're going to keep observing for these things. Those are the things that we want to keep an eye out, look for a cloud forming, look for water puddling at the bottom, look for water gathering at the light. See if it chemically changed into a new substance, we might be able to see it, right, in our classroom somewhere. So, we'll be observing for that. Is it going to happen immediately?\n No.\n No, so we'll have to come back to this one. Keep looking back as we go. In the meantime, uh-oh. No, here we go. We'll go to the next one, next scenario. What's in the bubbles? So, turn to that scenario in your notebook if you're not there right now. What's in the bubbles? So, Hannah is boiling water in a glass teakettle. She notices bubbles forming on the bottom of the kettle that rise to the top, and wonders, \"What is in the bubbles?\" She asks her family what they think. This is what they say. So, who agrees with Dad? Who may agree with Dad? Owen.\n Well, since it's being heated, and being heated from the bottom, the bubbles will form on the bottom as heat, and then the heat would make it rise to the top.\n Okay, the heat makes it rise to the top. Good. Other ideas? Other people who agree with Dad? Mitch?\n Well, I agree with Dad and Calvin.\n Okay.\n And for Dad, if the bubbles are heat, maybe the heat forms the bubbles and then the oxygen in the bubbles makes it float to the top.\n Okay, okay. So, let's move on to Calvin then. Other thoughts about Calvin. Who agrees, the bubbles are filled with air? Reed?\n I forgot.\n Okay, we'll come back to you.\n Anybody else agree with Calvin? Anyone I haven't heard from yet today? No? Trenton, anything for you to contribute?\n Well, I didn't at first, and I don't really know if I do still, but like I kind of do, because with the water, all water has oxygen in it, which is kind of like air, and then the air could be in the bubbles because the bubbles would probably heat up and be at the bottom, and then the air would fill up from the water and go into the bubbles, and then .\n Okay, so there's air in the water, and as it heats up, it comes out of the water. Okay, other ideas? Miley?\n I agree with Trenton and Mitch, because they could be both filled with air, but they could be hot, because it's where the source of heat is.\n Okay, alright. Reed, did you remember?\n Yes.\n Okay, go ahead.\n Well, the heat can take the air out of the water.\n The heat would take the air out of the water, like Trenton was saying.\n And since air's lighter than water, it would rise to the top.\n It goes to the top. Okay, good. How about Grandma? The bubbles are an invisible form of water. Anyone agree with Grandma? Rupo.\n I said I believe with Grandma because I thought that they'd go up to the top. I thought it was just invisible because I thought it was just going up, and the cloud's just evaporating higher and higher.\n Okay, so there are, the bubbles are evaporated water.  And then go away. Okay. Matthew?\n Well, it had to be a form of water, because it came from water, I guess, and they're invisible, so yeah.\n Okay, so it had to be water because it's coming from water, and you can't see it, so it's invisible.\n Uh-huh.\n Great. How about Mom? The bubbles are empty, there's nothing inside them. Who agrees with Mom? Who agrees with Mom? Jonathan?\n I think that there's nothing inside the bubbles because how could anything get in the bubbles in the first place? How could that turn into bubbles?\n Okay, how could anything be in there? Where would it have come from?\n Yeah.\n Okay. Anybody else agree with Mom? Anybody else agree with Mom? Okay, how about Lucy? The bubbles contain oxygen and hydrogen that separated from the water. Lots of hands. Who haven't I heard from today? Jodie.\n Well, I don't really know why, because it just sounded more scientific. \n Sounds more scientific. Okay. Any other reasons?\n No.\n No? Alright. Kyle, can you add on to that?\n I think in the water, when it's not hot, that there's oxygen and hydrogen and other things in it, and then when it heats up, it forms into, I don't know. It rises up.\n Okay, so where did the oxygen and hydrogen come from?\n I think it's part of the water.\n It's part of the water. Okay. Good. Emmie?\n Well, I know that, I'm pretty sure water is made of two oxygen molecules and one hydrogen molecule.\n Opposite.\n Oh, other way around.\n Yup, two hydrogens and one oxygen. You're right.\n Okay, and I'm with Lucy because bubbles usually kind of probably form by the water, and inside, and since the water's  the molecules, that that's what's happening.\n Okay, so water--\n", "filename": ["Copy of 846 SCI EA 846edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.255378], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW08", "TW22"]}, "845": {"text": " Ah, okay. Okay.\n Suri does this only happens in vinegar or can it happen in water?\n Try it tomorrow. We're going to experiment more with this, okay? This is, can I have your attention up here again? I'm just trying to help you by sharing observations I hear when I go around the room. Somebody had a question and I love questions. They said, does this happen when you put it in water the same way that it happens if you put it in vinegar because I have told you all it's vinegar. If you have questions like that could you please write them on the side so that I know what investigations you'd like to do in the future? So we can, because we're going to be continuing this. Now, once you've made all of your observations, you still have that column like we've had from every little activity today that says, what could be happening. So, let me be more specific. I want you to tell me, again, the title of the lab is, where's the matter? I want you to tell me where that tablet went. I want you to look at your observations. I want you to be specific. And I want you to tell me where's the matter. What happened to the tablet? Okay, in that last column you should only have one box to fill in. Please discuss it with your lab group and write down where it went. What happened to it. And then we'll all discuss it together. \n It can do both, can't it? So, you think it turned into a gas. You think it dissolved and turned into a gas okay, so you can absolutely write both. Next thing we're going to talk about is how we prove that. So, if any of you guys have a really quick idea think about how you can do an experiment. Okay, so keep thinking along those lines because you're going to design your experiment for it, okay. I have balloons. I see the word dissolves. I saw the word fizzy and escape. Okay. Alright, I'm going to write down some of these words that I'm seeing. I saw dissolved. I know. I saw escaped. Fizzy was in the same sentence as escaped, but thank you for reminding me. Did you have fizzy separately?\n Yeah.\n Oh, okay. On your observation sight or what could happen?\n Yeah, what could happen.\n What could happen, okay.\n Blended, okay.\n I had gas.\n You had chemical reaction?\n Bubbles.\n Did I pretty much get the kinds of things you think may have happened? Any, any totally different ideas that you think happened? You think it was still...\n It became carbon dioxide.\n Okay, alright. Alright, focus up here then. Good. I see the same mixture. When I did the first demonstration first thing you said was magic. Then someone said chemical reaction. Dissolved, disappeared, changed, neutralized. I see the same combination of words. Dissolved, escaped, fizzy, blended, vanished, chemical reaction, magic. I just see a little different priority, okay. Now I'm a scientist. I can't really test magic. Can't really test if something was magic. What I can test are the science type words. I can test chemical reaction. I can test blended. I can sort of test fizzy. Escaped, dissolved. These I can test. I can try to figure out a way to determine whether the tablet dissolved or escaped. Or a combination of both. I can figure out if it being fizzy had something to do with it. I can figure out if it was blended in. I can figure out if it was a chemical reaction or I can let you do this. And that's what I'm going to do. On your other half sheet, you should have another half sheet on your table. First thing I need you to do is, in your group, I need you to come to a consensus. That means you guys have got to agree. The first question on there says, okay, where's the disappearing matter? But I asked you to think about it in terms of everything you've seen today. I magically changed clear liquid into pink liquid and then pink liquid back into clear liquid again. You saw a candle magically get shorter and the wick magically disappearing and some black stuff come out of nowhere and you saw an alka-seltzer tablet vanish. Okay. So, your group needs to agree on an overall theory. Where's the disappearing matter? I want you to discuss it and I want you all to write the exact same sentence for where's the disappearing matter at the top of your paper. Okay, so you have to agree.\n There was a small piece that I put in right now and the alka-seltzer went up.\n So, you know that it goes to the bottom not to the top. Okay. That's a great observation because its very specific. I like it. So, you all need to talk about... Okay so, in every single experiment it turned into a gas? So, the pink liquid turned into a gas? And the white liquid turned into a gas? And when the clear liquid went pink liquid, the wax turned into a gas? I didn't even see it disappear. Oh, when you blew it out you saw smoke, so when you blew it out, the amount of smoke that went off, do you think it was equal to the amount of candle that's missing?\n Oh, the liquid was a solid, this is a gas, so...\n Tell me about the liquid again. Because I only saw liquid so I keep... \n If the pink was less dense than the white. \n If the density explained it, have you ever seen liquids that have different densities combined? Have you ever seen oil in water? Okay, so what does it look like when you have two different density liquids? Did you see layers with the... \n Where'd the pink stuff go? Disappeared by itself? Okay. So, these are the things you guys have to talk about. You can't just take one person's, you guys gotta make sure you all agree and it has to be an explanation that explains all three events that we saw today. So, when I say where's the disappearing matter, you tell me it turned into a gas. I'm going to say, okay then the pink liquid turned into a gas? I didn't see bubbles. Okay. So, it has to be a sentence that explains it all. You guys aren't talking here. Okay. The disappearing matter is in the liquid. So, you still think the alka-seltzer tablet is in there?  Okay, so you think it's in there, but it's now bubbles? Okay. It's in there, but it's now bubbles so it changed in to bubbles and then what about the pink liquid and the clear liquid? You think it's all still in there? Okay, but that time no bubbles, but it's still in there. Okay, so candle. Where did the rest of the wick go? Is it still there? Okay, so you were good for two out of three, but you can't say it's still in there for the candle, so change your sentence. Talk about it. Change your sentence just a little bit. I get that you're saying that. Right. But change your sentence a little bit so it applies to all three events. Okay. What's your sentence that everyone has agreed on?\n That matter turns into...\n So, you had bubbles in your candle?\n No.\n Oh, this is supposed to be, to explain all three events we saw today. Okay. This is a good start, but it has to be more general. Where is the disappearing matter in general today? Dissolved is good for this one? Is this one dissolved?\n Nope.\n Okay, so can you think of something dissolved and melted have in common so you can make it one sentence to explain everything. \n Okay, doesn't show up anymore does that mean it's gone?\n Okay, that's where you have to agree. You have to agree whether it is gone or not. Okay? Okay, stop for just one second. I talked to a couple of really good groups, but a couple of groups are very stuck because they disagree. I told you you all had to agree and you had to explain all three things. It's like the most difficult thing you can possibly do. He won't listen to you. I hear you. Okay, I'm listening. Here's the thing. In the disagreements I've seen, the disagreement is is it gone or is it not gone? Does that make sense? Okay. Did it go away? Did it disappear or is it still in there? That's the disagreement. Now, I have an idea. What if we, let's pick one experiment, okay. I think for this class, the easiest experiment to deal with would be the tablet. The alka-seltzer and the vinegar, okay. Write that down on that half sheet as the experiment we chose. The experiment, we chose the alka-seltzer. We're going to choose that as a class. What are the materials we put in? \n The tablet and the vinegar. Write those down on that left side. It says materials we put in. Do we put in anything else? I didn't trick you, I swear. Okay, so we had vinegar and we had a tablet. What did you see come out?\n Bubbles.\n We've got bubbles so write those on the right hand side. We've got bubbles. Fizz. He thinks, he's saying he thinks the fizz is carbon dioxide. That's fine. We can call it whatever you want and what some kind of guess and what else? Are you left with anything else? You're still left with some liquid, right? Okay, so write that down. You're left with, you've got bubbles and you're left with bubbly liquid. Here's what I think we need to prove. We need to prove if what we put in is the same as what we got out. How we can tell if something's there if we can't see it in science? Okay, you've got bubbles. What do you think, Nick? We weigh the vinegar and the alka-seltzer tablet   we add the numbers up and then weigh it afterwards and see of the number's the same.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 845 SCI EA 845edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.248769], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW05", "TW15", "TW17", "TW22", "TW23"]}, "842": {"text": " Okay, alright. Okay, okay. So, that's his position. He's going to stick with it for a minute, but then he might have to go around, he might change his mind, alright? Okay. This group agreed with Fernando, okay? That it's because the Earth orbits closer to the sun in the summer than in the winter. Who would like to share they're thinking? I'll call on you if you don't . So, what do you think?\n Well, I think it's because since the Earth like orbits around the sun, like in an oval, when it gets here it would be warmer because it's closer to the sun.\n Okay.\n And it's winter when it's away from the sun .\n Okay. So, can you go and draw that on the board, what you mean? Because I heard you say that the Earth orbits around the sun in the shape of an oval. Raise your hand if you agree with that. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, that's the Earth and it's orbiting around the sun and he said that the shape of the path that it travels as it orbits is an oval, okay? Anybody else in this group has something to add to help him defend Fernando? Okay, I see. Can I read what you wrote?\n Sure.\n He said that the orbit is not a perfect circle. So, that's sort of what he's saying there. Is that right?\n Yeah.\n And how would it not being a perfect circle affect the difference in summer, winter temperature or heat?\n Well, we know that the Earth, if it was a perfect circle the seasons wouldn't change.\n Okay.\n It would be the same.\n Alright. Okay.\n Depending where the Earth is--\n Alright, okay. Anybody else have something they want to add in this group? Okay. Now anybody based on these two groups? Anybody want to move from their group to these two groups? Not yet. Okay, that's alright. Okay. Now let's go to Raul, okay. This group agrees with Raul and he says it's because the Earth's tilt changes the angle of the sunlight hitting the Earth. Defend yourselves.\n So, I remember learning that the tilt of the axis is the reason for the seasons. But I read the question again, it says the Earth still changes and if it doesn't change it stays the same.\n Okay. Let's read it again. Read it really simple.\n It says it's because the Earth's tilt changes the angle of sunlight hitting Earth.\n Okay. So, it says the Earth's tilt changes the angle of sunlight.\n Yeah.\n Does it say it changes the tilt of the Earth?\n No.\n Okay. So you going to stick with what you said or you want to change? Can you show me? If I give you something can you show me what you mean?\n Alright.\n Okay. So, I'm going to give you an apple and I want you to pretend it's the Earth, okay? And I'm going to stick this bamboo skewer through it, well it didn't go exactly right, but just pretend. So, what does this represent based on what you just said?\n This is the axis of the Earth.\n So, this is the axis and what does the axis do?\n .\n Okay. So, the Earth rotates around the axis which is what Ryan said, right? Okay. And be careful because I just poked myself. I want you to be careful . Okay. So, can you stand up and show me what you mean and let's have someone else in your group that agrees with you be the sun and stand kind of in the middle of the room right here, okay? Alright. So she's the sun, you're the Earth, show us what you mean, okay?\n Okay. Well, the Earth orbits the sun--\n Alright. What's the word you were just about to say though? Revolves? I think that might be okay, too. What do you guys think? Do you think revolve and orbit might be the same?\n Yeah.\n Okay, alright.\n It doesn't matter.\n Okay, so you're going to have to make the-- Go around the outside of the desk for your orbit, okay?\n Well, it orbits the sun in a tilt.\n Okay. Which one is tilt?\n I forgot how many degrees.\n Okay. Alright, okay. So keep going.\n It orbits in an angle.\n Alright. Hold it the way you think it's supposed to be. Okay.\n I think it's this one. I'm pretty sure.\n Alright. So she's tilting it, but now, and it's tilted. Right now it's away from the sun, is that right?\n Yeah.\n Okay. Now keep coming around . Of course does it make a little job to play that?\n No.\n But we're just imagining those who were in this room . Okay. Now stop there for a minute. Is your axis pointing where you want it to?\n Yes.\n Okay, alright. Keep going. You guys need to make space for her to come through on her orbit. Okay, alright. So, does that help some of you? How many people think that she's right? That the Earth tilts as it's going around its orbit? It's actually kind of spinning on its axis while it's going around, right? Is that right?\n Yeah.\n It's spinning the whole time, right? What does that spinning give us? What does that spinning give us?\n Day and night.\n The spinning gives us day and night, okay? Right? Okay. Because one side of the Earth is facing the sun it's what?\n Day.\n And the other side is in?\n Night.\n Okay, alright. Okay, alright. This group over here. You guys agree with--\n Susan.\n Susan, okay? And Susan said that she thinks it's because the northern hemisphere is closer to the sun in summer than in winter. So, what do you think?\n So, like she said that its axis is tilting, but as it moves around the sun the northern and southern hemisphere are closer and farther away.\n Okay.\n But on this side the southern hemisphere is closer. \n Alright.\n And when it comes over here, the northern hemisphere is closer in the sun and--\n Alright. Anybody else in this big room have something to add?\n Well, I agree with her, Natalie. Because as it is tilted, I believe, that, and so when it goes around the sun shines bright and as it's turning and so as it goes around it will change where the light is hitting it.\n Okay. Can someone add to that or give us more detail?\n I'm also pretty sure that like the state of Texas it's more closer towards the equator and so it doesn't have all of the seasons.\n Okay. So, you think that places on the equator, right here, they don't have four seasons? Summer, fall, winter, right?\n I think they do have seasons, they're just not as different as like --\n Okay. So, there's not much, that difference in the heat from the sun and the winter versus the summer?\n Yeah.\n I think they're always getting the same amount depending on--\n The same amount of what?\n The same amount of sunlight and heat. Because they're getting it directly almost.\n Okay. Alright.\n \n Why do you think that? What makes you say that? So, you think the orbit is elliptical like this group, Fernando's group agreed. But it's not enough to change the difference in temperature.\n I don't think heat really varies depending on, I mean it varies, but not in that small of a scale, depending on where it is. And so just that little, teeny movement, ellipse or something, will not change--\n Okay, alright. Okay. I think we have another group over here. How about the Shakira agree-ers. Do you want to move now? Okay. Okay. Everybody if you want to move to a different table go for it now, okay? Nobody agreed with Warner, huh? Okay. So Eva's out, alright? People don't think that it gives off more heat, right, in the summer than the winter in Warner's group, right? So we're down to-- And Shakira's out, right? Alright. Who said to me that they didn't agree with any of them?\n I changed my mind.\n You changed your mind? Okay. Alright. So, here's what I want you to do now, okay? I want to do another little demonstration, okay? Would you be the sun? Okay. And would you be the Earth? Now here's what I want you to do for me. I want you to orbit around the sun. I want you to pick a spot. Like let's say that yellow bucket, okay? And as you're going around I want you to keep the axis pointed at that yellow bucket no matter where you are. Can you do that?\n Yes.\n Alright. Give it a try. Alright. Alright. Now stop for a second right there. Okay. He's still pointed at that yellow bucket, right? Keep going. Alright, stop right there. He's still pointed pretty much at the yellow bucket and you're tilted over a little bit, right? Like she said. Because we all kind of agree pretty much. These two groups agreed with that. What season is it right now? In the northern hemisphere? What season is it right now in the northern hemisphere?\n Winter.\n Winter. Why is it winter in the northern hemisphere?\n Because it's farther away from the sun--\n Okay. So, it's pointing away from the sun, right? Do you think it's because the northern hemisphere is farther away?\n No, because it's tilted away.\n Tilted away?\n Yeah.\n Okay. Alright, keep coming around here now. Keep pointing at the yellow bucket. It's a little bit hard to do, huh? Okay, stop right there. What season is it right now?\n Would it be spring? Perhaps.\n It would be spring in the northern hemisphere. What is it in the southern hemisphere?\n Fall.\n Okay. So it's the opposite, right? Okay, keep coming around here. Alright, keep pointing at the yellow bucket. Now what season is it in the northern hemisphere? What season is it in the northern hemisphere now? This group over here? Somebody in this group.  the table. What is it?\n Summer.\n Summer. Why is it summer in the northern hemisphere?\n Because it's closer to the sun.\n Closer to the sun?\n And it's like, kind of like--\n Are we like a few hundred or thousand miles away from the sun? A few hundred or a few thousand? Or like a few million?\n Yeah. Okay. So, in the scope of that, it's hard to picture, do you think that the distance between this spot and this spot is that much compared to the sunlight coming over?\n Yeah.\n To make it that different? Okay. So, you think it's more the tilt.\n Exactly.\n Okay. I'm not sure in your past science classes, what is it about heat energy and light energy pointed on something that makes something warmer or colder? Anybody have an idea?\n Depending on how direct it is because what I was thinking is like if this is the sun and, can I come up?\n Come show us.\n So, if my pencil's the heat and the light it would be coming from here and it would be coming and it would hit with him, this one more.\n Right.\n And this one will be direct.\n Okay.\n So, I think what he's saying is that both the northern and southern hemisphere are still getting sun, aren't they?\n Yes.\n Because we're so far away that the only, which side of the Earth is not getting sun right this minute?\n This side.\n When it's rotating it's night time. But during the day is it still pretty much light in the northern and southern hemisphere?\n Yeah.\n Yeah. So, what he's saying is that it's more direct to the hemisphere that's tilted, right, toward the sun. It's still getting sun and somebody over here said something about the equator, the places on the equator.\n Those over there.\n Who said that? Say that again.\n Like states or, I'm not sure--\n Any locations, right?\n So like for Texas, as an example, I'm not sure if it's exactly on the equator, but I know it's really close to the equator.\n Okay. Closer than we are.\n Yeah. \n Okay.\n I just read somewhere that it doesn't have all of the seasons.\n Okay.\n Yeah.\n Somebody else said I think as much difference or variation.\n Yeah.\n Okay. So, this is summer in the northern hemisphere. Now we're going to cut across our orbit and save time, go back over to that side and what season was that again?\n Winter.\n What season was that again? What season is it now in the northern hemisphere? Winter, okay. So, which hemisphere is getting more direct sunlight now? The southern hemisphere. And what season is it now in the southern hemisphere?\n Summer.\n Summer, okay. Alright.\n Because the heat's having to go around--\n Okay. So, let's go back for a second. Raul's group said it's because the tilt doesn't change, but the tilt, as you're going around, changes the angle of the sunlight that's hitting the Earth, okay? That's Raul's group. You guys still agree with that?\n Yeah.\n Okay. And Susan's group said it's because the northern hemisphere is closer to the sun in the summer than it is in the winter. Anybody want to move groups now?\n Wait. Does that mean more direct or--\n Well--\n Or literally closer?\n Literally closer. Okay. Anybody want to move groups?  Okay. That's okay.  You don't have to change, alright? And this group  with Fernando that is because the Earth orbits closer to the sun in the summer than in the winter. Alright. I'm going to show you something and I'm going to see if it changes your mind, okay?\n Do we get to eat the apples afterwards? \n Well, we'll see, okay? Alright. Okay. So, take a look up here. Alright. This is a simulation. What do I mean by a simulation? You can come back and sit down with your group. What do I mean by a simulation?\n It's a photo or a video of what actually--\n Right. It's not out in the universe looking back at our Earth. It's not from the space station or anything like that, okay? So take a look. Alright. And look at what's happening with the axis. It's a little bit hard to see on the screen. Okay. Did you notice how like what we tried to do, It stayed pointing the same direction, right? Let's do it one more time. Okay, alright. Okay. Now does this look kind of like what he drew on the board at the beginning? Does it look like an ellipse?\n Yeah.\n Or an oval?\n Yeah.\n Okay. So, I wish I had a glass, a clear glass.\n We do right over there.\n We have a clear glass?\n That's alright. We can use this. Okay.\n There is one over there.\n We can use this. Okay. I want you, and you're looking at this, kind of from the side. Does it look like that? When you're looking at the rim of this cup or the rim of this glass from the, sort of the side does it look like an oval?\n Yes.\n Yeah.\n Okay. Let me make sure you can see that. It does, doesn't it? When you're looking at it from that angle. But look at it straight down now. What does it look like?\n A circle.\n It looks like a perfect circle. Let's let a couple people experience that. Look at it from the side, now look at it straight down.\n With this one you're almost looking, you're looking like right here.\n Okay.\n So, the glass it was right there--\n I want you guys to try it too, okay? Alright. It might. But what I want you to think about here is this is sort of what you guys probably saw in your fifth grade science books, maybe even in your middle school science books. We'll have to take a look at the pictures in our books. You know, publishers, the people who print the books, they don't always do things the right way for us to work. And do you know that there are many, hundreds and thousands of adults, maybe millions of adults, who think that the orbit of the Earth looks like this because this is what they saw in their science books when they were kids growing up. But just like the glass, what happens? I'm going to do it again, but I'm going to flip it over. We're looking at it from up above. So, look what's happening now.\n It's a circle.\n Yeah. And did you know that the Earth's orbit, it is slightly an oval, but so slightly that it's really close to a perfect--\n", "filename": ["Copy of 842 SCI EA 842edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.128367], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW06s", "TW08", "TW13", "TW16", "TW22", "TW23", "TW24TW08"]}, "841": {"text": "  ... tilted towards the Sun, you're closer to the sun, which is heat, which means you're going to be warmer. When you're tilted away from the Sun, then there's less heat, because you're farther away from it, it's going to be colder. That's what changes the seasons.\n  Once again, it goes in orbit. Like you said, the closer we are to the Sun, or the father away, once again it goes back to being an elliptical orbit.\n  I think that tilt causes the seasons, and the closer we are tilted to the Sun, that means it's like Summer or Spring, then if we're tilted back, it's Winter or Fall.\n  I'm kind of understanding what you guys are saying. Because I'm thinking of it as like, say, like the globe that's sitting right there, say that Ben was the sun...\n  You can use that if you'd like.\n Say that Ben was the Sun, the Sun would be shining at the bottom of the globe, because the globe's tilted. So, there wouldn't be much Sun at the top of the sphere because that's the most tilted away from the Sun. So, it would cause Summer lower and on the other side it would cause Winter.\n  Why are you shaking your head?\n  I disagree. I think the Sun would hit more on top than it does on the bottom, because like Antarctica and stuff, always cold, and it's at the bottom. So, I think it hits more in the top and in between, like by the equator. Because as you go down South, it's more warmer, but still, if you go down, way down to Antarctica, it's totally freezing, they don't get no sun.\n  That's not right. Because... there is like sunlight in Antarctica and stuff. It's just 'cause like, the latitude and longitude, and like, because... Because, Antarctica's at zero degrees. So, it's cold down there.\n  I want to know, when the Sun is going in its orbit, if it just goes from this to this, like boom, or if its turning and its like facing the Sun like that, like, I don't understand that.\n  Okay. So, our question is what?\n Like, when you're going around the Sun, and its on its axis like this, tilted, and it goes around, eventu... Does it just, like, go like that? Like real quick? And then it's like shifted so the bottom is getting more light, and that would put us in Winter?\n  What do you think, Kaylie? You haven't said anything. Do you think that our, our tilt's going to just change?\n  No. I think it's like, whenever we're rotating, like it goes around the Sun in the orbit?\n  Can I show... She's saying that as it's rotating, it's staying the same, it's just that it's changing because you're changing position from which way the Sun is.\n  Can I show an example with the globe?\n  Yeah, please.\n  Say the Sun was in the middle. Say, like the globe, is right here. Say we're right here, it's Summertime, really close, and the Sun's right here. And as we go around, like maybe, like we're right here and this is Fall, and then we go to Winter. And as we turn this way for the Spring, and then we're back to Summer again because we're going around the sun, so...\n  But , the only problem with that is we're still going to be tilted away when it, when we go over towards the Sun. We're still going to be tilted away, won't we?\n  Well the Earth's always tilted.\n  Yeah, but we'll be tilted away. In the Summer you're tilted towards the Sun.\n  Let's go back to, does the tilt change? Okay, so we're definitely talking about this tilt, and I'm guessing there's a lot of kids that are a little unsure about the tilt? Yes? So, if you think you understand the tilt, help everybody else understand. We're not getting this tilt in what you're talking about. So, explain it the best way you can, and help each other, okay so... \"I don't get this tilt.\" Does it just flip flop? What do you think, Anna?\n  I think it stays the same?\n  What about you, Shana? You haven't said anything yet.\n  Well, as the Earth goes around in its orbit, it shifts, just like a little bit that way, you're like closer to the Sun. And then during the Winter, we're father away.\n  Is that how it is? We're closer towards the Sun in the Summer and we're father away in the Winter?\n  Yes.\n  Who doesn't think that?\n  Could I try something with the globe real quick?\n  Yes!\n  Could I borrow Nick, to be my Sun? \n  Yeah. Be his Sun, Nick.\n Come on, Sun. Go out there and stand in the middle.\n  Pretty dark Sun.\n  Yeah, you are.\n Okay, we're gonna say that this little pin here is where the Sun is hitting today. All right? And we're spinning, woah, spinning that way.  It's spinning, it's spinning, it's spinning, it's spinning, but it never, it never tilts back towards the Sun. That's what I don't understand, does it just go like this? \n  This is a really good question. This is a really good question. Now I want, wait, don't move yet. I want, go ahead, be the Sun still. And I want you to walk around and explain to people what you're talking about. Number one, show us the tilt.\n Okay, that's the tilt.\n  Show everybody the tilt.\n Okay, everyone, this, Nick move, you're in the way of people.\n  Just duck down, just crouch.\n And this is the way of the tilt, the way it's tilted that way. But as we go around it's still tilted that way. And this side here is still far away, so what? It's going to stay Winter all the time? Or is it just going to like flip? And be like, \"Hey guys, look! Now we're Summer, but we're upside-down.\" That's what I don't understand.\n  He has a very good question, okay? His question is, why is, what hemisphere are you talking about?\n The Northern Hemisphere.\n  Okay.  So, why is the Northern Hemisphere always tilted towards the Sun, how he's walking away? Because his argument is, that...\n  Oh, I have it right here.\n  Go ahead.\n  It says, \"Because the Earth's axis is slightly tilted, when the North Pole is laying towards the Sun and South Pole is laying away from the Sun. And when the South Pole is leading towards the Sun, the North Pole is leading away from the Sun.\" It says, \"As a result, the number of daylight hours in the Northern and Southern hemisphere are not constantly recalled because the Earth is divided in two halves of the hemisphere by the equator, the hemisphere that leads towards the Sun has a long day and short nights.\" Does that have to do with anything?\n  See, I...\n  Wait! Does that have to do with anything? That's Sabrina's question. Does that have to do with anything? So summarize, what you just read to us.\n  Does the tilt have, like also have to do with like, the days, and like the short days and short nights?\n  Does the tilt have to do with the short days and long nights, and long days and short nights? Shawn, you're shaking your head yes. You think it does have to do with it?\n  Say yes?\n  Yes?\n  You think it does have to do with it? Why? Who could help him explain, why would a tilt change the length of day? Move over, Lucas.\n  Because, like it's if, like it'll be indirect Sun if it's tilted away from it? And instead of like... I don't know.\n \n I think it is because I think another thing in the direct rays because, the way we're tilted, it's the number of daylight hours because of the less Sun, as much of the Sun because of the tilt, and how the Sun hits it when its on its tilt? I think, like, see how it tilted that way?\n  No, why don't you use it? Why don't you boys sit down and let... Pass that globe over to Byers, and let him explain.\n What I think is... You know how it's tilted this way? Maybe it'll tilt the opposite direction for the Summer. Like instead of it being tilted towards this, it'll tilt the other way for the South. Instead of the North be showing, the South would be showing. That's what I think.\n  Where is the Sun? That's what I'm not understanding.\n The Sun would usually be in the middle.\n  You need a hand?\n  Yeah.\n  Okay, go ahead, be the Sun again.\n The Sun's in the middle. And that's why if it's tilted this way, we're getting our Sun, but I thought if it would tilt the opposite way, like instead of being tilted this way, it'd tilt that way, then the South would get more Sun?\n  Okay? So, how... But what you're asking is the same question as Lucas.\n Yeah.\n  How does that other hemisphere become tilted towards the Sun? That's what you're trying to figure out. Whenever Lucas walked it around, the whole time, what hemisphere was pointing towards the Sun?\n  The Southern Hemisphere was pointing towards the Sun. And the Northern Hemisphere was pointing away from the Sun.\n  Ben?\n  No, I thought it was the Northern was pointing to the Sun, and the Southern was pointing  the other way.\n  But, it remained constant the whole orbit.\n  Yes. That's what I couldn't figure out, like how did it just like, did it like flip around and all of the sudden...\n  Maybe the Sun?\n  ... it changed?\n  What do you guys think? Does the Sun move? JJ, you haven't been in here yet.\n  I think like every day, it moves a little to the other side.\n  Wait, what does?\n  The Earth.\n  The Earth moves everyday?\n  Yeah, it might.  Like it tilts every day.\n  It tilts, the tilt is changing? Is that what you're saying? So, the tilt changes? What were you gonna say?\n I think the... It... The... Earth, like doesn't move, like when it stays in one spot, I think it might like flip. Like kind of like, just go around, like...\n  Can you show us? Do you wanna show us?\n Sure, I'll try.\n   ...I was gonna say maybe like, as it's, as like the Earth turns around, maybe it like, tilts forward every so often and backward.\n  So you're telling me the tilt is changing though and it flips?\n  Yes.\n  Okay, so what are you saying?\n It just goes around like this, and eventually it just like, spins around.\n  So, it spins on top of its rotation?\n  Yeah.\n  What do you think, Brad?\n  I think, yeah, I kind of agree with him.\n  Wait, with who?\n  with David. While it's like going around its orbit, it just like tilts.\n  So the tilt is changing?\n  Yeah.\n  What do you think, Alec? You haven't said anything yet.\n  I don't agree with him. I think that it spins while its moving around?\n  Don't raise your hand, you don't have to raise your hand.\n  Only this, like what Nick just did, or maybe every day it goes a little bit, and tilts like this. And the Sun hits more of the Southern.\n \n  It's like, everyday, goes a little bit, little bit, little bit, so where the South starts to get more Sun. Because like when we're in Summer and Australia has Winter. So, when we're in Winter, Australia has Summer. So... And it's in the Southern half and we're in the Northern half.\n  Wait! \n  Tiffany, you were shaking your head. Do you agree with what he's saying?\n  Sort of, yeah. Because, if... one spot on the hemisphere gets more sunlight, the most likely it's gonna be warmer than the other. Like he was saying, when we get more sunlight, and the temperature's warm up here, the temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere get a little colder if they don't have as much sunlight, and not as much warmth.\n You see what I mean? Like say I'm right here, the Sun is tilted, so you see how the Sun's right here? And then it tilts  a little bit like this. We're still getting Summer sunlight, but Australia's getting more sunlight.\n  I have to agree with what JJ said earlier. It tilts everyday.\n  So the tilt is changing? You think that the tilt is changing? Morgan, you think the tilt is changing?\n  No, I don't think it's changing. I think it's staying the same, because even, I think the rotation helps, because if it goes around the orbit, even though its rotating it helps. Like... Nick, you're the Sun like, and the axis stays, and when it rotates, the Earth rotates, and it's like kind of, it like helps us. I don't know, like indirect sunlight? I don't know. Something like that.\n  I can show what she means, I think.\n  Go ahead.\n  I think it's also about the gravitational pull. Like, when it goes around farther there's less gravitational pull.\n  As it goes around farther, there's less gravitational pull. Okay, when you do this, Grace, please explain to me what it is. So, that everybody here that's watching can try and make sense of what we're talking about.\n  I think what she's saying is like, say Nick's the Sun again. Since the Northern is that way, I think she's saying is, it doesn't rotate but this is, but we're kind of going around kind of like this? So, then it changes. So now the Southern is towards the Sun and the Northern is that way. So, now it's changed.\n  She did something very different in her orbit. Did anybody catch that?\n  Yeah, yeah.\n  Like she, it didn't move, it just went around like, around the Sun?\n  What do you mean it didn't move?\n  The Earth stayed still and just moved at one point.\n  It didn't do that.\n \n  Okay, let's do it again, okay? And I want you to make sure that, number one, everybody sees where you start, and everybody sees what happens to the Earth as she's showing you how it's going around. So, explain to us. What is this? Where are we starting?\n Okay, we're starting out this way with the Northern towards the Sun, and the Southern away from the Sun. And as we are rotating? I don't know  if all of you guys can see this. But as we're going around?\n  Stop there.\n  It's not moving?  So, since it's not moving, now the Northern is  kind of like facing away, and the Southern is facing towards the Sun now?\n  Keep going. And then just make sure that the camera can see what you're talking about as you go around. Okay. So, did everybody see that? Who doesn't understand that? Who didn't understand what she did right there? Okay. So...\n  Now, I don't understand, actually, wouldn't it actually have to stop rotating and then it would have to rotate on its axis, and then start rotating again?\n  I'm not sure what you mean by that.\n Like... you spun it like this,\n  All right?\n  But the Earth is going like this the whole time. Would that end up stopping, and then it go like this? Or is that still happening?\n  It's not turning like that. It's just rotating around the Sun.\n  Wait, Sabrina, you had something to say. Okay. So, here's what's happening. Lucas is a little confused about your explanation, okay? So, we just have to go through it again. What did you have to say, Sabrina?\n  The earth doesn't change its tilt. It stays like an exact same position, but when it goes around the Sun, it gets like different ways, like the Sun hits it in different directions which causes different weathers.\n  Okay, wait, why don't you try to show him? Maybe it's just a different person. Maybe it will help explain it, okay? So, the more people we can get information out of, remember, the more we're gonna understand. So, start and tell us what's happening. And just make sure the camera can see what you're doing.\n  The Northern Hemisphere is towards the Sun, and the Southern is facing away. So, this causes colder weather, and up here where it's facing the Sun causes warmer weather. So, when it goes around the weathers start to change and then when you get it around here, the Southern is facing towards.\n  Wait, is the Southern facing towards?\n  The Southern's facing towards the Sun. And the winter is facing away. Which causes it to be warmer down here and Winter up here.\n  Who can help her out, because...\n  What I don't understand, is...\n  Go ahead, go ahead.\n  I don't understand it because it's still changing from day to night, but then it's shifting so wouldn't it have to stop spinning and then shift?\n If it stops spinning we're gonna die.\n \n  Not necessarily.\n  Okay, wait, Ben, start from the beginning and explain what's going on. Nick is our Sun still. Put your legs in so he doesn't trip. Northern Hemisphere is towards the Sun, Southern's away. And it's still spinning,  it doesn't change...\n  Okay. And so stop there and what's happening?\n  The Southern Hemisphere's towards the Sun and the Northern's away from it.\n  And what happened to the tilt the whole time?\n  It didn't change.\n  It what?\n  It didn't change.\n  It didn't change, it stayed the same.\n  But that made more sense. Like, I couldn't figure out why it wasn't spinning, but now I do.\n  And then it keeps going. And then it just goes back.\n  Now I understand.\n  Okay. Let's use this model, and try to figure out, where are the seasons happening? So, where do we live, Anna?\n  We live... Yeah, where he's pointing.\n  What's that called, somebody?\n  America.\n \n  North America.\n  North America, let's get bigger.\n  Northern Hemisphere?\n  What Byers?\n  The Northern Hemisphere.\n  Okay, so we live in the Northern Hemisphere. Right now, what's happening?\n  It's Summer.\n  It's Summer in the Northern Hemisphere. Does everyone see that?\n  Yes.\n  Yes. Anybody not see it's Summer in the Northern Hemisphere, see it?\n  Yeah.\n  Okay, so...\n", "filename": ["Copy of 841 SCI EA 841 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.166879], "annotations": [["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Kaylie"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Anna"], ["Teacher"], ["Shana"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Sabrina"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Shawn"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Byers"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Ben"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Byers"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["JJ"], ["Teacher"], ["JJ"], ["Teacher"], ["JJ"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Brad"], ["Teacher"], ["Brad"], ["Teacher"], ["Brad"], ["Teacher"], ["Alec"], ["Teacher"], ["Byers"], ["NaN"], ["Byers"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Tiffany"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Morgan"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Grace"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Grace"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Grace"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Grace"], ["NaN"], ["Grace"], ["Student"], ["Grace"], ["Teacher"], ["Sabrina"], ["Teacher"], ["Sabrina"], ["Teacher"], ["Sabrina"], ["Teacher"], ["Lucas"], ["Teacher"], ["Lucas"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Ben"], ["Teacher"], ["Ben"], ["Teacher"], ["Ben"], ["Teacher"], ["Lucas"], ["Ben"], ["Lucas"], ["Teacher"], ["Anna"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Byers"], ["Teacher"], ["Byers"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW08", "TW22", "TW23", "TW24TW08"]}, "074 ": {"text": " \n  So how would you describe that?\n\n  Can you find the exact  spot where that is in the text where you can find those? So you basically have found two character traits to describe to me, right? You guys have discovered that he can be what? What was one of them again?\n  Jealous. Sad.\n  Jealous. Or sad. So I want you to find that evidence. If you want to make those claims, any of those are great ideas. But now you have to dig a little bit deeper into the text and see if you can find this. Can you find examples and see? OK. Keep sharing. You're doing a great job!\n  Toby wanted to play...\n  Because Toby was kinda jealous because Bouncer was outside by himself. Didn't want to . Nobody didn't... and a little kid wanted to go outside the house. Well, I think he's thinking this himself. Because he was thinking about what the other .\n  That's Toby.\n  So, he's kinda jealous because he's talking to the other little dog, and every single time, he wants to play ball with him. But he doesn't want to .\n  And the thing is, the lady said it, in the story, it made it sadder than it usually would be sad. That sometimes the stories make it seem so sad, so good that that can feel. So, here where it says, \"Why does Andy need a new dog?\" Oh, wait. \"'Why does Andy need a new dog?' wondered Toby. \"He already has me. \"Toby sighed and laid down \"Beside the dog. \"Maybe Andy doesn't love me anymore.\" They had to make it so that what happened, and actually it's sad what happened. It's not that it's sad, but it's not so so sad, but they make it like sad.\n  Toby wanted... \n  Toby wanted to play ball and he got a new dog and forgot, I was about to... \n  Well, he didn't really forget about Toby, because he still bought Toby his food. I know! Toby wanted to play ball, but when Andy came, he got a new dog. And then, for the rest of the day, Andy was playing with his new dog. And Toby felt left out. I say we put 'left out' somewhere.\n  He's so sad, jealous, and left out.\n  So, Toby wanted to play ball with Andy, but when Andy...\n  How do you spell Andy?\n  A-N-D-Y\n  Andy.\n  Andy.\n  Where do you see?\n  Oh, yeah.\n  When Andy told him he wanted to play ball,\n  Where are you?\n  Andy.\n  Andy.\n  Toby wanted to play ball, but when Andy came, he had a new dog. And you spelled with a silent \n  I think with the Andy...\n  Another dog?\n  A new... Like this one.\n  Another dog.\n  No, it's not. Well, whatever. Who wants to...  \n  Just write. Just write!\n  I put 'Toby was jealous because of Bouncer.' Maybe we can put, because he wanted more attention.\n  That's how my sister is. She wants more attention.\n  We're not talking about your sister. We're talking about Toby.\n  So, Toby was jealous...\n  Toby was jealous because a dog's there.\n  Because Toby was a dog and Bouncer just came along and he didn't like him. He's jealous.\n  No. We have to write a reason why he's jealous.\n  I know! Then we have to do part of the test. Part of the test!\n  Did you guys agree on a character trait that he was at the beginning?\n  Jealous.\n  Jealous.\n  Jealous? Do you have at least one example, and maybe two? Do you have an example, Joaquin?\n  I'm going to put Toby wanted more attention, but Bouncer got more attention.\n  Do you have an example  of why he wanted more attention?\n  I have one.\n  Can you find it, Oscar?\n  When he was, like, maybe Bouncer doesn't love him anymore.\n  I only said that. Can you find that? So when you write it, when you explain it, can you find that part and maybe quote it?\n  There's another reason... When they came through the driveway, he got all . And then when he came back, he lay... \n  So that's like too many things.\n  Toby was jealous, cuz\n  Toby was jealous, cuz Bouncer got more attention, instead of Toby.\n  No.\n  Yeah.\n  Oh, right here.\n  In the middle.\n  Toby, since nobody...\n  What paragraph is that?\n  Paragraph nine. He wondered if Andy had forgotten all about him.\n  Do you know why he paid more attention to Bouncer? Because he's a little puppy. And little puppies need more attention than big puppies.\n  Because little puppies don't know what to do.\n  I know. And they're not even trained. They have to train them more.\n  For like three months.\n  Yes. That's why he needs more attention than Bouncer, yeah.\n  Toby needed... Because Toby really knows how to...\n  And he knows, that's an old dog. And you can see all the wrinkles.\n  That's how the dogs are. Yeah, those dogs have wrinkles when they're big already. But they're still young.\n  OK.\n  Toby was jealous because Bouncer...\n  What did you write?\n  So. I have, 'In the beginning was Toby...\" \n  When Andy had a puppy, he liked Bouncer more than Toby.\n  Maybe.\n  And in the beginning, Andy was showing the puppy opening. Opening the puppy, and showing it to Toby.\n  Yes.\n  That's how he was like nervous.\n  Jealous.\n  Yeah, jealous.\n  And selfish.\n  Yeah. That's what I put in the beginning. And then Toby... Remember the part when he got the little ball?\n  Right\n  Yeah, and he was being jealous.\n  Yeah.\n  ...Bouncer. Because he was a new one. And the old one was Toby.\n  And the part when Andy closed the door in Toby's face, and he let him outside. Then he felt loner.\n  I believe that, Toby was getting  Bouncer. Because they would stay together, and they slept the whole night together.\n  So they were being friendly.\n  Yeah, like starting to.\n  Yeah.  Another thing that Bouncer was new. And another thing, Toby was old. So, Andy was used to Bouncer...\n  And Bouncer and Toby... \n  And that's I think what Toby about. It's Bouncer. You know how the fence went to  Bouncer. They get a kinda middle-something.\n  Yeah.\n  That's what I think.\n  When they started to get  , Toby showed Bouncer how to catch the ball, that's when they started to become friends.\n,  And the climax is when  Andy he throw the rubber ball and told Bouncer to go and fetch it but he just sit there  and then yeah, Then Andy called Toby to go and show him how  to pitch the ball\n  Okay\n   \n  Oh, almost part of the end is when the puppy that is Bouncer becomes crying and then Andy took the puppy to Toby\n  Yeah, in the beginning I was getting like selfish. \n  May I interrupt for a second, so you guys it looks like you've developed the beginning pretty well and you found examples, right? Have you talked about the ending yet?, and how he was at the end? I see you're on the back page. How does Toby change at the end? Have you guys talked about that part yet? What's his character trait at the end of the story?\n  We talked about the--\n  Okay, so who was working on that part? Was somebody working on that part? Yeah, was there a trait that you picked for him, at the end?\n  When... the little puppy Bouncer started crying and Andy took the little puppy Bouncer when Toby \n  How did Toby change then? How do we describe Toby then?\n  Happy\n  Happy?, yeah can you give an example of now that he's happy? He's happy why?\n  Because he just  thinks anymore that \n  Ohhh. Can you come up with another reason, maybe together if you guys can look for another example as to why at the end of the story Toby is happy? Can you look and see if you can find one?\n  I think that Toby,  in the ending is kind\n  Is kind? Okay, can you come up with an example and share it with them in the scene? And then maybe you guys can come up with a consensus on one that you agree? Or you can write two different things, right? You don't all have to write the same thing. One of you can write he's kind and one of you can write he's happy as long as you have what?  as long as you have what?\n  Your reason.\n  Your reason, absolutely. So share that other example. Share that other example, too.\n  I think I've got he's kind. Maybe because he's going to be kind to Bouncer because he's still like a little puppy and he doesn't know how to do stuff. I think.\n  Yeah, in the end when he said   for me at the end he was getting kind of happy because... Andy told Bouncer to-- Andy told Toby to to get the yellow ball. You know the yellow ball.\n  Yeah\n  And Bouncer was  kind of tired and everything. because he's-- he's small and Toby, he catched it and they were playing, yeah, and they were getting happy and Toby in the end at that part he was used to liking Bouncer now.\n  Mm-hm\n  At the climax--\n  At the climax, it was when   It was when Toby... When Andy told Toby to show Bouncer how to fetch the ball and then started fetching the ball   and then he started to play and Bouncer and Bouncer danced on his bed Bouncer tried\n  Okay \n", "filename": ["Copy of 074A ENL EMC 074A edited.srt.txt", "Copy of 074B ENL EMC 074B edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.177417], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Boy"], ["NaN"], ["Boy"], ["Boy"], ["NaN"], ["Boy"], ["NaN"], ["Boy"], ["NaN"], ["Boy"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Boy"], ["NaN"], ["Boy"], ["NaN"], ["Boy"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Boy"], ["Girl"], ["NaN"], ["Girl"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Girl"], ["NaN"], ["Girl"], ["Teacher"], ["Girl"], ["Boys"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Girl"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Girl"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Girl"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Girl"], ["NaN"], ["Girl"], ["NaN"], ["Girl"], ["NaN"], ["Girl"], ["NaN"], ["Girl"], ["NaN"], ["Girl"], ["NaN"], ["Girl"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW09"]}, "1846": {"text": " Get out your journal, I'll read it aloud and I'll put the time on the timer. Get our your journal. We're looking at journal entry number 14. And you're not allowed to write I don't know, take a guess if you're not sure, but don't write I don't know. So question 14 is very simple. Why do you think an earthquake happens? You can write it, you can draw a picture. So I'm asking you why do you think an earthquake happens. You have three minutes right now to write what you think. Why do you think an earthquake happens?  Why do you think an earthquake happens, and why do you think...  Remember there's no right or wrong, it's what you think is the answer. Remember you can draw a picture if that helps you. Okay if you want to draw  alright you've got like a minute left so you can draw a picture. Write down what you think.  I'm gonna give you about 30 more seconds. Many of you are still writing and that's fine, but I thought before we talk about this let's take a look at a little clip because I realize maybe not everybody has experience with an earthquake. So this one's kinda cool. It was shot obviously on somebody's iPhone so it's not the best quality, but many of you know that Japan has lots of earthquakes all the time, they're very used to earthquakes. So this person lives in Japan, and so again they're used to earthquakes, right? So they weren't like panicking so he actually took his iPhone and filmed the ground. So I want you to take a look. We're only gonna look at about a minute of it, but I want you to notice how the ground is moving, okay? And we're gonna use that idea to talk about why earthquakes happen. So this is pretty cool. So this was back in March 2011. So notice.  Now they're gonna go to another part. Notice the ground in the back, watch the back. You'll see something happen.  Watch what's happening.  Alright so that's real, it's not like there was a machine underneath there doing that. So you guys, we can solve what's happening, so let's take that and let's talk about this through. Why do you think an earthquake happens? Why do you guys think an earthquake happens? And remember, when we talk we're gonna let one person go at a time and we're gonna make sure we talk loudly so that we can hear. Alright so let's just start on this side. We're gonna work this way, Tony, what did you write? Why do you think an earthquake happens?\n Well, I think there's something wrong with the mantle that's coming out through the crust and makes it vibrate the earth and causing an earthquake?\n Okay, something to do with the mantle causes the earth to vibrate? Also I liked how you used a complete sentence. So remember, if you're not sure, there's some sentence starters up there. Jheyline, what did you write?\n I think earthquakes happen because two plate boundaries overlap each other.\n Excellent, because plate boundaries overlap each other. Jose.\n  I think that earthquakes happen when plates crash.\n When plates crash.\n  Together.\n Anybody else? Adrian, and then Dajana.\n I think that earthquakes happen because plates slide.\n Because plates slide, excellent. Dajana?\n I think an earthquake happens from too much stress?  Also, I think the plate boundaries overlap.\n Ooh, I like what you said, and that's exactly where I'm going next. So in that video clip you guys saw the ground move. I'm gonna give you 10 seconds. And that 10 seconds you're gonna share with the person next to you how did the ground move? What direction was that ground moving? So you have 10 seconds, share with your partner next to you or share with the people across from you. Go, 10 seconds.  Alright, finishing up in five, four, three, two, one, zero. Okay, so I heard lots of people talking so I'm gonna pull a name, this time, remember you can say what you said or what the person next to you said. So what kind of movement did you notice in that video clip? Let's see... . Now Neferly, what kind of movement did you see?\n  They were moving  apart?\n Good, moving apart, what else did you notice, Angel?\n  They were moving apart.\n Moving apart, what else did you notice, Dajana?\n Well, it was crashing everywhere, but I saw the... \n Ooh, kind of like water coming out of the sky? Josh, what else did you notice?  Oh, so a little bit of up and down movement? Alright so, up and down movement. Anybody else notice any other type of movement? So you guys said up and down, you said moving apart.  Oh, did you see how that piece literally slid?\n Yeah.\n Alright, so that's movement. You guys know some words for this. What are some words that we've learned to describe movement, and Dajana said a couple. What words, Jina?\n  Shearing.\n Yes, so there was some shearing happening. What else was happening? Rodolfo.\n  Tension?\n Yes, some tension pulling apart. And what else did you notice, Daniel?\n Compression?\n Yeah, compression, squeezing together. Okay, so we're getting this idea that, didn't Dajana, you said it was stress, or you said stress, Dajana right? So something about stress being kind of important. So we're gonna take that idea. Give us a moment, okay, thanks. Alright, so sorry about the interruption. So stress, Dajana was saying stress. So let me give you an example. So let's imagine that this rubber band is not a rubber band. Let's imagine that it's a rock. And let's imagine it's a rock, I know, it's a rubber band, but let's imagine it's a rock. So I'm gonna take, I'm gonna go like this, it's a rock, remember? So I'm doing this to the rock, and then I'm gonna stand here for an entire year, and then a year from now I'm gonna put my hands further apart. And then another year, I'm gonna put my hands further apart. What's happening to this rock, or this rubber band? What's happening to this rock over time? What's happening, Lupita, to this rock?\n  It's stretching.\n It's stretching, what else? Add to that, Tucker.\n   and stretching it out, stretch is added to it?\n Stress is added too, nice, Victor?\n  So maybe it's getting a little compression.\n Okay, maybe a little compression too. My hands are getting tired, Tony?\n Continental drift?\n Ooh, like okay, so if there were other pieces like my hands were Africa and South America, they'd be moving apart. Ernesto?\n  Thinner in the middle?\n Thinner in the middle. Sakura?\n  Tension.\n So tension, now I'm gonna stop because my hands starting to hurt, but what would happen if I kept doing that? I'm gonna have you take 10 seconds to talk to the person next to you. What might happen if I kept doing that, and I kept doing that, and I kept doing that? What might happen to this rubber band, or this rock? So 10 seconds, to the person next to you, ten seconds.  Alright, finishing up in five, four, three, two, one, zero. Okay, I heard lots of good discussion. So if I kept doing this, I kept doing it, I kept doing it, Moses, what might happen?\n  It might crack and break.\n It might crack and break. Everyone, what else maybe might happen? Victor?\n  It will scrape the mountain and it will create an earthquake and it'll break.\n Ooh, oh I like, 'cause you remember this a lot right? Little earthquake, excellent Tucker?\n It's just like when you shove your fingers, go all the way back it will break.\n Oh yeah, that would be painful. Jheyline?\n It'd probably explode from so much tension and stretch everything.\n Did everybody hear that word she just said? Which word did you say, it would?\n Explode.\n Explode, wow. That's a big, powerful word, but that's pretty equal to what happened, right? Big amount of power.\n Or like when you were doing that with the rock, like when you were moving it, like it would get more thinner and get more, it would kinda get wider when after all while it's still going it's gonna like .\n Good, so let's step back a little bit. So who was it, someone had said earthquake, right? You had said earthquake. So it's sounding like, what if that happens first? So before the earth actually moves, before what we saw in the video, what did you guys think was happening? And Moses had used the word for it too. What was happening to the rocks over time? So over time what was happening in that rock that would eventually lead to an earthquake? What's happening over time? Ernesto, what's happening over time?\n It's stretching?\n It's stretching, keep going with that, Diego?\n  It was standing.\n It was standing, Tony?\n  It's spreading apart?\n Spreading apart, Jheyline?\n  Widening?\n Widening, Tiger?\n Breaking?\n Breaking, so wait before the breaking though, you guys were saying it was stretching, it was pulling, so what word can you describe it building up in here, building up, Stephanie?\n  Through stress?\n Ah, okay, so it sounds like if we're gonna make an earthquake we need to have stress first. We have said stress that builds, right? Stress builds, and then what's gonna happen when the stress builds, and it builds, and it builds and it builds and it can't take it anymore? What's going to happen, Manuel?\n Collide?\n This is stress, keep going. Not collide, what's another word that's kind of, same idea? So you said it when I was over here. It's gonna keep stressing, and stressing, and what's gonna happen to the rock?\n Rip?\n It'll what?\n Rip?\n Rip, what's another word you can say.\n It'll explode.\n Explode, Adrian?\n Break?\n Break, great, so there's going to be a rupture. Or a break. And then is that it? End of the story? Nice day, that's it? Where does all this energy go, right? There's all this energy building up, where does it go? Yeah it ruptures, it breaks, and then is it over?\n No.\n No, what, where, what happened? Where did the energy go? Where did that energy go? Irma, where'd it go?\n  Plate tectonics?\n Yeah, it has to do with plate tectonics, absolutely. Where did that energy go? Where did it go, Rodolfo?\n  Plate boundaries?\n  Yeah, plate boundaries. So okay we got stress builds, ruptures, it breaks, and then is that it?\n No.\n That's the earthquake? What action? Yeah, Anna.\n It becomes an earthquake?\n Yeah, it becomes an earthquake and so what do we experience? Jheyline?\n Shaking?\n Shaking, oh! So it sounds like there's a rupture or a break, and then that's gonna lead to shaking and that shaking is actually what being released?\n An earthquake.\n It's an earthquake, yes and what is that shaking actually being released? So the shaking is released, what? Victor?\n All the stress?\n Yes, it's releasing all the stress. What's another word you could say? Releasing all of its...?\n Power.\n Power is a good word, or, Diego?\n  Energy.\n Energy, right? So it seems like all an earthquake is, is stress building up, building up, building up, breaks, and then we feel that. What do we experience the energy as? So what do we experience, think of the energy as? What do we experience it, as an energy? \n That?\n That, what's that? \n Shaking.\n Shaking, right? Alright awesome. So now we're gonna, you guys did that perfectly. So we're gonna write that down in our notes.\n  Woah.\n I know, that, earthquakes release energy, right? So that's what happens as a result. So we are not in any way done with this, because we are gonna talk all about different . You guys have made a good start on what's happening. So we are gonna take two notes today. They're pretty short. I'm sorry, the first one's a little long. The other one's super short. But this is what you guys were just telling me except now we're gonna add the word elastic strain, which is what you guys were telling me. You were telling me that energy was building up, you were telling me stress was building up, and that's gonna cause elastic strain. Yes, Dajana?\n The pictures that you showed us .\n What?\n It only cut through the .\n Kind of, yeah.\n Yes.\n So like maybe 'cause on the bottom that came out of the ground .\n Yeah.\n And then it just spilled it over, then it came out of the ground.\n Yeah, so thank you for those of you who got started. Rodolfo, let me just read this off for people. So our first topic today is earthquake energy. And this is what we just talked about. But now we're getting a chance to write it down and we're adding in a bigger word. And that word is elastic strain. So elastic strain is the energy stored as rocks change shape. So elastic strain is the energy stored as rocks change shape. Okay, so that's step one in an earthquake. Step two. Energy is released when the rock ruptures or breaks. So elastic strain is the energy stored as rocks change shape and energy is released when the rock ruptures or it breaks and released energy travels in seismic waves, and we will learn all about those next week. But you can still write down, you just think released energy travels and it's felt as shaking.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 1846 SCI_EA_1846_Video_Recording_A_edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.272092], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Jose"], ["NaN"], ["Jose"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Neferly"], ["NaN"], ["Angel"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Jina"], ["NaN"], ["Rodolfo"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Lupita"], ["NaN"], ["Tucker"], ["NaN"], ["Victor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Ernesto"], ["NaN"], ["Sakura"], ["NaN"], ["Moses"], ["NaN"], ["Victor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Diego"], ["NaN"], ["Tony"], ["NaN"], ["Jheyline"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Stephanie"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Irma"], ["NaN"], ["Rodolfo"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Diego"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW03", "TW05", "TW06s", "TW16", "TW17"]}, "1008": {"text": " The corners.\n  The corners, that's fine. How do you get exactly one painted face? Which one of these have just one color on them?\n The middle.\n  Yeah just the ones in the middle on each face. And how many of them are there?\n Six.\n  So that's 6 out of 27. So that's fine. And realize that if you did it right, those are all your options. Each of these cubes has either zero colors, up to three colors. Nothing has four colors. So that means all your probabilities should add up to what?\n  27.\n 27 out of 27. Does it?\n  No.\n No, so what's the issue? One of these numbers at least has to be off. So figure out which one that is. See if you could figure what one. So keep in mind, these look right. But realize, these are all probabilities because you're picking them out of that hat. So, these should all be out of...\n  27.\n Right, because there's 27 cubes you're picking from.\n  Right.\n And if you did it right and these are all the cubes, then they should add up to what?\n  27.\n Right, does it?\n  Yeah it does.\n 27, okay so fine. Good. So when you do the next one it should all be out of...\n We can figure that out.\n You can figure that out.\n  Isn't it 16 times 4 so 64?\n So where are you getting these numbers from?\n  My mind.\n Okay, so I get no painted faces. There's just the one cube that's right in the middle. So that's one out of... Because you're picking them out. 1 out of 27. You gotta do a probability, right. But then how many have one painted face? How'd you get six? Which six?\n The middle ones.\n Sure, the middle ones. And there's six faces so it makes sense, 6 out of 27. How do you get three painted faces?\n  I didn't do that one.\n Okay. The corners. So that should be eight. And then realize if you did this right, it should all at up to what?\n  27.\n 27 out of 27. So how do you figure out how many have two painted faces?\n Just add these together and subtract them.\n Yeah you could do that. Now, there is a pattern to the two, just like the other ones. But you can also subtract and figure that out. So, yeah, good. Oh that brings up a good point. Everybody, for your first cube... For your very first cube everything should be out of what number?\n  27.\n 27. All your probabilities should be out of 27. Is it possible you can reduce the fractions, when you figure it out?\n  Yes.\n Yes, I'm gonna tell you, don't reduce them. Leave it out of 27. Even if it's 3 out of 27, don't reduce it to one ninth. Just leave it at 3 out of 27, it'll help you down the line. So those look good. And you know-- One of the ways you could check if you did this right, is all four of these should add up to what?\n  27.\n 27. And does it?\n Yeah.\n It adds up to 27 out of 27. So you got all your bases covered. So that's good. Okay, good keep going. How many have no painted faces?\n Four.\n Why four, which four?\n The four is right over here inside, and then there's four.\n Okay but let me ask you this, there's these four. But you said go inside a layer. And then you're right there's four underneath. But then there's another layer underneath that.\n So there's eight.\n So there should be eight. And one of the ways you know you're right about this, besides just hoping that you're thinking about it the right way. How do you know there's three painted faces? Which eight are you talking about?\n  The corners.\n The corners. So you know you're right with the eight, but these should all add up to what? And they do, so you're okay. Okay, good. So keep going and you're good, it's all out of 64. So that's a good start.\n  Will this still have one painted face?\n Well there is a pattern to it, just like the other ones. But it's fine if you can't figure that out yet. Just keep going, you've got the right number. So see if you can figure it out now for the 4x4x4. How are we doing on the front side? Everything good? So let me ask you this about this stuff. I assume you all have the same answers.\n  Yeah.\n So, you said one painted face, there's six of them. Which six? Just one color painted. Sure the center of each of the six faces. And there's six faces, so six times one is six. That's fine. No, we got 8 out of 27 for three. Because which ones are you looking at? The corners. No painted faces, there's just one in the middle. If you added all these up, what should they equal?  But what does it equal up to? Not 27. So, what's the issue? What's the deal there?\n  No idea.\n Where is there something going wrong? Because you know that one has to be eight. You know there's exactly one because it's the center one in each of the six sides. So, you know that has to be six. The issue is with the two painted faces. It's not eight. Now, you can figure it out by subtracting, and just figuring out what adds up to 27. Or you could go back and just look at those, how many of those have the two painted faces. Where are you getting eight from? Which cubes here have two painted faces?\n These ones.\n So that's four on this front side.\n There's four on the back side.\n That's eight.\n Two on this side, 10, 12.\n 12. Does that make sense? And that adds up to 27 then, when you add all those up. So now do the same thing for the one out of 64. Okay. Good. How we doing?\n These should add up to 64 shouldn't they?\n They should add up to 64. How do you get no painted faces? How do you get the four with no painted faces?\n  The center pieces.\n So, over here, let's say these four in the middle. But you're not looking at those. Those have one painted face, but you look a layer below that. And that's four right there. But you can go a layer below that. So that should be eight. So does that mess up something else? I don't know how you got the other numbers.\n So the equation for this, it'd be distance... divided by two to get three.\n Does that work up here? You're on the right track. You're thinking the right way.\n Minus two.\n Does that work? I mean, once you get this, I would try to do a 5x5x5 cube. Even though, I didn't write it down there. See if it holds up.\n Yeah, because there'd be 27 in the middle.\n That seems to make sense. And that'll help you on the back side when you get there. So these look fine. Let's talk about this one for a second. If you add these up, you have 24, 24, 18, 4. If you add all those up what do you get?  Do you?\n 60.\n  60. Right now you have 60 out of 64. So there's four squares you haven't counted yet. Where did they go? And you kinda know you're right with the three colored cubes because you know which ones they are. Which ones are those?\n So would we add it to the non painted faces?\n Why? You can't randomly-- What's the pattern? Which ones have no painted faces?\n The ones on the top.\n So basically, you have these four right here, but a layer below, right? But there's also another layer below that.\n Oh so it's eight.\n So that's where there's eight. Does that make sense?\n Oh yeah, I see that.\n So that's where that's coming from. So now it adds up to 64. It looks like you're probably good. Why don't you try doing it for a 5x5x5 cube before you go to the back side, so at least you have some patterns you can detect. It'll make the back side easier. But it should be a breeze now to get the 5x5x5 cube. Wow, Chris. You're on a roll. Smart idea, making a graph. And that should be eight over what?  Over here how many squares do we have?\n We have 27.\n And you got that because it's...\n Three cubed.\n  Three cubed. And the other one is four cubed. If you do the 5x5x5, it would be five cubed. So if you have an nxnxn, what is that? n cubed. So everything should be out of n cubed on the back. And you're right that it's eight out of n cube for the three painted. Why don't you try the no painted? That's probably the next one to get.\n  But what, there's the one middle.\n How do you figure that out? And this is where you gotta go back and look at the pattern you got for no painted faces. How did you figure that out? And maybe the numbers help, but maybe just look at the picture and figure out, how did we know how many had no painted faces?\n  Right.\n What do those numbers have in common?\n  Okay.\n How we doing? Well you're definitely right with eight over n cubed. That makes sense, right? Because always the corners in the cube. It's always the same. How did you get 6n here? And you got it over here. You guys have 6n in different places.\n Well see, I thought I got a brain blast.\n What?\n But it didn't work out. I mean, I felt really smart for two seconds. But I was thinking that, since there's six sides, it has to be six times something.\n Okay. Okay, that's not a bad way to think. You know the answer here was 12.\n Yeah.\n That was with the 3x3x3 cube. Does that work? If n is three, you would get 18. But that's not what you got on the front side. So there's some discrepancy.\n Okay.\n But that's not a bad way to think. Some of these things have to do with six faces. Like, there's some multiplying by six involved. You know the corner ones are gonna be eight no matter what. That has nothing to do with six faces.\n Right.\n Right, that's just the corners.\n  How do you do this?\n Go back a second. Sorry, a lot of flipping. You feel confident about these two sets of numbers?\n  Yeah.\n So why don't you try doing it 5x5x5 cube, even though I didn't ask for it. But see what numbers you get for that because it'll make the back page a little better. Because now you'll have more numbers to use and try to find a pattern. You guys have different numbers. Why is that?\n  What do you mean?\n On the front side.\n  What do you mean?\n Sarah has 8 out of 64 here. You have 4 out of 64 here.\n  Oh blood.\n Oh my god. Do you need to go? Go, go. Go to the bathroom.\n  I don't care.\n I care, go.\n  Do you have band-aids now?\n I don't know. I don't think I do. Go to the bathroom. Things still happen. So you have eight out of eight cubed. That's fine... We know the three painted faces are going to be which ones? The corners.\n The corners. And there's always gonna be eight. So that's fine. Eight out of n cubed. How do you figure out how many have zero painted faces?\n It's always the ones in the middle.\n Yes, always the ones in the middle. So when you had a 3x3x3 cube, what was in the middle?\n One.\n And what's the dimensions of that cube? 1x1x1. When it was a 4x4x4 cube, what were the dimensions of the middle? That you couldn't see.\n 4x4x4.\n Well 4x4x4 is the whole cube.\n 2x2x2.\n  2x2x2. If it was a 5x5x5 cube what would be the middle?\n 3x3x3.\n  3x3x3. If its an nxnxn cube, what's the middle? You kinda have it. If it's 6x6x6, what's the middle?\n  I don't know. I'm kinda lost.\n Okay go back for a second. You lost me at the 5x5x5 one.\n Okay, you know its 3x3x3. And the center was 1x1x1. That's the ones you couldn't see any color. 4x4x4 cube, what's the center?\n  2x2x2.\n If it's a 5x5x5 cube, let's say. What would the center be?\n  3x3x3.\n 3x3x3. If it's a 6x6x6 cube?\n  4x4x4.\n If it's an nxnxn cube?\n  n minus two.\n Times n minus two times n minus two. So what's the pattern for no painted faces?\n  n minus two cubed.\n Exactly. That's the sort of pattern you need to find for those first two now. How are you figuring these out when you actually have a concrete 5x5x5 cube?\n Is this what you're supposed to do? Because it's saying that n is the number of small cubes, so you can't just say it's a 4x4x4. n is representing the whole 125 cubes right?\n Right.\n So is this the correct equation for one painted sides?\n For one painted side?\n Yeah.\n For one painted side. Well, how are you finding the one painted face? Or how many painted cubes did you have here?\n I had six.\n Six, which six? It's basically the one in the center, but there's six faces so we multiplied by six. So, I get where this is coming from. The multiply by six.\n So n represents the 125.\n n represents how many across you have.\n Oh. I thought n represented the whole--\n No, I mean.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 1008 MATH AYA 1008edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.106599], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW05", "TW09m", "TW13", "TW15", "TW17"]}, "029 ": {"text": " What I'm going to do is we are going to use these projects to help students at our school. Mrs. Ess's class is not the only class that has had problems with students accidentally plagiarizing. And that was the original reason that you guys came here today: because somebody in another class had plagiarized something accidentally in Mrs. Ess's class. Your projects today are going to be used in other classrooms. So we're going to have a contest. We're going to pick the 5 best Powerpoints, and we're going to send them out to other classrooms to help students learn why they shouldn't plagiarize. Now some of you are already experts at Powerpoint. We're not learning how to do Powerpoint right now. A lot of you already know how to summarize because you learned to summarize in Mrs. Ess's class. So you have that experience. There was a disconnect where you didn't put the two together. So what we're doing right now is we're saying, okay, I know how to summarize; now I know how to avoid plagiarism. So let's start working right now. You have your rubric. Look at your rubric. If you have a question, raise your hand and I'll come and explain it. And we're going to start right this very second. So go ahead and get into Powerpoint, and do your powerpoint. If you're going to be doing something different, like making a newspaper, a brochure, or maybe a podcast then you're going to start working on that. And I am just going to walk around you guys. Our focus is plagiarism, and the way we avoid plagiarism is through focusing on summarizing. So you can refer back to your notes. Remember you used your Cornell notes the other day when you were here and we went online, and you took a summarization quiz and tutoring session? I'll be right there in a second. Yes? I'm sorry?  Okay, David? Yes, yes absolutely.  I'm sorry, I'll be back to you in a moment. Yes?\n \n I think that would be a great idea. We're focusing on plagiarism and we've learned about how summarization is one of the ways to avoid it. Right? Okay. I'm sorry. Sure. Very good. Oh, great, you're back up. Okay, tissues are behind the globe. Can you go get one for me? Okay, have you been helped? You have to know how to spell it. Right over there on the board.  How's it going Cathy?\n Pretty much.\n Take off the S. I like that though. It was good. You need some help Mr. Phillip?\n No thank you.\n You're fine? What you're doing is looking through here at all the requirements. So when you use your creativity to put this together, And I, yes?\n what does this word mean?\n Okay. So, multimedia basically means that it could be either Powerpoint or a podcast. So you need all of these to get the highest grade. So if you come up with something additional, you're going to get a higher grade. This part you did here is basically your method of memorization which would be number 3. How is it going?\n Pretty good.\n Now remember if you're taking a definition of plagiarism from a website, then you really need to say where you got that. There's a way of doing that. You're going to state where you got that, and when it was, yes?\n \n That's okay. You're going to use your own words. It's interesting how different all of these look. Yes, you can. You definitely can. I also have some books available. They're hiding. You could, Eric, use this book too. I've got you marked right here. Would anyone else like a dictionary? You can get an online definition too. Okay I've got them marked. You can find it easily that way.\n Can we use our paper to take notes?\n Yes, of course you can. If that would help you, Cathy. Have you gotten to Powerpoint yet? No? Do you know how to do that? Oh, good. Okay, David. I'm sorry. I've got it in this book too.  Is that your second slide or your first slide?\n My first.\n Okay. Okay, like I said before, the purpose of doing this is to try to help other students in our school. And a lot of you already know ways of avoiding plagiarism. Maybe you were even aware that you were plagiarizing. And we've been focusing on summarizing. Of course, there's another way you can do it. Paraphrasing is a little bit harder, but we're focusing on summarizing. And besides summarizing, another thing that you can do, with summarizing, is still giving credit to where it came from. Yes? Hang on.\n,  Okay. What was this Animoto video telling us? Can someone raise their hand and... Yes, Brandy.\n  Telling you not to plagiarize.\n  Telling you not to plagiarize. Very good. So, if that's what you were thinking, you are thinking about what we're going to talk about today, which is plagiarism. Now, I'm going to go on the internet right now and we're going to look at the definition of plagiarism. Well, actually, we're going to look at the definition for plagiarize, which is \"to steal and pass-off as your own.\" So, you can think of internet plagiarism as equal to...\n  Cheating.\n  Cheating, and that is considered...\n  Academic misconduct.\n  Academic misconduct, and that's when you get in big trouble sometimes. Now, we're going to watch a TeacherTube video about plagiarism. So, you will be using your worksheet, and we're going to hear a story about this kid named Billy, and you've got some bubbles here. So, right here in the central box is what you're going to write down-- you're going to write in this box, and you can't write anything yet because nothing's happened so far, but you're going to write about what Billy did. And in the little circles right here you're going to write the causes, why it probably happened, and you're going to predict what happens to Billy. So, we're going to start right now so I want everybody to listen carefully. Here we go.\n  Mrs. Calstad\n  Hey Mr. Harris.\n I have to show you this research report by Billy. He did it on horses. It sounds really good. The pictures are good, too.\n Oh, I love horses, let me see it. Wow, Mr. Harris, this is really good.\n I told you it was.\n But you know what, it kind of sounds familiar. I've seen a lot of students looking at this website called allhorses.info, and I think it's some of this exact same information. I think we should check it out.\n Let's pull it up.\n Sure.\n Here's the website, Mr. Harris, and it says right here, \"The horse has been one of the most popular domesticated animals for centuries.\" What does Billy's report say?\n \"The horse has been one of the most popular domesticated animals for centuries.\"\n So, it's the exact same sentence? That's not good.\n That's not good. That's cheating.\n And look at that picture, too. It's the exact same photo.\n That is the exact same photo.\n Did Billy give credit to his sources anywhere on that page?\n No. I don't see it anywhere.\n No. Well, that's a pretty serious thing.\n I've heard of students in college being expelled for that.\n Really?\n Yes.\n I think they call it plagiarism when you copy someone else's work and don't give them credit, and that's a shame, because all Billy had to do was write down where he got his facts, and give some credit to that photo, too.\n How could he have written his report differently?\n Well, if you look at his first sentence, when it says \"The horse has been one of the most popular domesticated animals for centuries, \" he just could've changed the words a little bit. Maybe he could have explained what domesticated means. I don't think that's a word that he would use a lot.\n I see what you mean.\n What could he have done with this picture though?\n Well, he could use this picture. If he took the picture himself, he wouldn't have to do anything, but if he did take it from this website, which it looks like he did, he'd just need to copy the web address down at the top, and that would be it. That way, he could give the photographer credit for that person's work.\n So, what you're saying is, it's okay to use facts from other sources, just put them in your own words.\n Correct.\n And, be sure to include, in your report, who wrote these facts.\n Exactly, and as far as the photos go, you can use a photo as long as you include the web address that's on your screen, and I think in library and psychology class you and I will work on that with students so everyone will know how they can properly give credit to their sources.\n We definitely will. That sounds good. Now we just need to talk to Billy about this.\n Sounds like a plan.\n Where is that Billy?\n  Okay, you have your work sheets. Let's start filling them out right now. Make sure your name's on your paper, and we won't take too long, we've got some extra time  as well. So, when you start writing, if you have a question, raise your hand. You're going to do the predicted cause and the predicted effects. Now, while you're filling these out, I'm also going to ask a question. I want to do a quick question. What do you think happened to Billy? Can somebody raise their hand and tell me? What do you think might happen to Billy?\n  He got in trouble with the teacher.\n  He probably got in trouble with the teacher. Anybody else?\n  Detention.\n  And possibly detention, yes.\n  Suspension.\n  Say it one more time.\n  A suspension.\n  Very good. Okay. Now, let's do a quick think pair share. Okay, what is the message of this video? So, talk to you neighbor. Let's think in a pair. Talk to your neighbor. The person sitting right next to you. Cassie, you work with Brandy. Brandy, you work with Santiago. Talk to your neighbor real quick. Your question is, what is the message of this video?  Okay, we're going to stop right now. Raise your hand if you can share, if you can share out right now. Yes.\n  He could use facts and research .\n  Very good. So, if he used facts and research information in his own words this wouldn't have happened. Yes.\n  He has to give credit to the original site, or the place he got it.\n  Very good. Thank you, Cassie, that was great. Okay. So, now we've done our video, and I just wanted to say that, as a sixth grader, I made a big mistake. Before they had the internet, I used an encyclopedia set and I copied stuff into my report, and I thought \"Here's the information, \" I didn't realize I was actually plagiarizing it because I didn't put it in my own words. So, now what we're going to do is, we're going to move over to our renaissance responders. So, right now, you're all logged in, and I am going to go over to that right now, and we have a survey. So, it's all re-programmed, and we're ready to go, and what we're going to do is, we're going to flip our paper to the back side, and you've got your questions right here. We're doing an anonymous survey to find out how you feel about plagiarism. So, I don't want you to feel that it's going to be something that I'm going to know your response to, because it really is going to be anonymous, and I want you to circle the answer that is the most popular response to the group. So, when you look up here, you're going to see a graph, and you're going to circle the answer that is the most popular and you're going to star the answer that is the second most popular. Okay. What is the level of plagiarism at our school? You have three choices, \"students do not plagiarize very often,\" that's letter A; B, \"about half of the students plagiarize;\" C, \"almost everyone plagiarizes.\" Go ahead and respond. Now, we're going to look at the graph, and we're waiting for everybody to respond right now, and I'm looking and I can see some people have responded and some people have not responded. On your paper, you will be circling the most popular response, and you're starring the second most popular response. Can somebody tell me what the most popular response is right now?\n  A.\n  A. Okay, and that was, \"students don't plagiarize very often.\" That's good to know. So, go ahead and mark on your paper right now. A has a circle around it for number one, and our second most popular response actually is C and E, so both of those will get starred. I'm so sorry, did I say E? I meant C. I think that what happened is, somebody made a response in a column that they shouldn't have made a response in that column. So, they answered the wrong question. So, you did it the proper way. We're going to move on to our question number two.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 029B LM ECYA 029Bedited.srt.txt", "Copy of 029A LM ECYA 029 A.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.0608945], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW03", "TW05", "TW16", "TW24"]}, "459": {"text": " And I'm going to look at what number that is and I see that that is Now, your information that you get, we're going to be writing in our chart here. So do you see at the bottom of your page, it has ramp with one book, you're going to write the distance that your car moved. Now don't write 20 inches, 'cause yours is going to be different, okay? You write how far your car went for ramp number one. Okay? Hold on just a second Isabelle. Now, I gave you guys numbers. And the numbers are so that we all get a chance to do every part of this experiment. The number one person is going to set up the ramp. So they're going to put the dictionary and the ramp, get it all set up for the group. The number two person is going to get to hold the car, and let it go, okay? And then the number three person, is going to measure the distance that it went, okay? Close attention . Okay, so you're going to all have a job to do. Now this is with the one dictionary. When we do the experiment next, we're going to try it with two dictionaries and see how it changes, okay? But for right now, we're going to try just one dictionary. Are there any questions before we get started? Miguel.\n Like, the first one goes first, and then on the second thing, like you try to set the number one does the second job, and the second person does the number three and the number three does the number one job?\n Yes, so everyone is going to get a chance to do every single part of the experiment, okay? So we don't need to fight over who gets to do the car, and who can get that, okay? Isabelle, question?\n But what if we do the same, each of us what we do?\n Oh, if that's what you get, if you get 20 inches on yours, then you write that down, okay? Yes. Angie.\n When you took... \n No, we're all going to talk to each other in nice, friendly voices, that's right. Okay, Max, last question, and then we need to get started.\n Are we going to use the rulers?\n Yes, you're going to use the rulers. And I know I didn't give those to the groups, but I'm going to pass those out right now, okay? Can I have you guys please quietly walk with your papers and your pencil to your group? \n Who's going to set up the ramp?\n Me. \n Okay, you're number two. \n Start it in the corner? \n It's a meter. \n Come on over here. Okay, get your paper.\n No, but watch out!\n Don't do it!\n Awesome! \n Okay boys and girls, once you get to your group, you can go ahead and get started.\n It looks farther.\n And this group, you may use this ruler.\n Okay, measure it. One right here, and then here.\n Are you okay? \n No, from here.\n From there, there. No, Ms. Sprano said from here. Nine inches. No, 11,11, 11 inches.\n It looks like eight. Wait is, oh no it's eight. Remember what Ms. Sprano said?\n No, she said from the front.\n Actually, I said from the back. Good listening Miguel. So how far did the car go?\n Eight inches.\n Eight inches, okay, excellent. So write down your information. You've got a pencil right here. Okay so the next step, Isabelle, Miguel and Angie. Is you're going to try it with two dictionaries. Okay?\n But number three is going to set it up?\n Look up at the chart to see who's going to set it up.\n So, who's setting it up?\n Um, number two. \n Okay, let's figure it out. Okay, now go to your group for a second. Okay now, is this how far going to?\n Yea, 'till we go.\n Well wait a second, are we measuring from the top of the ramp, or are we measuring from the bottom? So, you're going to put the ruler right up next to the edge of the ramp, and then measure to the end of the car. So how far did that car go?\n Five.\n No, it's to the end of the car. So how far did the car go?\n Two.\n Two inches. Now, do you guys think that because you're on a thicker carpet, that's going to change your results?\n It should go up like that.\n Do you think that the thicker carpet is going to slow the car down and make it not go so far?\n Yes.\n Yeah? Would you guys like to move to that part of the carpet?\n Yeah.\n Okay, you can move to that carpet, and see what the difference is. And you guys will have to share that with the class, okay? So try it again with just one dictionary, okay?\n So then one. \n Have to let the car go guys! \n We're going to try it with two dictionaries.\n Okay, so look at the chart to see who's going to set it up next.\n Oh my God, this is going to be loud.\n We're good Ms. Sprano!\n She said from the very back!\n You set it up. No, I mean, you let go.\n Who's turn is it? You're doing the first one. Who's number three? We all have jobs to do. Who's number one? Okay, so your job is to set up the ramp, which you did a good job on. Number two person, who's the number two person? So Giselle.\n I'm number three.\n No, she was two.\n It's fine, she's number three. So Giselle, you're going to let the car go, and look, Esmeralda is going to measure. Okay, so...  Excellent. Okay, now put that down. Now which side do we need to start with? Very good. And then we can spin it around there. So now you want to move it over so that you can measure at the end of the carpet. Can you scoot it over some? Very good, so how far did the car go? Seven inches, good. Okay, so let's write that down on our chart. Finish yours. Change this so it's seven inches. Okay, now what's our next step, what are we going to do next?\n I don't know.\n Are we going to try it with two dictionaries? Okay, so now, who's going to set that up? Looks like the number two person, so Giselle is going to go ahead and set up the dictionary, so put one more dictionary on top. Okay, good. Well, number three is going to let the car go. So now it's Esmeralda's turn. So you guys, what do you think is going to happen? Do you think it's going to go farther, or do you think it's going to be closer? When you let go of the car right now, what do you think is going to happen? You think it'll fall down? Okay, well let's see what happens. Woah, did you see how far that went? Okay, don't pick it. Now, wait a second, it's Edgar's turn to measure. So let's see, how far did it go Edgar? So we measure to the, 14. Wow, that went farther, didn't it? So your next step is going to be to do it with three dictionaries. Please go sit down in your group and raise your hand. Let's go sit down at our group. \n The car's there.\n 15 and a half!\n 15 and a half. \n 15 and a half. Who knows how to write 15 and a half? \n So number two would get to measure the distance on this one, okay?  Okay, so let me see how you're doing here. Okay, well can we try it again? Can we try it again? So, you're on the second experiment. So number three, who's the number three person?\n He is.\n Jose's the number three person? Okay, so Jose get's to let it go. Should we move this out of the way, or should we keep it here? So, are you number three?\n No, I'm number one, but number one set it up. But then see. Oh.\n Okay so, it looks like it's Jose's turn to let the car go. So hand the car--\n No, he sets up ramp.\n Can you go sit down please, and I'll be right with you.\n Got it.\n Okay Jose, try it. It's my car, put it right here and let's see what happens. Okay, let go. Excellent, okay who's measuring?\n Me.\n Okay, so let's measure. Now do we want it, are we measuring with inches or centimeters? No, it's right, we're doing it the right way. Don't worry.  Did it go farther, or was it closer?  Okay, so then I have a question for you guys, listen. If we put three dictionaries here, do you think it's going to go farther, or it's going to go closer?\n Farther.\n You think it's going to be farther? What do you think Jose?\n Farther.\n What do you think?\n Farther.\n Well okay, we better check it out. Did you write down your numbers? So for the second one it was 15 inches. Okay? Now, we're on the last part, that means the number three person sets up the ramp. Are you the number three person? So set up the ramp, where's your other dictionary? Okay, so then we have to use the dictionary, okay? Can you let go? Okay it's, oh wow that might be pretty cool, huh? Okay, so Devon it's your turn to let the car go.  And I like how you're moving all the stuff out of the way. Selena, you want to stay there, or do you want to move? Oh, okay. So who's turn is it to measure? Again?\n No, number one gets to.\n You know what, I think we mixed it up. Now, Selena lets go of the car. And Devon measures this time, okay?  Did you, okay, so maybe it's Jose's turn. Okay, go ahead.  Ooh, look how much it turned! Okay, so measure how far it went.  Okay, so measure how far it went, let's see what happened.\n Do we move the... \n 17.  Try it again, let's try it again. \n Okay, let's see, how are you guys doing? You got all yours finished? Okay, good. Okay, well I haven't gone over that.   Okay, boys and girls, raise your hand if your group had a chance to do all three experiments. All three. Okay.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 459 GEN EC 459 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.0890393], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Clapping"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW05", "TW09s", "TW24TW09"]}, "621": {"text": " 5.03. \n 5.03. All right let's talk for a minute before you continue with your little test. First of all, let's talk about motion. What do you know about motion?\n Motion is the way that you get from one place to another. It's changing position.\n Changing position, so just now, Bailey was running, was he changing position?\n Yes.\n Yes, all right so how do we know that he was in motion? Like, when he is running toward me how do I know he's in motion? \n That stays there and you can see him coming up.\n Nobody else was moving around.\n So that's our frame of reference. He came over there so we know he's coming toward us. All right so you guys did a trial. How many times did you run, Bailey?\n Three.\n All right so what are we gonna do now?\n We're gonna have to add them all up and divide them by three.\n Why are we dividing by three?\n Because we did it three times.\n Okay, you did it three times. You're finding your average. What's another word for average?\n Mean.\n Mean, good. All right so let's find his mean or his average. And then we'll record that and double check to make sure the whole group has the same amount or the same number. Okay, what did you get?\n 5.21.\n 5.21, is that what everybody has? Nathan maybe you redo yours and just check since three people have that. Let's name some things that are in motion. What do you know that's in motion?\n The earth.\n The earth is in motion, yup. But I don't feel the earth move so how do I know it's in motion?\n 'Cause sun is the frame of reference.\n Okay, so if I was thinking of the sun which is what they do, and the earth we know we could see the earth is moving and the sun would be your frame of reference. What else do you know that moves?\n Animals.\n Animals.\n Insects.\n Cars.\n Insects, cars.\n Boats.\n People.\n People, books.\n Boats.\n Boats . All right so how are we gonna find our speed because now we know how many seconds it took him but what's something else that I need to know besides how long it took him?\n The distance.  The distance traveled which is a hundred feet.\n So what difference did we do?\n Hundred feet.\n A hundred feet. Okay, so what's the first thing you have to do is measure out your hundred feet?\n Yes.\n You did that and chalk-marked it? Good, all right so let's--\n We're talking about the average time taken.\n All right, so let's do that now.\n 19.\n So let's talk about what that means, 19.19.\n Feet per second.\n What's that mean? Feet per second.\n 19 feet per second.\n So if I say \"feet per second\" can you explain that to me? What does that mean \"19 feet per second\"?\n Every second I would go 19.19 feet.\n Good okay, so if I'm driving in my car and my car's going 70 miles per hour and I'm on the interstate do I say my car's going 75?\n No.\n No you'd say miles per hour, bleh, 70 miles per hour.\n Can you tell me, Nathan, why? What does that mean \"70 miles per hour\"?\n 70 miles per hour means you're going 70 miles per each hour.\n For every hour, so that's good to know for vacations, right? Especially when you have little kids who are saying, \"Are we there yet?\"  You gotta figure out how long it's gonna take you.\n Are we there yet?\n Right, okay. All right you're going to go into your next part and I'll be right back to check on you. Who's the next person?\n Jordan\n It's gonna be Jordan. All right, Miss Jordan.\n Hold the longest tape and put it down right here so it will stay up.\n He thinks he needs one more piece of tape.\n Ready? Ready. Set, go.  1.76.\n 1.89.\n Okay, so why don't you write them both. Do you have two spots?\n Only have one.\n You have two spots; write one there and one there. That's what you do there, just like that.\n What did you get?\n 1.89.\n 1.89.\n All right let's come talk about what you're doing. So let's get the three kinds of balloons that you're testing. Just gonna bring over here. Dan, why don't you get the, um, come slide that over here so we can get that tape off and get ready for the next one. We might try that one here. So we have...\n A big round one.\n A big round one, a green one, okay.\n A long one.\n Okay.\n And a birthday one.\n Did you all predict the same one would be the fastest or do you have different predictions?\n Different.\n Different predictions, what do you think?\n The Happy Birthday one.\n You think the Happy Birthday one.\n Long.\n Long.\n Long.\n Long.\n Can you tell me why you think Happy Birthday and then you'll tell me why you think long.\n At first my prediction was the long one because it was not as much wind blowing against it. But now there's wind blowing. It blew it to the sides and putting more force against it which slowed it down and made the long go faster.\n It'd be like this wind.\n Yes.\n You had this big. That is a pretty good prediction.  Why do you guys think it's gonna be the long one?\n I think it's the long one because it's more smaller and the air can come off faster and it's more stretchier.\n Stretchier.\n Tight, it's more tight.\n All right, all right we had some \n ...wasn't going all the way so we changed it to 20.\n It would stop about maybe three feet away from the end.\n It would stop, so what did you decide to do?\n We changed it to 20.\n You moved it to 20. Okay so... What else could you have done besides move it to 20?\n Blow up the balloon more.\n Maybe blow up the balloon more. Maybe the little one wouldn't have worked though, huh? It's not that much in there.\n We tried the big red one putting more air but it still stopped.\n The little one--\n I think the wind kind of changed how fast it would go and how far.\n All right, so... All right... So let's come back this way.\n Watch out behind you, Megan.\n Dan you can go over to... There's motion in the wind, huh?\n 176 and 108.\n All right, so here we go. What are you gonna do first? Let's do the round balloon first. That was nobody's prediction, right?\n Nope.\n So let's do that one first. What are we gonna do?\n 20...\n Add both up. And then what are you gonna do?\n Divide by two.\n Why are we dividing by two?\n To get the average.\n To get the average. Why did you do it twice? Why didn't you just--\n And there's two, the two trials.\n Why you did two trials? Why wouldn't you just do one? Why do you think that would've been better to do two?\n Divided by \n Then we wouldn't have to divide it, we wouldn't have to find the average at all. But I guess we'd get a better result. What'd you get there?\n 2.35.\n 3.73.\n That's what I got, 2.35.\n You add these two together and you divide them. Remember this is the average. Can you have four?\n I divided by two but I got 3.73.\n Let's try again. On the calculator I always do things twice to double check.\n 2.35.\n 2.35. Everybody's good? Okay so let's go down to the bottom of our sheet and we are going to figure out our average speed. So what's our formula for that? How do we figure out average speed?\n You do 20 because of the...\n Okay, so that's when we took 20 because, you see, we had 30 on our sheet because originally we were doing 30. So let's cross out you changed it to 20. And I think it was Dan that said, if we were to probably, no Hannah said we could probably could put more air in that balloon. But changing the feet, that'll work. Now how fast did the first balloon go?\n 19.35 by 20.\n Look at your formula again.\n 8.52.\n Your distance is 20 so you're gonna do your distance divided by your average time. Good?\n 8.51.\n Okay and I'll come back to check on you you. All right, let's see how these guys are doing. This one's a runner. The line's over here right, Jordan?\n 16.\n 16.\n We're at the end of Nathan's so let's go ahead and figure out Nathan together. I'll come sit in your spot.\n They're in here.\n So to figure out Nathan, let's talk about it together while we're doing it. We need some more calculators over here.\n Wait, what's this?\n 641.\n Everybody please do catch up. Got your pencils?\n Wait, wait.\n 641, 575\n Tell me again what we're doing?\n ...average time.\n 6.08.\n Does everybody have six? Read it back correctly.\n Six point O eight.\n Is that how you read it correctly in math?\n Six decimal.\n Do we say decimal?\n Six--\n Six point zero eight.\n Do we say point?\n Six and--\n And--\n Eight hundredths.\n Six and eight hundredths. Ohhhh.\n Gotta get it.\n So let's look just at our average time for just a second. Stop for a minute and let's look at the top at our average time. How do we know who is going the fastest when we're look at just the top part, just the time?\n Average time.\n The lowest.\n The lowest number, right, 'cause he's getting in the fastest time. So now when we go to the bottom and we're figuring out the speed, how do we do speed? Whoever's the lowest number?\n The highest number.\n The highest number it's going to be. Let's go ahead and do Nathan and then we'll compare then we'll let Demi do hers.\n 16 point...\n 16 point...\n 16.44, right?\n Yep.\n So let's look so far at the bottom. Bailey, Jordan and Nathan. Who is the fastest?\n So far Bailey.\n So far Bailey, okay, so how can we, instead of looking at this, this looks like a whole bunch of numbers to me. What can I do visually just to make it a little bit clearer?\n Make a bar graph.\n Okay, we can make a bar graph with this. Anything else we can do?\n Line graph.\n Maybe get each person to make a line graph.\n Take your own three times and make a line graph with your own three times.\n Because that would be you, right, over time? That would be a great idea. So we can do the straight line graphs. That's a good idea with the line graph, Bailey. So when we make a line graph we'll do that at the end using this information and then we'll do a bar graph using this information. Does that sound good? All right, Demi's turn's up. Let's go.\n Let's see how we are doing here. Okay, we're at the very end. So which one ended up being the fastest?\n The long one.\n The long one. But I think that Devon had a very good prediction. I think his reasoning was good. See that wind blowing? In a race, when you're in a race, and you're running, or when you're in a foot ball team, what side do you want to be on if you have the ball and you're trying to get that ball to the other side? You want the wind to be with you, right? Because if you're against the wind, the wind is pushing on you, so I think Devon had an excellent... Good job, Devon, next time. All right, we're at the bottom. Why do you think that balloon was the fastest?\n I put, \"The shape of it, the wind went right past it.\"\n All right, remember there was unbalanced force. So the force inside the balloon, where was the force?\n The wind, the air.\n The air that Devon blew inside that balloon, the air inside pushed the balloon and that's what made it travel and it was an unbalanced force so when you let go--\n It probably was the fastest because even though the wind was blowing it's on a round part to where it would spin and the wind would just roll off of the balloon and it would just make the balloon roll but it would still go as fast as it usually goes.\n That's a pretty good idea too. It's kind of like when you're driving a car if you're on vacation sometimes your parents, you may see them driving behind a 18 wheeler. Why do you think they would do that?\n Because the wind blocks the--\n Because the wind is blocking.\n 18 wheel blocks it. The 18 wheeler's blocking the wind so you can get more miles per hour, I mean you can get better gas mileage doing that. If you ever see your parents doing that...\n Some people don't like to do that though because of rocks.\n Rocks, yeah it could be dangerous\n Yeah it could be dangerous becuase of rocks. Good job.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 621 GEN MC 621 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0829219], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["laughing"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["laughs"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["laughs"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW08"]}, "077": {"text": "  And then with Carl's example was down to MSB, marginal social benefit. So how can we put that into words? Marginal social benefit. Andrew?\n  Isn't it something that can't really be measured?\n Okay. Yes, and it's harder to measure, but how would you explain it? What is it? Think about what we did in the example and say like, everybody is benefiting from washing cars. Right?\n  So, what is... It is a social benefit and it's what he gets from the society.\n It's what society gets from you.\n Yeah, you're on the track, but it's what we get from his interaction. Right? Okay. So, it's the benefit to society for whatever market that is. Okay? So, social benefit, this is going to be the additional benefit, okay? The additional benefit that society... those that are not involved in the transaction, but from society get from one more unit. Okay? Now, I'm going to put next to this slash costs. Oh, just kidding. That's... that's the other document. So, down here is just something is a negative thing. So what this leads to... Do you think these two definitions lead to positive externality or negative externality?\n  Positive Positive, they're things that market itself does   not take care of. Okay? Market, obviously, in this example, does not take Carl and offer YTB for all of our benefits, considering it doesn't pay him at all. Right? There are things in society that, when you look at the actual amount someone is paid, they're maybe not paid to the extent of the benefit they get. Okay? So, right now if you flip over to the back, we'll come back to definitions later, flip over to the back. Oh, I'm sorry, on the other sheet, because I didn't put it on the back, on the other sheet you have two columns. I want you first, by yourselves, without talking to someone else, think of, try to think of at least two examples where there are things in society where there are markets for these and it makes everyone better off because they're there, and we all benefit from them. Okay? Go ahead, write them down. Think about it. You really think, you're going to have to defend it. So, think about, on your own, what markets are out there, things that happen, that benefit everybody, not just the people participating in the market. So, benefits more people than are just paying for the service, not just the buyers or the sellers of that service, but outside of it, people are benefiting from it. Write and think and then we'll talk about them. Write and think, write and think.\n  Wait, do we need negative ones, too?\n Just positive right now, we're going to go back to the negative ones. So, just think of the positive ones right now. Okay, benefit people, again, let's cover the definition again. Benefit people outside of the buyers and sellers in that transaction. Okay? So, we're not talking about just the buyer of someone who goes to a store and buys something and the benefit they get from it, that's marginal benefit, but that person buying this gives other people benefit outside of that person.\n  But, like if they built a hospital in the neighborhood, and it has a reputation of being not like, they don't have a lot of equipment, it's not very good. Then, could you like, the property values of the of the town go down.\n So, you could talk about... Okay. So, you're on absolutely the right track, so then that would be a negative.\n  Like, so what could always be a positive benefit?\n Okay. Well, let's talk about some of the negatives. Some of you wrote some stuff down. I saw Matt right away think of something, what'd you write down?\n  I said flu shots.\n Okay. Why?\n Because the more healthy people there are around the less you'll... I don't know. The less sick people there are, the more healthy people there are.\n Overall, right? Because, if one of you... Think about this. If one of us... If half of the class gets flu shots and the other half doesn't that mentality shows us that now that other half is more likely to get the flu, right? So, that is an absolutely... Flu shots. What could you make that into a broader explanation.\n  Vaccinations.\n Vaccinations. Okay? Vaccinations. So, go ahead and write those two down because those two are textbook examples.\n  Is medicine good?\n Medicine... It depends if it's contagious, but go ahead and be more specific, so you want to put flu vaccine or any kind of vaccine. It's a perfect example because that is a big issue right now. A lot of parents are talking about not vaccinating their children because they're worried about issues of autism that have been indirectly, slightly connected to it, but, for the most part, that has not been proven yet, so now we're seeing other ramifications of that decision. Over here, go ahead\n Pro sports.\n Pro sports, tell me why.\n People who play get paid for doing it and the fans enjoy watching them.\n Okay, good. So, pro sports, and we're not even talking about people that necessarily pay for the ticket to go. You might just get to watch on TV. A lot of times on the main stations, you don't even have to pay cable lines. So, you would go ahead and benefit from those.\n  If you pay, aren't you technically then part of that?\n If you paid for it then you're part of that market.\n  So, like vaccinations. You pay for vaccine.\n Okay. But that person that pays for the vaccination doesn't get it, but all of us benefit because that one student got the vaccine. Okay? So, that's the key. It benefits people outside of the one paying for it. So, that's why it's social. Okay? Sam?\n  YouTube.\n Okay. Tell me why.\n Because people can freely put up any type of videos they want. That uses creativity and people that want to hear music from anywhere can do it wherever they want.\n Absolutely. So, YouTube is a great modern example, because we all benefit from that kind of laughter, that enjoyment. It doesn't cost us anything. People do it for their own interest and we all benefit. Cody.\n  Education.\n Education. Tell me why.\n Students learn and they get to do well in the world and then the world gets some technology.\n Okay. Good. Like, you brought up tax payers. So, your parents pay for your education in school. Right? But, by the fact that you're becoming educated, even if they pay for your college tuition. Now, you don't give back just to your parents with that education, you give back to society overall. Right? To everyone, hopefully, in the world, one way or another, you end up giving back to society. For more people than are paying for your education. Okay. Yeah?\n  Clean energy, like electric cars or something, because even if you yourself don't drive one, that makes like, it improves.\n Okay. Anything green. Absolutely. Anything green like that. You can put green technologies benefit the world, which kind of brings us to one that we're going to talk about with a negative. Okay. Yeah.\n  I just had a question. Could you put stock, like since if someone buys a stock it raises the price for everyone else?\n Yeah, I've never heard that example, but you could argue that. It's still benefiting a select group, though. I guess in some stocks though, that's millions and millions of people, so, I mean, you might be able to argue.\n  I didn't know, because they're still involved in the transaction.\n They're only involved if it's their initial one. So, that's why I think it's worth some argument there. You might be able to prove that. I think some of the other ones across the board are a little bit more general but that's definitely something to think about. Andrew?\n  Well see, I agree with him, because when the stock prices go up people see that as \"Oh, the public is spending more,\" so that would bring the economy up, which would bring--\n That's a really good point because that's an indicator of the health of the economy.\n Right.\n So, by the stock market being high, it makes everyone employ people. Yeah, that's a good extra point to add in. Yeah.\n  What about something like... sorry \n  You were thinking of the same thing at the same time? Alright, go ahead.\n  So, like, taxpayers, and the government pays them and even if you don't pay taxes you still benefit from it.\n You could actually put public works down in your column, because now that we've kind of opened that can, we can think about parks, right? And I get the example all the time. There's a really nice park I live right by Glenn Ellen, and I am not technically in Glenn Ellen but right by there, then I go down there, I run by the park, I take advantage of that public area, and I add to my benefit. So, just by having that park, it kind of benefits more people than just the people that pay for it. So, any public works. Police, you could talk about firemen, they benefit many more people than the people that pay for them.\n  The people that clear the snow off the roads. Delightful.\n  Can I get some negative externalities then? Flip it back over. Let's go right on. Flip it to the other sheet and let's go to the other thing here and then we'll start graphing it. Marginal costs. Let's put that in our own words here. What is the marginal cost of these? Everyone think about it for a second. Think about it, write down your own definition. This is something you should know like the back of your hand at this point. In your own words, write down the definition of marginal costs.  Write it down,  you already did? ...Marginal cost... You got it Andrew? What is marginal cost? What is marginal cost?\n  The extra cost of hiring one additional worker.\n Okay. One more whatever it is. It doesn't have to be a worker. We're all thinking about workers because we just got out of inputs, we just got out of inputs and factor markets and resource markets, but, remember those units one, two and three, they had marginal cost, too. If you picture a monopoly graph, what does marginal cost look like on a monopoly graph?\n  Upward sloping.\n Upward sloping, right? So, we can think of the system in every unit. So, what does it need? One, the additional cost of what?\n  One more unit.\n One more unit. Let's just keep it like that, because input is just factors. One more unit, because in a monopoly, it's marginal cost of making one more unit. In a labor market, it's the additional cost of one more worker. Keep in mind again, these are both people that are participating in that market. So, I'm going to put... This is the same thing, except for it's the cost. So, you wrote it ready in your own words but make sure you've got that basic idea. Additional cost of one more unit. So, now we're applying it to this new idea. What's the marginal social cost of something? The marginal social cost. Andrew?\n  How much society loses for one more unit.\n Okay. How much society loses for one more unit or how much it takes away, or cost us when we make one more unit. So, we're going to think, and I'm going to add thoughts here. It's for all of society. So, flip it over, what are some examples, or go to the other sheet. What are some examples of negative externalities now that we've got this down in your mind. What are some negatives? Zach.\n  Breathing in pollution.\n Pollution. That again, he is on it, this is the textbook definition. Pollution is the most common example. So, what has government implemented to try to curtail pollution? What kind of things have they done?\n  Smoking ban laws.\n Okay, good, smoking bans. So, you could say pollution, you could also say cigarette smoke is a negative externality. So, government stepped in, which is the type of pollution. The government stepped in and said \"No, you cannot smoke in places of employment, you cannot smoke in any public area in Illinois, \" it's obviously done by state, but the state has stepped in to curtail this type of externality. Betty?\n  Don't they have pollution rights that they can buy in the market?\n Okay. Very good. Who do they buy them from?\n The government.\n Good. So, federal government actually sells pollution rights. So, that's another way that they deal with it. What agency was created to deal with pollution?\n  The EPA.\n EPA. So, the EPA is out there trying to make sure that only so much pollution happens. Yeah.\n  This is kind of more local, but like banks in Elmhurst, like they make a lot of banks, a ton of banks, but every single time they make a new one it seems like less use of all the banks like there's no point to them and it's like a lot of--\n So, you're saying that's a negative externality because there's too much?\n  Not just that there's just like... Say you replace a store that maybe some people use and make a bank and then there's less to do in Elmhurst.\n Okay. Try to think of the best way... I mean, I see what you're saying because that transaction takes away from your enjoyment of living in a town.\n  You could put something else there like a new house or a restaurant or something, just don't put a bank. \n Okay. So, how would the government fix that?\n  ...They could be like \"We're not going to let you buy it.\" The bank buy that lot, they could have said no.\n So, they might limit, they might say how many of these business could be. That's a new one. I've never heard of that, but obviously there's something there to that because you're saying it's taking away from the enjoyment of people in the community. It is maybe adding to the wealth of the community with the employment and the income that's being raised, but overall... True, no. I think you've got something there but it's a different lens. Andrew?\n I think that a better example for that would be parking lots because then it's just there and not doing anything, whereas for a bank it increases the competition and it increases the rate of... .\n  The parking garage closer to the Y encourages people to go down to the retail area of Elmhurst and it kind of does encourage people to... \n All right. I like what you guys are going with this, either one of you could make an argument with it. That kind of brings up another point, though. This is somewhat of, Alex, are you with me? This is somewhat of a, this is somewhat of an opinion, right? Because, now you're saying that there's certain things, that there's definite, and those are going to be our perfect examples like pollution. No one in their right mind can argue that pollution gives a benefit to society. They can argue that what they produce that produces pollution is helping industrialize, I mean, talk to China. One example. Their massive pollution, few regulations at all because they're trying to compete with other countries and step up, but they're not, they definitely would say it's worth it. But pollution itself, no one can say that it's good. Andrew mentioned something about the beauty of something. What are some things that people buy or do--\n", "filename": ["Copy of 077 SSH AYA 077.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.111121], "annotations": [["Instructor"], ["Andrew"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Matt"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Sam"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Cody"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Andrew"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Instructor"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Instructor"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Andrew"], ["NaN"], ["Zach"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Betty"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW06", "TW08", "TW17"]}, "606": {"text": " Okay, so put these where they need to go on the board. And Liz, your job is graphing. So, Harper tell me about your data. You, your plant is...\n 20 centimeters.\n  Okay, and it's grown...\n 11 centimeters.\n  Wow, that's a lot of growth, isn't it? Good job. And, Emma, what's your job? You were the recorder. And so, some of the observations...\n  The leaves are bigger. It has grown bigger. In the middle of the leaves there are tiny leaves.\n  Cool, in the middle of the leaves, there's tiny leaves. That is interesting. And your cotyledon has come off. Okay, so that's good. Excellent. Okay, so Coby, you're going to be using the board and putting your data up there. So, tell me how high, how tall is your plant now?\n  20 centimeters. Okay, let's go check your graph.\n  We're out of room.\n  I have more. So next time, you'll have a graph that will be, take two of this, and it will be 40 centimeters. Because 20 plus 20 is 40. So, here's your 20 centimeter line, what needs to go down here? Okay, now remember to help Parker with observations. \n Natalie does the board. Oh, Natalie, go up there. \n  Okay, girls, let's talk about what your findings are, because, just a second. Talk to me about what happened with your plant. \n Let's take a look. So, what do you think has, is the reason for it not changing? It was 10 centimeters when you started. It was 10 centimeters again on Monday.  Okay, but that's okay because we know the cotyledon was for germination. It's done with that now, and it can grow without it. \n  Is it a growing plant? Looking at your graph. Is it growing? So, maybe the leaves will get bigger and then,\n The roots will get bigger, too.\n  the roots will get bigger. The water and the nutrients. Okay, let's take a look at your observations. Roots longer, white root, cotyledon fell off, leaves are pointy, bigger leaves. Now, what did we observe about the growth? About the growth of the plant? What did we observe about it? I think we should include that in your observations. Okay, so observer should record that. Okay, boys and girls, I need all board job people to come on up here. Okay, now you guys, one at a time, are going to fill in your data. Make sure that you're choosing a new color. And I'm going to make sure that these have seen all of your, I don't think I've heard about your growth here. Okay, tell me about what happened . Joshua, you need to go sit down, work on the math. You're not ready for that yet? Okay, so talk to your group and see what you need to do next. Okay, so tell me about what has.. .  How about the growth? Right now it is, okay, so Alex... Yes, go get some. Now, your plant has, it's 12 centimeters now, it started at... So, how much total growth has...   Okay, so it started at the 10 and now it's a 12. So, can we make that, who's the recorder? So, we want to make that, because this is how much is it growing. Okay, so it's growing, and let's look at our graph. You've got your day, and now... Oh, so you went up a little bit too high here.   Let's take a pencil, Alex, and just do a small X right there, so that we know that we really wanted our bar to stop at 12. Maybe more so that we can see it. Keep erasing it, that's good.  Don't play with your plant please. If you're all finished, you should be working on the math problems.  Okay, now, let's talk about your plant. Okay, let me come around here. Tell me about your plant.\n It started to get bigger. The shell was growing out and we, it's\n And how much has it grown total?\n 50. Oh, five.\n Five, that's right. You started at seven, and now you're at 12, so the difference between That's exactly the same as my plant, too. What I noticed about yours, is over the week, it came out of, like you said, the seed cover came off, and the leaves...\n Started to peel and it started to break.\n Yeah. Okay, so the stem is really long. Let's put this up here. The leaves are bigger. Who is the observer? You are, okay. And, can we see something about the seed cover? Okay, so while he's doing that, we need to do some important things here. What about the date?  One 30 goes here, because that was Monday. One slash 30.  Okay, and today's date is... Okay, and that's it, because today's the third and this bar shows... Natalie go sit down. This bar shows that... Good job you guys, and you've got that added. And let's make sure that we're gentle with that measuring. You can work on it together. Molly, stay with your group.  You guys work on that together. You guys can work on it together.  So, you guys have had, what's the most common number of seeds they found?\n  Five.\n Five, good. How about the total number of seeds? Now do we know, is each dot worth one? Okay, so what's the total number of seeds?  So how many seeds in all? Okay, boys and girls, Sophia's finishing up. If you have math extension problems in your table group, please put those to the side. And I'm going to ask Chloe's group and Angel's group, and Derek's group to come and have a seat here on the carpet so we're close to our graph. You do not need to bring anything with you because we have it all up here already. Chloe come join us, please. Alright, Ashton, and Josiah you can move closer, so you can see, or you can stay there. Coby and Isaiah please come join us. Alright. Now one last person needs to fill in her data. Let's see, that would be me, and my height was 16. Okay, so while I'm doing that, take a look at the graph we just built. And think about what are some things that you notice about the graph? What do you see? What are some things in common? What are some things that are different? Turn to your neighbor and tell them one thing that you noticed about the graph.  Okay, eyes on me. Now you tell me, what are some things that you noticed about the graph, Alex?\n  That six and three has the same height as us. Okay, so group six and three, and you are group?\n  Five.\n Five, all have the height of, all the way across, and it's...\n  10, 12. Centimeters. That's right, so we have three groups that have the same height. Ashton, what did you notice?\n  So, group one, four, and your group, eight, they're all not matching. But all the other ones have a match. So group eight, and one and four are separate. They don't have someone who's kind of similar. So, that leads me to ask about groups two and seven, tell me about them, Blake.\n  Seven and two are the same.\n Seven and two are the same, they both are the same, why Keith?\n  Because they both have 20.\n 20?\n  Centimeters. So, what group on there has the smallest plant? Alfredo, what group on there has the smallest plant? Group four. Toby, and how tall is group four's plant?\n  Ten centimeters. Ten centimeters, that's right. Now, group four, Molly, tell us a little bit about what happened with your plant.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 606 GEN MC 606edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0211846], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Emma"], ["Teacher"], ["Group"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Group"], ["NaN"], ["Alex"], ["Alex"], ["NaN"], ["Alex"], ["Ashton"], ["Blake"], ["NaN"], ["Keith"], ["NaN"], ["Keith"], ["Toby"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW06s", "TW08", "TW18", "TW19", "TW24TW11"]}, "122 ": {"text": "  Do not put any button caps in the center of the ridge. Put them right on the bottom edge on each side of that felt. \n  Do I get a lot now?\n  You get what? You can't do anything down here. You need to help him roll that out. He's going to need help right there. You can put one in one side and then pull it down through there. One right there. When in doubt, put a button. If you're wondering if it should be in there, it should be. We're a little far apart, right here. You definitely need to put one, right here.\n  So it's under.\n  Reach down right here and put one in.\n  This back end going to um... Wrinkle? Before you put a nail there.\n  Can I nail the top part of this?\n  Yes, absolutely.\n  Because if I--\n  Your feet need to be on a button, regardless on which side you're on, you need to be on the button.\n  Please, nail that one right behind you.\n  This sun, coming out like this, makes this felt?\n  Hot.\n Hot and soft, and it'll tear easily. Now this is 30 pound felt, it's not 15 pound felt. So it's a lot thicker than what, you got two common kinds you're going to be putting on. Okay. Okay how are we doing over here?\n  If you lay it up there, the top won't fly down.\n  That's right. That's good. Communicate. Communicate with each other, right there.  Did that work out, work for you?\n  Yeah.\n  Stand this way.\n How many rinds do we need?\n  You got your left rind. Now, we need our interval going up to the roof. Tell us what it is. What you need to do on a three tab. How far, what is our interval here? Remember? Can you remember? What is it? Speak up.\n  Five.\n  Five.\n  Five inches, okay? Don't be scared. You know it. You shout it right out. Five inches. Five inches up. Every five inches. Be sure to measure from the top of the seam. Don't measure from here. It's got to be from right here. Measure up five, 10, 15, 20. Just go ahead and mark it up you're roof. Get your layout there and your layout there. Double check each other. Check behind each other. If the layout's not right, and we have to tear shingles back off, are those shingles any good?\n  No.\n What?\n  No, sir.\n They're not any good. Let's make sure we double check behind each other and get the layout correct. Remember. Team work, just like on the job.  Anybody can make a mistake. You have a couple of eyes on it. Checking behind, that's a lot better.  You can mark on this side. It's not going to hurt a thing. You can put a bigger mark on there, so you can see it.\n  Alright. \n Something like that.\n  Okay.\n  You can see that. That's not small and tiny. That's big. Look at the difference right here, Enrique. My marks, and your marks right here. You can, especially, I mean, this is relatively new felt. This felt gets marked up and scratched up. If you put a large crow foot mark, on here, you're going to know exactly where to hold that thing. Make sure that you get it where you can see it. We're going to cover this stuff right back up...\n, Now, watch this felt as I pull this up and down. See those bubbles in it? Right here, I got the bubbles at the top that means I gotta pull it down to get those out. You want this stuff laying flat. If it doesn't it'll probably show up underneath the machinery. If I pull it down too far, it pulls a wrinkle in the bottom. So you want to make sure you get it straight and get all the wrinkles out of it. I've got them out and I'm just a little bit below my line right here, but that's okay. It's more important that this is out right here, that it's on. Does that make sense?\n Yeah.\n So just make sure. Now you want to come out here at this point and get you one right here. Don't forget our nailing pattern that we discussed. Here, here, here, here, and here. You can feel right here where the plywood is. You want to put a button right here, and your nail line is going to be right in here on this. You don't want to nail into the fascia board. You want to come right across in here and put them every six inches. And about every two feet right here, and one occasionally. Be careful not to step on the felt. Step on the buttons so you don't end up sliding. Just be careful anytime that you're stepping on felt. You never want to step on loose felt. Okay? All right. Go ahead and nail that off. This one right here. See how you're doing this shingle?\n Yeah.\n We're gonna come back with a starter right here, turned upside down. This right here is gonna have to be cut off. So go ahead and just cut this off even, that'll be fine right now. This one over here, don't nail that yet. Hold on just a second. Come here a minute. You can do it that way. That's one way that you can run it down and cut it, or right here I can just take this soldier, just like this, and I can cut it off right here. Or I can just lap it up there and nail it like it is. The other soldier is coming down to right here. So just come up here and cut this off. Got your hook weight on you?\n Yeah\n Take and cut one tab off of the shingle, flush it up and nail it on and then go ahead and start your starter tabs up there.\n It doesn't have to be straight right? I just cut it?\n Pardon?\n Does it have to be straight? Just eyeball it?\n No, it doesn't have to be perfectly straight, just go ahead and hook your hook blade right here and pull it straight back. That'll be fine. Hold it down. There you go. Never cut back on your handle. These right here we'll be able to use for the caps on top so don't throw these away. Tabs always go in on these. So make sure your tab's in, flush it up, and nail it off. Once you've done this you need to pull a layout, and in the classroom we talked about layout on three tab shingles. If we're gonna go off the end of the building what are we gonna pull?\n Thirty, 36.\n We're gonna pull 36 inches, and we're gonna pull 30 inches. Top and bottom, topping your lines.\n All right.\n Does that make sense?\n Yeah\n Okay so do that. Once you nail this off do that, and then run your starters. You can go ahead and cut that off. The inches right here you can go ahead and cut them, come right here and cut it off right here on the edge of the plywood and then that will have you ready to put your shingles on in a minute. You got a hook blade? Y'all have it? You go ahead and do that, then you can do the other side right here.\n\n Go ahead and get your lines snapped, put them on there and mark it and pop your lines. Either way. You can do it either way, it doesn't matter, but since we're gonna go ahead and start these they need to be on the 30x36 way out anyway. Flush it up and hang it. \n Don't pull that down. If you do that's just gonna take and break that shingle off. This right here is establishing the overhang that we wanted, that inch and a quarter off the edge of the building; so we want our finished shingles to come right here also. When you pull your 30x36 for your layout on your three tab you want to go all the way to the edge of the soldier joist. Go ahead and mark that at the top. You need to keep them moving, you gotta have it marked up there. Go ahead and mark it up there, and mark it right here. Get these popped and then you can go ahead and get Darius to get you a shingle and have it ready to go and y'all will be ready to put these things on. Put your starter on it...\n Here? Thirty and 36.\n It's raining buttons. See that button landed right there? Y'all make sure that you pick these things up when you're done. You should be able to reach right here and nail this plywood on without any problem. Once they get right here, you can't nail it move down the line.  *Hammering*\n Talk to him, what do you want him to do?\n Put a nail right there.\n There you go. Brandon is telling you right. Y'all hold on a minute. What does putting a nail right there do? I mean you're about to put it right there--\n It holds it center, because that way no bubbles or nothing comes up.\n It's gonna hold it right.\n Keeps it straight.\n So really you can start putting buttons from down there to here, it's not going to affect anything. Because he's got that button in. From this point on we can't put any more buttons in it until he gets it where he wants it down here.\n He nails it off.\n Right, but you could nail this. Go ahead and start doing that. Working together as a group to get the job done is what it's all about. This is not a one man job, you can't roll this stuff out and do it by yourself. It's not a one person job.\n If you want to mark that and pull that up to where you can get to it there's nothing wrong with doing that. What you don't want to do is put your foot on that felt right in there. Watch about cutting back towards your hand like that. Just be real careful. There ya go. Mike, put your hand on that roll for him. I got it. That may not be enough to cap that ridge off. So we can roll it as far down as it will go and piece it if we need to. You need a button in it now. He needs help. Help him right here. Yes, sir?\n Where at?\n Hold on, come on the line right there?\n Yeah, come on right here.\n Is that on right?\n Yeah, next put the felt right here. As far as starting this next row, you got a line on...\n Thirty-six inches.\n You got a line on 36 inches, and you've got a line on 30 inches. We want to make sure that when you start this next run that you're not breaking. Let me see a shingle, right here, I want you to watch.  I've worked on several houses, the whole boxing  fascia boards and all this is rotten on the house. The reason for that was this right here. They put their starter on like you're supposed to, to allow for the throats of the shingles. We have no water penetration down here. But once you start this starter tabs up, over to your 36 inch line, if I laid this 36 inch shingle down and nail it off I have a straight avenue of water to get down to this felt. This felt will only hold for so long. It's going to get down here, it will rot it out and there you're gonna be. So you wanna make sure that you start this on your 30 inch line and then, give me one more shingle. Then when you butt this shingle up to this one, now what I have is I got my break right here in the center of the full tab and I'm six inches away from it. That's why our nailing pattern here is important. You want to nail above every throat, in the far line, slightly above, in a three tab shingle. Four nails, 1,2,3,4. Just like we discussed on the PowerPoint--\n Above the tar line?\n Pardon?\n Above the tar line?\n I can't hear you.\n Above the tar line?\n It can be in or slightly above. Most people are gonna put them in them or slightly above them. Your video PowerPoint was slightly above, but the main important thing here is that you have it to where... If you put them in random, if I put one right here, or in the middle of these two. I could possibly have a nail where I got a shingle breaking. Or I could possibly have a nail in line with a throat that's gonna line up on top of the next one. It's important to go here, here, here and here. The purpose of this tar line is when this sun heats it, and it heats up you have the next shingle on top of here it helps secure it down so wind don't take and blow it up and rip the shingle off.\n So it melts down?\n It'll actually seal and melt down to it. All right, you're doing good, but go ahead and make sure that you do this with this hot sun out here today you will wanna keep these cut. So use a shingle to square it up or your speed square. Mark your line and cut it straight down right here. You can nail it on first, that will be fine. Or you can go ahead and cut it before you nail it. You see this shingle right here, that's got the little slit in it? That is exactly six inches is what that is. So you can take this shingle, right here. Put your speed square up here, take your hook blade and follow along it and cut that off. Then you can nail it on if you wanted to do that. Either way, there's multiple different ways to do it. The main thing is don't just take this, put it on the 30 inch line, nail it down, and don't do anything else to it until you get up there. Y'all do it as you go. These hot days like this cool that down and it won't get it's form back. It'll look bad. So we want to keep it looking good. All right, how we doing?\n Good\n Good. What about right here? \n You need to put it along the edge, if you don't follow along the edge...\n There's three buttons if you started, one at the top one at the bottom. What's missing? One in between so let's get them in there. Jake you mind getting that one?\n Is that going to be enough to roll all this?\n If not, we'll get another roll and finish it out. Just go ahead and run with what you got. That'll be okay that will lay down beneath. Be careful about the top edge of that felt. Run that, y'all can stand on this. Get a couple more buttons in between here, we're a little far apart right here. I like to see two foot. Go ahead and hop up here and stand on a button. Get you a couple more in the middle, and then cap that off. Lay it right down the center...\n", "filename": ["Copy of 122B CTE EAYA 122 B edited.srt.txt", "Copy of 122A CTE EAYA 122 A.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.0319445], "annotations": [["Instructor"], ["Man"], ["Instructor"], ["Man"], ["Instructor"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Instructor"], ["Student"], ["Instructor"], ["Student"], ["Instructor"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Instructor"], ["Student"], ["Man"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW06", "TW07", "TW13"]}, "177": {"text": "  How do you know?\n Because my dad works .\n  Oh, okay. See, I want us to think about that, because that was something that came up yesterday. Sometimes we think, \"Oh that's only stuff men do,\" or, \"That's only stuff women do.\" But, especially mechanics working on engines and stuff like that, we think, \"That's a man's job.\" But you said your dad works with a lot of women, and Kyle, your dad's a kind of a mechanic, too, and he works with a lot of women, too. So girls, think about that kind of thing. Okay, thank you, very good. All right, now Carter come up, please, Carter? All right, Carter. Tell us about the job.\n  works on people when they are injured, firefighters work on burning equipment and carrying test hydrants, and inspect businesses.\n  Okay, so your job is... ? \n \n Say it real loud so they can hear you.\n A firefighter and a paramedic.\n  Okay, and what are the skills that that job uses?\n Math, reading, writing, computer technology.\n  There it is.\n Be proactive, begin with the end in mind, first thing's first, think win-win, synergize, .\n  Great, okay. So all of the seven habits, right? Okay, interesting, who's next? And are there women firefighters \n Yes\n  and paramedics? Absolutely. Good job, Carter. Okay, Taylor, Taylor Green. All right, Taylor, tell us the job.\n A machinist.\n  And tell us a little bit about what they do.\n Repair and  turbine engines for helicopters and tanks.\n  Helicopters and tanks, and they use what?\n Math, technology, be proactive.\n  Okay, very good. Do you think women can do that kind of job? \n Yes\n  Absolutely. Okay, so we said math, technology are big ones there working on the helicopters, tanks, things like that. Okay, next let's have Lexi, Lexi Wilson. All right, Lexi. All right, tell us about your job.\n Furniture showroom manager. I assist customers with furniture, purchases, inventory, the furniture we have on hand, update customers' orders.\n  All right, and we use what skills?\n Math, science. Oh, I wasn't watching you.\n  That's okay, not so much science.\n Reading, writing, computer technology. Be proactive, put first things first, think win-win and synergize.\n  Okay, now I'm gonna ask you a hard question. Science, the person with that job indicated they use science in a furniture showroom management position. How do you think they use science?\n Maybe they make the furniture.\n  The materials maybe they use, and stuff like that. Good, good job, all right, thank you. Okay, so we can see that all of the skills that we're learning in school right now, especially technology skills, computer skills, reading, math, even science, our parents are using those jobs, uh, skills in their jobs right now in real life. So someday, you're gonna be using exactly what you're doing right now in a job, as well as our personal skills, our seven habit skills, being in charge of ourselves, thinking about things ahead of time, planning ahead, putting first things first, good job. All right, now we're gonna take our group cards, and on the cards you have a job listed, one of the jobs that you're looking at in your group, and a skill that goes along with that job. What I want you to do is, as a group discuss, how can we show the use of that skill in our job that we have, okay? So look at your cards, figure out how you're gonna use the skill listed on the skill card, and then we're gonna role-model to the rest of the class the use of our skill and show how we use that skill in the job that's on that card, okay? So start discussing, and then in a few minutes, I'm gonna call you back and we're gonna start showing the rest of the class our skills.\n We're the paralegal. We could do, well for reading skills, we could do filing or we could prepare bills for clients. But to prepare bills for clients, we'd have to read you know, who they are, and then for filing we'd have to read whose bill it was.\n  Class, when your children get ready for heading where they go down to gym for the program this morning, we are right now in the process of calling kindergarten, we're gonna get them to head down the hallway to the gym first, and then we're going to have second grade come on down, third grade, fourth grade and fifth grade .\n Okay, so Payton is gonna lay on the floor, and then I'm gonna get to do a knee surgery on him. First I'll like get a pencil, pretend I'm cutting the knee open and pulling it, and then cutting the muscle, and replacing the broken parts of the knee bone with--\n Like using our skills, we can measure the wire right here.\n And we could measure how long it could be for the house electricity circuits, and we can measure how long the wire is, and somebody could be in the house and we could measure how long the wire is.\n So, let's do the thing we did yesterday. When you're laying on the floor and I'm trying to put the breath back in you, and then I ask Carly what happened, okay. \n So you two are doing it. Do you think maybe a table and chairs, and maybe a couch, \n Yeah, a sofa.\n and then you'll get over behind the table and everything, and then I can say what day and what time.\n  And that's writing down what? Writing skills. \n Writing skills.\n Very good, very good.\n We're gonna show like you, you would be like typing on the computer and you would be, and I would come up and ask what you're doing, and so the other people would know what you're doing on the computer, I would come up and ask what you're doing and you would say, \"I'm making a blueprint.\"\n Like, 'cause if we did use set up machines for production, and we use synergize, we'd have to work together to do it, and how do we do that? Miss Kimberly?\n  Yes ma'am.\n How do we act out setting up for productions, setting up machines?\n  Well, since you're act, you want to show synergizing, now what does synergizing mean?\n Working together.\n  Okay, so you need to involve... ?\n Working together.\n  Yeah, okay. And certainly with being a mechanic, you're working on, what?\n  Machines.\n  Machines, and so what you wanna try to demonstrate, is everybody working together.\n To build a machine?\n  Possibly, that would be a good one, I think. All right, we're going to go ahead and start our demonstrations. So I'm gonna ask Morgan, Landon and Abby's group to show us their skill. And tell us what your job is, tell us what's your job?\n A paralegal.\n  A paralegal and your skill is?\n  Reading.\n  Okay. Let's see how they're using reading.\n  Second grade and third grade, please come on down to the gym, thank you.\n  Okay great, that's good. Now what were they doing?\n  Filing, reading...\n  Filing, exactly, very good, good job. Okay, let's have Luke, Destiny, Payton, and where do you guys wanna go?\n Up here.\n  All right. Tell us your job.\n Certified surgical tech.\n  Wonderful, and your skill?\n Put first things first.\n  First things first, okay.\n Clear!\n  Okay, great. So what were some, Luke, what was the first thing you did? The first thing first.\n I had to gently cut his knee open and pull it apart.\n  And then...\n Cut his muscle and pull it open, and then get a mini saw and cut the pieces of the knee bone and replace it.\n  Okay and then what would be the last thing that a surgeon does?\n Stitch the knee back together.\n  Okay, all right, good job.\n Clear!\n  Good job, first thing's first. Okay, all right, now we wanna see Reagan, Mackenzie, and Logan, let's see y'all. And where do you wanna go? In the middle? Okay, that's fine. And tell us your job.\n Electrician that uses math skills.\n  Okay, electrician.\n Come in.\n It's over here.\n He's measuring how long the wire is.\n 3 feet.\n  Okay, okay. Now what were they doing?\n  Measuring the wire.\n  Electrician, and you were, say it again. Say what you were...\n We were measuring the wires.\n  Measuring. Measuring, okay so, and measuring is part of... ?\n  Math.\n  Math, very good. All right, good job, good job. Okay, all right, let's have... let's see, it'll be Josh, Alyssa and Taylor G.\n Our job is maintenance mechanic--\n", "filename": ["Copy of 177 SC ECYA 177.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.352879], "annotations": [["teacher"], ["inaudible"], ["teacher"], ["inaudible"], ["teacher"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["inaudible"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["inaudible"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["intercom", "inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["together"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["together"], ["teacher"], ["intercom"], ["teacher"], ["together"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["together"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["teacher"], ["together"], ["teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW05", "TW16", "TW17"]}, "176": {"text": "  Well I can start. I just kind of wanted to follow with Lina's going back to the very beginning of the book, and sort of I guess a response to Mariana's comment. I think that a big focus of the book is sort of that beginning story with the starfish, like at the very very beginning when she talks about how one girl tosses back a starfish and then she brings all the other people that toss back starfish, so it's not about making this huge change in one moment, cause that's never going to happen. It's about that one step where you inspire somebody else to take the next step. And since we are young adults, you know if we take that step now and we continue taking those little steps throughout our entire lives, before you know it things are gonna change. So even though it seems discouraging like \"oh it's really hard and upsetting\", and speaking from personal experience it can be upsetting, it's about continuing on and taking those little steps.\n  Yeah you know, at the same time I think there's something hard about it, but it's not something that is beyond our control. It's just--we don't want to appear confrontational. Because I thought we were having this discussion on Friday, I was listening in my science and physiology class to what people were saying, and was listening if there were any instances, although it doesn't count as racism, you count it as prejudice by definition, I was listening for instances and actually something does kind of fit. Because there was this one girl who was talking about how her stepfather was or her mom's boyfriend was really mean and was always cheating on her mom and yelling at her, and he said \"Oh I wish you were white, he wouldn't do that stuff if you were white.\" This was a black girl. There was this other, in my physiology class--\n  Isn't that not racism?\n  Well, that's not--\n  Do you think she was serious or don't you?\n  I don't know, but you know even if it's joking, it's still a pretty serious thing to say. And besides, there was a Mexican boy in my third block class who was making fun of one of his friends, some relative saying get a bean or a shnean . But you know, even as jokes these still have effects and these are instances where I could have said \"Well no, that's not an appropriate thing to say. \"That could be offensive to people.\" But you know I didn't, just because I didn't want to be confrontational. So obviously that's some fault of my own for not getting involved there.\n  Going off of what Tomas said about the ethnic jokes or whatever, I'm wondering if you're considered actively racist if those jokes don't bother you. Like I hear that all the time in my third block class, and it doesn't bother me. It's kind of funny sometimes. Because a lot of the time it's not interracial, it's the same race. You know what I'm trying to say? There's no Armenians, but I can't roast another Armenian. Should I throw this? This is not gonna work.\n  Laser it, bro.\n  Maybe you should just call on somebody and then throw it. \n  I think while racist jokes can show racism they can also show an amount of... show how comfortable we all are with other races and I make fun of my parents, I make fun of my teachers because I'm comfortable with them. \n  Maybe we should talk about that.\n  And I mean, I can  do it because we love each other and  it's okay,  it's unconditional. So even if they may get annoyed at me we become stronger from making fun of each other. I'm scared.\n  So going back to  what Lina was saying at the beginning and what Tomas was saying a little later is with the escalator thing, I felt that was a good metaphor for the system but it also struck me as a bit of a false dilemma. She makes it out that racism is the biggest problem facing us today, and not to say that it's not a giant problem but I feel like one can be passively anti-racist whilst working actively towards anti-poverty, anti-hunger, anti-war, and making a difference in the world whether it's in the field of racism or not. And then going back to what Tomas said about the... and I lost my point, what was it? It'll come back to me. Who wants to go?\n  I think Tatum would agree with you and she would even I think say that while you're actively combating say poverty, you are having a positive impact for, say poor African American families. And she points out the correlation, statistically speaking between ethnicity and class. But one thing I want to say in relation to some comments from over there is that I think that one thing that it means to become an adult, and I'm thinking what Holly said, is to suddenly be forced to think of global concerns and think beyond our own individual needs and wants. And I think it's really as simple as that what Tatum is asking of people. That she's asking them now you consider your duties to the people around you. I want to hear from other people.\n  I got my point for Tomas, it's coming back. It came back to me. I had two points when I asked for the yarn then I forgot one of them, and I just remembered it.\n  I want to encourage other people to speak up too. And we've got 10 minutes left. There's a lot of voices that haven't been heard yet today. What I'm gonna do is something that I'm gonna encourage other people to do too. I'm gonna toss it to somebody who's not wanting to speak and make them make their voice heard.\n  I'll keep it short and then I'll throw it to someone.\n  Okay. Toss it to somebody who doesn't have their hand raised though.\n  So back to what Tomas said about the confrontational thing, is it's really hard to strike that medium between either being confrontational or being patronizing. And it's the fear of the reaction of either one of those that I think stops most people from speaking up. Like either confrontation or you're appearing patronizing and therefore destroying racial relations even more. So, Samuel?\n  Yeah, sure. Well I was gonna say out of what Chris was saying sometimes racial humor can actually-- I think while sometimes it contributes to racism, and I have a problem with telling too many off-color jokes and gender-related jokes. But I think sometimes that kind of humor can start to eliminate prejudices and bring that into the broader dialogue and stuff. So if you look at people like comedians say like Dave Chappelle, how many can say that he's a racist person because he makes lots of race-based jokes in his comedy? On the contrary, I think he actually helps bat those issues by bringing that humor out.\n  When Tatum mentions the fact that she thinks there's no such thing as being passively anti-racist, I think what she means by that is like it's sort of hard. I actually got to mention you know, our society we have a lot of comic jokes and all of these other things here present in the system of housing and stuff is... unweighted or whatever. It's kinda difficult to... how should I say it? I don't know what I was trying to say. I can't put it out into words but anyways, I kinda agree and disagree with her. It's like you can do little things to change, however what I was trying to say is that it's a lot out there and it may be difficult. That was all I was trying to say. I don't even know. Here you go.\n  What I would say about jokes and stuff at times it shows that you know we're addressing it sorta kinda in a way, but at the same time it just shows how much we see it played out in our society. And then for some people that say it that aren't actually trying to make a difference it's like, I mean it's gonna be hard to make a change and be like \"Hey, let me correct that.\" Because to them it's just like all fun and games. But to us it's like, okay. Yeah. \n  It stopped. It died. I agree completely with what Laticia is saying. Although for instance how Sam was saying about Dave Chappelle, although people make jokes as they do address that in that manner, it's not like people make jokes so people understand that \"Oh, we need to break these stereotypes.\" I've come to realize that every joke has a little bit of truth in it. Obviously yes, by making these stereotypical jokes yes we're addressing it, but my point I guess is just it doesn't necessarily prove that people are anti-racist.\n  Alright, I just wanted to say the question, the prompt is why is there no such thing as being passively anti-racist? And it's because racism is so ingrained in our system and our being. From when we're born we're exposed to racism consistently. And because of that we can't be passively anti-racist. Our default setting for the most part is being racist. Not overly racist, but we are. So it's not possibe just to not be racist by being alive. Once you come to being in this world, you are racist. You can't change that, so that's why there's no such thing as being passively anti-racist. You have to work at being anti-racist. It just doesn't happen.\n  So I completely agree with what Wyatt's saying. The way I look at racism is it's like a poison and once you've been injected or you know, whatever to it, it stays in your system forever. And there's always gonna be a little part of it no matter how much you try to get it out of your system there's always gonna be a little bit of it in you. So before you can fix the people who have been exposed you have to get to the source of the poison and stop it. Which would be parents or teachers. I don't know.\n  I'm a source of it? \n  You know like crazy teachers who say the wrong thing and then students go home and like, \"Oh yeah my teacher said this\" and then they go and tell their other friends and stuff and they kind of get passed around. I don't know, it's not you. I'm just saying. \n  I don't believe you.\n  Yeah, I agree with Wyatt and Brooks because I think that we were talking about how Disney movies may have these subliminal racist undertones but at the same time, there are racial undertones to everything that anyone says, basically, right? There are always implicit messages which aren't necessarily said overtly which may come through to the way people word things. There are subtle subtle messages and the attributes come through peoples' speaking. So everyone's totally surrounded by all sorts of prejudices from all sorts of different sources from the time they can understand words. So, yeah.  If someone's gonna hit you in the face, it might as well be this.\n  I want to go back to what Brooke just said about parent kin thinking about racism. I mean, how many times have you ever hear your parents saying teach you a lesson about racists? They don't even try.  They might just give you some parental info on your surrounding. Or just say those joke you were talking about.\n  So you're saying that you think parents should have conversations with kids?\n  I'm saying that parents should know how to combat racism, and they don't even try.\n  Going back to what Ryan  said earlier, I agree because if they keep using racist jokes as jokes then it will become overused and kind of a clich\u00e9 so people won't want to use it anymore.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 176 ELA AYA 176 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.335054], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW06", "TW07", "TW08", "TW24TW08"]}, "050": {"text": " Do you know how to make a U shape, like this?

Eli, what was good about a sod home?  That's right, and what made them that way?\n Because the ground is cooler.\n Okay, the ground is cooler. Were the log homes good as well?\n  Yeah.\n Okay, but what was one bad thing about a log house compared to a sod house?\n  It's not warm in winter.\n And do you remember when we did a Venn Diagram about the sod house and the log house and compared those two?\n Yeah, \n So that was the bad thing about a sod home is the animals could fall through. What was the best structure to live in?\n  A log cabin.\n A log cabin.\n So that, animals couldn't get on top of it and \n If you lived in a dug out, Cayden, would you, if it came a big rain storm, would you rather be at the front of the dug house or the back of the dug out?\n  Back.\n Why?

Again. Trevor, tell him the definition of an altitude. You tell me I have an altitude. You have to tell me then what's the consequence of an altitude. Read the definition of an altitude. Say it.\n The definition of an altitude is that it intersects the opposite side of the angle at a perpendicular angle. I don't know how to word that right,  but...\n Somebody help him out. He's making sense, but somebody...  Yes.\n Alright. It goes through the opposite vertex and it intersects the opposite line perpendicularly, if that's a word.\n Don't say through because an altitude is bounded. It starts at a vertex and it goes... Okay, so! Now, Isaac, What should be the consequent step two there?\n  Right here?\n Yes. Whatever they gave you in those definitions, Trevor's and the improved definition by Trey, nobody said anything about congruent angles. What did we talk?\n  That they're both right angles.\n  That they're right angles.\n No, we didn't.\n That BD is perpendicular to AC.\n Ah-ha!\n That's what I got.\n Nice. That's what it is. So, just write on top of that, honey.\n  Right here?\n Yeah, the step two, you should have that. Right? You have to go with the definitions when you have a justification because that's what reason says. It comes from a defintion.\n  And why is that  because of...\n Tell him. Why is that?\n Definition of altitude.\n Definition of altitude. \n Okay. You see how when we were working with the picture, we put those boxes on the triangle. What did those boxes say, indicate?\n  That they're right angles.\n They're right angles, okay. So, that should be... And why do we have right angles? Somebody tell me. Why do we have right angles?\n Definition of perpendicular lines.\n Yes. That's a consequence if you have perpendicular lines.\n  So, I'm going to write, ADB and CDB are right angles?\n  Yes.\n  Yeah.\n Okay. \n  You guys, the rest of you might have started with the fact that it's an angle bisector, right?\n  Yeah.\n  Yeah.\n And that's okay if you started with that. It's okay. Doesn't matter. You could have started with the BD is congruent to BD. You don't have to start with a given, but that's traditionally the way we do it. \n I can't believe I got this. It's because of...\n  It's the definition of perpendicular lines. \n  What's this?\n Okay, wait. Breathe in and out. Now, let's go see what's going on. Okay, step to the side. ADB and CDB. Okay. Still, you need to have an angle, a side, and an angle. Do you have a congruent angle? After all that work.\n  I'm going to do that now.\n Okay, what are you going to put?\n  Angle ADB is congruent to angle CDB because the definition of right angles.\n  Nope!\n  Right Angle Congruency\n  Right Angle Congruency Theory.\n Well, I haven't...\n What is the definition of right angle?\n That all right angles are congruent.\n What's the definition of a right angle?\n 90 degrees\n It measures 90 degrees\n Yeah, yeah. All right angles are congruent is the Right Angle Theorem that he's writing.  Okay, let's see what we have. If you would number them, that would help. That's one. And what's the consequence for after one?\n  I'm trying.  I am old and somewhat blind from here. But I know... Is that a \"2\" right under that? At the perpendicular line, you have \"2\". What is that?\n  AD is perpendic...\n No, after that.\n  Angle ADB is congruent to angle CDB.\n Wait. He wrote it.\n  It's all jumbled up and it's all there, so...\n But, wait a minute. Let's make sense out of this because it has to flow, okay? You know when you have your perpendicular line, What should be at the  perpendicular line? The direct consequence if you have perpendicular lines, is what?\n  That the angles are...\n Somebody, somebody\n  That they're right angles.\n  I want to say that,  but then--  I just don't want to say  something that's wrong\n No, you're fine. You were not here yesterday. And it seems you're doing great. Hey, so, take the blue marker, so that everybody can see. Take the blue marker because I would like to re-number it so they can see it, okay? So, re-number them again. One is the given, the altitude.\n  So, you want me  to write over?\n Yes. And then that's two.  Now, what should be three? Don't put three on that one. What should be three? Somebody tell him.  What should be three?\n The angles.\n The right angles.\n Yes.\n Okay, now, honey, after you have right angles, what are you going to say?\n  That, uh, Definition of Right Angle Theorem.\n No.\n Okay, so right angles. What happens after right angles? Because remember angles are angles. I need to talk about angle congruency. But, you haven't said that. You talked about right angles. So now, what are you going to say? You have it there, honey.\n  Angle ADB is congruent to angle CDE.\n Okay, so that should be the next step.\n  That's four.\n Okay, you remember. Good. Great. Remember when I asked you at the beginning, when we first started doing proofs, to keep track. So, you have mentioned an angle congruent to an angle?\n  Yeah, right here.\n Not yet, we haven't touched that guy yet. We don't even have a number for that guy. He's just floating in there. What angle is congruent to what angle? Have you mentioned that one angle is congruent to another angle?\n  Yeah, ADB is--\n You just did right?\n Okay, go cross out one of the As. I don't think you specifically did this, but I've noticed that some of you. I've noticed in Abby and I would notice in a couple of you. Taylor, that you were always... After you prove something, you found it within your proof. You would kind of cross it out in here. Okay, I found this. Or some of you would come over here and actually write it here. It's like you're taking attendance. I need angle for an angle. I already have an angle. Keeping going. See what I'm doing here. I showed you this way back. Yeah.\n He's probably getting confused because of number three. How he put ADB-- because it should be ABD and DBC instead of ADB.\n  Wait, what, what, what?\n Number three. The original number three.\n  Yeah\n The B should be in the middle instead of D.\n It should be ABD and DBC.\n That's right.\n  That's why!\n  That's why! Yeah!\n  I didn't noticed that.\n  Yeah, I thought he put that.\n  You guys are smart. Yeah, that's how you got confused with everything else. Okay, so now, segment BE is congruent to segment BE because of reflexive property, so that's another side. And then it's given that BD is an angle bisector, so that means angle ABD is congruent to angle CBD\n  Okay, but the issue here is he hasn't listed that as a given, right? Just like people say, \"Well, you're making that up. \"How do you know that?\" And you just say, \"It's given,\" but you didn't write it, --\n Yeah, he did.\n Yeah, yeah he did.\n It's right there.\n It's number four.\n  He just did it wrong.\n  It's backwards.\n  It's all there.\n  So, that should be step... Wait a minute. One, two, three... four, five...\n Four should be one\n  Whoa.\n Three should be two\n One should be...\n  So, there's a one, two, three, four... and then five... Wait, five, right here.\n  Six right above it.\n  six, seven.\n  Okay, can you change the numbers?\n  Fix the numbers.\n  Yeah, please fix the numbers.\n  It's there.\n Okay, we got it. We have an angle bisector, the consequence of an angle bisector. We have an altitude, the consequence of an altitude. We have reflexive property, so do you have them all?\n  Yeah.\n So, what could you say now? The triangle... I'm going back to the black marker...   Okay, let's get him out of the hot seat, okay? Micah! Yes, Micah. You tell us, is he finished with the proof?\n No.\n Why?\n Because you said no.\n Who said no?\n You.\n But okay, you're supposed to tell me if there's something.\n Well, you have to put that... it is the... I don't know.\n Frank to the rescue!\n He hasn't proved that it's isosceles yet.\n And how do you prove that it's isosceles?\n I don't really know.\n That sounded so tough, Frank.\n Yes.\n Okay, you say, segment AB and segment BC are congruent by C... Wait, how do you say it?\n CPCTC.\n Corresponding Parts of Congruent Triangles are Congruent.\n I always mess it up!\n I can't do the CPC...  I can't do that. I say the whole thing.  Okay, now, Frank, is he finished?\n  I think.\n  Is he?\n  No.\n  Not yet.\n  No, he's not. Okay, why? Tell him why.\n Since you have the two sides congruent and the isosceles triangle needs two sides congruent, then you can say that the triangle is isosceles now because AB is congruent to BC.\n So what should be his number 10?\n Triangle ABC is isosceles. And that would be the definition of an isosceles triangle. Yes!\n  I'm so proud.\n It keeps getting better. I told you it would get better.\n  Teamwork.\n  I was stressing last night because I was like, it's so hard.\n  Okay, you guys understand what this means, but I'm trying to hurry it.\n  Good job, Isaac.\n  Yeah, Isaac, a good job.\n Very good, Isaac! One big clap for Isaac, one, two, three \n Alright!\n Yeah!\n You did good!  Okay, so. You know what?\n This is the proof, that the new program where I give you... because I want to make sure you get it... enough information to do this on our own, okay? And then, I'm not going to  write it out. We're going to talk about how to do it. And then you're going to complete it tonight at home. So, what do we need to do? What is given there? Jonathan. What's given?\n The middle one?\n  This one, honey.\n CB is an angle bisector of ACB. CD is an angle bisector of ACB.\n  Okay, what does that give you? Once you have an angle bisector? No, that's not it. Don't look at that one. That's a totally different proof. This is one that I'm going to give you tonight. So, what does CD being an angle bisector of angle ACB mean?\n", "filename": ["Copy of 340 MATH AYA 340 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0147425], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Isaac"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Isaac"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Isaac"], ["NaN"], ["Isaac"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Isaac"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Isaac"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["Isaac"], ["NaN"], ["Isaac"], ["NaN"], ["Isaac"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Isaac"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Isaac"], ["Isaac"], ["NaN"], ["Isaac"], ["NaN"], ["Isaac"], ["NaN"], ["Isaac"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["Isaac"], ["NaN"], ["Isaac"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Isaac"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Isaac"], ["NaN"], ["Isaac"], ["NaN"], ["Isaac"], ["NaN"], ["Isaac"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Isaac"], ["NaN"], ["Isaac"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Isaac"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Isaac"], ["Student"], ["Isaac"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Isaac"], ["NaN"], ["Isaac"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Isaac"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW06m", "TW07", "TW08m", "TW11", "TW13"]}, "603": {"text": " We all know it's splash. Just put it next to it.\n Your turn.\n Okay, let's see.\n  How are we doing? How many animals do we have? Do you have a few?\n We think mussel...\n It can be in the middle.\n It can be in the high tide and the low tide.\n Because it can move around. And then it eats clams and clams would be in the high tide.\n It can grab on to the wave. It eats clams.\n It says this eats clams.\n I saw the, of the mussels sort of in the mid-high tide one day.\n When you were out at the tides before?\n Yeah.\n Excellent, so you're using some of your previous experience to help you. Good, excellent. Okay, I'll be right back.\n It's a snail. The shell protects its soft part. As a hermit crab grows, it moves into a new shell. It may take an empty shell or steal one from another.\n So it's like war.\n I think that would be in the high.\n Yeah, that's a high.\n Yeah, I think the high tide.\n I thought it would be in the mid or low. But no.\n Well it could move down there.\n What's your next one? Tuesday, put this circle right on top of the clock. Same time. Same height. Wow, that's pretty interesting isn't it? Good for you. Oh, you're looking at your first one. What's your first one? Yeah, just line it right there on the clock.\n That's eight.\n Yep, like eight. Yeah, excellent. And Margo you're getting your first measurement? Negative one! Oh, awesome. Monday's negative one. Hello Kazhu, I will show you where you need to go.\n It's negative something.\n I don't know what negative. It's right here. Look here.\n  Did you find out they went that low?\n Yeah.\n Mine went to negative six!\n Wow!\n I didn't put Tuesday. and then I'm going to put a block under it.\n You had one that went really low. Look at that. Awesome. You set that up first pretty well, didn't you? Look's like we got Monday and Tuesdays getting done. Wednesdays are being worked on. Perfect. So much to hear, what it is you guys are gonna discover from the charts.\n  Let's do a worm. Whatever that says. They have a veil of flaps on each side. The worms usually stay buried in the sand. If a wave comes, it swims back down toward the sand and wiggles into it.\n I'm pretty sure that's low.\n  Yeah.\n No, how about maybe high?\n High tide.\n High tide.\n No, but the waves crash there a lot actually.\n Splash!\n There's more of the sand.\n Yeah, I think it would be splash.\n  Want to try splash on that one? Good. And you guys thought that because what did it say?\n It said it buries in the sand and if a wave crashes it has to wriggle back down.\n Okay.\n So, it stays in sand as much as it can.\n How many does Nate have? Oh, two.\n  The whelk? That's a scientific name. That's a tough one, isn't it?\n Ah, it's hard.\n It's hard, it's okay you can skip it. Just say \"look for the whelk on rocky beaches.\"\n \"On rocky beaches and on rocks, sift, or muddy gravel beaches.\" \"The shell of the snail can reach about two inches in height.\" \"It is a scavenger, feeding on kin. It also preys on injured animals such as limpets\" \"The snail has also...\"\n So, I thought the sentence said \"it also preys on injured animals, such as limpets.\" So \"preys on them\" what does that mean?\n I think I know.\n What do you think, Andrew?\n It means catch them and eat them.\n It catches them and eats them. Where do you think that would need to be if it's gonna eat limpets?\n I think it would be in the high tide.\n Oh, you've got both of them. So, you also might want to talk to Addy and find out what Addy has. And try to figure out where those guys are before you place your whelk. No, so Addy what do you think? What is one of yours? Let's find out what yours are, right?\n Under each shell. I think it's already in the high tide zone.\n I thought it would be in the splash.\n Wait, no.\n High, high, high.\n Yeah, high tide. Okay, the limpet...\n Guys, I thought it would be in the splash.\n No, remember you gotta, like, figure. Okay, I'll let you two go.\n I thought it would be splash because...\n No, I don't think that...\n The thing should be underwater most of the time.\n It says \"Watch for whelks on rocky beaches and muddy or gravel beaches.\"\n It could be in the middle.\n True. Yeah, mid.\n Okay, mid. No, you have to say where the other food is.\n I put it to high splash.\n Okay, you go, then you go.\n Guys look, too much heart. One that was lower than... negative four. And this is negative four.\n  What do we have? Margo, did you finish your graph? Excellent. How are you doing on yours, Joshua? You finished?\n I'm on Friday.\n You're on Friday. So, maybe you two should start setting up your circle. Pick your question, Margo. Joshua. And this is your question. And set up your circle right on there. Grab your graph and a chair. And sit in your circle off to the side there.\n I think it's either low or splash.\n No, not splash.\n Not splash. Otherwise there wouldn't be anything.\n Lower mid.\n I'd think low.\n No.\n No, remember at the aquarium, they were underwater completely. No things sticking out.\n Only some of the spine.\n Yeah, but the rest, it was just... boom there.\n I am doing it. I'm doing the sand dollar for my... report. And it's high.\n No, remember at the aquarium also, it was at the bottom of the tank. Remember?\n  No, it was at mid. I remember, I checked. And also anyways... I'm doing the sand dollar.\n Okay.\n  Okay, so Margo, do you have your question with you? So, everybody gets a chance to converse and talk about the answers to that question. Or maybe you might realize something or come to a realization about your information. And all of you can contribute to the answer. Okay? So, go ahead.\n Were there any patterns you noticed doing your graph? What are they?\n I noticed that first it went to medium then it went lower and then it went higher and higher the third, fourth, and fifth time.\n My pattern was that each time... each level started getting higher and higher and higher and so it's really high.\n Mine would go to 12, to 12, then it would go to 11, and then it went down to 10 and then it went down to nine. It went lower and lower.\n  And it was kinda like a mix.\n Monday and Tuesday were the same and then it started going higher and higher and higher, all the way.\n What was unexpected? I'll go first. It went lower than the average on the chart. It went lower and then it started going higher and higher.\n I thought it was just gonna stay in the negative parts but it actually went up to the nine.\n  In mine, I expected it to be some different levels, but it kept going higher and higher and higher and then when it started to go even higher it just kind of stayed the same.\n Mine went higher and higher and higher and higher again. Okay, who's next?\n  I am. Unless you want to go. Read your question.\n What was your highest tide? What was your lowest one? My highest was Tuesday and Friday. They were both negative one. And Friday and Thursday, they were both negatives. Everything was negative.\n  Everything was negative on yours? Wow! Negative.\n Even one below the negatives. You have five negative. Negative five.\n  Yeah, that's right because you're grabbing, you don't realize you'll get a negative five.\n That tide's really low.\n  Very low tide level, yeah. Margo has her hand up, go ahead Margo.\n On the day that was highest, was Friday. It went all the way up to nine. And my lowest was Monday and Tuesday because they're both negative one.\n Oh, and my lowest was Thursday. \n Thursday and it was 9.\n  Thursday and it was nine?\n Yeah.\n  And Maia what was your lowest tide?\n My lowest was Monday. It was about at eight and then it starts going higher and my highest was at 12.\n So, I'm wondering now if we look at all of our charts, all of our graphs, who had the highest tide of everybody? Who had the highest? So, you had a 12.\n I had two twelves.\n No, she had 11.\n So, it looks like maybe Callen and Maia have close to each having a 12.\n I have the lowest score. I have the lowest. I think Joshua got the lowest with a negative five reading on his. Anybody else have a negative five?\n No. I have a negative one. But no negative fives.\n  Okay, alright. So, whose question's next? Alright, I'll be right back.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 603 GEN MC 603edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.158451], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW05", "TW07", "TW08", "TW09s"]}, "043": {"text": " Okay. So, what's going on with this group? You go ahead since you did it.\n We made like a T chart.\n Oh, fantastic. Graphic organizing. Love it.\n We put the ones that we're going to delete over here and then keep over here.\n Now we're discussing why we deleted these or chose them.\n Was it pretty easy to choose the keepers?\n It was.\n Yeah, we agreed on most of them.\n What about the delete? Have there been some discussions?\n We had to think about the smart and the healthy and religious.\n Yeah.\n Okay. Good.\n Oh and stay in school. They don't have to stay in school.\n So, there were some that you had to discuss a little more?\n Yeah.\n Tell me some of your thoughts. Which was the most difficult?\n Probably the religious.\n And also smart.\n Tell me a little bit about the discussion you had with religion.\n Well, first of all we thought that it wouldn't be, but then we thought some people had different religions and other people...\n My dad has a friend--my dad has a friend that isn't a Christian, but he's still a really good person.\n It's just like as you grow up being a Christian, that's just what you think. But then as you think about it, that's not how you're a good person.\n Okay. So, you stepped back from what you knew and you looked around. Were you able to come up with some examples, like was it your uncle?\n No, it was just a friend.\n A friend. So, were you able to come up with some examples of people that were not religious people.\n Yeah.\n Can you tell me some qualities on the list that they have even though they are not the Christian?\n My uncle, he's not religious, but he's a teacher. So, he's helping kids and stuff and he's really nice.\n My neighbor, she's really nice. You can't even tell that she's not religious. You always think she is. She's kind and friendly. She's respectful. I don't know, just really nice.\n Okay. So, when we first put up our list, that was one of the qualities that were on lots of list--boom, boom, boom, then just religious. So, we had to step back from it to really stop and think about that.\n Or they could be not doing their best in school but they could be a really great friend or person.\n Very good. There's more than one kind of smart.\n Yeah.\n Do you think that having good qualities and keeping yourself with those qualities is another kind of smart?\n Yes.\n And you're right. I know some mentally challenged friends, people, that are some of the most kind-hearted people. Good discussion. Good going. Okay. Why  did you do happy?\n Because whenever you're sad then you just have that gloomy feeling hanging over you all the time.\n Yeah. And also if you're not happy all the time, you don't have it all the time, every minute--you can't just be depressed all the time. And then...\n Stay in school.\n Yeah. Why did we go into stay in school?\n Thank you, Lexi. Come on over here, Veronica. Okay, ladies, what is your question?\n We're going two ways. I kind of think that you need to be religious. Because if you go to church it helps you become a good person. But then at the same time, there's like people in the world that are really great people but they're un-relgious.\n They can't be religious.\n Like countries?\n And they're still a good person even though they can't.\n Also, we were thinking people that do go to church aren't always taking what they learn and using it in their lives.\n So, you have found some examples of religious that are not exhibiting other qualities and then people who are not religious who show a lot of these qualities.\n Yeah.\n Okay. So, that kind of goes both ways.\n I think we should delete.\n I don't know. I can go both ways.\n So, you can see both sides.\n Yeah.\n You don't have to be religious to be a good person.\n Okay. So, can you set aside what your own religious beliefs are that if you believe this way, if you don't believe this way, something bad will happen to you? Can you set that aside and just look at the person's qualities?\n My sister has a friend that goes to college with her and she doesn't hang out with her that much, but she doesn't believe in God. And that's her religion. But I guess that would be their religion. So, really, everybody has a religion kind of, but they can't express their religion or go to church and stuff like that.\n Okay. So, which one's our leader? Jordan, you're our leader. So, do you want to take another vote and see where it stands? Okay. You're changing in a way? Okay. So, where do you stand now?\n Those are all qualities that make up a good person, but again, we all had to make a decision on it. But again, other groups can have different opinions about that or different opinions on how to make a good person. So, we can think that you need to be religious but then another group can say you don't have to be religious.\n Right. It's all about what this group decides.\n I was also thinking about the Ten Commandments, that it has a choice. If you want to be religious, that's also putting that in mind.\n Okay. So, are you leaning towards deleting or keeping?\n We're just talking .\n How about you, Grace?\n I kind of think it's... I don't know. I think we should keep and then I think that we maybe should delete because you don't have to go to church to be a good person.\n Does anybody have a personal experience in their own family of somebody who's not religious that is a really great person?\n Well, like they don't go to church or they're just not like... ?\n Okay. That is a great statement that Jordan made that will give us pause to think. What does \"religious\" mean to each one of you? So maybe that's another place to start. What does that word mean? And then that might help you decide whether to delete it or keep it.\n Because going to church doesn't necessarily make you religious.\n You can just walk into the church and listen to your pastor's sermon. It doesn't mean that you're a good person.\n So discuss that for just a moment. Okay.\n What does religious mean to you?\n I think it means being saved and saying sorry for our sins and asking for forgiveness. So, that's like the main writing.\n In my opinion of being religious, I think that you take what you learn in a church's sermon and you use it in your world. You know what I mean?\n Yes.\n If it's a very touching sermon and it's what you believe, you can take it back and you can use it to help you go through problems or whatever and then I think also religious is that you're willing to share with other people.\n Yeah. You're not embarrassed.\n You're not just holding back and keeping it to yourself.\n No matter if people aren't religious and they'll come up to you and make fun of you here at school. You're just willing to put it aside. I used to go to a different school. I don't remember now. But he was a very, very, very good student. And for some reason, they did want to . I don't know why. I didn't figure it out. The pastor got fired because it was just a job to him. He did something very, very inappropriate that a pastor could do with another person within church. And he left because he was so embarrassed.\n Why would he have been embarrassed? I would have felt bad, not just embarrassed.\n And he was married. You know what I said about you have to be willing to share? Well, there was this one pastor...\n Let me turn the camera on you. Hold on.\n So, there would kind of be a way of saying that it doesn't really work out. So, if both sides are .\n Okay. All right. Regan, let's hear again what you said about the deleting, why would you thought you would delete it.\n Oh, I'm not the one who said delete.\n Oh, okay.\n I said delete it because I know people that are not atheist who are not--\n Yes ma'am. I will tell her. Thank you. Scarlet, Vicki is not here today. Thank you, ladies, for getting quiet when the intercom rang. Now, discuss, continue.\n They're still Christian but they're still just as good as any other person would be. That's why I think we should delete it. But I don't know.\n Okay.\n Maybe it's the way she put it because she said it changes you inside, but being Christian, it does kind of change you inside.\n Okay. So, you have a person in your life that you consider to have some qualities that make them a really great person but they are not religious?\n Yeah. They're not atheist but they're not Christian.\n Okay Do you have anybody in your life that's not religious that you find a lot of good qualities?\n My grandpa. He's not saved, but he still believes.\n I guess it just depends on how the person acts.\n Okay? How about you? Do you have anybody in your life?\n Yeah.  named Delaney, she's an older person. But she really, really likes  her house and stuff.\n And would you consider her to have qualities that make a really great person?\n Yes.\n But you would not consider her religious?\n Oh no. But she is not really atheist, but she doesn't believe in anything. But she doesn't believe in being atheist.\n So, we're kind of on the fence on this one in that some people think it needs to be deleted and others think no, it makes a difference. Do you know anybody who says that they are religious and they don't have qualities of a great person?\n Yes. Some people, as soon as they get out of church, they'll go out and do stuff that wouldn't be religious.\n Yeah. It's kind of like they don't have a Christian background.\n They'll sit in the church room and they say, \"I'm a Christian because I'm here at church,\" but really you go do this at other places.\n So, then I guess it all boils down to what do you believe or what do you think that religious means. A lot of people would say, \"Oh, I'm religious,\" but then like you said, spend the rest of the week doing things.\n Yes. But they're kind of being truthful if they say they're not religious and they're not really religious. So, it's kind of two things--so truthful, but they're not religious.\n Or maybe being a fake Christian, like sitting in church. They'll watch a football game just waiting for church to end.\n But maybe that's kind of worse than saying, \"I'm not a Christian,\" but also be a good person.\n Okay. So, you're the leader in this group. Why don't you poll each other again and see if they want to now delete other people.\n Okay.\n So, go ahead and ask.\n Okay. So, I put I'm not sure yet.\n We're still not sure. That's fine. That's fine. If we're not sure yet, we don't have to put it in one side or the other yet if we're not done discussing it. This may be one that the group can't agree on.\n I think it's a good thing to have, but you don't have to have it to be a good person.\n Yeah.\n I think we can just delete it. It is good to have, but people can be really good people and not be religious.\n Everybody agree with that? If you're still thinking, \"No, I don't want to say that,\" this is the safe place to say that. Nobody's going to kick you.\n Because even religious people can also be...\n", "filename": ["Copy of 043 GENMC043.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.111196], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible", "inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW08", "TW09"]}, "596": {"text": "  I can go into group two because that--\n Except this one is like, these two are like, both like pop. These two are kinda like both pop. Because water's not bubbly. This one's bubbly and this one's--\n  Coca Cola. Or Dr. Pepper.\n  Do you have a secret rule to use?\n We're gonna get, like, one of those blue ones and that could be like the bubbles.\n Because they're kinda the same.\n  Okay.\n  And this one, like--\n  So, I'm gonna make sure I'm understanding what your rule is gonna be. Does it have something to do with bubbles or does it have something to do with it sticks to the side of the container?\n It's the bubble.\n Bubbles and stick to the side.\n Yeah.\n  Okay, so one group is gonna be sticking to the side and one group is not sticking to the side. Is that right?\n Yeah.\n  Okay, great, alright. Alright, friends. In order to be closer together, to really see how this is going to work, I'm going to ask Anagelia's group to very quietly come and sit in these three chairs here. Go ahead and bring your liquids with you.  Thank you very much. And... What we're going to do is we're going to set up our rule so that it's up here at the front. So actually, Anagelia, if you don't mind, Callie and Natalie, if you guys could scoot down just a little bit and then Anagelia's going to join you on that side so we can see this front area right here. Okay? Thank you. So, we can set up one of our groups on this table and one on this table. For your, what's my rule, okay. So, you're thinking of your property and you're going to put the ones that fit the property here and the ones that don't fit the property here. Who would like to go first? Who would like to start? Okay, so Ryan's group. Ryan's group. Come up and set up one that fits your rule. Just a minute, Ryan. Isabella needs to come with you. One that fits your rule here, and one that doesn't fit your rule here. Just one, just one. One in each. Okay, thank you. You can be seated, okay. So, we have this one fits their rule, this one doesn't fit their rule. I can tell Bryson's already thinking about what it could possibly be.\n This one can fit their rule.\n Hold on one second. That's where we're going, but wait one second, okay. Let's talk about what we see. Any ideas so far of what might be going on here? Bryson, do you have one that you could bring up that you think goes in either space?\n  The bubbles on the top.\n Okay, so you think it has something to do with bubbles. Do you have one that fits bubbles?\n  That one.\n He's got a hypothesis. Now Lena, he's got a hypothesis about what he thinks it might be. Do you think this fits the rule?\n Yeah.\n Okay. So, now we need to check in with Isabella and Ryan. Does that fit the rule?\n  Yes.\n It does, okay.\n  It doesn't fit my rule.\n So, your rule should be the same as your partner's. Do you remember what that rule was, Ryan?\n  Yeah.\n Okay, great. Alright, so Anagelia, thanks for raising your hand. Do you have one that you think fits the rule or doesn't fit the rule? Thank you, Callie. Callie, will you check in with Isabella and Ryan and see if that fits.\n Isabella, does that fit the rule?\n  Yes.\n Okay. Anybody else who's ready to bring one up?\n  Oh, another rule?\n Another one that might fit or doesn't fit. Rigo, would you like to try? Which one do you think would go with this group? Which ones from the ones you have would go with this group? Bryson giving you a hint?\n  No, that one doesn't. That one here.\n So, you think both of these fit?\n The blue one, just the blue one. Because look at this one. It doesn't leave white bubbles.\n Okay, so if that one doesn't fit the rule, where would it go, Rigo? Where would this one go?\n This one--\n Over here, right? Just hold that thought for a just a second. No, this one we said does fit it. Right? Isabella and Ryan, are we on track so far?\n  Yes.\n Okay. Anagelia, did your group have another one to bring up? Okay. That one you think fits in this side, fits the rule? And Callie, you think this one doesn't fit the rule?\n  Look, when it shakes. Doesn't do anything.\n Okay, okay. Natalina, do you want to take a stab at stating the rule for us? What's going on here?\n  I think it's the bubbles and not the bubbles because that whole group, when you shake it, it has lots of bubbles. That one doesn't.\n Okay, so let's go back a minute though because you said two different things. Sit on your botton, Rigo. First, you said bubbles and not bubbles. And then you said bubbles when you shake it and no bubbles when you shake it. Is that the same rule or is that different? Is the shaking part important, do you think, to that rule? Okay, so can you state it one more time for us?\n  When you shake it, if there's bubbles, it will go that one. If it doesn't go bubbles, it goes in that one.\n Okay. And Isabella and Ryan, is that correct?\n  Yup.\n Excellent, so the shaking was the really important part of that, great.\n  At least for this one it's weird.\n Right, because right now this one has no bubbles. But if I shake it, it gets bubbles later. Okay. Excellent. Can you remember which ones you had in your group?\n  Yes.\n Can you come and get them? I'm not sure if I can. I'm glad you can remember. Can you remember, Rigo, which one you put out there?\n This.\n -  No, that one's ours.\n No, this is ours. Um, yeah. One, two, three, four, five.\n I think you've got five. These ones are originally from Isabella and Ryan I think.\n  Yeah.\n Isabella and Ryan, can you come back and get yours? Great. Alright, which partnership is ready to tell, to not tell, but to do another secret rule?\n I thought I brought a blue.\n Did you think you brought a blue one? You figured it out. Okay, Natalina's group. Can you put one on this side that is fitting the rule and one on this side that is not fitting the rule? Natalina, you want to check that one more time, make sure that's correct? Okay, this one fits the rule you guys told me about earlier. And let's leave this on the table. Anagelia, can you remind what the rule is? \n Stick to the sides. Anagelia, can you remind Callie what the rule is too? Go remind Callie. So, these two do fit, right? Alright, show us one that doesn't, please. Okay. Careful with the liquids, please. You okay? Alright. We actually got a little extra help here now, didn't we? We got two in this group that fit the rule and one that does not. Isabella, do you have one in your group over there that you think does or doesn't fit the rule? Ryan, can you sit on your bottom again, please? Watch what Isabella is doing.\n  Oh, cool.\n See if you agree. Ryan, watch what Isabella's doing and see if you agree. Okay.\n  I agree.\n Natalina, Callie, and Anagelia, thumbs up? Is that correct? Did she put it in the right place?\n  Yeah.\n Okay, good. Bryson and Rigo, do you guys have one that you want to put in?\n  Yeah, more than one.\n More than one, okay.\n  Oh, three.\n Oh. Go ahead if you think that's right. I think that's right, Rigo. Rigo, can you tell us why you put these two here?\n Because it can bubble. Bubbles in it.\n Because they have bubbles in them? Does this--\n  Does not--\n Just a second, just a second, Callie. Does this one have bubbles in it? Yes, it does. So, it's not bubbles and no bubbles. You're on the right track though. Take a look again. Ryan, do you have one that you can bring up and add to our groups here?\n  Stuff on the side. And this one, it goes away after awhile. Maybe this is the rule.\n Thank you, Ryan. So far so good?\n  Yeah.\n Okay.\n  Yeah. Let's bring up all the rest. Oh Bryson, you can go ahead and leave those there. You can go ahead and leave those there. I think we're okay, actually. If you have any other liquids to bring up--\n  This one.\n Bring them on up. And put them where they belong and we'll see if we can figure out what the rule is. Bring it on up, bring it on up. Ryan, bring that one on up and see if we can figure out where it goes. \n This one's confusing.\n Ooh, a confusing one. I love a confusing one, do you know why?\n Because it helps you think.\n It helps you think, exactly. It makes it more difficult to figure out. Would you like to consult with someone? Do you want to consult with Ryan? Ryan, come here a minute. Your partner needs your help. She's trying to figure out where this one goes. What do you think?\n I think it goes in no bubbles because no bubbles is the correct one.\n Now remember, we just found out though that bubbles and no bubbles is not the rule. Because look, this one has bubbles. This one, if I shake it, has bubbles. So, bubbles and no bubbles was our last rule. Okay. Thanks for your help, Ryan. Anybody else give Isabella some assistance here? Well, you know the rules already right, Anagelia? What do you think, Anagelia? Which one do you think it goes in? Listen to Anagelia, Rigo.  What's your opinion, what do you think? Does it go in this group? Or this one? What do you think? Even though you know what the rule is, can you help her figure out how to classify it? Rigo, are you watching? What do you think?\n  It goes in--\n  In that one.\n  That one.\n In this group right here? Okay. What do you think, Isabella? You want Bryson's idea? What does Bryson think?\n I think it goes in that one.\n Because?\n Because most of them kind of move when you shake them. But when you shake those, they don't.\n Oh, interesting. Let's try that out, okay. Okay, Ryan, come a little closer to me right now, please. We're trying out something different. Bryson just said the ones... Rigo, you can stay where you are, you're right close by.  No. Bryson just said something really interesting. He just said, stand on your own two feet, please. Thank you. He just said that these ones don't move when you shake them, and these ones do move when you shake them, and that's how they're classified. So, I want to just double check that I make sure that I agree with what you're saying. Okay, Bryson? Does this one move when I shake it?\n Not really, I can't really.\n Try it out.\n Okay.\n See what you think.\n It kinda does.\n Does this one move when you shake it?\n Yes.\n  Yes, okay.\n Oh, it sticks on the walls.\n Ah-ha. So, are you amending your rule? Are you saying that the rule is it sticks on the sides?\n Yes.\n So, this group right here is--\n  Ding ding ding ding ding ding.\n  This group right here is the one's that stick on the sides?\n  Yes.\n Ding ding ding ding ding. Ring the bell, ring the bell.\n  But we still haven't figured out, even if we know that that's what the secret rule is, where does this one go?\n That one.\n  That one, that one.\n Okay, Natalina. Let's take your opinion first. Rigo, we're listening to Natalina. And then we'll hear from you, okay. Go ahead, Natalina.\n I don't think it follows our rule.\n  It does.\n  You think it's totally out here, it's separate? It's not in either category?\n  No, I don't think it goes in this one.\n  You don't think it goes in this one?\n No, I do think it goes--\n  Because?\n Because it doesn't really stick to the walls.\n  It doesn't really stick to the walls. Okay, you wanna hold it, make sure?\n  Stick to the--\n  Other opinions? Other opinions? Anagelia, I couldn't hear you. Could you say it louder so the group can hear you? Go ahead.\n It should go there because when you move it, some parts stick to the wall and some parts...\n  When you move it?\n It sticks to the part.\n  It does stick to the walls?\n Yeah.\n  Okay.\n  It's dirty.\n  Isabella, what do you think?\n I think it should go in this one because it kind of... It sticks to the wall at first, and then it goes down. So, and then doesn't stick to the wall .\n Okay, it sticks to the wall first, and then it doesn't, so you think it goes in this one? May I have it just for a minute? One thing I'm noticing that's a little confusing for me, if I look at this one compared to all the others, this is the only one that's not colored in this group. Does that make it feel like these ones are stickier because they're colored somehow? So, this one's not as sticky because it's less colored maybe? I don't know. So, you're saying it sticks at first, but then not so much after that. Can we tell how much this one sticks?\n  No.\n  Yeah.\n  Yeah.\n It really sticks.\n It really sticks. How about this one, can you tell how much this one sticks?\n  Yeah.\n  It kinda sticks.\n  That does stick .\n  Most of it.\n Some of it.\n  That does.\n So it sticks, but it is--\n  Most of it goes away and some stays.\n Some goes away and some stays--\n", "filename": ["Copy of 596 GEN EC 596edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.0111125], "annotations": [["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Bryson"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Ryan"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Isabella"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Isabella"], ["NaN"], ["Callie"], ["NaN"], ["Natalina"], ["NaN"], ["Natalina"], ["NaN"], ["Isabella"], ["NaN"], ["Bryson"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Anagelie"], ["Voiceover"], ["Anagelie"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Bryson"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Natalina"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW09s"]}, "107": {"text": " Like the chocolate one with the strawberries that we looked at, that is going to serve approximately 24 people. So if you multiple that by two that's approximately $48 that you should charge if you're going to charge for your cakes. Now it's going to depend on did you really put that much time, energy and effort into it and do you feel like you really need to charge that? That's going to have a little bit of basis to how much you are going to charge, but that will kind of give you an idea what to charge for your cakes. Think about it too, serving sizes for cakes are typically two inches square. They're small, so when you are thinking, \"But that's a little cake\" well, serving size is tiny. It's not that you are going to serve them a whole meal out of cake. It's just for them to get a taste. Sculpted cakes like the catfish cake that we looked at, $100 plus. When I looked these up specifically for something as big as that catfish cake because it was a pretty good size catfish cake. We tried to make it, as realistic as possible and it was about this tall. So probably somewhere at $150, $200 level had we bought that at a bakery. The wedding cake, like Jessie's wedding cake that we've seen, somewhere in the neighborhood of $600 because it was a seven tiered masterpiece as well. Who has a question? Come on somebody has got a question.\n I wanna make a 3D cake.\n Okay, when do you wanna make one?\n I don't know.\n They're fun! So if you were going to make a 3D cake, what would you make?\n Catfish!\n Okay! Britney's making a catfish! Okay, Erica's making a dinosaur. Oh, my favorite. Piggies, butterflies, what else? What would you like to try? Penguin, duck, basketball, panda bear would be cute.\n A tire.\n Brandi, I wanna see your tire cake when you get that done. A monkey would be fun. \n That would be really cute.\n So you guys are starting to think 3D. We need to be thinking about your roses, too. Because we gotta work on those roses and get that technique down. Let's go over to our table, and I'll show you about making those roses. Okay, so when we get our snow day tomorrow I expect you to go home and practice, practice, practice, practice, practice. If it's snow we probably will get out. Watch Facebook, Brandi. Or listen to the news. That's how we'll find out. I always post it to my Facebook whenever they tell us. You guys already know about fixing your pastry bags, and this one is already fixed and it's all ready to go. You know me, I like wrapping it up. One of my just little tricks I like to use for this, if it starts getting sticky on the outside-- Which actually I know you have struggled with this-- these are not my friends. These are my friends. That's my first tip. My second tip is if you're going to use a plastic bag, take a paper towel and just turn it into your handle. And the other thing is, don't fill your bag so full. It really only needs to be filled to about halfway, maybe a little bit more than halfway, okay? Then what you'll do is you'll start rolling it down. As you're rolling it down, typically what I do first is I fold it in kind of at a triangle. Then I start rolling it down. The reason for that is so when I start putting pressure on it's got both those folds and then another fold to keep it from escaping. Other people like to do the toothpaste thing and twist. It's totally up to you how you want to do that. Either one is totally acceptable. Just feel what works best for you, okay? Then I make my little handle out of my paper towel. Remember on the tips. You will notice on the tips, especially the Wilton tips, has a number. That number is representative of how big the hole is. The larger the number the larger the hole. That works on the writing tips. Someone tell me what number is on that one. Okay, tell me what number is on that one, Erica. It's on the outside. Okay, yours is a number 12.\n Five.\n You've got a number five.\n It says a 230.\n Okay a 230.\n One.\n Okay, and why. A one what? A one M, that means one monster. No, I don't know what the M stands for. What is the difference though between this tip and this tip? They're pretty much the same thing. \n What would you use this one for?\n For big cakes.\n Or for?\n Wait, don't! I got this!\n You've got it, okay come on, Ashley. What would you use it for?\n  Borders? Borders!\n Yes, great answer! Absolutely. I'm telling you by the time you have finished your masterpiece and you're ready to do the borders, get the big ones cause you're ready to be done with it. If you pick one of these little teeny tiny ones, by that time you're sick of working with frosting and you're ready to do something else. But this one's just a number 16. See how tiny that is? Okay, rose tips. The bigger the number the bigger the holes. Also on your rose tip, make sure that the large opening end is going down. If this is awkward for you, all you have to do to adjust your tip, loosen it and then twist it around, and then tighten your tip. You don't want to tighten it so much that it's gonna take a pair of pliers to get it loose, okay? Let's see if I can get this back in business. Okay, you've got your rose nails. You're just going to put a little squirt of frosting, and it doesn't have to be very big... and I'm making a big mess now. Hold it down. Lay it straight down on your waxed paper and now you've got your basis for your rose. This is what we're gonna build the roses on. We have to make a pyramid of frosting to start out with. Remember that on the Power Point? The first one I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna rotate this counter-clockwise and make my little pyramid. See that little circle in the middle? That's going to be the very inside of the rosebud. Actually you could pull these off after you let them set up. Stick them on a plate or on a cookie sheet, stick them in the freezer, and you could have lots of little rosebuds to set on your cake. Just add your little leaves add your little vines and make you a really pretty little rosebush out of that. If you want it a little bit bigger, you just squeeze and rotate all at the same time. It's about pressure and release. So, if you wanted a little rose you would pull it off right about now. If you want a little bit bigger, we're gonna build it up. My frosting is getting warm, but that's okay. There's a little bit bigger one. It's starting to flop over on me because it's getting really warm in here. The more petals you add to the outside, the bigger your rose is going to be. Did you see that? It just about flew onto the floor.\n Could you tell me what this would be used for?\n Yes! That one is actually to decorate cupcakes. So if we had a whole bunch of cupcakes this is so you can do some really delicate work inside the very delicate areas. Like if you have them all lined up and you're trying to do them really fast, you can just do that. Usually what they will do that for is you know the little curly things that look like a little snake on the top? Have you seen them? They just go \"shhhhh.\" That's what they use that for. It kind of is fun. One other way that you can do your frosting pyramid is just go straight down and squeeze and just bring it straight up. So now we've got our cute little middle of our cute little rose going. Yeah, it sticks straight up and we're just gonna wrap our little petals around it. There we go. See how cute that is? It looks just like one that you just picked right off my little rosebush. Some of my white roses at home look like that. That one is cute that one's a good one. Let's see if I can finish this off. We'll do this one tiny. The smaller you want to make them, you just add a smidge of pressure instead of a lot of pressure. If you add a lot of pressure you're gonna make a big rose. It is, it's getting really warm. Who has a question about making these cute little roses? Okay, and I know you guys are masters at using your little star tips for shell borders. All right, so lets see what you can do. I think you got your tables set. Who would like to use this tip. Simone? Do you need a rose tip? Okay. I'll come around and check on you and see how you're doing. I want to see your masterpieces. I wanna see a couple of good roses from each of you. Kimberly, do you all need a rose tip over here? Do you need that? Okay. Sorry, let me get out of your way.\n Do we just do one or two?\n I want you to practice your borders and I want you to practice your rose tips. So if you have a rose tip at your table you'll probably have to share. I'll come around and check on you and see how it's going and if you have any problems or questions let me know.\n I have a question. \n That is a good question. It should be but it's not. Don't use this one. This works best if you take your bag and just snip it and just drop it straight back in the bag. Because this coupler is not designed to fit on this particular one. I'll get you a different one you can try. Brandi, have you used the super star one that makes-- have you used the leaf tip yet?\n No.\n Let's try leaves. The big giant one? This will not fit on here with your coupler. You'll have to use a different frosting bag. Most everything else that's out you can use. This one-- actually you might have fun with this one. This one makes swirlies. Cool, it just makes lines you just zigzag it. \n All the star tips are right here.\n Err, not the star but the rose.\n No, I think all of them are out. You guys will have to wait and trade out with each other. Yep, they're all out.\n I just suck at this.\n No you don't! Let me see. Start with this, Christina. Hold your handle. Handles are our friends.\n Ooh, it looks like a square rose!\n It does look like a square rose, that's cool. Okay, Britney make sure the big end goes to the bottom. The small end goes to the top. Remember your angles, too. 45 and these to Brandi and I'll be right back. Brandi? Here.\n How do I make this one work?\n Oh, this one is kind of fun. This one quite literally is something you'd finish off, like if you're making grass you just kind of swirl it around. You can do it like this. Yeah, there are two lines. Like if you wanted to do ziggy zags. You can do circles. You know like that. It's all about your pressure. Oh! What happened? What happened?\n They're laughing at my rose.\n What's wrong with it? That's a good start. Keep building on it. Now remember Leticia, this big part right here on this side-- that goes down. There you go. If it's not in the right location You may want to unscrew this and realign this. Try that, see if that works better for ya. Then remember you're twisting all at the same time. You're making like upside down U's, remember? Oh, you did miss that part of the lesson, too, didn't you. All right, let me show you and then I'll let you do one, okay? What you're gonna do, this big one always goes down. You're making like an upside down U. Just like that. You're gonna U and turn it all at the same time so that it's a slow turn and this motion all at the same time, okay? Then when you're done you just set that aside and do another one. Show me what you're doing. There you go. Hold it just like that. That's good. Hey, you're getting there. You're making a pyramid of frosting and you can do it one of two ways. You can either do it this way or straight up and down. Just make a big glob of frosting, and turn this all at the same time. There you go, just like that. Pull your frosting off, there you go. Okay now that's a good start, and now you're gonna start making your upside down U's. Usually you have three on your bottom layer. There you go. You're turning it all at the same time. It's all about the hand motion there you go, just like that. Just make little tiny ones all around. There ya go that looks good. There ya go. See, you can do this, Leticia. There, oh look how beautiful that is! It is! Oh my gosh. That's a perfect rosebud.\n Thank you.\n That's it. That's all you have to do. The bigger you wanna make your rose, the more levels you put around the outside edge, okay? If that's all you want then pull it off, set it aside, and do some more. That's it. All right, you've got the techniques and you know what to do. I'll come back and check on you. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Oh come on show me. Show me, show me.\n At least it's better than theirs.\n Hey, you're getting there. I think you're doing the same thing that Leticia was doing. See this big piece. You've got it back. It needs to go down. If this is awkward for you and you need to twist this part of it. Just unscrew and re-navigate. Britney, that looks good.\n Wait, it is on bottom now.\n It is now because I just turned it. When you were doing it it wasn't. See how these are heavy on top? That's the reason. It'll be okay. Do you need some more?\n Is there anymore cut-out things?\n No, but there's stuff to do it. All right, I'll come back and check on you. Sierra, I'm gonna leave you in charge over here. If they need some help, let me know okay?\n Okay.\n Good job. Where are you over here? Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Star borders deluxe. Okay, so how are you doing? You're doing really good on those leaf tips. Have you tried any standing up? So you know how to do that? Literally you start here and you pull straight up on it at a 90 degree angle.\n What?\n Just like that.\n Like that, sometimes they roll over. The stiffer your frosting is the stiffer they are. See how you can get them to stand up? Just like that, or if you want them to lay on the side.\n If you go slow they stay up faster.\n Yeah, and it has to do with the consistency of your frosting, too. Remember what you put in it to make it a little bit thicker?\n Powdered sugar?\n Or you can do what? \n There you go. Sarah! Sarah, I have never seen-- Don't look. A big no-no. Oh man that's good frosting. Okay, all right yell at me. I stuck my thumb in it. I had to lick it off.\n It's really good by the way. It is. Don't do as I do, do as I say. That's kind of like momma's say. Ya know, I'm your school momma.\n It's not monkey see, monkey do. It's monkey do what monkey say.\n I'm telling ya, today it's Ms. Morris is doing something silly. All right, so Sarah show me another one. Show me some shell borders, cause I know you've practiced those. She will, she'll be-- I'll be back. That's cute. That's very stylish. Now, the tip that Ashley has the one that looks like the little grass that's got the two holes at the same time. If you're gonna do something real fancy if you'll do this one white and then put a colored one in there and do it back and forth it will kinda look like this. Holly, try it again. Try again.\n Where's the leaf?\n Leddy's got one of them.\n Do you guys have one? Okay show her what to do. It's pressure and release. Pressure and release. That one actually turned out really good. That one is a very good leaf. When you're working on your leaves for your cake this is what you want it to look like. If they start breaking off like this, you'll probably want to scrape them off. It's just a matter of the pressure and release thing. But those are looking really, really good. I know I'm gonna sneeze, too. Okay, maybe I'm not. Bless you. Hey Mariah. Show me what you can do. \n Oh, come on. Those are good ones. Those are cute. That's a cute border. Samantha, you're doing a really good job on that, too.  Kailyn, that is awesome. So, have you practiced at home yet?\n No.\n Why not? I figured you would be-- I figured you would be practicing every chance you got.\n No, I don't have time.\n What do you mean you don't have time. Yeah, Drew told me you're working on your scrapbook. Good job, Brandi. All right, show me something that you can do. I wanna see somebody make a rose. I showed you how now I wanna see them. Yes, I wanna see you make a rose. Make another one. Oh, Let me-- You can use my frosting. I'll bring you some. Look, you did it!

We've done this a couple of times before. Inside we did it on the gym floor and the ball moved real fast. It'll be a lot easier out here today on the grass, ok? You guys are gonna be awesome, we'll have a good time. First thing we're gonna do is dribbling. When you dribble, I want you to use the inside of your foot, right here. Inside of your feet, keep the ball real close to your feet and dribble. When I say go, you're gonna start right here at the start line.

Four balls going in a circle. Is Jessie going first? Alright. Alright, last one. Last event. You guys remember this one, right? Run and kick, you're gonna start.  Start right here in the middle, alright? Arrows going to number one first. When I say go, I start the clock. Fast as you can run up to this ball. Just pass it through those two cones. Then we're gonna go this way following the arrows to number two. Same thing, pass it through those cones. Number three, pass it through these cones. Then to number four, pass it through those cones. And as soon as you kick that ball, the clock stops. Alright? Remember, you don't have to hit it real hard on these. Just kick it easy, nice and soft and aim it between those cones. Jessie, you're the first one up. You ready? Start on that arrow in the middle and I'll say go. On your mark, get set, go. Boom, alright. Go faster if you can. I know you can go faster than that. There you go. There you go. Alright. You wanna get that one right there, Jessie? Taylor, can you get that ball? Colin, you get that ball right there? We're gonna set 'em up and go again.

Aim it right in there, nice and soft. Thank you for getting that ball, Colin. I don't know, are you?\n  Is it my turn?\n", "filename": ["Copy of 183 PE EAYA 183 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.408257], "annotations": [["Teacher"], ["Taylor"], ["Teacher"], ["Taylor"], ["Teacher"], ["Taylor"], ["Teacher"], ["Colin"], ["Teacher"], ["Colin"], ["Teacher"], ["Faith"], ["Teacher"], ["Jessie"], ["Teacher"], ["Taylor"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Faith"], ["Teacher"], ["Taylor"], ["Teacher"], ["Taylor"], ["Teacher"], ["Taylor"], ["Teacher"], ["Taylor"], ["Teacher"], ["Taylor"], ["Teacher"], ["Colin"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW06", "TW10", "TW15", "TW17", "TW24", "TW24TW10"]}, "181": {"text": " In my opinion I think the grandpa shows the most leadership because he stands up for himself, telling the principal, \"I should not pay $15.00 because then it wouldn't be a scholarship.\"\n  Okay, thank you very much. I like the way the way you show, you know, how much he pays for one day and not have to pay for the scholarship jacket. Thank you very much.\n I agree with Julia, because you should not choose people for, like, what kind of races they are or their culture. You should choose them for what they've been through like their hardest work or something.\n  Okay. So you mean they had jobs, they had work it was right to feel that. Very good, good job. Okay.\n I think Martha because she earned the jacket instead of buying it.\n  Okay.\n In my opinion the grandpa showed the greatest leadership because he was wise, and a great leader is wise.\n  Okay.\n I agree with Alejandro that the grandfather is the leader because he didn't pay for the jacket.\n  He didn't pay for the jacket. So you thought because he didn't pay for the jacket then he's a great leader. You think you know just because he did not pay for the jacket that's what made him a great leader.\n No, I think that what makes him a great leader is that he stood up for himself instead of just saying, oh, okay, here's the money.\n  Okay, so a greater leader should stand for what he believes. Is that what you are saying?\n Yes.\n  Very good. Thank you very much for clarifying that. Go ahead, Daniel.\n I was going to say that I agree with Jennifer. I think that a great leader should stand up for what they believe.\n  Thank you very much. Go ahead.\n In my opinion, I think Martha showed the greatest leadership because she showed wisdom because she earned that jacket by getting straight As and being a good student.\n  All right. Thank you. Go ahead, Lisette.\n In my opinion, Martha's grandpa is a great leader because a leader needs to be a strong person like Martha's grandpa.\n  Very good. So you need to stand your ground. Very good.\n I think that the person who showed the most leadership was Martha. Even though she thought she was going to lose what she had earned, she believed that even though the teachers, they, they, some wanted to give it to someone else, but some knew that she had earned it and she, she spoke up, not keeping it quiet and keeping it to herself.\n  Okay. So you feel a great leader, you know, she speak up, you know, when something is wrong or in the way.\n She shouldn't just keep it.\n  Very good.\n She has to tell someone.\n  Very good, good job. Go ahead.\n It seems to me that Martha showed great leadership because she did all the things that she did so she could win the jacket.\n  Okay, what are some of the other things, you know, that Martha did.\n She got, she got, since she was in first grade she got good grades and she tried not to get in trouble, and be a good student.\n  Okay, so that means, you know, she has worked hard all this time. Very good. Thank you. Okay, go ahead.\n I believe that Martha showed very good leadership because she wanted the scholarship jacket so bad that she didn't give up on trying to get it.\n  So a good leader, you know, she'll try to do whatever it takes, you know, to get what he or she wants. Is that what you're saying?\n Yes.\n  All right. Good job. Thank you.\n In my opinion I think Mr. Schmidt is a great leader because he was fair, you know, to fight for Martha and not the other girl.\n  Thank you. Who is the other girl?\n  Joanne.\n  Huh?\n  Joanne.\n  Okay, so Mr. Schmidt was fair enough, you know, to fight for Martha instead of who?\n  Joanne.\n  Joanne. Thank you very much.\n In my opinion it's Martha because she fight for the jacket and she tried her best.\n  All right.\n In my opinion I think Mr. Smith because even though Martha was poor he still said that she deserved the sweater because of her good grades.\n  Because of her good grades. Good job.\n In my opinion I believe that the one that showed leadership was Mr. Smith because he was honest and fair to Martha.\n  Very, very good. Thank you very much.\n I agree with her because Mr. Booney just wanted the person that had money, which is Joanne. Her father owned the only store in town. So, Mr. Schmidt was actually being fair.\n  Okay. Thank you for adding on to that. Now who is Joanne's dad? You know, because everybody was saying I could hear Juan, you know, when Juan said because of Joanne's dad. Who is Joanne's dad? How can we describe him?\n He owns the only store in town.\n  Hmm?\n He owns the only store in town.\n He owns the only store in town. What else?\n He's also part of the school board.\n He's rich.\n School board.\n  Huh?\n He's part of the school board so they had the decisions like, in the school, like, what they do and stuff.\n \nIn the story he gives money to the  school so maybe that's also why they wanted to pick Joanne so they got more money.\n\n  Very good. Thank you very much. Now that everybody has contributed, now let's look at the next question. The next question is this: what does Martha represent to you? Think about the leadership qualities that Martha showed. What does Martha represent to you? Not only the leadership qualities, all the other things that Martha represents, okay? Anybody can start. Anybody can start. Just jump in.\n I believe that Martha to me represents a great leader. Her experience and triumph illustrate importance in leadership such as never giving up.\n  Thank you for sharing that.\n She represents someone who will find the truth and will solve it. She stood up for herself and she listened to what her grandfather had to say.\n  Very good.\n It seems to me that she was a smart and outgoing girl because she worked hard and speaked up and no matter how you look or where you live you have to be treated fairly.\n  Great. Like that. Anybody can jump in.\n It seems to me that Martha is not a leader because her grandpa speaked up for her about the scholarship jacket.\n I disagree because Martha did speak up for herself. Her grandfather just told her what to say.\n I disagree because like, her grandfather gave her most of her ideas. If it wasn't for her grandfather she probably would've tried to get the money. But like her father said, I mean her grandfather said that a scholarship is not a scholarship unless you pay for it.\n I agree with Daniel because like, well yeah, I agree with Arkie because the grandfather actually had to tell the principal that they shouldn't have to pay for it instead of Martha going to speak to the principal in person.\n I disagree with that.\n I disagree with that.\n I disagree.\n I disagree with Daniel and Javier because even though her grandpa told her what to say, her grandpa didn't go up to the principal and actually tell it was actually Martha who went up to the principal and got ideas of what to say.\n I agree with Myra because it's true. I mean he didn't go, Martha actually had the guts to say what her grandfather had said. So that's why I say that Martha had most of the guts to do that instead of the grandfather. The grandfather might've said that, but she was the one that stood there and said it. That took a lot of courage to me.\n  Okay. So you know that was a great leader should be courageous enough. So I like what Arkie said, Arkie said, you know, I disagree that Martha was a leader and Arkie open up that. Thank you very much, Archimedes. Thank you all of you for sharing that. Any other person?\n To me Martha represents a hard worker because since first grade she worked hard to get her good grades and not get in trouble.\n  Okay. She worked really hard. Thank you. Any other person that wanted to add something?\n It seems to me that Martha is a  that proves that it doesn't matter her race or color, she could do anything the same as anybody else can do.\n  Wow.\n I agree with Ashley because a lot of people discriminate, like Mexican people or like Mexican Americans, just because their family or their ancestors came from somewhere else and they're not from the United States.\n  So you know what has Martha done to straighten that or to disprove that?\n She showed that who cares where you're from or who you are, you can always do your best.\n  Okay. So you know there was, Martha is representing to us that we can do whatever we put our mind in doing. If we really work hard we know that it will work. Is that what I'm hearing from all of you?\n  Yes.\n  That it doesn't matter what race, you know, if you work really hard you know that you can achieve. Thank you very much for sharing that.\n I really admire her because I know some people who have been made fun of just because of their race and it's somewhat sad because some people aren't allowed to do things just because of their skin color or where they're from. What I think is that it doesn't matter what you are. No one is bad except for the person who's making fun of your race. You are not the bad one, it's the person who's making fun of you.\n  Thank you very much. Any other person that wants to add something to this?\n I agree \n \n because in a poem it says you can't persuade anyone unless you have the courage to make them, like, persuade them.\n  Thank you very much. Now let's go on to the last question. Thank you very much for sharing. I could hear from all of you. The last question is what other stories have you read that share a similar theme with Scholarship Jacket. Think of other characters that have faced difficult choices or situations. Okay? So think of that. What other stories have you read, okay? Anyone can start.\n I think Crossing the Wire is somewhat similar because Pablo was Mexican, too, and they mistreated him and denied him a job. However, he worked as hard as Martha.\n  Thank you for sharing that. You call that Crossing what?\n Crossing the Wire.\n  Crossing the Wire. Thank you.\n I think the story of Martin Luther King is pretty similar to The Scholarship Jacket because they discriminated a lot against African-Americans because of their color, but Martin Luther King stood up for his race and said that we should not discriminate others because we're different. We're all the same just because of color doesn't separate us.\n  Thank you very much for sharing that.\n I agree with Jennifer, Martin Luther King said that it doesn't matter where you're from or who you are, everybody inside is the same and all of us are brothers.\n  Thank you very much for sharing that.\n I have seem the movie The Blind Side which is pretty similar to the story. Michael shows great leadership because he is an African-American and he is poor and he tries to pull himself up to be able to play at a Catholic school to play football.\n  Thank you.\n I agree with Carlos. I've also seen that movie and the movie has a lot of great leaders definitely Michael.\n I agree with Carlos because in that movie, Michael, from the beginning he didn't want to go to school, he actually had really low grades and the family he had, they're from another race, and even though he had really low scores, they got him a tutor and they helped him, like, reach his goals so he could play football for the school he wanted to play.\n  Wow. Thanks again.\n I have read The Outsiders, which is a story about two classes of people, the Greasers and the Soches. The greasers get treated real dirty because of their lower class.\n  Okay. At the end what happened? Did they succeed like Martha? Did they achieve?\n Some of them died.\n  Some of them died, okay.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 181 ELA EA 181.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.317824], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["together"], ["Teacher"], ["together"], ["Teacher"], ["together"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["inaudible"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["together"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW08"]}, "104": {"text": " Has more light around him and it goes off into this huge dark hole through the trees.\n Why do you think it's more light around him?\n I don't know. Just to show that, to bring him more into the main point that you should see when you look at the picture.\n What is the dark force symbolizing? Why is it a dark force? Why isn't it, like, a bright light? Yeah.\n I don't know. It kind of reminds me of what Jack said. Dante started going through the forest. It kind of reminds me of his travel of starting to go to the layers of hell and stuff. Hell's not a very bright place so it reminds me of that.\n One thing, the light and religious paintings. Jesus has a light around his head so it might symbolize how he's pure or more religious. But--\n What'd you say?\n I said but Dante isn't pure so why would they highlight someone who wasn't as pure as like Jesus?\n Okay, so I want to come your statement in a moment, because Kailyn had something to offer. Why do you say he's not pure? Is there any indication that he's not pure?\n Well it's kind of an inference because he's man. We all assume that the purity is in God or Jesus or Buddha or whatever. He's not because he's man and men have faults. Women have faults. A human being is just not divine, I guess.\n But it says in the text that he gets angry with people who are not true to their religion and their beliefs politically and religiously. So he kind of is the most pure one. Not like Godlike but he is more pure than the rest, I believe.\n So do you think that's why Dante went to hell in the first place? To go see all the bad people? Do you think he was going there to learn a lesson? Or going there to prove that he was right?\n Because remember this is a fictional. This is fictional. So can a character... 'cause you're right we infer that man is sinful. But can a fictional character be perfect? Can be flawless? Can be sinless? And if so, is Dante trying to go a different way of inference. Is he trying to infer that he is, from what you've said, that he wants to find out more of what sins are so he can make himself pure if he's not already. So can a fictional character be pure?\n One of the questions I think was the three beasts he encounters and what do they represent. I kind of thought that they represented what he does or what he did and everything. Like a wake up call. You're going to go see all of these people who have done things similar to that so you kind of want to change your ways. They were reminding him what he has done and what he did because he was violent because he was in that guild kind of thing. He was considered a fraud by the other team I guess side. So I think it's more of a like he's going to there to see what happens when you don't be the best you could be, I guess.\n Who judges where you go? Is it the devil or is it a higher power?\n I thought it was the gods that judged that.\n Are there gods in this story? Do we ever hear much about the gods?\n We aren't sure about the gods.\n Yeah, really.\n Who judges where all these people go? Cause they're talking about all the famous people and the places they are but who decides that?\n We didn't really read the hell part as opposed to the...\n Yeah, yeah.\n So maybe in the other books it would explain.\n Where the gods are.\n And you said who judges where they go and everything? Technically we don't know what supreme being judges that because all we know is the devil is on the bottom eating Brutus, Cassius and Judas. But in the book, on page 41, lines 8-9, Minos is the one who discover the crimes and dictates where they go. So he's kind of like boss of hell sort of. Forty-one lines eight and nine.\n I have a question. Are their crimes so bad to the point that they go to hell or is it just because they made like sins or something?  Because everybody makes them so would that make everybody go to hell?\n That's what I find too \n Meaningful. But in their own perspective they are different\n Individual, yeah. So do you think that the layers of hell are how bad of the thing that the person did like how far? What do you think depends on how far you go down--\n Like, the pain increases?\n One of my questions are, are the punishments of different people different based on who they are or what they do?\n I think it's what they do but through their actions they can kind of be defined as who they are. I think the layers of hell go down as the pain and suffering increases related to their crimes\n Couldn't it be like their pain and suffering for all of eternity is based off of all the pain and suffering that they had caused others in life? For instance, in Limbo. All these babies that had died and weren't baptized are now there but they hadn't really hurt anybody so they're not being quite as punished as, let's say, Judas who's in the center of hell having his head gnawed on. He caused a lot of pain and suffering therefore we was given a greater punishment for what he had done\n So it depends on who they put it on.\n Yeah.\n So if they just keep it to themselves? Like, gouging out the eyes. That's not really hurting anyone else.\n Right. Where's the gouging of the eyes? Where did you just pull that from? What piece did we read where the eyes were gouged out?\n Oh, I'm sorry I got confused. Oedipus?\n Oedipus.\n He punished himself for it in a weird way. But, do you think that his punishment would not go as far because he didn't torture other people?\n Think before you respond. Think about it because I want you to respond to this. This is huge. I want you to write your question down on a piece of paper and then their responses to it because you have probably just now created a thesis for an essay we're going to do for the end of the year.\n Okay.\n So write down your question. Mainly she has brought up, just like I heard you guys doing with these pictures, a different text. Didn't you bring up the Odyssey with this?\n Yeah.\n Do you want me to write Oedipus specifically?\n Yep, write down the gouging of Oedipus' eyes. Where would Oedipus have ended up in Dante's Inferno?\n Okay, so pretty much--\n Yep. And I want you guys to answer and then I'll move on and come back. I love how you bring in another text. That's one reason I brought this picture in, so you guys hit on that. I love that you brought this up. This is real higher order thinking because at the end of this year our essay for you guys for the final is to bring in the texts that we've read and you have to develop a theme so right there's a good start. Okay, you ready for them to answer it?\n Yeah.\n Okay.\n The pain that Oedipus caused wasn't intentional. So I don't really think he'd be punished as harshly. I do believe that he'd be punished due to the fact that he did kill his father and I believe a couple other people during that fight. So, he would be punished but I don't believe that the gouging of his eyes would lessen any of the punishment. 'Cause, really, he didn't knowingly go into the incest and do that intentionally. So really, he shouldn't be punished for something that he didn't know he was doing.\n But he still killed somebody.\n He did kill somebody. And the gouging of his eyes, I don't think would lessen that. I think it was more of a pain in life lesson for him. Although, It did cause him a lot of pain, I believe the guilt that he faced caused him greater pain than his actual gouging of his eyes.\n May I clarify something really quick here? So you're saying basically, because she asked where in hell would he be? So f+irst of all, what level do you think he'd be? Gouging eyes or not, where would he be in hell? Where would Dante run into him?\n He would be with the murderers.\n With the murderers, okay. So you're saying that he wouldn't be any more in depth than that simply because of his gouging.\n No.\n That is just his own--\n Retribution.\n Yeah.\n He did that to lessen the guilt in his life--\n In himself.\n 'Cause the guilt was much more painful than him gouging out his eyes.\n And also, even delivering pain to yourself can get you in hell with, like, suicides.\n Right.\n 'Cause there's the whole ring where like people kill themselves and they go to hell. Or they destroy their possessions. I didn't quite understand it completely but it seemed to say destroying items that they had, I don't know, maybe a couch or something. If you destroyed that, you'd go to hell because they destroyed their own items.\n Right, right. In Circle Nine, and that's what important about this, in Circle Nine, those people that destroyed or  take from. You know, you have Canna after Cain. Everything is allegorical. Every part of Circle Nine, there's an allegory. There's Ptolemy, there's Cain. Everybody is compared or made allegorical in there for their sins. Because of what they did to humanity. Like Ptolemy murdered people in his-- In his-- He was a ruler. He just murdered people. Mass murders. So, he was put in there as a comparison to that kind of sin. That Hitler type of sin. So everybody in that level, too. Which would be interesting to see. Talk about some of our other literature. Talk about The Odyssey a little more.\n I have one more question about sin. Do you think, is everyone's definition of sinning the same?\n Actually, I don't believe so. \n We were just talking how everybody lies but how are some still in Limbo.\n Goes along with what he said was, \"no, I didn't steal\" so you stole and then you lied.\n Yeah.\n So you double dipped.\n So you half and did different things.\n Oh interesting, so what'd you come to?\n We came to they'd go to the serious one.\n Yeah.\n Whichever one's more serious\n Why? Basically the one thing that impacted the world more, like in a bad way, is going to take the worse punishment. So if I stole a penny, or I lied to the king, I'd probably get punished for lying to the king. That's what we kind of came up with.\n Yeah.\n So I want to ask you a question. If you're saying you lied and then you lie about lying, or you steal and you lie about lying.\n I don't steal, sorry.\n Yeah, they're two crimes and this person has chosen to commit two crimes. Okay, so does that play into that?\n Would you suffer twice the punishment then?\n No, it doesn't bring up any of that in Dante's. Basically everybody's got the same punishment.\n But still wouldn't you get like harsher--\n Well, depending on the circle.\n Yeah, but some people in the circles do have worse punishments than other people.\n Will you give me an example?\n Well, let's see. Ulysses, and I forget the other guy's name, they are in the same flame and I think he said the flame was burning brighter. I would assume that'd be a worse punishment than other people if they're burning --\n If they're burning, yeah.\n Some of the less worse... um... lesser punishments.  It's like magicians get their heads turned backwards. You could see where you've been but you wouldn't cry over it. Unless getting stabbed to death and then healing and then getting stabbed to death again\n Yeah\n Then your flesh getting eaten off over and over and over again.\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n I want to ask you guys a question because we've studied pictures all year long and there was one when we were studying Oedipus. And I don't know who in this group had this one when you were doing those folders together, but there is, what is her name, Antigone's brother's name that was dead...\n Polynices.\n Yeah, Polynices.\n Was it the one where she was like leaning over his body?\n Yeah, by the rock.\n Yeah.\n Okay, now that you've read The Inferno, do some of those photos from some of these other stories and poems tie together or relate or reoccur?\n I can relate. \n Okay talk to me about that.\n Because it reminds me of Dante being lost in the forest  in the beginning and then it reminds me of how Oedipus gouged his eyes out and couldn't see anything and so he didn't know which path to take. He had to rely on somebody else. He had to rely on Virgil to get him through what was to come. Then Oedipus, he had to rely on Antigone to tell him where to go and trust her with his life basically.\n Nice. Nice.\n That's what I got.\n Well as I walk away I want you guys, 'cause I'm going to leave this here. I want you guys to talk about other literature. 'Cause you said yes, I can relate some. You just did. I would like for you to relate.\n All right.\n Okay.\n Okay.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 104 ELA AYA 104.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.364631], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW05", "TW08", "TW09"]}, "1033": {"text": " You're totally fine. So you guys will be using, I'm assuming a meter tape?\n Yeah.\n For measurements? And then can you take a minute to explain the balance thing again so we're good?\n Strength versus strength qualifies ten times.\n Ok so I like that you're making everyone go clockwise, everyone's doing ten, alright.\n And then see how long they can balance on their most dominant foot.\n Ok.\n There's a max of 60 seconds and no shoes on.\n No shoes on, ok perfect. You guys are good. Ok so wingspan, what are your units you guys are measuring in? Centimeters and you're going tip to tip right? And then what was the ability again?\n They'll take their shoes off, try to touch their toes. And then we'll measure the distance from their finger tip to the top of their foot.\n Ok, good. In what units?\n Centimeters.\n Centimeters. Did you say take shoes off or no?\n Yeah.\n Ok, cool. You guys can start collecting data. I'll come back to you. Ok what do you guys got?\n  Same thing we got yesterday.\n Recap me.\n Hair color,\n You were hair color. Why the hell don't you have something else?\n  I don't know.\n Ok, so here's my question. Cause I was thinking about this last night. You're gonna be asked to make a scatter plot graph of this data. How would one go about making a scatter plot with hair color? Ok, so you're gonna assign numbers, numeric data to shades?\n  Zero to ten. Or one to ten.\n One to ten.\n Yeah.\n One being the,\n lightest.\n  The lightest \n lightest. We should probably get this straightened out before we do it, right? And then ten being the darkest. Ok, before you start collecting it can you just give me a really quick specturm. Draw a line out so I could see where you're getting your number data. And then what is your characteristic? That was your characteristic. What is your ability?\n How many steps does it take you to walk backwards seven feet?\n Ok, so we'll probably do that in the hallway? Does that sound fine? Meter tapes are up there.\n  That's a lot of guys.\n So give me a real quick scale then you guys can start.\n Ok.  One and ten. So that's blonde and really blonde. And like really dark brown.\n So where would red fall in?\n Like me? Like right there.\n So you're gonna make blonde one end. The low end, are we all in agreeance on that?\n  Yeah and mine is like in the middle.\n  Ok, and then the other far end's gonna be the darkest brown?\n  Yeah.\n  Or black.\n Or black. Are you gonna have everyone taking data on that? Or maybe one or two people just consistently doing the hair color? You know what I mean so there's not a ton of variation? \n Measure their hand from first crease to their middle finger. And then hopping on one foot, right? On your tiptoe? Or no, balance, balance. And then once your heel touch into the ground, it's done. And your hands can do whatever you want.\n  Ok, are we shoe on, shoe off?\n Shoe off.\n  Shoe off and is it right or left foot? Right foot for everybody? Ok. Right foot shoe off on tiptoe\n Max two minutes.\n Max two minutes so the deciding factor when to stop the stopwatch is when their heel hits the ground.\n Or their other foot.\n  Or their other foot. So it could be either or. Okeydoke. So just a kind of a flashback to remind us. This has been a couple daytime span here. Our goal behind this is try to determine what we can learn from a fossil. So as we work through this unit we're gonna start building together pieces of information that help us come up with ideas about the past. We've been specifically, as I've said before looking at one specific fossil, foot fossil length, right? The idea behind this is that scientists put the pieces of the puzzle together, we start to get a clear image of what's going on. Again, our goal was to determine if there's a relationship between the characteristic you chose, the ability you chose, and a person's foot fossil. I asked you last night to plot up your data for both characteristic and ability and then if possible draw a line of best fit. That could be an indirect relationship, a direct one, a trend, or no relationship. What I'm gonna ask you to do for a minute, talk to your neighbors. Compare your data. Make sure we're on the same page in determining a relationship. And then I'd like you to come up and post your data. It's gonna be a pretty simple process to post your data. So for example, if group one, what was your characteristic?\n  For fossil length.\n Hand spans. We're gonna put characteristic on the left side so they're gonna right hand span for us. And then what type of relationship did you guys see for that?\n  Direct.\n Direct, so all you're gonna do is do this. That's all we need to report. Ok, in your lab packet, you are going to find some little graphs. You're gonna be asked to record everyone's data. I've also given you a supplementary sheet cause you're gonna need more graphs. I messed up and didn't tell you. So what's gonna wind up happening is all the graphs would appear on here. You will also copy down into your packet because as a whole you'll be looking at everyone's data and drawing conclusions, ok? So take a minute to talk to your groups. I'll come around and give you some markers. Determine what your characteristic and ability relationships are. Post them on the board and then we'll talk. \n No\n Can you determine it?\n No.\n Cause they're not. They're just kind of clustered. It was like more not clustered.\n Ok, so we're gonna have a trend fall in between where?\n I guess the trend really is between 15 and\n What are we lacking?\n You know what, it was 12:30 last night, Fossil, foot length, stride length.\n Ok, so we're having a trend falling between, what's our lowest?\n Our lowest is 12 and our highest is 23 but like the trend is between these ones. \n Ok, I think that works. So you're gonna give a horizontal line on your graph up there. Need help? Ok, whatcha got?\n  Would you draw a line for a trend?\n Yeah it would either be vertical or horizontal just like we did in the beginning. So this person's kinda like an outlier right so let's just for argument's sake take them out. Does that help clear the data up at all? You could say no, it's ok.\n They're all kind of in the same foot length but they all have different times.\n Ok, so we've got a pretty wide range here, right? For trend, we tend to see more of a skinnier range. So if you look at our options, it's definitely not a direct or indirect I would say based on what you showed me, right? Trend-wise, it's kind of a wide range. So what would we determine, what's our other option?\n No relationship.\n Yeah, I would probably go. So up there instead of drawing a line just write no relation, ok? Here's your marker.\n With this one, cause it's kind of like a trend or kind of just focused in this area. But then there's also the increase\n Ok, so here's my question. That's a good question. When I look at this data, right? If I had a pick, excluding this line, if I had to pick where someone with a foot fossil over here would fall, where would you pick? Up here? Why? Yeah, it appears to be going this way. So that would indicate that you have a direct relationship. It's kind of the easiest way to look at it. Ok group number one. Hand span versus foot fossil length and then jump height. What kind of relationship are we seeing here? Direct, so the bigger the foot fossil, the bigger the hand span. So just to clarify hand span, we're talking tip of thumb to tip of finger. Correct? Why do we see that? So I asked you guys last night to jot down some ideas in the conclusion section. so you might want to turn to that page, everyone, cause you wanna gather some ideas here. Why are we seeing this? Why do you think we're seeing that relationship? What did you guys say?\n Because your hands and feet are usually proportional in size. You're not gonna have a very large foot and have very small hands. Usually.\n  Ok. So I have a question for everyone in class. I bought some new shoes and I like them. Do you like them?\n  They're so big on you. \n They're a little loud. Don't worry I won't wear them on testing days. They look good?  What's the problem here? They're like way too big, like twenty sizes too big. How do you know? Why do you know that my foot's not this big? Yeah, it doesn't look proportional to my body. And exactly what Megan said, bodies in general are proportional. Now we go through some stages in our lives where we have long, really lanky arms. Or you might know someone that has extremely long legs. They're kind of fitting outside that pattern. But in general, bodies are proportionate, right? And so we can probably makes some connections to certain body characteristics based on other body characteristics, right? Because of this idea that we are proportioned. You're not gonna see Shaquille O Neal wearing a size three shoe. He'll fall over. He wouldn't be able to support his own body. Common sense applies here. That's a good one. Jump height. So you said pretty much everyone kind of fell into one kind of area but there's no indirect or direct relationship. Why do you think we saw that?\n Jump height is an ability versus,\n Ok, jump height is an ability, you are correct.\n  It depends on muscles versus structure.\n Ok, so it's depending more on muscle as opposed to structure of your foot.\n I remember the class like could already reach so that played to our height and the proportions of our body and then in turn determined how high I could jump in itself so I guess with your foot, depending on what size shoe you have, that in turn kinda determines your height because of the proportions of your body.\n By having them reach, guys. What was your point? When you set up your lab? Cause I remember distinctly talking to you guys you said you're gonna have them make a mark and then they're gonna jump.\n  Well it's so that the taller people didn't just automatically jump higher than everybody who was shorter than them. Cause then it's already the distance, like how high they can actuall jump as part of how tall they are.\n Ok. So you're saying that by measuring the height, you factored that idea in. So Mr. Bieber isn't totally outjumping say Adrian who's a little bit shorter. So you already kind of factored that in. Why did we not see a connection though? Megan said jump height deals with more muscle mass maybe? opposed to foot.\n  Cause everybody kind of jumped the same. There wasn't any variation. So it didn't really matter what foot size you have.\n Ok. So when you say jump the same you mean achieve the same scores roughly? They found the same general area in that same general pattern?\n  That's why theres a trend. It was all in just one spot.\n So in general when we're looking at fossils, would jump height be one that we could solely predict then based on the length of the foot fossil?\n  No.\n Probably not. Which kind of makes sense anyway. Group two. Group two didn't get their data plotted but let's take a peek. They did foot fossil length and height. If you were to make an assumption, if there was a relationship, what would you all assume would be the relationship? Direct, why direct?\n  Cause it's proportional.\n Bingo, bodies are proportional. You're gonna see that pattern as we work through this. Proportional, ok? Average stride.\n  We didn't really get a graph but it didn't look very direct. It was a little more indirect.\n More indirect?\n  I think so.\n Like this? So you're saying longer?\n No, no. Like there wasn't really a pattern.\n Oh so your'e saying no relationship?\n Yeah.\n Does that make sense? Alana says no. I saw this. Why?\n Well just based on the proportional idea, if your height and hand span is proportional to your foot length then your legs then, the length of your legs are also proportional to your foot lenghts and the length of your stride based on the length of your legs.\n So you're arguing that you think we should see what kind of relationship?\n  I think, a direct.\n You would say direct. Claire and then Barrett.\n Well, cause we had the same thing but a little bit different. And, well, backwards. It couldn't really be that accurate because it wasn't a very long distance. and people had different ideas of walking. Some people were trying to take larger steps or being more careful or walking slower. It wasn't just like an average.\n So you are saying based on the idea of body proportions that we should see a direct.\n But you're saying, you agree that we should see direct\n  No we should see an indirect.\n An indirect? Longer leg, shorter strides? Direct. Longer legs, longer strides. But you're arguing that the way maybe that the experiment was set up didn't lend itself to collect proper data?\n  Yeah.\n Ok, good point.\n I think it was also just, I was asked just to walk like I normally do and I don't take very long strides. I kind of walk really slow so my strides are very small when I just normally walk.\n Ok so you almost felt it was kinda awkward like how am I supposed to walk. So maybe we could have captured it in a different manner. We could have designed the experiment if you're already walking and then you walk past the line and maybe keep carrying through that stride.\n I think no relationship is accurate because my stride length I would assume is based on how long my legs are. I have very long legs but everybody knows I have a small foot. I mean I'm still proportional like I'm normal sized but my legs are just a lot longer than anything else.\n Ok so you're kinda arguing that maybe you're not always going to fall into every part of your body being specifically proportional.\n There was a lot where some people with kinda smaller feet had relatively longer strides and some people with big feet had smaller strides. It was kind of just all over the place.\n Ok. So what are we labeling this? Direct, question mark, no relationship, question mark.\n  If we're basing it on the data that they had, I'd say no relationship.\n Ok, if we're basing it on the data, even though we didn't plot it. Looking at their actual data, we would say no relationship. Could there be a point where we could argue that we might potentially see a direct relationship? Yes. So for our data collection, we'll leave no relationship. But keeping in mind that very valid point that if' you're gonna have longer feet, more than likely you have longer legs. More than likely you're gonna take longer strides. But inherent as Claire said in the kind of setup of the experiment, that maybe that didn't shine through. Group three. Hair color versus foot fossil length. No relationship. Is this shocking to anyone?\n Yes. Even though they had a great numeric scale? Why? Why no relationship Bubs?\n  I didn't have anything to do with it.\n  It's like a gene base.\n Hair color is determined by\n Your DNA.\n Does your DNA determine your foot length?\n  Yes it does.\n  But not the same gene.\n Ok but not the same gene. Ok, now you're getting very technical, I appreciate that. Yes sir.\n I think its partially because \n Would you think that there would be a connection? Like smaller foot, lighter hair?\n  Well go on for like racial background like your ethnicity, Some ethnic groups are generally taller and have bigger feet than the others.\n Ok so maybe you're arguing the sample size? The idea that we were to survey globally, maybe we could see certain ethnic backgrounds that tend to be taller, would have different, I could see that. Yeah.\n Well, I think it has nothing to do with it because I'm six feet tall and Franco's under five feet and we both have dark hair. So obviously.\n  Yeah it's got nothing to do with it.\n Ok so on face value, looking at hair color. Would we say that foot fossil length would be a good indicator of hair color?\n  No.\n Ok, I would agree. There's no connection there. No connection. My question though, is. There are organisms that lived in the past. And we have very, I would say. We have certain ideas about what their coloring was like. How would we come up with that, then? How would scientists come up with that idea? Of the coloring of certain organisms? Caroline.\n Well if you say that lizards would be, or dinosaurs would be green, it would help them blend into their environment so you would assume it would be good then to be green but you don't know for sure.\n So you're thinking evolutionary connection. It'll be beneficial for them to be able to blend in their environment,\n  Yeah.\n Yes Claire.\n I think you also said a few days ago. About how you're supposed to assume everything in the past works how it does now. So if you see some type of reptile in the past it probably looks something like a reptile now.\n Ok, so again you're doing that evolutionary connection to modern day relatives saying well if they appear to be this color, possibly due to some benefit, we can assume in the past.

I don't think either of them were really looking to find that, but they both ended up finding it.\n  I think both of them were like looking to help their people, and then I also think like a small part of them was looking for glory.\n  I think it's kind  of like looking for their destiny, like they know they're meant for something bigger, but they don't know what it is yet, so they're just looking for what that is, so....\n  Then he goes to take the test, and the test kills him. Or not. Then, he goes back to his father, and he realizes that he's just like, you know, the father's really disappointed in the son, and then he's really disappointed until the son, I think it could happen in today's society. I don't know about Gilgamesh.\n  Well yeah, it  was a really like--\n  Abstract, connecting--\n  In the really broad sense, it could happen, but like --\n  Like the story line.\n  But when you  look at details, then like, no.\n  But I mean, minotaurs don't exist. So it probably couldn't happen.\n  But like you  were saying, like metaphorically, it could be something, that, you know.\n  Like the storyline could happen.\n  But metaphorically, you could compare anything.\n  That's true.\n  Can you explain more of what you mean by metaphorically?\n  Like me.\n  No, the  only one was like \n  You mean hypothetical.\n  Theseus, not like he goes and fights a minotaur, and when he comes back, he's like not dead, but his dad thinks he's dead and kills himself. But it's like Haley said, I guess.\n  Thanks!\n  If you have like a test, and like you're bad--\n  Like a difficult situation  in general.\n  Yeah, and like your dad or parents or someone are like, \"You can get through this,\" like, \"You can beat it,\" and they think that you, or like they think that you fail it, or like catastrophe fail it, or they think you do, then they're gonna be kind of disappointed in you, but like they're not gonna necessarily kill themselves because you failed a test.\n  But still.\n  You can laugh if it was someone else.\n  But maybe like on the inside, he's dying.\n  Yeah.\n  Your turn.\n  Okay, I just said, what factors have to be changed to make this apply to modern times?\n  Well, the--\n  Probably the  whole like fantasy aspect of it would have to be changed.\n  At least like  in the... to the culture, like the gods and goddesses aren't like a, you know--\n  Big deal?\n  Yeah.\n  I think that the gods and goddesses kind of like connect with like the people that are, not like in charge, but that are higher up in our society, like the government people, and like parents and--\n  I just think  more like mentors, in general.\n  Yeah, like people that are higher than us.\n  Like anyone  technically could like, you know, that you look up to, that you rely on for help.\n  It's like a figure, rather than like-- - Yeah.\n  A physical--\n  Yeah, god.\n  God. Yeah.\n  Well my question was, show the similarities and differences between Theseus and his father.\n  Ooh, okay. So, I think like they both kind of, they're very different in their terms of like loss and like failure. Because like when Theseus's dad like thought that he was like dead, then he jumped off a cliff and committed suicide. But when like Theseus like was with Ariadne or whatever, and she like helped him to like defeat the minotaur, then he just kind of, you know, left her on an island.\n  I think that, I don't really remember how he got in the situation of having to give the people on Crete seven maidens and seven children, but like, I just think that because that happens, and because he does that every year, I think Theseus is a better leader, he's just like better in charge of--\n  I think that they're  definitely like different rulers, too. Because like Theseus is more, like including the people like when he goes and like he led his army against Thebes, but doesn't try to like-- most people would like try to steal stuff from the city, but he's just going to like bury the dead, and then he leaves. So like that's more of a nicer leader I guess, whereas his dad wasn't really like put in that situation, but I'm guessing that he would be one of those people who would probably take stuff from that city, and not include people very often.\n  It says that \n  Because he lived  with his mom, so he didn't want to have a son. So then when he could lift the rock, then he could come over and meet his dad.\n  Is this question number--\n  No, we're still asking, predict what would happen if King Aegeus and Enkidu hadn't died.\n  If the king hadn't died, I think the son would have come back and they just would have lived happily ever after, and there would have been no like--\n \n-not formed, you know what I'm talking about? Because King Aegeus--\n  No, but he  would have died sometime, and then Theseus would have taken over.\n  Yeah, that's true.\n  Can you go, dig a little deeper with what you said about the democracy? What did you mean by that?\n  Oh, just like  right when King Aegeus died, Theseus came over and said, \"We're going to have a democracy \"instead of me ruling over all of you.\" So like, we don't know if that would have happened, or because if he just would have stayed alive, he could have like changed Theseus' mind and made him think a democracy was a bad idea.\n  Mm-hmm.\n  Yeah. He would've wanted him to be-- he would have that as king. He would've been more like his dad.\n  Yeah, that's true.\n  But if Enkidu didn't die, then Gilgamesh would probably like be happy, and then like, conquer a bunch of other stuff, and like they would probably like die together.\n  She could have sent him to Athens to claim him as his--\n \n  Oh, okay, nevermind.\n  You're allowed to go on.\n  All right.\n  No, if Enkidu didn't die, though, I just think that Gilgamesh wouldn't have really known-- like you know how they said he was really arrogant in the beginning? I think he still was kind of arrogant, until Enkidu died, so he--\n  He would have stayed like that.\n  Yeah, he would have stayed that way.\n  Mm-hmm. Because he went through like a stage of depression, so.\n  Yeah.\n  Do you think that each one reached humility at the end, or no? Do you think that Gilgamesh, you said, was still arrogant, even at the end?\n  No.\n  Oh, he wasn't?\n  Not after Enkidu died, but once he died, it stopped of course, but--\n  I think Gilgamesh was arrogant until he found out that he wasn't going to be immortal.\n  Well yeah, that, too. Because then he had to like live his life to the fullest because he couldn't live forever. He couldn't do whatever he wanted.\n  Who's your favorite character between each story? Out of the stories?\n  Theseus.\n  Yeah, I like Theseus, too.\n  We all like Theseus.\n  Yeah.\n  It also said that Theseus was grieving.\n  Was grieving her loss, or his father's loss?\n  It was both.\n  Debate which character  had more impact on their society.\n  Can you say that one more time?\n  Debate which character  had more impact on their society.\n  Oh, she has the \"debate\" word in there. Okay, let's hear it.\n  I'd say Gilgamesh--\n  I would say--\n  ...he wants to be king.\n  Let's let him finish his reason. What's your reason? You think who?\n  I think Gilgamesh. Actually, I think Theseus would, because he changed the kind of structure of government, and made it democratic. That's it.\n  Yeah, I would agree with you there in the way that he kind of completely changed the government structure where he lived, while kind of Gilgamesh would probably be one of those leaders that is better forgotten than remembered, and memory lived on is not probably a theme in that story. While Theseus kind of left his ways and his story behind. That people remembered on high, rather than as like a low point of their society.\n  Weren't you going to say something?\n  Oh, I was?\n  I thought you were.\n  I think Theseus was, had an impact.\n  And the reason for that?\n  Because he like survived more than Gilgamesh did, and he helped people out of the maze, with Adrian's help, right? Yeah. Predict what would happen if the King and Enkidu didn't die.\n  Well--\n  I don't think  Athens would be democratic. I don't think the king would have done it.\n  Yeah, he probably would have been poisoned.\n  Why is that?\n  Gilgamesh--\n  I don't know, because--\n  Gilgamesh probably wouldn't have been searching for immortality.\n  Yeah, he wouldn't have gone on that Journey.\n  Yeah.\n  Okay, well my question is: how would you have handled some of the tough situations that each of the characters had to go through?\n  Wait, what was the question?\n  How would you have handled the situations?\n  Wouldn't have done any of them?\n  No, I get scared  really easily, and stressed, so that would not be good.\n   the Labyrinth thing.\n  Sorry, I didn't hear what you said.\n  I wouldn't go to  the Labyrinth thing.\n  Why is that?\n  It kind of sounds like a bad idea.\n  I might go and  just not defeat the beast, and in the first place, I probably would have traveled by water, and not just said, \"I'm too good for that, it's too easy.\" Because, I--\n  Bandits have sharp swords.\n  Yeah.\n  Okay, what's yours?\n  Choose your favorite character and explain why. From, because you like Gilgamesh or Theseus.\n  Okay. Oh, not like our favorite character, just in the story?\n  Yeah. Well either way, it doesn't really matter.\n  Well because my  favorite character from Gilgamesh was Enkidu? Is that how you say it? Because I think he like really changed Gilgamesh for the better. And helped him and humbled him.\n  Do you agree with that?\n  Yeah, I agree with that, because I feel like he was kind of-- like Gilgamesh was so awful, and like Enkidu came in and just changed all that. Plus, I thought that it was kind of cool, his journey from like a savage to the civilized guy. Yeah.\n  I don't think that Enkidu really meant to change Gilgamesh, though, I think that it was just the circumstances surrounding his death that made that happen.\n  Enkidu's mom kind of made that happen, too, didn't he?\n  Did you feel like Enkidu was just kind of created, that he, I mean we were saying that we like him, but did he seem real to you, or was he just something created?\n  See, when I read it, the entire time, he just kind of seemed like this robot that the gods had created to fix Gilgamesh, so he didn't really have that much of a personality to me, so that's my opinion, I don't know.\n  Yeah, he seemed  like his pretty much sole purpose of existence was to balance out Gilgamesh.\n  And he did.\n  Yeah, he did.\n  My favorite character  from these stories was Ariadne.\n  Oh.\n  Well, because I  didn't feel sorry for her, because she helped Theseus, and like without her, he would have been trapped in the Labyrinth. But then to repay her, he just ditched her on an island, and just left her, so that wasn't very nice. So I feel sorry for her, that's why.\n  Okay, mine is: how would you have dealt with these situations in \n  Can you repeat it one more time?\n  How would you have  handled these situa-- \n  I wouldn't run away from the-- \n  I would not have gone  on this journey. I probably just would have stayed home, not gonna lie.\n  Do you feel like, that people, to be great, have to go out in the world and seek these amazing achievements, that that's what greatness is?\n  Not necessarily.\n  I don't think you necessarily have to seek them. It all really depends on what your definition of greatness is.\n  I feel like to get that like glory and all that, I mean, I think you can do that, if you have enough impact where you are, you don't need to go off on a journey.\n  What do you think, Dinesh?\n  I don't know, I feel like, if we're going by the definitons as you would see them within these stories, that obviously you don't have to, I don't think you have to seek greatness, necessarily, I don't think you have to seek it to find it, but I think that you do have to go off, if you're just going to stay where you are, you're not really going to be able to achieve it.\n  So if you just sit on your front porch and watch your life go by, that's not greatness. That can't constitute--\n", "filename": ["Copy of 188 ELA AYA 188 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0466506], "annotations": [["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Haley"], ["NaN"], ["Haley"], ["NaN"], ["Haley"], ["NaN"], ["Haley"], ["NaN"], ["Haley"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Haley"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Haley"], ["Teacher"], ["Haley"], ["NaN"], ["Haley"], ["NaN"], ["Haley"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Haley"], ["NaN"], ["Haley"], ["NaN"], ["Haley"], ["NaN"], ["Haley"], ["NaN"], ["Haley"], ["NaN"], ["Haley"], ["NaN"], ["Haley"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Girl"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW05", "TW08", "TW24TW02"]}, "1031": {"text": " What part of soccer you really want to know?\n What about the measuring or even the measure?\n That's what you've got to figure out.\n Or how long you can.\n Okay.\n I mean how many like, times you can do it.\n Okay, so you could sit there and count how many bounces, kicks, or you could sit here with the timing.\n How much you can do it and how much time you need.\n Okay, how many per minute. So, you've got lots of ideas. You're going to have to choose that. Do you need a little more time to bounce it off each other?\n Yeah.\n Okay, so I think you have both come up with, all four of you. You guys come up with an experiment to support each other and you two come up with one. And you'll collect your data and you'll collect your data and then present it as a company. How about that?  soccer team or company. Alright? Alright, you've got a good name. Alright, that's part of it.  It works. Catch your attention.\n I know, Stephanie.\n We're having trouble.\n Because we barely decided on it. We didn't do the friction one, but  the one where you drop the marble in the the shampoo bottle. The little car that you pull back and see how far it goes.\n \n Okay.\n And the parachute one, so I thought of the parachute one.\n What do you think?\n Yeah.\n You're a team on it, okay. So, what are you going to measure with a parachute?\n \n Pardon?  Yeah, you're going to use metric, which is centimeters. Stephanie's got control of the metrics. So, can you tell me what your experiment is going to look like with these parachutes?\n Well, we don't know how far . Because we know we can't throw it out the window.\n Oh no.\n It's too far.\n Okay, but you know what...\n Maybe on the counter?\n You guys are coordinated, I would let you stand on this counter and you could kind of measure different heights. How high you could... You could do some test runs, right?\n Yeah.\n Don't you think scientists would do test trials before they make a real decision? Okay.\n Yeah.\n And you know what? If you'd like, if we have time, I want you to do test runs in here, but we could do a final drop off the balcony and get it clear.\n That's what I was thinking.\n Okay, but I do want you to do test runs in here first and then we could do a final. But make your hypothesis, what you're thinking because I think you're on a roll here. It's going to be good.\n I don't like his interview.\n So how far?\n In this experiment, can we put like some sort of weight on the parachute to see how fast or something?\n Okay, I think you're making another experiment, right? So, what's your first experiment?\n Just how fast it would drop by itself.\n How fast from one distance?\n Yeah.\n Okay, so one distance you're going to see how fast it'll drop. And then you're going to compare that to from that distance.\n Adding weights to it.\n Okay, alright.\n Well, I wondered how far will the parachute go from different heights.\n Okay, so she's got one experiment and you've got another one. Do you want to do two in one and kind of combine it together? You do yours and you do yours. Because you only can change one variable at a time, right?\n Yeah.\n So, what's your variable you're going to measure?\n I'm going to measure the distance, how far.\n How high, different distances. And what are you going to do?\n \n And you're going to time it, right?\n Yeah.\n Okay, and you're going to do, what's your variable that you're going to change?\n The weight.\n Okay. But you're going to see how fast it drops?\n Yeah.\n Alright, so I think you're going to need another paper.\n Okay.\n Because you've got two experiments going. Are you going to support each other in each one?\n Yeah.\n That's pretty cool, double points. How are you guys doing? Oh, I like it. Okay, tell me about this one.\n Okay, so we're going to get two or three different size basketballs, like a really small one and maybe a medium one and then... Yeah. And then we're going to like have two meters or a meter and like drop it from there. So, like how high it bounces depending on its size.\n Oh, so the size of the balls to see how--\n High it bounces.\n Okay.\n If it bounces higher  .\n What do you think?\n I think the small one will bounce higher.\n Because there's less material to like have to drop from there.\n Like when in gym class when they have the huge balls for exercising, if you drop a bigger one usually it doesn't go up as high and the smaller ones do bounce higher.\n So, based on your observations. You're a good observer.\n  So, your large ball went the highest and you thought the small one would. Whoa, are these your averages?\n  Yeah, they're my averages.\n Wow, okay. Good. So, how are you guys going to present it as a team?\n She's probably going to do like what we thought would happen . And I'm probably going to do the results of what actually happens.\n  Are you comfortable with that?\n Uh-huh.\n Okay, to make it really clear what you did?\n  Yeah, yeah.\n Okay, I think that'll be really good because this is great, this is great to show, and then you're writing your conclusion with numbers in it, I like that. And then you told, yours was rejected, right?\n Yeah.\n Okay, now does that mean you're a failure?\n  No.\n Do you guys mind going first?\n Sure.\n  Because if they see that yours is rejected and yet you still could write up a scientific experiment, I think that might give them some confidence and it'll take the pressure off them because they don't really want to go first.\n  Okay, so let's go.\n   Aqui tenemos que cambiar la  friccion sobre dos.  Tenemos que cambiar.\n  Oh wow, the graph looks good. And your data chart looks good. So, Jenni will you shows yours?\n On the first dictation thing when we have to go up there, do we have to go up by step, like show everything?\n  What do you think?\n Or just show our graph?\n  What do you think would be the best?\n  I say showing the graph.\n Should we show like, our question and then should we show the whole thing?\n  What do you think?\n I don't know.\n  I think so. Showing both.\n Okay.\n But it's probably the most important thing to convince them. I'd definitely show your data.\n  Okay, we'll show his because it's better than mine.\n Okay, very good. And let's see, yes it looks professional. So, these numbers... How many times did you do this experiment?\n Three times, wait, four, three, twelve.\n  100, I don't know.\n  Because there's five and there's three.\n Okay. We've got one, two, three, four, five trials here. Is that correct?\n No, we went up three, but he wrote trials for these.\n  Oh, okay. So, we can fix that?\n   Que dibujaste? No tienes que poner esto.  Tienes que poner esto.\n It's very neat. So, you added one, two, three and divided by...\n  By three.\n  Okay, alright, that's how you got the average?\n  Yeah.\n  Okay, and who figured out the answer?\n Me.\n  Jenni.\n Wow, Jenni.\n We did, was it highest to lowest?\n  Yeah.\n Highest minus lowest, divided by two.\n Awesome. You definitely should show this. And then this would be uncertainty.\n  Yeah.\n And these are the mounted distance with different kinds of... What are these five things?\n  The shoes.\n  Okay.\n  The shoes.\n  It gets tiring when you have to do it three times.\n  Right. Now my question is, if you didn't have the shoes how did you get the data for it?\n  I did it at my house.\n You did them at your house? Okay. And then what's this one right over here?\n  The socks.\n Okay, and that's one you definitely did at school?\n  Yeah, we did it here and we also did the Vans here.\n And the Vans. Alright, so that's good. Would you explain that to the class?\n  Yeah.\n That these you did at home and these you did here and so would you have any sources of error?\n Yeah, because of the surface. Like at his house it would have been not like floor, it would be carpet or something like that.\n  Yeah, what's your floor like where you did it?\n  Well, I had to do it like outside during the rain.\n Oh my goodness. Okay, so you've got to explain that and then do you think that would affect your experiment any?\n  Yeah.\n Okay, maybe it would. And so what would a scientist do in the next time?\n Would have done it in a dry place.\n  Yeah, do it in a dry place.\n   Yeah, I like that. Okay, so you'll tell that for the next time?\n Yeah.\n But I really liked how you guys didn't give up. How you actually did the socks compared to your Vans.\n And you know how you pull those out what are  research, we could have done your boot.\n  Oh yeah, my boot. Yeah, I could have. Want to do my boot?\n  No, I'm good.\n No .\n  My legs are tired .\n Okay, I'm sure they are.\n  Well, did you accept or reject your hypothesis?\n Accept.\n  We accepted it.\n  And tell us why.\n Because .\n  You've got the evidence right there, don't you?\n  The experiment, like that one question we had, it goes with the real world or something like that.  \n  Could you repeat this experiment?\n The whole thing?\n  Yeah, or could anybody do this experiment?\n Yeah, it's easy.\n  It is? Did you write your procedure so it's easy?\n  It's hard to write a procedure because it .\n  Okay, and if you had to do this experiment over again, would you do it any differently or not?\n No.\n  Would you test for anything else?\n \n  Good point. How much pressure, right? Okay, alright, any other questions? Nice job. Thanks.  Jenni's team. Sorry to rush you guys, but we got the idea.   \n  What was your experiment?\n Our experiment was to find out what types of shoes would work to do the moon walk.  uses four different pairs of shoes like Adidas, , Converse or Vans. The Adidas would go the farthest. The Vans . \n  No, just show the data.\n You were correct.  And you were correct because the Adidas were here and the first time it went like 112 centimeters and the second trial it went 118 centimeters and the final was like 12 and then it was like 116.6 centimeters.  We accepted our hypothesis. Jenni, continue this.\n  Why me?\n  Because you're professional.\n Well, we were going to do an interview , but we forgot to.  So, what do we do? It's really bad.\n  Why do you think it's bad, Jenni?\n I don't know.\n  Esta bien, esta bien.\n Well, here's the amount of distance and here's the kind of  and I marked them as the average they all went. So, we can see that the Adidas went more than the Vans did because the Vans were like, the lowest. \n  Will you tell us about your source of error because that was interesting. Because you had a good way to solve it if you did your project over again.\n Oh, yeah. Well, it's because Jose did half of the experiment, he did it at home and the other part of it we did here and I think it did it different because he did it in the rain and we did it like on dry. So, I think that affected the experiment.\n  There's probably different traction on shoes.\n  Si.  Simon.\n  What kind of shoe would you try next time?\n A boot.\n  Oh, like my major walking boot .\n Si.\n  Alright. What would you hypothesize would happen if you tried my boot? If you look at the...\n Well, because it's soft, so I think it'll go farther.\n Possibly go farther.\n  Okay, alright. That would be interesting to try out. Does everybody see how this can apply to real life?\n \n  Tienen preguntas?\n  Hablan en ingles, no espanol.\n  Can you explain how this would apply to real life, if you aren't just moon walking?\n Jose?\n Jenni?\n Don't look at me.\n I don't know.\n  Go on the actual moon.\n  Gym class.\n  Yeah, gym class.\n  Does anybody change out of their shoes for gym class?\n  Sometimes.\n  Okay, some people do.\n  I don't.\n  You don't?\n  Yeah, like these shoes, they slide a lot like, in the gym .\n  Okay, so it might be different shoes for different jobs?\n  Yeah.\n  Okay, well thank you. Nice job. Good, we have time for our last presentation. Thank you.  Alright, sorry to rush everybody. I know you could talk more about it. Thanks for being a good audience.   \n Hello class, how are we doing today?\n  Good.\n So our title was dirty water versus clean water. Thank you. Our experiment had to do with a sailboat in four different types of water.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 1031 SCI AYA 1031edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.0632396], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceovoer"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Class"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW09s"]}, "060": {"text": "  Does that include slaves?\n  Yes\n  Does that include women?\n  Yes.\n  Okay.\n  So how are we supposed to take uneducated people's opinions when they obviously don't know what's gonna happen?\n  Because a lot of people in Russia-- I mean, if the Russian's knew how to read, they would write a song. If they knew what was going on, and they were smart enough, they would obviously write a song about it.\n  I think John Locke had one more thing to say, is that right?\n  Yes, okay, and to answer your question about the government. The government was created to protect people's rights, it wasn't created for you to abuse power and just do what you think you need to do, they are only for them, and it's not doing what it needs to do, then yeah, the people do have the right.\n  People aren't dead, so obviously I'm doing what I need to do, and I'm protecting them.\n  If that's all you care about, then that would just be easy not to let people die.\n  Obviously they're not having problems where their lives threatened. We have all these, like... If you're, wherever you live... Anyways, wherever you live, if your king or queen wasn't doing what they thought to protect you guys, and you had all these invaders coming in, then you could argue being mad at them because they're not protecting you and doing their job.\n  That's when you know they're upset.\n  Plus, you're saying that your people aren't educated, but they're educated enough to know what their rights are, and how they should be treated, so...\n  I mean, you can think you should be treated in a certain way, but I could say I think I should be able to slide on this floor right now, but I might not know if I slide on this floor right now, I'm gonna die. But because I'm not educated in that kind of way. But your king or queen is educated in that kind of way, so they're not gonna let you do stuff like that.\n  We're not asking for stuff like that, we're asking for our natural rights.\n  I know that they,   What's the word? The end result? Conclusion. I know the conclusion of you guys getting your natural rights, and the way that you guys are acting for them. In a way, I'm gonna get you guys what you guys need to get, your conclusion is gonna be a whole lot better than what you guys are hoping.\n  So what's the point of having your natural rights if you're going to abuse the law?\n  It doesn't mean you're going to abuse the law, it just means that you're gonna be more cooperative towards the law.\n  You're attributed to a beggar if they don't give you your natural rights. It's like a two-way type thing.\n If they give it to you, then you're gonna be happy about it, and you're gonna want to follow them and listen to them. Instead of trying to revolt and kick them out if they're not gonna give it to you.\n  Alright, so we say government is a good thing, bad thing, or kind of in between. Let's go around the room real quick. What would you guys say?\n  I would say government is a positive thing because it stopped some starving, and it keeps everything in place.\n  Okay, good.\n  We're in between. Because it's there to protect your rights, but if they're not gonna be there to protect you, then they shouldn't be there at all.\n  Okay, so it has to be done in the correct way?\n  Government is a good thing.\n  Any explanation why?\n  Because if you don't have a government, then you aren't organized, and if you're not organized, then you're, like, chickens would be in your home. \n  We think that philosophers, they write what they feel about us, and they don't do anything about it, and they don't understand where we're coming from. \"You philosophers are lucky men. You write on paper, and paper is patient. Unfortunate Empress that I am, I write on the susceptible skins of living beings.\" Meaning that they write on paper because they can put out they opinion like that, but we have to be responsible for all the people in our country, and we're trying to do what's best for them.\n  In your opinion. \n  Frederick?\n  We think government is interesting because we need a government to be organized. But government also does a lot of bad stuff.\n  We think the government is completely necessary along with religion, because it brings unity to the people.\n  And I think the laws and religion kind of go hand in hand because... I wouldn't consider myself a Christian, but others probably would, because of certain stuff I write in books, that's why they consider me as a heretic, but the bible says, \"Thou shall not kill.\" Killing someone is also against the law. Thou shall not steal is also against the law.\n  I feel the government is good if it uses the right power, basically for their rights and things. As long as-- It should be there, we feel it should be there, but it needs to be used appropriately.\n  We believe, sort of,  that the government is a positive. If you didn't have a government as a base structure for your country. If you didn't... The government perhaps is a positive. Due to the fact that the government, helps you if you need it to an extent, I agree with Catherine the Great in the fact that it sort of really helps with the territory. I've been interviewed by many people, and specifically saying, to many people I've said it, that I'm capable of saying whatever I want. So my country is there, and  I get to do whatever I want\n  If you were the king,  you'd do whatever you want to. Theoretically. Alright, Voltaire.\n  Pretty much, the government is an abomination. I mean, there's way more bad  and nasty leaders than there are good, lawful public leaders that do good stuff. Too many leaders take advantage of their people in their kingdoms, so I think they should just all go away, start over with enlightened, total... \n  What about slavery?\n  What do you think about slavery?\n  What do you people think about slavery?\n  What about slavery. Anybody have an opinion? Is slavery good bad or otherwise?\n  I wouldn't say slavery is a negative. then again, I wouldn't say  that it's a bad thing either.  I guess you could say, mostly slavery came from Austria due to the fact that if you get in trouble, with another country, and they sand to the Austria you're pretty much going to be a slave for the rest of your life. You pretty much work for them. You work for the Pope himself, and you work for the Roman Emperor.\n  Voltaire?\n  I think slavery is a necessary evil.\n  A necessary evil? \n  Well, we disagree  with , because we see everyone  as equals, and think everyone should be treated equally, and it's part of their natural rights such as freedom.\n  Exactly, that would  be considered one of their natural rights. \n Rousseau? \n  Serfs, which were similar to slaves, very good. Last comment there,  Thomas Hobbes?\n  I don't think we really have an opinion on slavery, but if the king decided to have slavery in the country, I think we should respect that and do it for the betterment of the country.\n  Respect the authority  of the king?\n  No piling up...  ...because that's what  slavery is there for.\n  Okay. Very good. Any last minute comments? I think we're almost out of time for our salon discussion. I heard a lot of good ideas. Does anybody have any last minute comments that they want to add? Yes, Frederick?\n  A lot of things that we have to say I didn't get... Three things of everybody's opinion. All you guys are really self... You're not sinners or anything. For lack of better words. And I wouldn't read them, meaning I would probably do anything to get support from my people, and I'd do anything for my people. Like my dad would do anything for me, he raised me well. And slavery and natural rights and all that mumbo-jumbo shouldn't be from you, because you're not them. You're not, just as you're not Voltaire, and I'm not Thomas. So you can't overrule anybody else, it's not right.\n  Very good. Excellent job, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending our little salon here. Hopefully we learned some new ideas, and got to hear some other opinions of people throughout Europe, so let's give yourselves a little round of applause.  Alright, you are now done with the salon. You can take your little parts if you want and put them up because you are no longer those people, you are now you in modern day times. Back to modern day times. But I do have some questions, we are not done with our discussion, but you are not longer your person, you are back to being you. \n We are not done,  and I'm going to ask you your questions now. Please listen. What was the purpose of a salon? We've talked about this from what you've right here. What was the purpose of a salon?\n  Exchange ideas.\n  Exchange ideas,  any other purposes?\n  Sometimes like, Joseph did over there, but to find out what people thought of you.\n  Okay, to find out  different opinions. Okay, maybe see something from a different side or viewpoint.\n  It was a devised to discuss music, who gets painting time...\n  Okay, so it has an artistic point to it as well.\n  It was just another way for us to learn about taking notes and stuff. Like research on our person and then hearing what the other people thought.\n  But as far as back then, is what we're thinking about.\n  Oh, back then. Oh.\n  Yes, you were right  about what you said.\n  Just to exchange ideas and go back until people like it.\n  Would you say there were effective back then?\n  Yes.\n  We haven't talked about results, we kind of left off talking about these people and how they talked about things and came to the salon. Do you think this is going to be an effective method of discussing?\n  The conversations we were having with them over there, like how they didn't think that we were listening to what the people were saying and how we were just gonna stay the way we were and stuff, but actually they got to hear our thinking about moving to where we need to go, it's gonna take them a little longer to get there.\n  Okay. Do we have anything like salons today? Do we have salons today?\n  Yes.\n  What happens at salons now? \n Right, so it's not so much political all the time in exchanging ideas about government stuff, but they're still kind of socialization and gossip going on. Is there anything that we have in place, or anything in our society today which you can discuss opinions, especially about government or problems that you might have in life?\n  Um...\n  Since salons don't really go with that, but... \n  So if you have a problem with your country or with the government or with something that's going on, we don't have a salon to go and meet like this and talk with people, but is there anything that we do that? Or any other thing? Another way to voice your problem, if your dissenting and you have a different agreement, or a disagreement with the government, or with anybody, anything. What can you do?\n  Don't we have press conferences?\n  What do you mean representatives? Write letters. Write letters to who?\n  The government.\n  Congress, the government, okay.\n  They also have environment issues and worldwide problems.\n  Worldwide problems. Okay, that's kind of similar. Where different people come and talk about their issues, their problems, and maybe how to solve them.\n  You kind of have different levels like, if you have a problem with, like, if it's about the school, you go to the school board.\n  Okay.\n  President, or people who are trying to be president, they have the debates on TV.\n  Okay, good. As far as being an average citizen, what can you do? Say there's an issue with the world, or an issue in our country, or an issue in our city that we want to see fixed, what can we do, you think, to maybe, go about fixing that, or trying to get that done?\n  Protest.\n  Protest. Is that allowed? Are we allowed to protest?\n  Yes.\n  Were you allowed to protest back then?\n  It depends on where you live at.\n  Depends on where you live. We have a different government now, right? Back then it was monarchy, now it's more of a democracy. So what we're seeing here a little bit, a little bit different method and a lot more opportunity.\n  There's a town like...\n", "filename": ["Copy of 060 SSH EA 060 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0741887], "annotations": [["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["All"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["All"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["All"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW08", "TW18", "TW24", "TW24TW08"]}, "310": {"text": " So, does percent always have to be 100?\n No.\n Because I see, none of the percents up here are 100.\n They're all lower than 100%.\n So you think a percent can either be 100 or less.\n Yes.\n Okay, okay. So that means you think this can be called an improper. Okay. Ian.\n Three-fourths and the decimal 0.75 are the same.\n What do you mean by the same? One's a decimal, one's a fraction.\n Well, I mean like they're equivalent.\n Ah. Equivalent. So, does that go back to what Alana said? Alana, which ones did you have there?\n One-half and .5.\n So you're saying the same kind of relationship is one and the same with  one-half and 5/10?\n Yeah.\n Okay. Alana, no?\n Well, I did one-fourth, three-fourths, 0.75 and 0.25 because they're all part of quarters.\n Ah, you did one-fourth, what was the other one?\n One... Wait, one-fourth,  three-fourths.\n All right.\n 0.75 and 0.25, because they're all part of quarters. Ah.\n Okay, quarters. I can think of,  money. Quarters. Or...\n Yeah, 25 cents, 75 cents.\n Yeah, 25 cents is one quarter.\n 75 cents is three quarters. Three-quarters, one-quarter.\n Excellent. Good, good. Ian?\n Everything can be made a percent or a fraction or a decimal.\n Oooh. So you found a way to connect every single one of them. So everything can be made into... Say it again?\n A percent, fraction or decimal.\n Interesting. So you're saying that I can take this percent and write it as a, just a percent? Or as a... What else?\n Fraction and decimal.\n So, okay, he's connecting all. He thinks all three of them can become equivalent. From the views before.  Excellent, Ian.\n Six-fourth, one-fourth and three-fourth,  they all have a denominator of four.\n Ah, yeah. What does that mean that they all have a denominator of four?\n Well, they're all like, sets of fourths.\n What does a denominator represent in a fraction?\n The, um...bottom number?\n When we write it as the bottom number, when we're literally writing it, what does it actually represent? What's that for?\n How many equal parts it's split into.\n Ah, the number of equal parts it's split into. So let me go back to Ian. Ian is saying that everything can be written as also, as a fraction, a decimal, and a percent. So can everything be in four parts? What if it's in five parts? Does that matter?\n I can do the five parts as a percent or I can do four parts as a percent?\n Yeah.\n What about what Alan said? Percent, is it up to a hundred and that's it?\n No, depends on the range that you set it.\n So can you give me an example of when something would be more than 100%?\n Well, like, when something you did in Earth Science we did to see if our grow-dino grew over 600%.\n Good connection. Okay. So what did that mean if it grew over 600%?\n It, like, grew bigger than, times...\n Over six hundred times its size?\n Yeah, 600 times its size. Okay. So is it possible, so is that an improper percent? No, but we sort of get stuck into thinking that percent is 100%,  meybe we can't go over 100%. What happened here? You tell me about that percent. \n It's less than one percent. Is that possible? Can you think of a real-life example when you'd have less than one percent?  about growing something expanding over and over, to 600 times its size. Can you give a real-life example of when I would have 0%?\n When you fail a test.\n Oh. Well, I could fail a test with 64%. What does it mean if I fail a test with 0%? Other than I'm in big trouble at home. What does it mean? What would that mean if you failed it with 0%? What would that mean about what you did on the test?\n You didn't get anything right.\n Yeah, you got zero right,  nothing right. Didn't get a single question right. Can it be less than zero? Is this less than zero?\n Yeah.\n No.\n It's less than one.\n So where is zero here? \n Tenths is that zeros?\n No.\n Where's zeros?\n Between.\n Where would they go? Would they go in the ones place, tens place...\n Ones.\n In the ones place. We have zero ones. So is this less than zero?\n Yes.\n No.\n No.\n No, because it's 0.1 \n Interesting, okay. So, can I have less than zero percent?\n No. You can have a negative, but\n If it's negative percent...\n Can you have a negative percent?\n What do you think?\n Well, I was going to say something could be, like, one point, like, point one percent less than something, if you're comparing two things.\n Okay, your percent of increase or decrease, have you looked at that in Earth Science yet? Standard deviation? Okay. We'll talk about that somewhere else the percentage of increase-decrease.  I'm talking about a negative increase in or decrease in percent. And whether that's below one or zero. Okay, so can you give an example of where this could occur? Where I can have less than 1%?\n It can occur I think  with that fraction.\n Okay, but that's just a made up. Can you give me something in real life that I could have less than 1%? You can have an example of  more than 100%. So my question is, does percent go from 100 to one, or zero, or is there anything less in between? What do you think?\n Like, a gas tank in your backyard.\n Okay.\n Like when you call in to get it filled and it's really low. The meter's low, and under one.\n Okay, that's typically not going to be measured in percent, it's going to be measured in how many gallons for your tank, it's going to be a volume situation.\n Oh.\n Okay, but we'll talk about that. So let's keep that in mind. We're still trying to find an example when we have less than 1%. Think of one, Alice?\n Like, on the labels and stuff on the vitamins, less than 1% of your recommended day or something.\n I just so happen to have here, vitamins. You're right. And there are some examples when, if I take this, I'm not going to get my daily 1%, I'm going to get less than that. But there's some of these in here, ooh, like if I take one of these I get 100% of vitamin C. Now, I drank a glass of orange juice this morning, when I took my vitamin. What happened to the percent of vitamin C? Where's it at?\n It went over 100.\n Over 100. So, there's a real-life when I can get over 100% of something. Anybody get over 100% on a quiz or test ever? Over? And, how do you get that?\n Bonus.\n Ah, bonus questions. So we're good with coming up with more than 100%. But we're still trying to figure out if we can think of an example where it's less than one percent. So, we'll go back to that. Any other connections? Let's see if we can connect the ones we haven't done yet. Anything with the leftover ones?\n One-fifth and 20% are equal.\n Okay. Box right there. They're equivalent to each other, right? How did you know they were equivalent?\n Because one-fifth of 100 is 20.\n Okay, she did one-fifth of 100, because we think of, again we keep going back to a hundred for 100%, is 20 out of 100. Excellent. What else?\n One-tenth and 10%.\n Ah, what can you say about one-tenth and 10%?\n They're equivalent.\n Again, equivalent. Going to go back to Ian. Ian, they're finding the percent and the decimal, but there's no fraction there. Fraction with a percent, but there's no decimal. Is there a third for all of them? You said there's an equivalent fraction, decimal, percent for all of them.\n No.\n But there can be.\n The decimal would be \n So what would you like to add here, Ian? Let's go to the... which one?  You pick one. Find the equivalent relationship and see if we can find that third piece we're missing.\n Well, 150 and six-fourths is equal.\n Okay. Do we think they equal each other?\n No.\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n Convincing, but not yet, you haven't convinced everybody.  Do you think that equals...? Okay, four-fourths would equal 100%\n And one-fourth, each fourth is 25% and if it's two over, then\n I've got two-fourths left over.\n And that'd be 50.\n And they can also equal 0.5.\n So now we need the decimal piece. 1.5. What did you say, Alan?\n Uh, two-fourths can equal 0.5.\n So what do you think six-fourths, give me the decimal that I'll put here. We agree that these are equal.\n 1.5.\n Oh, so there is a decimal that goes there.\n How'd you get 1.5?\n Oh, because one and a half.\n Got it? See where the half came from? You said, Ruby, you had told us that one-half and five-tenths were equal. So, if we have that one-half here, we do the same thing, we combine it here to get the 50%. Okay. So, any others? What's the missing piece, Ian?\n Uh, you mean like another decimal to put in or do you mean like, another...\n Well, pick two that are equivalent and give me the missing third piece.\n One in one-thousands.\n One thousandths.\n One thousandths and 0.1%.\n Ah. Are these equivalent?\n No.\n Yes.\n No.\n You're going to have to convince them, Ian. It's the day of Ian convincing, I don't know.\n They are.\n Why do you say they are?\n Because one percent over a hundred... \n Well, because that's tenth, that's not thousandths.\n It's not one-tenth, it's one-tenth of a percent. So, here's another question then. Are those equivalent?\n No.\n No. So be careful. That's not one-tenth, that's one-tenth of a percent. So could one tenth of a percent be the same as one one-thousandths?\n Yes.\n Yeah, but when you divide it by 100.\n Ah, so we keep hearing, divide and multiply by a hundred, so when I convert from a percent to a decimal, or percent to a fraction, I'm using powers of what?\n Ten.\n Ten. So the question is: Is that the equivalent to that?\n Yeah.\n How do you want to do it, Ava?\n Um.\n Can you fill in the missing piece? Can you give me the equivalent decimal to try to convince me to go from here to here, with a missing decimal that I have? I have the percent and I have the fraction but we think we're going to get all three of them. Can you tell me what decimal that is?\n Um, zero and one-thousandth?\n How did you get that?\n Um, divide by 100.\n Ah. Dividing by 100. What do you notice happens when we divide by 100?\n It goes back.\n Okay, when we divide it...\n It moves two decimal places.\n And the decimal place moves two places over. So did that happen? So, are we convinced that these three are now equal?\n Yes.\n Can we see that now?\n But you divide 0.1% you divide it by a hundred to get... Oh yes, you're changing it back because you multiply a decimal by 100 so you have that. Okay.\n Yeah. Now that Ava gave us the decimal, is it easier to convince ourselves that all three are equivalent to each other?\n Yes.\n Because now you when you read that, you read it as what? One and one one-thousandths. So are we convinced that we can find an equivalent fraction, decimal, percent for every fraction, every decimal and every percent?\n Yes.\n So why do we have all three? Why not do everything in fractions, do everything in percents, or do everything in decimals? Why do we have, in real life, all three things going on?\n Alice?\n Because for some things it's easier to picture it in percent, in decimal.\n Okay, so picturing a visual to go with it, can you think of an example of one we use or, in real life?\n Well, like with money. It's like easier to think that it's going to be 25 cents or 0.25 than like, 25% of a dollar. Yeah, wouldn't that be interesting if they said, how much is that salad today? Well, it's something percent of a dollar.\n Okay, Ian?\n Well, with fractions, one-third is equal to 0.333 and keep going.\n Ah, so if we did with fractions or decimals, we might have some repeating...\n", "filename": ["Copy of 310 MATH EA 310 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.279304], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW08m", "TW13"]}, "1377": {"text": " Yeah, I wanna talk to you some more.\n This is cool, that's probably how you attract them is start doing this. \n Hey, tell me why you think, Adam, he's able to do this again.\n Because he has these legs, like his legs stick to the ground so I think they can do it because they stick to the ground to get the strength, then he pulls it up and he does it again.\n Hey, that sounds like a connection to what we've been learning about the structures and the functions. Yeah, so when it's time to start making those connections, I really want you to write that down with your team. Just make sure that that gets on your paper. Okay, I want you writing out, how many paper clips is this beetle pulling?\n Two grams.\n Two grams, right now mathematician get busy. \n Okay. I'm gonna keep putting another one on here to make sure.\n Put four on there, let's see if he can do it with four. Hey little buddy, don't, don't, don't. No, no, no, no, pull him away.\n What am I doing?\n He's making a sound! He's making a sound!\n He's making a hiss--\n He's making a hissing sound.\n You think? Why do you think he's hissing?\n Maybe because he thinks we're trying to hurt him.\n Yeah, for self defense.\n Yeah, alright. Let me go check in with some other teams. You all keep working on your beetle.\n Okay. \n What's going on at your all's beetle team?\n He's pulling-\n The beetle is pulling two times its weight.\n Two times right now?\n Yeah.\n So how many paper clips is that that he's pulling?\n Two.\n Three, three. \n He's pulling three.   \n Your beetle's not moving. You think it's because of the loudness?\n Yeah.\n Class city class, should you be going to other team's beetles? I know it's fun, and I know it's interesting, but should you be going to other team's experiments?\n No, ma'am.\n You need to be engaged with your team. Okay.\n We're trying to--\n Okay. Did he pull two?\n He's pulled two and then we're gonna--\n He has pulled two? Okay. So let's see, let's just give him a little nudge in the rear.\n When I put a pencil right here, he'll go after it.\n Oh, well see if that works, do you think--\n I know, like earlier he was trying to get out of the bucket.\n Let's see if he can pull it? He's doing it. He's moving.\n Oh my gosh. \n I see he's moving some, but I haven't seen the paper clips move yet, that's what we have to wait and see. Are the paper clips going to move?\n Wait, I have to do my job. \n They're moving! They're moving! So he just pulled three grams? Okay, so... Did the beetle pull three grams? Beth, where's your sheet? Go ahead, help.  Talk to each other about what's happening.\n Woah, you can't hold him, you have to leave him on the table.\n Wrecking ball!\n Somebody pick these up.\n I got it.\n You hold him up, good, teamwork. You hold him up.\n You're hurting him, you're hurting him.  There we go, now we've got four paper clips on there. Now, lets put the paper clips behind him. Now... Talk to each other. Talk to each other.\n I think he's, I think he'll be able to pull many, many, many. Right now.\n I think the beetle may be able to pull-- \n Eight, eight.\n That's how many we have.\n Oh, this team over here has eight, I might need to go over... \n Woah, wait, wait, wait.\n Get a green.\n Let's see him in action.\n I am noticing that we underestimated our beetles, didn't we?   We underestimated our beetles, didn't we?\n Yeah.\n Our beetles may be able to pull more than we anticipated.\n We can do nine.\n Okay.\n Not yet, not yet.\n Keep working, mathematicians keep track.\n He's going. \n Talk to me team about what's going on.\n He can talk.\n It can pull nine times...\n It pulled eight.\n Its body weight.\n It is pulling nine times its body weight? Wow, how many paper clips is nine times its body weight?\n Nine grams.\n Nine grams? Holy moly. Did any of you all predict that this beetle would be able to pull nine grams?\n No, we only did all four.\n We only thought four, he'd pull four.\n We only thought four. We only thought four. Okay, are you all making any connections? How in the world is this beetle able to pull nine grams of paper clips? Nine times its body weight. What do you think-- Oh now look, when it's on the desk is it able to do it?\n No, its harder for him to do it on the desk.\n Why can't it do it on the desk?\n I think he might have a better grip on the construction paper.\n What grips better? What structure is gripping better on that construction paper?\n Because it has--\n It's because it's got, it's got like suction cups and I guess it's not used to the slippery desk.\n It has claws to pull it.\n It's pulling it.\n I think it looks really--\n It's what, Abby?\n Even though it's really loud in here its still moving.\n It's still moving even though it's loud in here, that's right.\n I think it just wants to go to Justice.\n You think the beetle's trying to go to Justice? I don't know about that. Are you gonna try a tenth paper clip?\n Yep.\n Yes.\n Look, look ten.\n Ten paperclips? Let's see.   \n He's taking your pencil.\n He's wants to get your pencil.\n Oh, why do you think?\n Because it's  wood.\n Because he likes wood.\n And what type of animal is the beetle?\n Bess, Betsy beetle.\n But what do they do? Why do they eat wood?\n They are... \n It's pulling ten!\n Why does the bess beetle eat wood?\n Look at him, I don't know if he's pulling ten or not. Look at him.\n Because he's a decomposer!\n He is a de-- He is barely pulling ten. He's having to work really, really hard.\n Yeah.\n I think it's probably time to stop adding them to the beetle, you think?\n I put max.\n Maximum is ten.\n Do you think we can add--\n Class city class, if your beetle is struggling and, like, arching its back and, like, flipping its legs, but it's barely pulling it, it may be time for you to give the beetle, we don't wanna be mean to the beetle.\n Our max was ten.\n Okay. So, we're left on, thank you for taking them off. \n Alright class city class.\n Yes, baby, yes.\n Put your eyes on me. Oh, I'm waiting. I'm waiting. Thank you. Most of us have come to the point where the beetle is struggling, okay? And having a hard time pulling the weight. At this point, if your beetle is struggling it is time to start the summarizer and the connector job. Okay, so I wanna hear you talking, summarizing, connecting what has happened. \n Let's give him a rest.\n Yeah, let's give him--\n Wait, don't pull that.\n Oh my gosh.\n How many is he pulling?\n Seven.\n Okay, here, I'll bring you some more. Where are the rest of your paper clips?\n Right there.\n Get off.\n He's starting pulling.\n Okay, oh be nice to my beetle friend.\n I'm trying to. He keeps on getting his foot stuck to my hand.\n Hi little buddy. Oh, I almost touched it! \n We learned before that beetles...\n Hang on, you're learning that beetles what?\n That beetles are really strong, but with their little legs and their thorax maybe.\n Their thorax you think is what makes them really strong?\n Because the thorax, it may be the biggest part in their body.\n Yeah, it is probably the biggest part. What else on their legs, what on their legs are helping it?\n Their... Look at it. I know what it is. Their...\n The thing that's sticking to the table and helping it move faster.\n Okay, so the sticky part on their feet?\n Here, let me do it.\n Yeah, okay.\n You all have done a really nice job noticing what structures of this beetle are helping it to be so strong. How do you think it uses that in the wild? Like out in nature? How do you think it uses that?\n It's functional and it almost-- \n You may even think it's cool, but he could use his wings to fly away.\n Some beetles do have wings to fly away, but what do you think is, I need you in your seat Nathan, what do you think it's using to move? Its, that's a lot of strength.\n Its abdomen?\n Right, okay, its abdomen is, but in nature. What might it use that for?\n It might use it to catch its prey maybe.\n Okay, what does it... What does it do? What does it eat?\n It may eat...\n Casey, say it again to your team.\n Organic and it breaks it down.\n It breaks it down. What is that called? What type of insect would--\n It's a, it's a d...\n A d... A d... \n A d...\n A D.\n A disposer.\n Not a disposer, close.\n A decomposer.\n That's it!  Not a disposer, but a decomposer, good. And so okay think, it's okay. Think about if it was trying to dig into the wood of a tree. Wouldn't it have to be really strong?\n It can make a hole.\n In the wood of the tree.\n That little thing, the little... might be to decompose the wood.\n So it can bite and then break down.\n It's really gonna have to be biting harder.\n Yeah, that mouth part is really strong to bite. Okay, so now may I have your attention, how many do you have?\n We have 10.\n You have 10 and it's pulling it, let's send him home.\n I want 11. \n They're moving, look at his legs how hard they're trying to pull. You might, he might be able to pull 11.\n I'm gonna give him one extra.\n No!\n No 12.\n Okay, you all keep working on that, you're doing a great job.\n Thank you.\n I wanna come back to my very first team.\n Carrying 10.\n 10?\n Ours can carry 11.\n Yeah.\n It did?\n Yeah.\n And he pooped on the paper.\n Okay, it pooped?\n Twice.\n It pooped twice?\n Yeah, twice.\n Okay, let me put this here. I don't know where to put it. There we go. So what are you doing? Are you adding 11?\n We're gonna see our 11 puller.\n You're gonna do 11? What connections can you make?\n The legs are like a crayfish.\n The legs are like a crayfish?\n Yeah.\n How?\n They have joints.\n They're jointed. How do you think those joints help that beetle to pull 11 times its body weight?\n The beetle is like a, able to grab on.\n Yes, so, Tim's saying something, say it loud.\n It helps it walk.\n It helps it walk, but--\n And escape from predators.\n And escape from predators, how?\n Because--\n What might it do with those powerful legs? What did we notice them doing in their containers? They get under the what? \n They get under the rocks and the dirt.\n Like, Tim, like when he was on the corner Tim was, like, picking him up, and he was holding on to the paper.\n He was holding the paper?\n Tim lift him up.\n Okay.\n Oh yeah, it's neat.\n I can make a connection.\n What's your connection?\n If we didn't have jointed legs we couldn't walk up stairs, if we didn't have jointed legs.\n If we didn't have jointed legs, we couldn't walk upstairs, right? Is that what you said Coner?\n You're okay. You're okay. Alright, I want you talking to each other. Help Halle, she's writing down some of your connections. Help her, team, help her. \n Talk to Halle.\n What's another thing?\n The aphid's have pincers and the bess just have...\n Tim's telling you something.\n It has little like claws.\n Hang on, Tim's telling you something. Listen to Tim.\n The aphids have pincers and the beetle has these things, that helps it eat out the wood.\n They look like little--\n They look like pinchers.\n The beetle has.... a pincher like a crayfish. A pincher like a...\n Oh, this could pull 11.\n Good connecting, keep connecting.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 1377 GEN_MC_1377_Video_Recording_A_edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.13216], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW09", "TW24TW16"]}, "066": {"text": "  We haven't talked about some things that we do when we are what?\n  Sad.\n  Sad.\n  Not sad.

Sometime when we get mad it's okay if we squeeze our hands. That might help makes us feel better. Make us calm down a little bit. Alright, I have some of our pancakes.\n  Yeah!\n  Yay, pancakes!\n  The Pancake Game.\n  Alright.\n  Yeah, pancake games.\n  and on some of my  pancakes are things that are--\n  Coo-coo games \n  --red choices, things that we don't want to do when we're mad, and some of my things are green choices, and if it's a green choice, we're gonna add it to our book. If it's a red choice, we're gonna put it on our plate. Okay? Alright, so, Jakiah you want to go first?\n  Yes.\n  Alright, are you ready? Alright, here you go, ma'am.\n  I want the pink one.\n  Flip it.\n  Oh, that went  way high past my head. What is that boy doing?\n  \n  Not your thing. What is he doing?\n  Bite\n  He's biting. Is he biting himself or his friends?\n  His friend.\n  His friend.\n  His friend. Is that something we want to do when we're mad?\n  Yeah.\n  Should we hurt our friends?\n  No!\n  That is not something we want to do\n  We need to be good.\n  So, Jakiah does that  go on our red choice plate, or is that a green choice that goes in our book?\n  It's the red choice.\n  It is a red choice  plate, you are right. All of our red choices go on our plate. You were right that was a red choice. Put is right on top. Nice thank you, high five. Good job! Scoot back, sit down. Alright, Nicholas are you ready? Flip that thing. I caught it. What are they doing on there?\n \n  They are smelling that  flower, and blowing out the candle. Can you show me how to do that? Smell your flowers. Now put the hand on top. Do it one more time for me. Sometimes we need to stop and take a deep breath to calm ourselves down. Nick, is that a red choice or a green choice?\n  Green choice.\n  It absolutely is a green choice. Here's your sticky stuff. I'm gonna put it right there. Can you stick that picture right on top please? Our sticky tack\n  Sticky tack\n  Put it on top, please.\n  Sticky tack\n  Sticky tack\n  Good job.\n  Sticky tack\n Nice thinking. Okay. High five. Okay. High five. Nice work! Have a seat. Alright, Kendrel Lowel, are you ready?\n  Yeah.\n  What about... this one?\n  Woah.\n  Woah!\n  Somebody push  somebody off the chair!\n  Somebody pushed someone else off that chair.\n  Somebody broke that head off. Right there.\n  It doesn't look like he has a neck, does it? You're right.\n  Woah.\n  That's just weird. Try and see me-- Criss-cross applesauce. Jakiah show me criss-cross, please. Thank you. Alright, Kendrel, is that a green choice or a red choice?\n  Red choice.\n  Absolutely, why is  that a red choice?\n  because that is very bad. Don't know when to snack, or probably our friends at the playground.\n  Why is that a red choice?\n  Because they gonna get left.\n  \n  Because it hurts their... friends\n  Friends!\n It hurts their friends.\n  that pushed somebody off the chair.\n  Yep, Alright, Jakiah, Jakiah. Kendrel where does that one go?\n  On the red.\n  On the red choice plate. You're absolutely right. Alright, miss Jakiah, flip that pancake.\n  Boom!\n  What is he doing?\n  Numbers!\n  Numbers. They are?\n  One, two, three.\n  And what are they  doing, they're...? Counting. Can you help me count to ten?\n  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.\n  If we get really  mad at our friends, can we stop what we're doing, take a deep breath and count to ten to help calm ourselves down?\n  Yes\n  Would that be a green choice or a red choice?\n  Green choice!\n  Absolutely,  it is a green choice. Jakiah, is that a green choice or a red choice?\n  Red choice\n  A red choice.\n  Is it a red choice to count?\n  No.\n  Does that hurt our friends if we stop and count?\n  No.\n ]Teacher] So, that's a green choice. Something we can add to our book.\n  Though it's the red choice.\n  That's a green choice. We can stop and count. Our red choices are--\n  That's a green\n  --things that may hurt ourselves--\n  choice and a green\n-or our friends.\n  choice.  It is a green choice. Can you put it right there on our sticky tack in our book?\n  Sticky tack\n  Put the picture on top please\n \n  I know sticky's cake\n \n  Alright, you ready, Mr. Nick?\n  Yeah.\n  Sticky.\n  Okay let's do one more. Lets see what else--\n  You're sticky.\n --we can do. We could, can we do this one?\n Oh.\n \n  What are they doing?\n  Walking\n  Walking.\n  They're taking a walk. If we get really mad and we just need to get away from our friends for a minute, is it okay if you come ask me to take a walk?\n  Yeah.\n  Yep. We could walk around the hallways. So is that a green choice or a red choice?\n  Green choice.\n  It absolutely is. There's your sticky stuff.\n  Sticky stuff \n  Your sticky tack. Sticky tack.\n  It make stick \n  Put it on quick please. Or on the book please. Good job.\n  Let me see\n  Okay, stick it on there. Nice job. Alright, so let's look at some of the things that we have that we can do. Can you scoot way over here so your friends can see? Alright, you guys, help me read this. If we get mad, it's a good idea to . . .\n  Talk to people.\n  Talk to our friends. We can tell our friends to. . .\n  Give it back \n  to give it back or to. . .\n  Give us back the toys.\n  or to...\n  Stop.\n  Stop. We can talk to who? Jakiah, who else can we talk to?\n  Our teacher.\n Our teacher, and what can we tell our teachers?\n  To give us back our toys.\n  We could say someone  took my toy and they will not give it back, or someone hit me--\n  Give it back! Teachers.\n  Alright, we could stop and do what?\n  That guy.\n  What can we do? Good Kendrel.\n  This one. This guy.\n  What could we do, Nick?\n  Smell that flower and then blow that candle away.\n  We can stop and take a deep breath. Smell that flower, blow out that candle. Deep breath. Smell that flower. We could...\n  Push the hands!\n  Push those hands, how hard can you squeeze them? Jakiah, can you show me? Nick's squeezing, Kendrel's squeezing. Alright we could ask our teachers to what?\n  They get a walk!\n  To take a walk. Sometimes we may just need to to get out of our classroom and that is okay.\n  You're loud.\n  That was loud, You're right.\n  You screamed.\n But you know what, I like how you used your words and told him. You told him that you were screaming and that hurt my ears. Alright, using your words--\n  I did.\n  You did too. Alright what's our last one, we can. . .\n  One, two...\n  Numbers!\n  We can stop and...\n  Count!\n  Count. We count to ten.\n  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.\n  It makes my teachers happy when I am calm and not mad.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 066 ENS ECYA 066 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.116817], "annotations": [["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Nick"], ["Kendrel"], ["Jakiah"], ["Kendrell"], ["Jakiah"], ["Teacher"], ["Jakiah"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["Jakiah"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["Jakiah"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Jakiah"], ["Teacher"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["All"], ["Teacher"], ["Nick"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Jakiah"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Jakiah"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Jakiah"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Jakiah"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Jakiah"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Jakiah"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Jakiah"], ["Teacher"], ["Jakiah"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Jakiah"], ["Teacher"], ["Jakiah"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Jakiah"], ["Teacher"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Jakiah"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Jakiah"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Jakiah"], ["Teacher"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["Jakiah"], ["Teacher"], ["All"], ["Teacher"], ["Jakiah"], ["Teacher"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Jakiah"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["Jakiah"], ["Teacher"], ["Jakiah"], ["Teacher"], ["Jakiah"], ["NaN"], ["Jakiah", "Teacher"], ["Jakiah"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Kendrel"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Nick"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Jakiah"], ["Teacher"], ["All"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["Jakiah"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Jakiah"], ["NaN"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Jakiah"], ["Teacher"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["Jakiah"], ["Teacher"], ["Jakiah"], ["Teacher"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Nick"], ["Teacher"], ["Kendrel"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW06"]}, "068": {"text": " \n  Starter-stopper, opposite side. Okay. Everybody has their marbles. How many trials are we doing?\n  Five.\n  Five trials. If the first one doesn't work, raise your hand. I will come help you and we'll talk about why it doesn't work and what we're gonna do to change it. What you're gonna do to change it. Okay? Timers. Get your people ready. Remember you're gonna say, \"Ready, set,\" as soon as that: \"go.\" All right. Go.\n  Ready. Set. Go.\n  Oh! You're supposed to get it.\n  Right here. This great piling direction. Did y'all's work?\n  Yeah.\n  Good. Good. Did you record the time?\n  Look.\n  Tell him. You guys are ready to keep going. Five trials. Good job. And we'll discuss why yours worked in a minute.\n  We gonna take-\n  Okay hang on. Tell me what happened.\n  When it got here, it stopped.\n  It stopped. Why did--\n  Friction.\n  Okay, the--\n  Probably because the speed wasn't great enough.\n Okay. So you think you needed more speed?\n  No. I think we need to take this off.\n  Okay. Let's try taking that off. Where do you think you can put those to get more speed?\n  Up here.\n  Ok. Now, what is that gonna give the marbles?\n  More momentum?\n  Yes.\n  Let's make it bigger. Three centimeters.\n  Is this our second one? Are we gonna do a second try?\n  You're going back to your first one because you want to make sure it works. So reset it. Okay. Try again. \n  Did it work?\n  Yeah.\n  Let's discuss why did it work this time?\n  Look how we gave them these.\n  By doing what?\n  By um. Making it higher.\n  Elevation? Ooh. And what's another word that--\n  Altitude.\n  Yeah. That's good. Okay. So it worked. How long did it take?\n  Seven seconds.\n  Face the recorder. Got it? Okay. Very good. Keep going. You're ready for your second trial. Okay.\n  We're done.\n  Y'all already done five trials? Okay. Well, let's just stop for a minute. What comes down. Let's pull together here. Let's talk. I want you guys to talk about why you think it worked.\n  Because the big hill helped.\n  The hill? What force is that?\n  The hill was enormous so it gave it more momentum.\n Good job. So gravity pulled it down.\n  What did you say?\n  I said the hill's bigger  than the hoop so it gave it more momentum so it would go.\n  To make it through the loop. Right. And the force pulling it down was what?\n  Gravity.\n  Gravity. Good. Now talk to me about the order that you put it in. Why would you-- you kind of just did.\n  We put the hill here so the hill would go faster to go in the loop.\n  To get more speed behind it. Good.\n  And the turn would--\n  Make it slow down.\n  Yeah.\n  So what do you think would make the marble stop down there at the end?\n  Friction.\n  Friction. Okay. Very good. We got all five trials. You guys need a knee. Start recording your information.\n  It went really fast.\n  \"Really fast.\"\n Just three seconds.\n Did it work on the first trial?\n  No.\n  Okay. Tell me what happened on the first trial.\n It was like that. And it just went off right here.\n  Okay. Why do you think it fell off? What was going on right here to make it fall?\n  Twist?\n  There was a twist in it? So you just had to fix it so that it went straighter. And so you pushed it?\n  Renny put it  like this, like around here.\n  Pushed it in.\n  So it might have been a little to steep too. That incline might have been too steep. What order did you put your elements in?\n  Hill, loop, and turn.\n  Okay. And why'd you put the hill first?\n  Because it's higher. And it would give more speed.\n  What force is giving it more speed right here?\n  Gravity.\n  Very good. Okay. And then talk to me about why you put your loop right after that hill and not your turn. Why didn't you put your turn there?\n  If we turn, there's not enough speed.\n  For the loop.\n  Okay. Y'all both said the exact same thing. Repeat that to me so I understand.\n  If we put the turn first, it won't have enough speed for the loop.\n  Good. Very good. All right. Good job guys. Have you got five trials?\n  It's all three seconds.\n  All of 'em were the same? That's interesting. Very good. We'll talk about that after you each need a knee and record your information. Anthony, what was your job?\n  Record.\n  So you were the one that found that they were the same each time? Make sure you get written down everything. Okay guys. Talk to me.\n  We got three.\n  Did the first one work?\n  No.\n  Tell me what happened on the first one becuase I didn't see it.\n  The first one, we had this open and we had it sitting right there and we had the chair right here and when we set it down, right here, when the chair was right there, it kept on falling off.\n  So it just dropped.\n  So you think the incline was too what?\n  Straight.\n  It was too steep.\n  There you go. That's the word I'm looking for. It was too steep.\n  Because it was right here and it was going all down.\n  Very Good. So what did you do to fix it?\n  We kept on sliding  it down a little.\n  Did you have to slide it down more than once?\n  Yes.\n  Good job guys. So did you get it to where you could do five trials?\n  Yes.\n  And we got three for each.\n  Three seconds? They did too. They got the exact same for all of 'em. How about that? But look at your coasters. They look different.\n  Yeah.\n  That's interesting too. 'Cause their incline is steeper than yours. Lets talk about the order that you have your elements in. What's first?\n  The hill because it gives more speed when it's going down a hill so you don't--\n  But that's on what force?\n  Gravity.\n  Good job. And why'd you put your loop right after that?\n  Because it would have the most speed to keep going and then the turn return it. Because if we did the turn, it wouldn't have enough speed to make the loop.\n  Good job. Good job. Need a knee, record your information, and start figuring your speed. Have you guys got all five trials?\n  Nope.\n  Uh oh. What happened?\n  It stopped because of the friction. When it get right here, it started getting out of friction.\n  Friction right here? What's causing friction right here? Can I watch it?\n  Its gonna work this time because we taped it down.\n  Why do you think it's gonna work?\n  Because we taped it down.\n  You know what? I want you to use that one. How long did that take?\n  Seven.\n  Seven seconds? All right. Do it again. Let's look at it again. So it was stopping right here.\n  It always was stopping right there and then I taped it down.\n  Oh you taped this down.\n  That thing could be higher.\n  Okay. I think you should try that.\n  We can use this clock. No we need some more.\n  I was gonna get one of them books.\n  Guys, you can use any state. So what are you doing to the hills?\n  Making it bigger.\n  So the speed will go more faster.\n  More faster? So that it'll increase the speed? All right. Let's see what happens. Let's see if this one works.\n  Angel, what are you doing?\n  Timing. Ready? One-- Oh.\n  We use good team work.\n  You are using good teamwork. I'm proud of it.\n  Ready? Set. Go.\n  It didn't start  from the beginning.\n  I did not start that one.\n  Let me ask you this. Just to give you a different idea because you've already tried to change in the elevation of your hill.\n  Maybe how big the loop is.\n  How do you think that'll help?\n So the-- will go faster and will make it go through.\n  All right. We're gonna try this. Help her out guys. So we're making the loop smaller and that's gonna -- So now you might want to move this up a little bit there. You see how this is gonna have to go -- There you go.\n  What about your taping? If it's -- will the --\n  Yeah. Let's try again. Wait. We were gonna time that, honey. Now you're ready to go. So what was the solution to your problem?\n  To make the loop smaller so it would go through much faster.\n  All right. Good job. Now you're ready to time five trials.\n  Ready? Go.\n  Look, how beautiful. Good job, guys.\n  How many seconds?\n  Four.\n  Four seconds. That's good. How many trials?\n  Three. We got two more.\n  I want to know. You got three seconds on each one. So your speed was the same. Where did your distance come from?\n  We did how many feet and then we found out how many inches.\n  And times it by 18 because it's 18 on there.\n  How long was each tube?\n  Six feet.\n  Six feet. How many inches is that? Let's work it out. Make sure you've got it right on here.\n  72.\n  So, you've got 72 inches.\n  We only did one tube.\n  And how many tubes are there?\n  There's three tubes.\n  So 72. What would you do next?\n  Times three.\n  Yes. 72 times three. How did you guys get 216? You did 18 inches instead of six? I mean 12. Okay. So now you'll have to go back and redo your speed. Figure in your speed. So how do you find speed?\n  I still got 216.\n  Well then you were right. That's right. So you guys are ready to go on to make a graph. Let's talk about the graph you're gonna make. Let's talk about the graph Thinking about what you've learned in math and what you've been doing with graphs in math using this data table right here. What is this right here?\n  Time.\n  I want you guys to think about what we talked about with graphs. I want you to decide what kind of graph you should make.\n  Line graph because it's over time.\n  Yeah. Line graph. I decided. Yeah we decided to put a line graph because it's time.\n  So any time you use time, the line graph is the one to use. Very, very good.\n  Do we write the numbers on here?\n  Yeah. How are you gonna know what numbers to put on there? Think about it. You've got the trials, the distance, the time, and the speed. Do you need to use these? You're probably just gonna use your trial and your speed. So you'll label your line graph. One will be the trial and one will be the speed. And do you remember when you did the race car activity? Not the race car activity. I'm sorry. Remember the Stanley the Sluggish Snail? What did that line graph look like?\n  It was a straight line.\n  Because it was a constant speed. So what do you think this is gonna look like?\n  Constant speed. A straight line.\n  Good.\n  Okay.\n  You've got your trial. You got your times. Let's talk about your speed. First we need to look at your distance. How did you figure distance?\n  We need to divide by those speeds.\n  But your distance is how far the marble traveled; right?\n  18.\n  Yeah.\n  18?\n  Yeah because you said each was six feet.\n  Six feet. You're doing it in inches.\n  Oh.\n  So let's go back and refigure that. I want you guys to talk about how to do that. 'Cause we want it in inches. So what is the first thing you would do? Y'all talk through it. Y'all talk to each other. Let's talk about it. After you're done erasing.\n  I was thinking like how many inches each--\n  Okay. There you go. Talk about it. Anybody know how many inches are in a foot?\n  16?\n  Nope. Try again. If you have a ruler.\n  12.\n  Yep. Good.\n  So that's 12 x 3.\n  Good.\n  36.\n  Okay. So 36 inches and then how many of these are there?\n  Three.\n  Uh-huh.\n  36 multiplied --\n  six speed. So you need to do 6 x 12.\n  6 x 12 is --\n  72.\n  Make sure you got it right.\n  I did it before. It is 72.\n  So now you will do 72 times...\n  Three.\n  Good. Do it on your paper\n  It's 216 inches.\n  Okay. Now what are you gonna do?\n  Write it down.\n  And then what?\n  Multiply 216 to this.\n  So how will you figure speed now?\n  Divide.\n  Divide what?\n  Three to 216.\n  Very good.\n  Can you tell me that again, Jeffrey? You're gonna do what?\n  Divide 216 into three.\n  And you'll only have to do it how many times?\n  One.\n  Because you got the same speed each time. You can do three into 216.\n  72.\n  And no remainder. That's nice. Isn't it? Now, knowing what we know about graphs, what we're doing in math. Jeffrey, are you listening? Y'all stop writing for a minute and listen. Knowing what we know about graphs, what we talked about in math, and using this data and speed, what kind of graph do you think you're gonna make?\n  Line.\n  Why did you say a line graph?\n  Because it's the same.\n  I want you to think about this right here. Over time. We discussed we need to use a line graph, okay? When you make your line graph, which two columns -- there's only two columns that you can use on there. Which two do you think you're gonna use?\n  This one and --\n  Well you've already figured that out. This one and which other one? And speed, good. Right. Because you were figuring all this for speed. What do you think your line's gonna look like?\n  Straight.\n  Straight. Because it was the same every time. Good.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 068 GEN MC 068 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.046333], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Kids"], ["Teacher"], ["Kids"], ["Boy"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Angel"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Kids"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Kids"], ["Teacher"], ["Angel"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Kids"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Girl"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Teaher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Kids"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Kids"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Kids"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Anthony"], ["Teacher"], ["Boy"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Kids"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Kids"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Kids"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Videographer"], ["Angel"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Angel"], ["NaN"], ["Angel"], ["Teacher"], ["Angel"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Videographer"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Angel"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Angel"], ["NaN"], ["Girl"], ["Teacher"], ["Girl"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Kids"], ["Teacher"], ["Girl"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Girl"], ["Teacher"], ["Girl"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Girl"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Girl"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Girl"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Kids"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Kids"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Videographer"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW04", "TW05", "TW09", "TW13", "TW16", "TW17", "TW24"]}, "460": {"text": " Alright Anne Carol, what's your job?

Yeah, you can warm your hands up. Because, what's gonna happen if our hands are warmer?\n It makes more warm.\n Yeah, it's gonna make it easier isn't it? Alright you keep making that ice cream, I'm gonna go check on the other group, okay. Help each other.

It could turn into a liquid. Do you think that an ice cube -- Hold on, Amy's got a good question. What did you say?\n Maybe sometimes it could turn into a gas state.\n How would you turn it into a gas?\n Boil it.\n You boil it. Very good.\n It could melt too and turn into a --\n It could turn into one as it melts.\n My house is a solid. Your house is a solid, Anne Carol. Good job.\n It's so cold.\n Shake it, shake it. Give it a good shake.  Alright, I'll be right back, guys.\n Try not to squeeze it, then it might pop.\n Ms. Moore?\n Yes ma'am?\n Will you do it, please?\n You want me to help you? Okay. Let's re-check it and see?\n Have to open a lot of bags.\n What is it still?\n Liquid.\n So we're get it right in the middle. You wanna feel it?\n Whoa.\n It's still a liquid. Is it getting colder?\n Yes. It did mix together, didn't it? We're gettin there. It does look like that now, doesn't it? That's okay. Alright, ready guys? We're gonna get it more in there.\n There's like 50 pieces of ice in there.\n There is a lot of them. Alright, here goes your turn, Kevin. Getting colder. Getting colder.\n Hey look --\n What you need, sweetie?\n Aw, thank you, darling. Keeping your hands warm there, Thomas? Ready to go? Do you think it's easier to go to the store or make it?\n To the store.\n Make it.\n Is it more fun to make it?\n Yeah. Yes ma'am? \n That's okay. You can make up your own flavor. Alright, if it's not your turn, what I want you to do, is you're gonna start to filling out these questions, okay? Yep, you can start filling those out. Alright, you start filling those out. You can help each other with these. So what did you make?\n Ice cream.\n One thing was solid, what was that, Kayla?\n Sugar.\n Ice! Ice and sugar.\n Oh, we did use ice.

So guys, I just wanna say one thing. I wanna say that these words I'm using are cause and effect words. And we have some examples of clothing here that you're gonna need, and I want you to focus for a second with this. Say it with me: since.\n  Since.\n Because.\n  Because.\n So.\n  So.\n Boys and girls, these are words you use when speaking, when you're talking about cause and effect when speaking. Because it's snowing, I need my heavy jacket. That's cause and effect. These are words we use with speaking. These words, let's say them just one time for a little pronunciation practice. Thus.\n  Thus.\n Therefore.\n  Therefore.\n Consequence. Three syllables: Con-se-quence.\n  Consequence.\n All right, good, good. And the fact is.\n  And the fact is.\n These are pretty much words we're gonna use in writing only. We don't really speak these words, not often, very rare. These we used in speaking: since, because, and so. And these are the words you're gonna be using today. You're gonna be using them to write some simple sentences that show cause and effect relationships. These are more when you're writing an essay, an essay, like maybe for the ELA, or when you're writing an academic essay. Okay, so we have one more. You guys are doing so great. And I have a lot of stuff here. I have a one, two, three--\n  Scarf.\n Say it with me: scarf.\n  Scarf.\n What about that \"F\" on the end? Scarf.\n  Scarf.\n Scarf.\n  Scarf.\n Okay, I like this scarf. It's a nice scarf. I have a, what is this?\n  Sweater.\n Sweater or sweatshirt?\n  Sweatshirt.\n No, sweater. Sweater.\n  Sweater.\n Okay, I think when it's, what is this outside?\n  Sunny.\n Say it with me: sunny.\n  Sunny.\n It is sunny, so... I think, you know what's interesting is, this is the important word: so.\n  So.\n So I'll need...\n  Sunglasses.\n Boys and girls, when it gets really, really sunny outside, sometimes the sun hurts my eyes, so I put on my sunglasses. Okay, so... I want you to try it now. I want you to try it.  Boys and girls, now you all have in front of you two worksheets. You have one worksheet in front of you, you have two different ones. Many of you have this worksheet, and many of you have this worksheet, okay? I just gonna do one quick sentence here. Because it is hot, I'll need my--\n  Sunglasses. Shirt.\n Someone raise their hand. Tina. Tina, say that loud.\n  Sunglasses.\n Sunglasses.\n  Sunglasses.\n And, shorts. Oh, I didn't tell you about my shorts. I brought those today too. Say it with me: shorts.\n  Shorts.\n Say it with me: shorts.\n  Shorts.\n Okay, so it's sunny and I'm gonna need my shorts and sunglasses. I got 'em. I'll need my sunglasses and shorts. And \"because\" here, this is what you call a transition word. This is what we're working on. Now, if I have this here, Juan Pablo you have this worksheet. We have cause and effect. If I have this here, we have, let's say, since it is raining, I'll need my raincoat. And that's a coat for rain. It's on your list there. So, what is this word here? Say it with me: since.\n  Since.\n \"Since\" is a transition word. In speaking, and then sometimes writing like this style of writing, you would use these words. All the time in speaking, you show cause and effect. Since I don't have any money, I can't buy anything to eat tonight. Because it's raining, I think I'll go to the movies. Cause and effect, boys and girls. Use it each and every time you think about, speak about cause and effect. Now I want you to try this with your partner, and then we're gonna practice speaking these out. On three, I want you to go. Three, two, one, go.  Use the examples, use the sentences. And here's some more additional examples for you.  Do you see it up top? Clothing. Right here. Clothing. How would you make \"clothes\" out of that? Can you see it? Give it a try. Can you read this to me?  What do you need when it's hot?  Okay, so you see the list right here? Which items are for hot? Which items are for cold? Can you try to write that for me? I'm gonna come back. \n Look at the charts, they are there to help you.  You see the chart that I made? So, let's try something. I want to try something. Can you read me, actually read Hon Lu your first sentence. And you read her your first sentence. You first. Partner A, partner B. Partner A, go. You first, you're partner A.\n Because it is raining, I need my umbrella and raincoat.\n Because it's hot, I need my shorts.\n Okay, now you're speaking to each other, not to me. Okay, keep going. Go.\n Since it is sunny, I need my sunglasses. \n Can you write that there? Look right here. That list, for you. Okay, you see on the...   \n Look at the word. Slide through it. Two syllables.  Is that one boot? One boot? Or two? So how, is there... Yes, yes. Boots. Great. This is great stuff. I'm proud of you. So proud of you. Read this. You look like you haven't got started here. So listen to him, he did a really nice job here. And let's work together, okay? Can you read me your first sentence?\n  Because it's hot, so I need my sunglasses.\n Good, now pause. Now listen, I want you to try one. \n So I need my .\n I'm sorry, did you say the--\n  Umbrella.\n If it's hot, I need an umbrella?\n No.\n If it's, which one? Which one? If I, if it...

How many people? One, two, just three of you. Okay. Cameron, do you want to start us off with your reason why?\n Because the, 'cause you can put water in a water bottle to put in the freezer, then that water bottle will like, explode, because it has so much ice in it.\n Okay. So because the water, when it freezes, expands, then therefore, you're saying it has more mass?\n Yeah.\n When it's frozen.\n Yes.\n But when it melts, it doesn't take up so much space, so it has less mass.\n Yes.\n Okay. Michael. Do you or are you on the same idea as far as more, as far as thinking there's less? Was your reason the same as his or do you have a different reason why it's going to be less?\n Mine was the same.\n  Same idea?\n Yeah.\n  Okay. Hannah, you got a thought or something?\n Well, isn't it like, the same? Isn't it, like, the same thing because it's the same thing. It's just expanding, but it's going to have the same mass.\n  When you're saying it's the same thing, what do you mean by the same thing?\n Like, if you have water in a water bottle, like it does expand or whatever, but it still has the same amount of water so it still has the same mass.\n  Okay, so Hannah's saying it doesn't matter that it expands. It's still the same amount of stuff, and therefore it should still have the same amount of mass. Is that correct? 'Kay. Houston, idea on that?\n Well, about the water bottle thing, it would be opposite to this 'cause when you start with water, it takes up the entire bottle. But the bag, the ice is the one taking up the minimum space of when it freezes an entire bag. So it wouldn't.\n So are you saying if we let the ice cubes melt, are you saying the mass is going to go up? It's going to increase?\n Yeah.\n Okay. Colby?\n I'd say that when a solid turns into a liquid, its form changes, but not its mass.\n  Okay, so kind of the same idea as Hannah. Only you're talking about the actual forms then. It can change form without changing mass. Hannah says it's okay to expand because it's still the same amount of stuff.  Okay. Michael's got another thing thing to talk about.\n Well when you put, like, the water in the bottle, and then you, like, freeze it, then you unfreeze it, then there's less water than what you started with, and it probably would change the mass.\n  Why is it, so you're saying the amount of water you put in first before you freeze it is more than the amount of water after you thaw it back out?\n Yeah.\n  Do you have a reason why that might be?\n Well, no. it's just .\n  Okay, any other ideas on this one? Okay, how many people thought the mass would increase, then? How many people said the mass would increase? A couple of you. Jared, why don't you tell us why you think the mass would increase.\n I thought the mass would increase because water weighs more than ice. Like if you pick up a bottle of water that's frozen, it doesn't weigh as much as a bottle of water with water in it.\n Okay. So Jared says that water weighs more than ice. Correct? Anybody else have a different idea? Anna?\n  Well, because ice floats on water so that means it has less mass, so if it thawed back out, then it'd weigh more.\n Okay. So Anna's using the example that she's seen ice floating on water, therefore she's saying the ice must have less mass than water. Correct? Is that what your'e saying?\n  Mm-hmm.\n Colby, you got something to say about that?\n I have something to say about that. It will stay the same going off of what she's saying.\n Oh, going off of what she's saying. Okay, go ahead, then.\n Ice is pretty much the same as, it's water, it's frozen water, so it still has the same density as water, it's just colder. So, if it's colder, it floats. Ice because it's cold, it floats in the water.\n  So you're saying the floating of ice has nothing to do with its density or its mass, it has to do with its temperature. 'Kay. Houston?\n Well, I think the only reason ice floats is because an ice would weigh less because ice isn't completely full. There's some air in there.\n Okay. So Houston's saying there's some air trapped in there that was not in the water beforehand. Okay. Anybody else? Anybody want to have any other arguments about why the mass should stay the-- Oh, sorry. Anna.\n  Oh, okay. I disagree with Colby how he said that it floats because it's cold when heat rises, and so if it's cold, wouldn't it sink if it had to do with the temperature?\n Okay, so Anna's saying that heat rises and cold sinks, so you don't think it has to do with temperature?\n  Yeah.\n Okay. Colby, response to that or are you...?\n Well, in water, it works differently. Warm water actually sinks more to the bottom actually, and cold water's more on the top.\n  Alright.\n So if you put cold in ice, it will float above.\n  Okay. Oh, I have some hands up now. Michael?\n Well, when you're in the lake for example, the warm part's on top, and the deeper you go the colder it gets because heat rises.\n  So you're using your experience in swimming or something in a lake.\n Yeah.\n  It's colder the deeper you go, warmer towards the surface, you're saying?\n Yeah, so the ice cube must have oxygen in it because when we hold our breath, we float up.\n  Okay.\n When we have no air, we go down.\n  Okay, so you're saying an ice cube has air trapped in it, that's what's causing it to float. Is that what you're saying? And Hannah, were you gonna agree with her as far as the lake water temperature thing?\n Yeah, so when you put your sweater or something in the water, it's like the top is usually more warm  colder.\n  Okay. Alright. Now people who think the mass is going to stay the same. Who are those people? Who thinks the mass will stay the same? Gavin, why don't you give us the reason why you think it's going to stay the same?\n I think it's going to stay the same because nothing's lost when it melts. Nothing goes away. It's still the same thing.\n  He's saying it's going to stay the same because nothing is lost. When it melts, it doesn't get lost. Okay. Anybody else who says it's going to stay the same have something to add? Gabe?\n I said that...\n  Just talk louder.\n I said that it'll stay the same because there's still the same amount of water melted or frozen, and even if it's in a bag, if it melts, and tries to... break down into gas, then it's still in the bag so it won't go anywhere.\n  So Gabe's saying that it doesn't matter if it's frozen as an ice cube, if it's melted as water, or even, he's even going as far as saying that even if the water, liquid starts turning into a gas, it's still going to be the same because nothing's leaving the bag. Is that what you're saying? He's going even a step further, he didn't even mention anything about turning into a gas, but he's saying even if it does that, it's still not going to change. Right? Houston.\n Well, I disagree with that because if you take a frozen lake the ice is only on top, it doesn't freeze all the water.\n Okay. Hannah.\n I agree with what he said. Even if there's air bubbles in the ice, then after it melts, the air bubbles, it's still in the bag. It's still concealed in the bag. \n  So sounds like the people who are for it, staying it's the same are really sticking with the fact that everything's in the bag. Nothing's out of the bag or leaving or coming in, and then the people who are thinking it's going to increase or decrease have a lot of ideas about ice having more mass than water as a solid, and then some of that's through the temperature. Michael, one more before we move on.\n About how it all stays in the bag, well, when you melt water it sweats. So wouldn't it lose some of that. \n  So are you saying some of the moisture's going to be on the outside of the bag?\n Like, comes off the bag. If you have it on the table, then it comes onto the table.\n Like how it has a \n  Okay, so here's my question to you then. That water that's on the outside of the bag that you're talking about? You were saying that water came from the inside of the bag?\n Well, it sweats from the... the compression of the temperature.\n  So you're saying that's what's causing the mass to go up, then.\n Wouldn't that cause the mass to go down?\n  Okay, so that's my question to you, then, is where was that water on the outside coming from?\n Inside?\n  How is it getting to the outside?\n I don't know. Some scientific theory. \n   Okay. Does anybody agree with her idea that some of the water from the inside might be getting to the outside?\n  Yeah.\n  Do any of you guys have an idea of how that might be happening to help her out? James, how do you think that water might be getting to the outside?\n  The moist is like, when it... What's it called? Wait a minute. The carbonate, the condensation, it, like, seeps out, like the air, it seeps out.\n So somehow you're thinking it's seeping through the bag. Colby?\n I know how that happens, actually. Because the water in the air will stick to the bag because it's colder. So it'll stick there and just condense there so it'll look like it's . It's just water from the air.\n So you're saying the water that forms on the outside is not coming from the inside? It's coming from the outside, which is different than what they're saying. Cameron, did you have any other ideas  how it might be getting out there? 'Kay. Alright. So we got some different ideas on that one. Let's move on now to our alka-seltzer problem.  This time, last one we started with people who thought the mass would decrease. Let's start with the people who think the mass will increase. So people who think the mass is going to increase with the alka-seltzer. Who are those people? Alright. We're going to have Kyle start us off on this one. What's your reason why, Kyle?\n Well, when the tablet dissolves I think after dissolving,  water will rise and make more.\n  Make more water?\n Yeah.\n Okay. So Kyle thinks the reaction is going to create more water, and therefore, more mass.\n Sam, different idea than that for why the mass is going to increase? \n Okay, so you're thinking it's going to increase because you're adding something to the water. Colby?\n I think it's going to increase because the alka-seltzer tablet will release gases which will increase the weight of the bottle inside.\n  Okay so the gases that is going to be created from the reaction are going to add to the mass. Jake, you had your hand up for the mass increasing, correct? Do you have a different reason why it's going to do that? \n So basically saying, the same thing as Colby. More gases. Hannah.\n Aren't the gases from the water in the alka-seltzer, aren't they going to just stay the same?\n  Good question. So what you're saying, then, is if the gases are coming from the alka selzter tablet in water, so what are you saying the mass will do?\n I think it's going to stay the same. Actually, it'll decrease.\n  It'll decrease? Okay, why do you think it's going to decrease?\n I don't know.\n Okay.  Who could come up with the reason as to why it might decrease? Cameron? Why is it going to decrease?\n Because the acid from the, from the, from the tablet, the acid from the tablet is going to release gases, and the water will go out of the beaker.\n How is the water going to get out of the beaker?\n Because the tablet will react with water, and the gases will float away.\n But isn't there a lid on top?\n Maybe the lid will pop off or something.\n Let's assume the lid is does not pop off. Let's assume I have it on there tight enough that it's not going to pop off.\n Then, since air is lighter than water, then that means that the air, that means the mass will decrease because the water will be like not as much, and there will be more gas in the container.\n So. Correct me if I'm wrong. So you're saying that assuming the top stays on, it's still going to decrease. That's the decrease, right? Because the solid and liquid are going to turn into...\n Gas.\n Gas, and gas is lighter than solids and liquids. Is that correct? What you're saying?\n  Yeah.\n Alright. Jared has something to say about that.\n I think that the mass will decrease because the tablet will disintegrate and that mass part will be  decrease.\n Okay, so he's saying that the tablet disappears, then the mass will go down. That piece that the tablet's bringing to the table for mass is not going to be there anymore. Kevin, what are you thinking?\n Pretty much the same thing that the tablet's going to dissolve into the water.\n  And so mass will go down?\n  Yeah.\n Okay.\n  Who thinks the mass is going to stay the same? It's not going to change. Who thinks it will stay the same? Why don't you tell us why it's going to stay the same?\n I think it's going to stay the same because the water, the alka-seltzer piece is a water, it's just in a different form. But everything is still .\n Okay. So you're saying because nothing's going away, it's still going to be the same. It's just in a different form. So kind of like what some people were saying about ice in the water. Gabe, do you have a different reason than that?\n No, it was a lot like hers.\n  It was the same as hers, pretty much?\n Yeah.\n Okay. Anybody got anything else they want to input on the alka-seltzer one? Why it might go up, down or stay the same before we move on?\n Gavin?\n I said it would probably go down because if you have a bunch of gas in a bottle, it'll probably weigh a lot less than a cup full of water, like the same amount.\n  Okay, so you're going again with the idea that gas has less mass than the water and the tablet. And since we're turning them into gases, the mass will go down. James.\n I said since the tablet is gonna be kind of shrinked, once it mixes with the water, it'll stand, making it a lot more liquidy and bigger and then the mass will get higher.\n The mass will increase because it'll produce the...  Alright. Let's go to burning paper. Alright.  Burning paper. Let's start with the people, this time, let's start with the people who think the mass will stay the same. People who think the mass still stay the same.\n Colby's the only one. Morgan. Gabe. Not very many. Jasmine. Morgan, why don't you start us off for why you think it's going to stay the same.\n I said the mass will stay the same because the air and everything else is still in the jar and it's not going anywhere.\n Okay she says it stays the same because everything is still in the jar not going anywhere. Jasmine, you had your hand up. Do you think the same thing as her or do you have a different reason for why it would stay the same?\n I agree with her.\n  You agree with what she said?\n Colby?\n Burning stuff does not add. It's still the object, but it's more spread apart.\n  Okay, so the mass stays the same, you said. It's just we're going to take up more space with it. Okay. Michael? No? Yes?\n I was stretching.\n  Hannah?\n I disagree with that because it, when it burns,  I don't know if that's the word for it, but how it's  causing it all, when you burn wood in a fire, eventually all that will turn into ashes, so I don't think it has the same mass or anything.\n  Okay. James, you got some more on that?\n When that paper burns, it'll turn into charcoal which basically is lighter than paper, and then that'll make it so mass will be decreased.\n Okay, so given the idea that we're taking the solid things, and we're changing them into maybe non-solids, so either liquids or liquid acids they're not gonna have as much mass as those. Edward, what do you think? Do you think this mass will go up, down or stay the same?\n I think it will decrease.\n  Decrease?\n Yeah.\n  And what's your reason for that?\n 'Cause when the paper burns, it turns into a gas, so some of it, and then gas is, has less mass than solid objects.\n  Okay, so again, back to that gas is less mass than solid objects. Kayla, what do you think? Increase? Decrease? Or stay the same?\n I thought it would decrease, like what Hannah--\n, It'll disintegrate \n  Okay. So, as a quick vote, how many people thought, on this one, oh, sorry, Kevin, go ahead.\n Also, I think it's gonna decrease, because, the paper's gonna burn and incinerate, but also, the match, when you light the match, it's gonna burn, too.\n Okay. Some of you, maybe, forgot about the match. I haven't heard you mention it, until just now, so that, not only is the paper gonna burn up, but so will, at least part of, the match. Okay, 'cause it's burning too, alright? A quick vote. How many people, on this one, said the mass would go down, would decrease? And how many said it would increase? And, how many said it'd stay the same? So, the majority of you are on the decrease side, on this. Okay, here's my next question. We've now heard what a bunch of people had to say, about each different situation. One, if it would increase, or decrease, or stay the same. My question to you now is that, after listening to all the people throw ideas out there, has anybody changed their mind on any of these? In other words, like, maybe for the ice in the water one, I was thinking it was going to increase, but, after listening to every one, now, I think it's gonna decrease.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 262A SCI EA 262 Aedited.srt.txt", "Copy of 262B SCI EA 262 Bedited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.241537], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Anna"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Students"], ["Voiceover"], ["James"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Cameron"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Kevin"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW08", "TW16", "TW22", "TW23", "TW24", "TW24TW08"]}, "280": {"text": " It's probably three. Because five to the third is 125.\n  Alright, so let's test that out.\n Can I use my calculator?\n  You can have your guy test it out here.\n Oh.\n The other thing to work on is the pronunciation of this. This is something that is unusual because it's got that subscript. Read that first line up at the top where it says \"pronouncing logarithmic equations\".\n Log base b of x equals y.\n Yeah, so can you transfer that pronunciation to, for example, the one in example six? How would you say that out loud?\n Log base two of eight equals...\n  It's three.\n  Equals three. So, that's how we say these things out loud. Log base two of eight. The little number, this subscript, is the base. Keep going, you guys are doing fantastic.\n  Speak up.\n The log of 10,000 is four. Forgot, I don't have a pencil.\n  You're off. No pencil.\n In number nine, is it one?\n For number nine?\n  Yeah.\n When the log, when the base is equal to X.\n  When B is equal to X it will be one.\n  So would 10 be negative one?\n Uh, 10, yeah negative one.\n  Oh, I think I get it now.\n And then 11 would be...\n  Negative three.\n Negative three yeah. It's like the power stable thing, you know?\n : Yeah.\n It's like four to the y would be equal to this?\n : Yeah.\n : So, 12 and 13 would be zero?\n Let's see.\n Yeah.\n Yep.\n  : Okay.\n Pretty easy.\n Yeah and...\n  : What's 14?\n 14 is one-half.\n  : So again what you're saying is...\n If it's a fraction or if like, like for 14,\n  : Yeah. It'd be a fraction. So 14 came out a fraction or a decimal of half.\n : Yeah.\n So that, what about that one made you think it's going to come out a fraction versus the other ones that were all integers?\n The other ones were integers because in the log, the little exponent there\n Mmhm.\n is less than the actual number.\n Okay, let's work on the pronunciation because this is something that's brand new as far as how to say this thing out loud. Let's go back up to the top, where it says \"read this out loud\". So, Matt, I'll have you... Are you the, what is your role here?\n We're professors here.\n Oh, so that's a good role for you. So, why don't you speak that out loud.\n Log base root of x equals y.\n Yeah, now I want you to say the first example out loud.\n Log base of, log base five of 25 equals 2.\n Yeah, so it's hard to pronounce it.\n Yeah.\n But the little number, that's down is what?\n Uh, base.\n Yeah, so it's the base. So when we say it, we're gonna say base little number, whatever it is. Alright, so now say what you were saying before, either of you guys. You told me why it comes out a fraction. How will you recognize it comes out a negative number?\n When the y, or when the x is a fraction, and the log base is a whole number.\n Okay, yeah, so like, which examples do that?\n Ten and eleven.\n Alright, that's good. How, will you recognize if it comes out as zero? See any patterns for the ones that log?\n If the x is a 1.\n  : Alright, yeah. Why does that make sense? Have you figured it out?\n : Like, any number to the power of 1 is itself, or no, it's zero. Or I mean, not any number to the power of zero is one.\n  : Exactly. Alright, you're very, you're getting right to the idea of what a log is. How will you recognize the ones that will come out one, without calculating?\n X equals the base.\n  : Okay, well said. Why does that make sense in terms of exponents?\n 'Cause if you divide itself, it'll equal one.\n  : Can you give me an example of an exponential equation that might look like this one? Because that's the next thing we're going to try to do...\n Seven to the fifth power.\n Seven to the one equals seven. Good, having done all of this, can you say what a log is in one word?\n A single word.\n It's like the power of...\n  : Mmhm, it's the exponent.\n Yeah.\n  : Good, a log is an exponent. Now, what I'd like you to do is try to do the bottom ones based on what your understanding of log is, yeah.\n : Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh...\n It would be.\n Don't stop.\n So it's gotta be two. Take the, so the first one would be 32 because basically the base is the actual number and the answer to the logarithm is the actual number.\n : So right to the there...\n Yeah, so 32.\n Something with...\n  : Something to the fourth...\n Yeah.\n Maybe five, five to the fourth.\n : Five, to the...\n Execuse you.\n So 59 is...\n : One, 52 equals one.\n So it'd be 59.\n Yeah.\n 18 would be...\n  : Just three.\n : Is it a thousand?\n Yeah, a thousand. You put ten thousand.\n : I have a question.\n Yeah.\n For this one, what's the, for this one, what's the log? No, well, yeah, I don't know.\n  : The log of what?\n  : I think I understand your question, but you first have to figure out the way to read these things. Read that part, that first, because the pronunciation is challenging at first.\n Log base b of x equals y.\n  : Alright, so now read example... Well, we know example four is three. So, the log is three. So read example four out loud.\n So log three of 27 equals three?\n  : Good, except I want you to say the word base in there.\n Okay log base three of 27 equals three.\n  : Perfect, so I think your question was about examples seven and eight?\n So, what's the base?\n : Wouldn't the base be one, it's just not there?\n  : It's not there. Here's the question, the answers, the logs came out two for number seven and four for number eight. Go back to what you guys were saying about an exponential equation. What's equivalent to that?\n  : Oh, if it's not there, the base is ten.\n  : Alright, so can you write the equivalent exponential equation for example seven?\n Ten squared equals 100.\n  : Ten squared equals 100. Does it still work for that? Is that void?\n Mmhm. Because it would be ten to the fourth equals...\n : But I thought he just said the base was one.\n Well, he said the base was one. He thought it might be.\n Oh, it's not.\n  : It turns out it's ten.\n Okay.\n  : So the base, if not written, is ten. I want you to check this two ways. Who's our calculator person here? Alright, so Brandon I want you just to type in the log, but just use this button. It's next to the seven. Just type in log of 100. So if he doesn't use any base, it comes out as two. Now, try it with the log base, on the new operating system log base ten of 100.\n Log base ten of 100?\n  : Mmhm. See if that still works.\n Two.\n  : It turns out, it's sort of optional. If there's no base what is the base?\n Nothing.\n No, it's a certain thing. So, if there's no base written, like all of the other ones had a base written...\n : Okay.\n  : If there's no base written it's saying what's the number to raise a certain base to, to get 100? And this one came out two. So, what's the number, that you can use as a base, squared to get 100?\n Ten.\n  : Yeah, so if there's no base, the base applied is ten. And it turns out, you can write it or not. So, what I'd like you guys to do is as you're working through these, also consider what would be an equivalent exponential equation for each of the ones that you're taught.\n So just do all of the ones at the bottom and then go back and do it again.\n  Yeah, sure. And the one's at the bottom, you can't just type into the calculator. So you got to kind of think a little bit about what would be the relationship there.\n : Then for like, any number in there?\n That's a really good insight. How come that's the case?\n Because anything to the zero power is one.\n  : You got it. Yeah. Except for one number. There's one number you can't put there.\n Zero.\n  : Yeah, good job. You got it, good job.\n Thank you.\n 20 would be 81...\n I wasn't even close.\n So, ten, alright so ten to the third would be 1000?\n  : For 18, wouldn't it be a thousand, supposed to be base, is implied to be ten. Ten to the third would be 1000.\n I'm not sure.\n  : For 18.\n  : I don't know. \n  : Alright.\n  : Alright, say it again, except this time include the word base.\n Log base of, log base of eight. Wait, log base of eight equals zero?\n  : Close. Log base eight...\n Log base eight of one equals zero.\n  That's it exactly, yeah.\n Okay.\n  : So we say base, where's the base always on a log equation?\n : Under the exponent.\n  : Yeah its a subscript, it's down.\n A subscript...\n  : So I'd like you to pronounce number 12.\n Log three of one equals zero.\n  : Close. I want you to get the word base in there.\n Log base three of one equals zero.\n  : Yeah, and that way, if you're always saying what the base is, when you create an equivalent exponential function, it's going to be a lot easier. So next to each one of these, let's do a few together. Let's do the top row, going one, six, 11. I want you to write an exponential equation using 5, 25, and 2.\n : So it would just be, five squared equals 25.\n  : Exactly. What's the base in that equation?\n : It's five.\n Yeah. So, you did two cubed equals eight. Yeah. Yeah, so now you recognize, you guys correctly identified that a log can be summarized as an exponent. Yeah, that's good. Each of these numbers is an exponent. What'd you notice about the ones that came up zero? Would you be able to recognize those and predict...\n  : Any number works for it. Really.\n What do you mean any number works for it?\n For this one...\n Oh, I see for that last one.\n You could put any number here other than zero.\n  : Yes.\n : I thought it was one, but they had got it.\n  : One works, but so does two.\n  : So does, two, three, four and five.\n  : I'm wondering about the ones like 12 and 13. How would you predict or recognize in the future, that the log is going to be zero?\n If it has a one for the...\n  : X\n For the X, yeah.\n  : Mmhm, yep. I think there's a fancy mathy word, called a characteristic for that. But we don't use that word very often. But yeah, you could say the x 'cause that's how it showed up in our first equation. Sure. How will you recognize that it's going to come out a negative number?\n : If it has a fraction in it.\n  : Mmhm.\n As the X.\n  : Okay, well said, yeah. Why does that make sense in terms of what you know about exponents?\n On the green chart, whatever is on the left side and whatever's left...\n  : Yeah. Our powers table. You're talking about all of our fractions here. Yeah. How about the ones that came out with one as the log. The log was one.\n : They have the same base and the same x value.\n And what about this one? This is a fraction, so...\n  : Yeah, how come it had a negative log?\n Well, I know it's because it's a fraction.\n  : Can you write an equivalent exponential equation?\n Two to the, no, two to the negative one\n  : Mmhm.\n equals, it doesn't equal this right?\n  : Actually it does. Two to the negative one, equals half.\n Okay.\n  : Yep.\n Okay, so that's correct.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 280 MATH AYA 280edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.227613], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voicever"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Intructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW09m", "TW13", "TW15", "TW24TW02"]}, "164": {"text": "  From the top.\n  This way?\n  Starting from the top.

What did you discover about bubble wrap, sand paper, wax paper and just the plain ramp?\n  On the bubble wrap, it didn't go. Because it was a bumpy surface. Because all the bumps, because it was too bumpy and had to much friction.\n  Too much friction, okay. And so, what did you discover, Sean?\n  I discovered that on the sand paper it got higher and lower\n  What do you mean by that, higher and lower, and higher? Can you explain that a different way to me?\n  well-- \n  So what does that say about the surface?\n  \n  Increase and decrease.

How are you gonna find the average?\n  Like 32 plus, plus 30, plus 41, divided by three.\n  Okay, you guys go ahead and do that. Who's going to be the calculator?\n  I am.\n  You are? Okay. I might suggest someone else also be the calculator, so you can compare your numbers, and then I'm gonna come back and talk to you about your results. Okay?\n  Okay, let's sit down. Let's see what your doing.\n  It's not going very good on the sand paper.\n  Because it's just like the carpet.\n  Why won't it go as far on sandpaper?\n  Because it's like the carpet.\n  Okay, what does that tell you about friction?\n  That if it's sand paper it doesn't have a lot of contact--\n  It rubs against the rug.\n  It rubs against the tires-- I think it doesn't--\n  One person at a time. Paul?\n  Because it rubs up against the tires and it doesn't have a lot of friction. If it did have a lot of friction it would go faster.\n  Okay, so does sand paper have friction, or not? Yes or no?\n  No. No.\n   Yes.\n  What is friction? One person at a time.\n  It's like...whoosh.\n  That's friction? Hm. Okay, can you explain, what is your idea, Stephen? Friction?\n  When a car rolls on carpet, it's friction because it slows it down. Sand paper slows it down, too.\n  So far, what have you discovered about friction, and wax paper versus sand paper?\n  Wax paper--\n  Let's let Stephen tell me, okay?\n  Wax paper is, kinda like, it's probably gonna be like the...\n  Look at your numbers and what have you discovered so far? Because you already recorded them.\n  It's the highest so far.\n  What does that mean, it's the highest so far?\n  It's the one that has the least amount of friction.\n  It has the least amount of friction, okay? And how do you know that?\n  Because we did the experiment.\n  And what happened?\n  It didn't go as far...\n  It didn't go as far on what?\n  \n  Okay, go ahead an finish your experiment. Go ahead and finish on the plain ramp, you have one more to do, I see here. Okay? And then we'll talk about what we should do next.\n  Oh, 39.\n  That's showing you more about fourth dimension. \n  Let's talk about our results. Talk about your results that you've noticed. Sh. Stephen, Tanner, I need to be able to hear this group, okay?\n  We found now, that our total averaged out to 85cm.\n  \n ...for our total average.\n  Okay, what does this tell you? Look at your averages. What does this tell you about friction?\n  That friction slows you down, like the salt slows you down on ice. Like the plain ramp is kinda like the ice. It makes you go faster.\n  Right, and you know what it's doing outside, right now? What is it doing outside right now?\n  It's sleeting.\n  It's sleeting, it's snowing, and the roads are very, very slick. So, what do you think's gonna be a great idea, because I know my husband's coming home from work tonight. The roads are gonna be slippery. What's gonna happen so they can create friction so the roads are safer? What should the road crews do?\n  Salt.\n  They can put salt and ...?\n  Salt and sand.\n  Salt and sand. Yes.\n \n  Why?\n  \n  So it didn't go at all? I wonder if it was small, little bubble wrap, if it would work better? What do you think?\n  I think if they were popped--\n  Oh, if they were popped, I wonder if they would. Maybe so. Okay, down here you have a graph that we're gonna talk about a little bit later. But this is what I want you to do: I want you to pretend like you're a teacher, and if you were going to tell someone one thing that you learned today from this experiment that we did. What would you tell them? I want you to write it on the back of here. What's one thing that you've learned today that you would teach someone and then we're gonna talk about it, okay? I want you to talk about it when you're done writing, talk about it with each other and I'll be back in a minute, okay?\n  We can share when we're done writing.\n  Or we can share them as we write them. So, what would we tell someone?\n \n  I would say friction on the ramp would make something go slower. What would you say?\n  I would say the rougher the surface, the more friction.\n  I would say something about the same thing that you guys were saying, except a little bit different. I would say... it depends on which kind of surface it is. If it's bumpy, it won't go. If there's bumps and air all over on it. If it's a smooth and soft surface, it will probably go a lot faster.\n  So, tell me what you-- are you still writing?\n  We all shared it.\n  Okay, but I want to see it in writing. Like I want to see something written down.\n  I said the bumpier the surface the more friction it makes.\n  Okay--  Spencer, what are you gonna write?\n  Because I'm gonna write kind of the same thing as Heather.\n  Is there anything your gonna change about it? Or add to it?\n  I'm gonna say the bumpier the ramp is the more friction and the less... and the less further it goes.\n  Okay, I like that. I think you guys are learning a lot about this. Sean, I see your writing something a little bit different. What are you writing?\n  I'm writing the smoother the surface, the farther the car goes.\n  You guys are right. The farther it goes. Because why?\n  Because the friction, because the surface is too bumpy and it has a lot of friction so it was causing it to not go. But on a smoother surface-- \n  Barely any what? What word is she looking for? She said on a smoother surface there's barely any friction. And I like what you said. You said \"A smooth surface is like ice.\" A smooth surface is like ice, right?\n  I said the bumpier the surface, the more friction.\n  Right, but you also said, something, that if it was a smooth surface, it's kinda like ice. There's no friction to keep it from, like if it's outside today, if it's ice, your car could go anywhere, but putting sand down or the salt, keeps it ...\n  Less friction.\n  More, it has more friction. Okay. Okay, go ahead and finish. What? What do you want?\n  I wonder what would happen if you tried snow and see if it would run on snow and then we tried ice.\n  Oh, so how would be do that? I like that. How would we do it?\n  When it's like an icy day or something and there's a little bit of ice somewhere, we could bring the car out or something, not like a real car--\n  Oh, okay. \n  Just like a play car--\n  And try it out.\n  Try it out on ice and then they would put a little snow and then we would try and see if it would go faster on the snow or on the ice.\n  How could we change this experiment? What could we do next time if we wanted to change it to find something different out?\n  I think you could use a plain surface and you could probably use popped bubble wrap.\n  We talked about that.  Popped bubble wrap, and what else did you say? The bubble wrap could be what? Talk about that, the bubble wrap could be what? Guys, I need you to not come in here.\n  You can use  un-popped bubble wrap and you can use the tile, and you probably use, like a grid with the marbles. Instead you can, like, use a car.\n  Okay, talk about that.\n  To see if it would fall off.\n  Now, what would be the purpose to see if it would fall off? With force and motion, how does that tie in?\n  Well, what I mean is, will it like go far...\n  If you make a ramp and you try to get it on and wanted to see if it would fall off or not...\n  Like if it was on the--\n  It depends how fast it would go, if it went faster would it fall off?\n  But if we're talking about friction, does this have anything to do with friction?\n \n  Oh, I love that. So, wood, carpet, and ice. And we could freeze ice, because we have big containers...\n", "filename": ["Copy of 164 GEN MC 164 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.237715], "annotations": [["Stephen"], ["Paul"], ["Stephen"], ["Paul"], ["Paul"], ["Girl"], ["Stephen"], ["Teacher"], ["Paul"], ["Teacher"], ["Paul"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Paul"], ["Stephen"], ["Paul"], ["Stephen"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Sean"], ["Teacher"], ["Sean"], ["Teacher"], ["Sean"], ["Teacher"], ["Spencer"], ["Teacher"], ["Spencer"], ["Teacher"], ["Spencer"], ["Teacher"], ["Sean"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Paul"], ["Teacher"], ["Paul"], ["Teacher"], ["Paul"], ["Girl"], ["Stephen"], ["Teacher"], ["Paul"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Paul"], ["Teacher"], ["Stephen"], ["Teacher"], ["Paul"], ["Teacher"], ["Stephen"], ["Teacher"], ["Girl"], ["Teacher"], ["Stephen"], ["Teacher"], ["Stephen"], ["Teacher"], ["Stephen"], ["Teacher"], ["Stephen"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Sean"], ["Sean"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Spencer"], ["Teacher"], ["Spencer"], ["Teacher"], ["Sean"], ["Teacher"], ["Spencer"], ["Sean"], ["NaN"], ["Spencer"], ["NaN"], ["Sean"], ["Teacher"], ["Sean"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Spencer"], ["Teacher"], ["Spencer"], ["Teacher"], ["Sean"], ["Teacher"], ["Sean"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Sean"], ["Teacher"], ["Sean"], ["Teacher"], ["Sean"], ["Teacher"], ["Sean"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Sean"], ["NaN"], ["Sean"], ["Teacher"], ["Spencer"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW09s", "TW24"]}, "165": {"text": "  Look, I can be a serk . \u266b Now, my whole house, is great \u266b I can do anything good \u266b I like my school, I like anything \u266b I like my dad, I like my cousins \u266b I like my aunts, I like my Allisons \u266b I like my mom, I like my sister \u266b I like my dad \u266b I like my hair, I like my hair cuts \u266b I like my pajamas, I like my stuff \u266b I like my room \u266b I like my whole house! \u266b My whole house is great \u266b I can do anything good \u266b Yeah, yeah, yeah \u266b I can do anything good \u266b Better then anyone \u266b \n  Okay.

Okay, so what we're going to do after this this is a good start, I think, for the work that we're gonna be having to do this afternoon. We're gonna have to work on our ladder. And I know that we've spent some time on it, we've had to make some considerable changes. But I think that the compromise.. the agreement that we all talked about yesterday, I think it can be implemented today. So what we're gonna try to do, is based on... These are the signatures, that we have allocated. One signature for elementary school. One signature for middle school. And five signatures for the high school. I think let's try to fit it in. Let's try to stay within the seven signatures. Don't forget, we have ads also. Okay, so I think Tanisha, and... Dustin, and... Jazz, will be on team one. And Sammy, Emily, and Colleen, will be on team two. Let's work together. What are the rules of getting the teamwork going? When we're trying to discuss, What are the things that I want you to think about?\n  Everyone has a voice.\n  Okay, everyone has a voice. What else?\n  We all have to agree to a middle ground.\n  Okay.\n  And it's not just for the high school seniors.\n  Okay, so it's for the entire school. The elementary school, middle school and high school. So let's be fair, and try to get everybody involved. What else? Discussion-wise, among yourselves. What would I like you to be working on? Collaborative work? Compromise? \n  Okay, let's go ahead and start. You have the books there, you have copies of the previous ladder. Let's get it good. \n Yeah?\n  I understand, elementary school, middle school, high school. In what order--\n  It's up to you honey. If you want to start with the middle school, elementary school, high school.\n  I don't know, maybe just 'cause I'm a senior, I kinda like that plan.\n  It just seems weird  starting at the elementary school. I think it's just that, they're not as important, just that--\n  'Cause it's always started at high school. It starts with the seniors and it's like this is what, for--\n  Okay now, remember, just because it's always done before--\n  I know but--\n  If we started with the elementary school, We'd be starting with the fourth grade. And that's really our--\n  Kind of an  awkward place to start.\n  Okay, now remember with your signature, you were gonna start with Student Life, correct? With the High School? So you could start with that. I mean look at it and you can see. \n  And then we're  gonna start it with, like the introduction... Um, like, um...\n  Pictures.\n  Student life, candid shots.\n  Right.\n  And then we're going to the seniors and all the senior stuff, and our classes. And then the sports and night clubs?\n  Yes.\n  We're not gonna have a class... class division page, anymore. 'Cause all of the classes are scrambled. Are we still thinking, like, doing division pages? Like how it was worded originally? Except, not for the classes. Because all the classes were split up.\n  Yeah, now it makes it easier to do your \"me\", right? Don't forget, what's our theme?\n  \"Me\".\n  Okay, so keep that it mind when you're creating your signatures. And I think, now that solicited more... allocated, the sections are allocated. Your division pages-- maybe more adaptable.\n  They'll fit in there more.\n  Yeah. They'll fit in there more. Don't ya think?\n  I guess. \n  So should we  just do one, like just high school division page, then middle school--\n  Yes, try it and see. See. Now you might still need a division page for sports, you might still need a division page. But you don't need as many. I think--\n  We definitely won't have one for the classes. 'Cause they're all split up.\n  They're already split up. And I think this is what helped save us pages. Remember, you're getting eight signatures.\n  Um, Question.\n  Yeah.\n  The yearbook,  two pages and ads is under the high school?\n  Only because, I just put that as just to remind you that we need to have ads at the very end.\n  Okay.\n  So whatever, is your last section, you have to have ads. We have to start selling ads. And again, if you have any questions on the photographs, Sammy is here she can help you with what ever photograph you want. \n  \n  Show the blood drive scales. And then... \n  But their only  sport is the seventh grade basketball. Everything else is going into high school.\n  Does it make sense?\n  Yeah, yeah.\n  They all happened right there, together.\n  Are we still gonna do straight lines, and single lines like they did?\n  I think we might just do a big column.\n  Yeah.\n  We can still do that, and then after our seniors, we can explore all the classes in line.\n  And it makes sense? If you have that quote.\n  Yeah.\n  We are gonna do... \"Student Life\", seniors, all the senior stuff, And then classes?\n  Make sure that you have your page counts.\n  Are doing school division pages or are we doing section division pages?\n  I guess we could  do school, and then-- We would have to have the division pages that we thought of-- the spread division page with all the things. It could just be different little division pages.\n  Yeah, okay, so...\n  Or like, have  the title at the top of the page. \n  Don't forget, she has control of the photographs. So you need to consult with her, okay? You can ask her.\n  Okay, um.\n \n  So are we going  to do a senior opening page?\n  I think we could just  have... an opening page, on the division page.\n  I thought we were going  to do the top. \n  Instead of doing a collage, how they put in their, like, the song and all that on the second page. Around all the photos, we should put-- 'Cause, in our theme or whatever, it's just a strip. Of pictures. Blended in the big picture. So we're have written around it, to add in these. So I think that we should put these, on the first, opening page.\n  Now remember, we did this only because... we had no choice.\n  I like, well I like,  the happenings that we decided not to do, for the opening page for the seniors. Because, it's new life. Since our theme, it's just one strip. We could arrange it like this. I think that we should put, on that page, we should put these.\n  Oh, definitely. Yeah, good idea. Well, what happened, is the reason why I placed it and you placed it here because when you sort it all originally, it was so empty, and it didn't mean anything, so, we went ahead and did that.\n  I think it would have been better to do that from the beginning.\n  And then we can have  Alex start doing the onward for two others.\n  Do we... want to put favorites before the formal?\n  I think we should put favorites.\n  So, we're talking this one, right? These are the formals you want before the favorites.\n  No, we want our  favorites before our formals.\n  Oh, Okay.\n  And then we're combining formal and baby pictures in quotes right?\n  Yeah. Well, you know, what do you think?\n  Well I like, combining it.\n  Can you pull up the other ladder? Do you still have that one?  If we have that picture, and then another picture, and then another--\n  This one? Is this the ladder you want to see? Which section do you want to pull?\n  \"Student life\".  I think it's on that.\n  Right here?\n  Yeah.\n  Let me know. Because then I can go back and let her know.\n  So, you want to start off with that?\n  So it'll be like... The formal, then the baby, and then the quote.\n  Can you tell Emily what she missed yesterday? About the quotes. No, were you present? When you said that a lot of seniors who didn't have quotes last year.\n  They would rather have a big list of them and just have them pick and cross it off. If they can come up with their own.\n  And I have a quote book. Somewhere, and we can start deciding. We can go from very funny, to very serious. So the kids can have a good choice. \n  Did you want me to go back to the other one? \n  How are you deciding the order? Is it, just from serious to funny or...\n  Well it's more, funner stuff, the memories into the more serious stuff.\n  And you're ending it with the grauduation?\n  Yeah.\n  You rather repeat our homecoming?\n  But that's spirit week.\n  There's another one--\n  That's what  homecoming fills. This is the problem. On the other ladder that we had, the only high school \"Student Life\" we had was \"Holten Hemming\" and \"Spirit Week\".\n  That's the same thing.\n  Yeah, Hemming  and Spirit Week. Like, one spread and then the awards honors. Well that doesn't make up for all the signatures.\n  Oh, then we had prom.\n  You had the prom, and then you had... how about the senior, the um... \"Sports Banquet\". Sports Banquet should award everybody. Not just seniors.\n  Yeah, it's got uh--\n  Do you want to put that under student--\n  I don't...\n  What if we-- You cut the prom down to one page, but maybe we could, put it back to two pages, we could show, like the planning of prom and setting it up.\n  Okay, but--\n  'Cause I'm  on the prom committee.\n  Okay, so, and you have your committee meeting, start taking pictures. Guys, remember, we have seven cameras. So take cameras with you when you're having little meetings. Just make sure you're flexible enough, just in case we don't have enough pictures, you can flip back to one page instead of the signature. I mean, instead of a spread.\n  Well,  I don't know how we're gonna fill up the signature then.\n  Well you don't have to have-- we can move everything up.\n  And then  we move seniors up into another half of the signature, and that half would have to be colored. Because it's the senior signature.\n  Um... Do you have a section for committee?\n  We had those  in with the clubs. With like, all of their-- what they do in the community.\n  Okay, if you want, you can bring it up a little more. Just the overall community that doesn't have a club. And use up that space. Like the blood drive. The blood drive is not part of the school.\n  Rotary does that.\n  Rotary, yes, but that's the... interact is with Rotary, yes?\n  Yeah, we help with that. We help Rotary.\n  But you also do the \"Victorian Classic\"?\n  Yes.\n  You don't have enough space. You need to put the blood drive up. I mean, how much space breaks--\n  A spread.\n  Oh, Interact has a spread?\n  Yeah, we've  covered this three times now.\n  Okay, sorry. Yes, but we've changed it three times. So... Find other community things. Well, if you want, do you want to talk about the tax bill?\n  Well, that's not  really student life.\n  It's going to affect your life.\n  Yeah, but...\n", "filename": ["Copy of 165 CTE EAYA 165 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.0883983], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Boy"], ["Girl"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW04", "TW05", "TW09", "TW11", "TW20"]}, "166": {"text": "  Approved guided reading area.

I want you to find the letter that makes the sound that you hear at the beginning of the word \"worm.\" Worm.\n  W. W.\n  What letter?\n  W!\n  Good job. We have been talking about spring and we have been talking about the seasons of summer and winter and springtime. What season are we in right now?\n  Winter.\n  Winter. Very good. Well this book, \"Hedgehog is Hungry,\" that's written by Beverley Randell, is about a hedgehog. And he is asleep during the wintertime. And he wakes up in the springtime and he is hungry. But first, look at this picture. Have y'all ever seen anything like this before?\n  No.\n  I saw a hedgehog in a book, but not real.\n  You've seen a hedgehogs before in a book but not real?\n  Not me.\n  Hedgehogs are pokey. And when they curl up, their little spikes poke out. They pop up. That's right. Why do you think they pop up?\n  Cuz that means you're scared.\n  That means they're scared.\n  Nature protects.  If a person runs into the pointy stuff, they'll say, \"Ouch.\"\n  That's right. And it protects them. Well, as we are reading this book today we're going to read this book to find out what Hedgehog is going to eat. What Hedgehog is hungry for, and what he is going to eat. I want you to look at your partner, and I want you to tell your partner what you think hedgehog might eat? \n  I am thinking he, is going to eat a worm.\n  I think he is going to eat a snail.\n  Okay. Alright. Well, I heard I heard worm, and I heard snail. And she said snail too. Why do you both think the hedgehog is going to eat a snail?\n  Because there's one right in front of it.\n  I think it's going to eat a worm.\n  You think it's going to eat a worm?\n  I think he's going to eat a leaf.\n  You think he might eat leaves. Okay. Alright. So, we're going to read this book to find out what Hedgehog is going to eat. Alright, why are we reading this book?\n  To find out what Hedgehog is going to eat.\n  But guess what? There's going to be some words in this book that we might not know how to read. One of the words we are going to work on today is new high-frequency word. And remember, high-frequency words there aren't any rules for them, are they? We just have to learn the way they look, so that we can learn to read them. Can you read, tell me what this word is? \n  Here.\n  This is the word \"here.\" I love how you decoded it.\n  We already learned about it.\n  We have learned about here. Here is on our...\n  Word wall.\n  Word wall, isn't it? Excellent job! Well, today it is important that you not only know how to read words, but it's important that you also know how to spell words. So, I'm going to give you the letters that you need. I want you to dump them out, and I want you to spell \"here\" for me. I'm going to turn this around so you can't look at it. And I want you to spell \"here\" for me. I hear Lilly saying it's . Here.\n  I spelled it.\n  Alright, I'm going to turn it back around. Are you all ready? Alright, check it!\n  H-E-R-E\n  I did it!\n  Are you all right?  What word did you just build?\n  Here.\n  Here. Alright, now we can build it, so I want you to... write it. I want you to write the word \"here\". Not look at your letters. Okay. Are you ready? Show me how you write the word \"here\". And then I'll let you check it again. You're almost there. What else do you think comes next?\n  I think you push harder.\n  You want to try pushing harder? You think you got it, Natalia?\n  I put an exclamation mark. Here!\n  You put an exclamation mark at the end.\n  I spelled it.\n  You did? Alright, I'm going to turn it around. You all ready to check it? \n  Did you get it? Alright, read your word.\n  Here.\n  Here. Very good.\n  H-A-R-E, here.\n  Here.\n  It's not, A.\n  Alright, now, one way that we can help ourself is by looking at high-frequency words, and learning all of our high-frequency words. Our high-frequency words are on our word wall. So, that's one place that you can look if you get stuck. Another thing that we can do is we can look at the pictures to help us with the tricky part. So, we're going to go through, and that's what we're going to do right now. We are going to look at the pictures. Are you ready? \"Hedgehog is hungry\". That's our title. Now, what time of year do you think it is?\n  Winter.\n  Winter. It is definitely winter.\n  Because all of the leaves are off the tree.\n  Because all of the leaves are off the tree. Alright let's look at the pictures. Now, who do you see buried down in the leaves there?\n  I see Hedgehog.\n  You see Hedgehog. Is Hedgehog awake or is he asleep?\n  Asleep.\n  And you know why he's asleep?\n  Because it's winter and he hibernated.\n  And he's hibernating. Very good, turn to the next page. Now what season is it? What season is it?\n  It's spring.\n  It's spring! And is Hedgehog still asleep?\n  No.\n  No. Hedgehog is awake. Let's turn to the next page. And there he goes. Here he comes. He's going out for a little walk. What do you think he's doing?\n  Find something to eat.\n  He's going to find something to eat. Let's turn to the next page. Hedgehog is hungry. And what is the first thing he finds? He finds a...\n  Snail.\n  I was right!\n  Uh, you were right.\n  And me.\n  Okay, let's turn to the next page. He's still hungry.\n  He ate worms and caterpillar.\n  Okay, now that is a very big word, caterpillar. How did you all know that that was the word \"caterpillar?\"\n  I saw it right there.\n  Alright, listen closely. You all just told me two strategies you can use to help yourself when you come to a tricky word. You can get your mouth ready for the beginning sound. Or, you can look at the... pictures. Tell me again. You can get your mouth ready for the beginning sound. Or you can look at the...\n  pictures.\n  Okay, let's turn to the next page. Now, what does he find? What is that? Okay, we talked about one of the strategies is we can get our mouth ready for the beginning sound.\n \n  Alright, let's run our finger underneath it now. Let's look at it. Let me write it. Let's do, \"Bug\". Let's spell bug and see. How would we spell bug? Get your arms ready.\n  \n  Is that going to be the word bug?\n  No.\n  No. So we're going to have to look at that. This is the word \"beetle.\" Can you say that word?\n  Beetle.\n  And look underneath it. What do you see underneath it? That is a slug. Ooooh. Now, just like-- eyes are up here, Lilly. Eyes are up here. Okay there we go. Just like we can get our mouth ready for the beginning sound, you all also know how to decode words, Is everybody's eyes up here? So, we can get our mouth ready for the beginning blend, which is, sl... What sound is the U going to make?\n  Uh.\n  Because there's only one vowel. And what sound's the G going to make?\n  Guh.\n  Let's blend it together.  Are you ready?\n  Sl-u-g. Slug.\n  Now, look at me. You have three ways now. You can look at the pictures. You can get your mouth ready for the beginning sound. And you can decode words that have one vowel in them. Alright, let's close our book up. All the way up. When you are reading, I want you to read to find out what Hedgehog eats. What is your purpose for reading?\n  To find out what hedgehog eats.\n  Alright, start reading. Hedgehog is hungry. \n  What did we say he was? Use the pictures to help you with the tricky part. We said he was a... asleep.\n  Asleep.\n  Good job.\n  It wasn't doing that space in there.\n  That's right because  \"asleep\" is one word.  There's our high-frequency word: \"here.\" \n  I'm tricked.\n  You're tricked. Alright, so what will you do?\n  H-un-gry\n  Hungry.\n  Very good. Hedgehog is hungry. \n  Good job. \n  Slug.\n  Good job. \n  It does spell the word \"spring.\" Good job. Alright. I love the way you all did two things: I love the way you can all use your fingers to help you point. I saw Lilly stretching lots of words out. When she came to a word that she didn't know, she got her mouth ready and she stretched those out just like we did with the word \"slug\". I saw Poniyota using the pictures help her with the tricky part. We are reading to find out what hedgehog ate. Do you remember what hedgehog ate?\n  Snails.\n  He ate snails. What was something else he ate?\n  A snail.\n  A snail. What was  something else he ate?\n  A bug.\n  A bug. What was something else he ate?\n  He ate a beetle bug.\n  A beetle bug. Alright, let's read it and make it sound like talking.\n  Hedgehog is hungry. Hedgehog is hungry. Winter is here. Hedgehog is asleep. Spring is here. Hedgehog wakes up. Here comes hedgehog.\n  Let's all get together. Here we go:\n  Hedgehog is hungry. Here is a snail. Hedgehog is hungry. Here is a worm. Here is a caterpillar. Here is a beetle. Here is a slug. Hedgehog is hungry in the spring.\n  Very good job. I am very proud of you all.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 166 LRLA EMC 166 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.0037322], "annotations": [["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Everyone"], ["Teacher"], ["Everyone"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Everyone"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Everyone"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Everyone"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Everyone"], ["Teacher"], ["Everyone"], ["Teacher"], ["Everyone"], ["Teacher"], ["Everyone"], ["Teacher"], ["Everyone"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Everyone"], ["Teacher"], ["Everyone"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW03", "TW04", "TW05", "TW09", "TW13", "TW15", "TW19", "TW24", "TW24TW09"]}, "167": {"text": "  I see lots of different levels of tennis. I see some balancing levels. Blake, why do you choose to balance this? Who wants to share? \n  Keeping that ball controlled. Back to back. Catching placement, find a partner, and standing with equipment on the ground. I've got two groups ready, equipment's on the ground. You're looking for somebody you may have not worked with already. You should have found a partner. If not, you guys will start. Thank you for placing the equipment down on the ground. Lost and found? Lost and found always come to the start, very good. When I say go, you're going to turn to your partner, I want you to talk to them about what is a lifetime activity? What I have on the board over here, and I also have it on my screen. Lifetime activity, what does it mean to have a lifetime activity? What does the word lifetime mean? Go. \n  Bryan: soccer, baseball... Maybe not.\n  Soccer?\n  Maybe one of those, yeah maybe it could be, yeah soccer.\n  Volleyball?\n  Yeah, volleyball \n  And five, four, three, two, and one. My partner and I, Zachary, had some really good examples of what lifetime means, so I'm gonna use his. Zachary said that lifetime means you do it now, as a third grader, but we could do it later in life as an adult. Raise your hand if that's what you and your partner kinda said? It's something you should be able to do later in life? Very good. And then we gave each other an idea of what some activities could be that we could do now and later in life. Zachary said two cool ones, \"tennis.\" Anybody else say tennis? Awesome, pat yourself on the back. And he also said \"bowling,\" and the reason those two are really good examples for having now as a third grader, and later in life is that they're pretty good on your body. You can still do 'em, they're not gonna injure your body too much. It's gonna make you strong and healthy. We have an organ in our body that really needs to be worked out. We've talked about aerobic capacity. And tennis will make your heart beat faster. You have to find something that's gonna make the heart beat faster. So now turn to your partner, talk about what you're gonna choose to make your heart beat faster. Go. \n  And five, four, three, two, one. Pat yourself on your back for your lifetime activity, that you're gonna choose, nice job. When I say go, you are your partner are now gonna travel back to any open area and stand back in face-off position. So this is where my partner and I came, and we put our equipment down. Then we'll turn and look at the board. Ready? Go. Looking for an open spot with a partner. Thank you for carrying your equipment quickly and quietly. Now, we're transitioning now to talk about working with a partner and doing some tennis challenges. So far, we've worked by ourselves to be responsible learners Brian, are you looking for your partner? He's right here. So now we can work with a partner and be responsible learners. On the screen is one of the challenges we did with the balloons yesterday. Zachary and Ms. Rock will show you an example of what you could practice. We're gonna actually skip this level today, but you could choose it, if you said \"Hey you know what, let's go back to this other level.\" So Zachary and Ms. Rock both have our rackets, we're gonna practice underhand striking keep up. Raise your hand if you remember that? Awesome. Alright, here it is. I tick, step, tock, and he's gonna strike back or he can catch it, and then I'm gonna keep striking. We're gonna keep our paddles low, go ahead. Alright, I'm gonna wait 'til it gets low so I can strike, he's gonna also wait 'til it gets low to strike. Keeping that paddle low. We're trying to keep it up as long as we can. Awesome. So that was the first level. Striking, keep up with the balloon. Now we're gonna move to bean bag challenges with a partner. Super duper cool. It looks like this. Only one person will need a bean bag. Since I'm closest to the wall, I'm the person to have the bean bag first. I'm going to be the underhand thrower. Zachary, go ahead and pick up your racket. Create a flat surface. I'm going to underhand throw, he's going to catch it on his racket. Take a step, tock. Good try. You might have to reach out and get under it. Now he's gonna leave it on his racket, and he's gonna underhand throw it back from his racket to my hands. Go ahead. Take a step, tock. I catch, alright? He needs to have three tries with the racket, then it's my turn to have three tries with the racket. Thumbs up if you understand. Down if you got a question. Alright. Person closest to the wall, you will pick up your partners ball and switch out one bean bag. Bring it back, and place it in your racket. Go. Quickly, quickly, and five, four, three, two, one. You should have one bean bag back on your tennis racket. Raise your hand if you have a question. So, partner with the beanbag go ahead and pick it up. You're the tosser first, with your hands. You only need the beanbag. You only have the beanbag. Grab your place on your side. Thank you, Christopher, for being safe. We're gonna move through these challenges fairly quickly. We're gonna see how far we get. We're gonna be responsible, if the beanbag is not working so well, you can go back to a--?\n  Balloon.\n  Balloon. Alright, let's practice. Go. One catching on their racket, one catching on their hand. I hear good communication with a partner. You have to help each other. \n  One person is underhand throwing, one person is catching. Awesome, if you haven't switched jobs, go ahead and switch jobs at this time. If you haven't switched jobs. \n  See how many good catches you can get. Give yourself a point for each catch. Hands or racket. Are you using the opposite foot to step back with? Both partners pick up rackets. Both partners pick up rackets. Look at the board now, you're gonna see the toss from racket to racket challenge. Count how many you can get. Go.  There you go, Zach. Excellent\n  One.\n  And freeze.   Alright, from here, I'm going to now make you and your partner be responsible learners. We have learned to use a bean bag with a partner. We're gonna now learn how to use both a foam ball, and a large tennis trainer. Both of these offer different challenges. The first one is a foam ball. As you can see on the screen, they now have a foam ball. Zachary picks up his racket. We are doing an underhand strike back and forth. But like we did with the tennis ball, we can also catch it on our tennis racket at any time we need to. So, Zachary do you think if I tossed this to you, you could try catching it? Alright, let's see. Nice! He had to figure out how to keep that balance on here. He's gonna do the same thing back to me. This is just working on looking for that ball, getting our feet to it, and keeping a flat surface. We can do the catching with the ball, now we're ready for the tap offs. Remember what we did with the balloon? We're gonna try to keep the foam ball up. This is what it looks like. Tap, tap, good try. It went away a little bit, stop it, we come back. I tick, step, tock. Good. We're keeping a flat surface coming back, slanted out. The lower the racket, the better control we will have. I want the racket to stay at a slant to partner. Can you say that?\n  Slant to partner.\n  So that's the foam ball challenge. Some of you may just stay with the foam ball. But, if you're like: \"I wanna challenge myself and my partner,\" I say \"Zachary, we can now use the tennis trainer\". And, it's going to bounce,strike, bounce,strike. The bouncing is gonna bounce here, before I hit it, then it will bounce in the middle, then my partner will strike. Okay? Ready Zachary? So, it's a bounce strike, bounce strike. Excellent. And I would come back and start it over again if I need to. Bounce strike, bounce strike, bounce strike, bounce strike. Catch when needed. Were we controlled? Yeah! When it got out of control, we caught it. So from here on out, you now have balloon to challenge yourself and a partner with, bean bag, What came next?\n  Foam Ball\n  And then?\n  Tennis trainer.\n  Excellent. See how far you get with the partner you're working with. This uses communication and cooperation. Say that.\n  Communication and cooperation.\n  Excellent. This is how it would look: Zachary, what piece of equipment would you like for us to use? Or you think you're ready?\n  The...\n  The foam ball? Or the balloon? What did you say?\n  The end one.\n  The end. He said he wanted to use the tennis trainer. \"W\" for Wilson, it's the brand. I said, \"Oh you know what Zachary, \"I don't feel like I'm ready for this one. \"Can we go back to a foam ball first?\" And he said \"yes\". I'm all \"phew, thank you\". We just had communication and cooperation. I know that I can practice with this one for a little longer I'll probably be ready for the challenge. Alright, ready, go. \n  Are you able to keep your paddles low? Keeping that balloon or that piece of equipment nice and controlled. Are you using an underhand strike?  Alright, ready Zachary? Bounce strike, bounce strike-- let it bounce one time. Bounce strike, bounce strike, good. Bounce strike, bounce strike, bounce strike, bounce strike. Now I'm going to give you a challenge, so I can go around the room and see if anyone needs help. You'll just work on tap ups, you can use any equipment that you need, okay? Tap ups, or tap downs. If you and your partner need a little help, you can always raise your hand, and I can come over. Try to review those cues with you. Underhand strike.  Okay bounce strike, bounce strike, bounce strike. Okay, say that, bounce strike. Okay, and if it's not working, then you and your partner need to say... \"We need to go back to the--\" Be responsible, try it again though. Bounce strike, bounce strike Ooh this is where, Aiyah, did she step with her opposite foot? Did you step when you strike? No, so it's key to step when you strike. You gotta step. Try it again. Keeping those paddles low. If you and your partner have to move off of your self space a lot, that's a reflection, you should say \"Ooh, we A, need help or B, let's go to a different level.\" Responsible word I hear. Which piece of equipment are you going to have the most success with? And freeze. \n  Equipment should be  back on our rackets. Now, I see students at all different levels. So that shares with me that we have some very responsible learners in the class, which is excellent. But now, we're gonna see if you can switch it up a bit, and give yourself a challenge. You should be able to work with anybody. So what I'm gonna have you do is, let's see here, Ellie, Ellie is gonna step over here, come jogging down, all the way down to where Zachary is. Yay Ellie! Ellie is gonna slide down one, and that's gonna make everyone in this row slide down to a new partner. Where you going? Very good, Zachary. And then you go one down, yep, there you go. Now, wave to your new partner. Excellent. Same thing here, Harrison, come on down. \n And slide on down. Wave to your new partner. Now you all of a sudden have to have more communication, because you don't know where this partner is at. Ready? Go. Talk, which one are you gonna do? \n", "filename": ["Copy of 167 PE EMC 167 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.147931], "annotations": [["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Zach"], ["Teacher", "Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Zachary"], ["Teacher"], ["Zachary"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW03", "TW04", "TW05", "TW06", "TW11", "TW13", "TW17", "TW18", "TW24TW17"]}, "160": {"text": "  Gina.\n I wanted to test the amount of acid in different brands of antacids, example Alka-Seltzer, Maalox and Tums, can effectively neutralize.\n Okay, so far we've been listening to this, are we talking mostly the same equipment, same supplies?\n Yeah.\n Right? Maybe some beakers, maybe some pipettes and some base? Right? Okay, is this similar to, Juan's? This one is, right? So maybe we can start grouping these two together. Christina.\n The goal of my investigation is to determine which laundry detergent is most effective, Tide, Clorox, or OxyClean by determining which is most basic.\n Any concerns? Yeah? Adrian?\n How do you know that the most effective detergents are gonna be the most basic? Maybe there's some other factors that go into that and they're, it's just, basic-ness.\n Juan?\n That some of them have really strong bases and maybe the vapors, I mean, Some of them have safety warnings that say like, don't get too close to the vapors that come out.\n Okay, so there could be some toxic chemicals that are associated with these which is why we shouldn't use them? Is that what you mean?\n Yeah.\n Okay, okay, we use them in our homes, but don't bring them to school, right?\n Yeah, I'm a little concerned too, about your idea that it's about which one is most basic. Okay? 'Cause the active ingredient in Clorox, I think, is bleach, and bleach--\n Sodium hypochlorite.\n Is sodium hypochlorite.\n Which has a pretty interesting smell.\n I'd stay away from that. And then we have Tide, right? Tide is not bleach, all right? I'm not sure what the actual detergent, active ingredient is, but I'm pretty sure it's not bleach. So, this is probably going to require some cleaning up and making sure that we test something that we can test, and that it makes sense why we're testing it. Okay? All right, we'll come back to this.\n And OxyClean is powered by Billy Mays, so it doesn't matter, it wins anyway.\n I think he died, didn't he?\n Yeah he did, it's too bad.\n You know, that guy must have made so much money, I better not complain.\n Adrian! Go ahead.\n I will find the molarity of one of the magnesium sulfate bottles in the lab inventory. To do this I'll mix 50 milliliters of magnesium sulfate with 50 milliliters of one molar calcium chloride in a beaker. I'll mix it to form a precipitate of calcium sulfate. After as much precipitate as possible has formed I'll weigh the precipitate and calculate the molarity of the magnesium sulfate solution with the data collected.\n Any ideas? Jimmy?\n I'm kinda wondering why it's important to you, like you said, to make the lab meaningful.\n Yeah, it should be. So Adrian, do you have a response?\n It's just 'cause bottles that don't have molarity kind of annoy me, and I feel like I should, there should be like a label that says the molarity, I just kinda...\n You know my room is open fifth period every day, you can come on in and do these experiments and get them so that you know their concentrations.\n I don't have a free fifth period.\n After school's fine too.\n That's cool, that's cool.\n What concerns me is, I thought the theme was titration, right? Is the theme titration? Okay, where is the titration aspect to this? Do you know what I'm asking here?\n Yeah, I know, I just didn't realize.\n Because you're mixing, you're doing a precipitate reaction, everybody see it that way. I think you're doing a precipitate reaction and, so I just feel like, you know, this, you had the wrong theme going on here. Anyway, we'll move on. Nicholas, Artel, Artel. Sirhan Sirhan, although he was a bad man, though I think, right? He was accused of being a bad man. Go ahead!\n The goal of my investigation is to see which of two pills have more Vitamin C per pills and weigh them to 100 milligrams and cut away mass as appropriate, crush them, dissolve in water and use a base to titrate it. I would also use a pH sensor to see what the solution, to see when the solution is at seven, to see when it's neutralized. Doing this will let me know which company I should buy from for my Vitamin C pills.\n What do you guys think? Vitamin C is ascorbic acid, I don't know if you wrote that. Did you? No, okay, so if it's an acid, you can titrate it, right? Is anybody concerned about, like, anything here? Jimmy?\n Don't the pills tell you how much Vitamin C is in them? Like, the bottle?\n Wait, let me make sure, if you buy a Vitamin C that says 100 milligrams of Vitamin C, my assumption is when you pull out one of them tablets, and you crush it and you do this experiment, it's gonna be close to that 100 milligrams. So are you testing because you think they're not accurate?\n Yeah.\n Oh! Okay, so you're testing for accuracy on their part, just to keep them honest.\n Because, I mean, 100 milligrams, it's kind of a, non-specific number.\n All right, Ian?\n Actually, another way you could look at it is that, just because it says 100 milligrams, that's how much of the Vitamin C is in it, that's not how big the tablet is. Being that sometime, I mean you could have, and say, just arbitrary numbers, you could have a 500 milligram tablet that has that 100 milligrams of vitamin C, or you could have a 200 milligram tablet with that same 100 milligrams of vitamin C, so you might wanna know which one actually had more stuff in it, actually had more stuff in it per, density.\n Okay but, is that what you want him to do, I thought, are you doing it because you wanna make sure that when they write 100, you don't care how big this tablet is, unless, unless, what's the danger here? Some of that other that tablet contains, acids or bases in them, then that would affect your results, right?\n One of them I have is pretty pure, it's pretty much just ascorbic acid, the other company I have does have some other stuff in it, so I was wondering if anybody else had like one that was mostly Vitamin C.\n Have you ever been to like, the CVS and looked in the section--\n I mean, I could find one I just haven't--\n There's a bunch, you could even--\n What'd you guys figure out?\n It's turning yellow.\n Why do you think it's doing that?\n Maybe the bicarbonate when it dissolves, gets out some CO2 and turns it acidic. I didn't think it would be that big of a deal because--\n Wait! Hang on, so you mean, so far what you've done is you've crushed these things you tried to dissolve them and you added some bromothymol blue?\n Yeah.\n And, that bromothymol blue is not quite the color that you want?\n That's right.\n That's what you're saying?\n Yeah.\n What color should it be?\n Blue, I guess. It's kind of, green. It just looks as if this coloring is just, green dye.\n Have you thought about using like phenolphthalein? That has a distinctly pink color, otherwise it's clear.\n No, we did not think of that.\n You wanna try that?\n Yeah.\n Yeah, that'd be better. \n So, the phenolphthalein is gonna be, it's probably going to be behind... - If it's pink it's acidic right?\n No, if it's basic. \n Do the bubbles matter?\n All right, could I just stop and ask you guys, did you guys get your color change you were looking for?\n Yeah.\n So the titration is working out?\n  Yep.\n Very clean.\n What? So, tell me what you got here?\n This is a disinfecting Clorox, we're just starting out, we're just trying to measure out 10 milliliters. That one we're done with, we got it to the brown, like, it didn't stir anymore, that was it.\n That's as far as it went?\n We put in 61 and that was it. Now we're going to start this one. And that worked with the one molar.\n So is this, oh, so this is a different concentration? Or how is this one different, this is just a different--\n This is a different type, and it's a different percentage of the hypochlorate.\n That's disinfecting spray and that's bleach.\n With a different type of Clorox cleaning product.\n All right. Did you make sure that mixing some of these would not produce anything poisonous?\n No, we did not make sure. But they're--\n I just wanna, you know, we don't wanna create any of these strange gases coming out of here.\n When we looked at the reaction this is the reaction that they showed on the thing. And this was fine, like it said it should be done in basic and everything.\n Okay.\n God bless you.\n Excuse me. \n How's everything going?\n Not good with this one.\n What's in there?\n It's red wine vinegar.\n But it hasn't changed color.\n The treatment's too powerful.\n Yeah, we're thinking it's too...\n So, we're gonna do the white--\n What's the solution to that, then? Why don't you just use less?\n Less of the vinegar?\n Right. All right?\n So we use five milliliters instead of\n Well, I mean, right? If you use less, then don't you think you'll be able to titrate it--\n Easier.\n Well, you'd need less base to get there.\n Right.\n Okay.\n Let's go over here, see what happens over here. \n So, squeeze that out.\n What are you guys, so you've got Vitamin C, crushed in there, you used, is this bromothymol blue, what did you use?\n Yeah, we used BTB, and now we're gonna see how much base we used.\n Just out of curiosity, why did you use a graduat--, what is this about, 50? You didn't want to use like... 'Cause that is, are you gonna--\n All the other ones were like dirty.\n Yeah, they were kinda...\n And I think this is accurate to two sig figs which is our experiment's limit. \n All right, coming along okay it looks like.\n  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,\n Hi!\n You're adding 20 drops of bromothymol blue?\n Yeah. Is that too much?\n Well, has it occurred to you, and it probably hasn't, it's okay, bromothymol blue itself is either a weak, my guess is it's a weak acid, it could be a weak base, but all indicators are going to be weak acids and bases. So, we always want to use a bare minimum amount. Therefore, how about if you use something that has a distinct color change, roughly at the, neutral point, like phenolphthalein. 'Cause then it'll go from pink, your...\n This is acid.\n These are acids, so they'll go from clear to a pinkish color.\n Okay, okay, but do you think the pink will be able to be seen?\n Well--\n Like the blue one?\n You know, the blue you need to use a lot more to get there, although, I don't know, I suppose since you already did this one--\n I mean, we could remeasure, out--\n You may wanna, well, we don't want to run out of time here, so, right? Stay consistent and then consider it, how you can make improvements later.\n Okay.\n All right?  \n Now that's very nice.\n You guys have questions?\n What was your results in comparing what the company says and what you--\n There was a little bit less, since we used 500 milligrams and the company labeled it as pretty much pure, pure ascorbic acid. As in the first trials it was around 480 per kil to, which is, it's pretty close and the other one was around than what you're probably paying for. But--\n But that's, then again, it could've been, because--\n Because not all the powder dissolved, some of it was still settled on the bottom.\n So they could be really accurate?\n Yeah they could be, you know, dead on.\n For the trials, did you guys use different amounts of stuff, for the two trials?\n For the first two trials we used 500 milligrams of powder for each pill, and then, for the third trial we used 100, right? A hundred.\n And then for those trials, like the third one you said you used a different concentration of NaOH?\n Yeah.\n Why did you use a different concentration?\n First of all there wasn't much left of the .567, and also, you know, who's to--, you know, maybe that could've been contaminated, it might not have been .567, so it's also good to use some different stuff sometimes.\n Right.\n You can't always base it, you can't have it all on one thing.\n Yeah, that's smart.\n How did yo actually figure out the amounts? What was the math?\n  Oh!\n We did the stoichiometry.\n Yeah, but we assumed that it was a one-to-one ratio, one hydrogen ion dissolved from the ascorbic acid from one OH from the base. And so we just calculated moles and changed moles to grams using the formula mass of Vitamin C.\n Do you know with certainty that ascorbic acid is one H plus?\n No we just assumed that, for the experiment.\n Maybe you should look that up.\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n The other thing, anybody else? So the other thing is, and I just wanna make sure, when you said 500 milligrams, that's .5 grams, right?\n We did it accurate with--\n Yeah, 'cause that thing, the scales here give you two sig figs, right? Okay, I mean to the hundredths, hundredths of a gram, right? So you crush this thing and you weighed out .50?\n  Yeah.\n That's what you did it? How much was left in the... ; I mean, of one tablet, when you, you know what I mean? When you crush it?\n Yeah--\n How much--\n We had excess, I mean, one of the pills I had was 1000 milligrams, so we, you know, we had about, we had a, like, about,\n It is my fault for--\n Oh, you were using 1000 milligram tablets.\n And then my pill was 500 milligrams and then we weighed them and it was actually six five seven, like milligrams.\n That's how we removed--\n So we had to-- we removed mass.\n Oh, well how 'bout this, if it, if they say 500, but the thing weighs six... What'd you say, six or seven hundred?\n Oh yeah.\n Then, aren't there other ingredients already in there?\n Not that were listed, like--\n Yeah, they weren't listed--\n It just said, it just said Vitamin C--\n Because they might just list the active ingredient, right?\n Yeah.\n In other words, if the pill itself weighs more than the 500 that they claim, my guess would be there's more of something else.\n Okay.\n Because here's another thing. Don't you need possibly a binding agent to keep all the Vitamin C in a clump? Do you see what I'm saying?\n  Yeah , yeah.\n And they'll typically use, some, there's gonna be some certain chemicals they're gonna use that's in there. So I have a feeling before you write the company, be careful, they're--\n  Yeah, yeah.\n They probably added other ingredients.\n Yeah.\n Because what I think might've been even better is if they claim 500, then why don't you just crush the whole thing, regardless of how much it weighs? And then titrate that. You see what I'm saying?\n  Yes.\n 'Cause then, they're claiming there's the... You see what I'm saying?\n So that would be taking further just simply--\n Yeah, that would be--\n The experiment.\n Wouldn't that be like the next--\n Yeah.\n Thing that you could try? Same thing with 1000, right? I mean if they claim 1000.\n Yeah.\n Go crush the whole thing and see what--\n", "filename": ["Copy of 160 SCI AYA 160.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0142627], "annotations": [["Insructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW24"]}, "161": {"text": "  Okay guys, good morning and welcome to class today. We're going to continue our discussion on energy, but we're going to extend it to cover some new points that we haven't talked about yet. So what I'd like for you to do first before we get started with out discussion is look at the big idea, the big idea for just a moment. So the big idea that we're going to talk about today is how do you think the sun is going to help you shoot the stretchy lizard across the table? So everybody's got their little stretchy lizard. Without shooting them, we're not doing anything with them yet, I'd like for you to talk in your table group and see if you can come up with a big idea. I'm going to give you and then we'll just go around and see what you think. Okay, so 30 seconds to think about what's the big idea.   Do you know who your spokesperson is going to be?\n   \n  Alright guys, it's been 30 seconds. I'm going to go to each table. If you could just have your spokesperson ready, you could just tell me what your big idea is. We're going to put it up here and we're going to come back to it at the end of class and see how we've done. Alright, so how about we'll start with you guys back here since there's just two of you. Alright, what do you think? Shawn, are you going to speak?\n  The sun would warm up the lizard and make it go across the table.\n  Okay, so the sun might warm up the lizard. I just put L for lizard, that's alright, and make it go across the table. Robert, how about your table, who's your spokesperson going to be?\n  The energy from the sun, once it shines on the lizard it would give the lizard energy.\n  Okay, the energy from the sun will shine on the lizard. Right, is that okay? Who's your spokesperson?\n  We said that the sun might make the lizard melt and make it sticky and then maybe it would shoot across the table.\n  Okay, so it might make it melt and sticky and that'll make it shoot across the table. Is that what you said? Alright, Kendrick who's your spokesperson going to be?\n  Blaire\n  It was unanimous. Alright, Blaire, what do you guys have?\n  We were going to say things like the other people said that like the energy from the sun is going...\n  Is going to do what?\n  Like the energy from the sun would like shine on the lizard and it's going to make it jump\n  Okay. Shine and make it jump. Nicole, did you guys decide who your spokesperson's going to be?\n  Arrington.\n  Arrington.\n  The sun would gives energy to the lizard to help it sling.\n  Okay, so the sun gives energy and I didn't hear the last part. You want to tell me?\n  That helps it.\n  That helps it, okay. And last but not least, Jada?\n  We think that the sun give heat to the  and make it more elastic so it would stretch.\n  Okay, so the sun would give heat to make it more elastic? I'm sorry, what was the last part again?\n  Like make it more elastic so it will stretch more.\n  So it'll stretch farther, good. Alright, so what I'd like to do now is I'd like to just kind of recall some of the things that we might already know about energy. So if I call your number, I would like you to think about what do you know about, let's start with potential energy. What do you know about potential energy? So if I call your number just tell me one factor, one thing that you know about it or an example of it. Alright, we'll start with 15.\n  When an object is like still, it doesn't move, it's holding it in.\n  Okay, still, doesn't move, it's holding it in. How about number eight? Robert. Something you know about potential energy or an example of it.\n  The lizards.\n  Alright, very good. When the lizard is still? When it's moving, what do you think?\n  Still?\n  Alright, very good.\n  It's stored energy.\n  Alright, it's stored energy and I'll do one more, number two. Potential energy. An example or something that you remember about it.\n  The pencil is still.\n  The pencil is still. Alright, very good. Now I know we haven't talked about these topics too much yet, but I know from your pretest you guys had a lot of background knowledge on it. Okay, the next thing I'd like to know is what do you know, what examples do you have, what can you remember about kinetic energy. So we talked about potential. Now I'd like to know a couple things that you might know about kinetic energy. Alright, so if I call your number let me know what you think. Number 20?\n  A car moving.\n  A car moving. Alright, number 13.\n  A paint can being dropped.\n  A paint can being dropped, alright, very good. Number 14.\n  When you push a pencil and it rolls.\n  Alright, when you push a pencil and it rolls, very good. And how about number seven, we'll do one more.\n  Like the energy of motion,  like the .\n  The energy of motion?\n  Yeah.\n  Thanks. Alright, and if I didn't call your number and you want to contribute about either potential or kinetic. Anybody have anything else to add about it? Dylan?\n  Kinetic is when like the stored energy from the potential energy leaks all out and it starts pulling.\n  Alright, very good and that's a great way to start into the next part, what we're going to use the lizards for today. Alright, so what I would like to know from you guys, is everybody has a bucket on their table, right?\n  Um-hum, yeah.\n -Teacher] Okay. And you can raise your hand for this part: how can you, from your seat, how can you make the stretchy lizard get into the bucket? Anthony.\n  Shoot it.\n  You can shoot it.\n  You can just toss it in.\n  You can just toss it in there.\n  You could pull its tail.\n  You could pull its tail and stretch it.\n  You could drop it in there.\n  You could just drop it in there. It's not too far away. Anybody else? Okay, how about, and I'm not asking for a demonstration yet, we'll get to demonstration, I promise. How about if I asked you guys, instead of in the bucket at your table, how could you get it into a bucket at your neighbor's table? At your neighbor's table? Javious, what do you think?\n  You could toss it.\n  You could toss it. Arrington.\n  You could sling it.\n  You could sling it. Wilson. That was your idea? Alright.\n  Walk over there and put it in it.\n  Yeah that's true. I didn't say you had to stay in your seat did I? You could walk over there and just put it in. Gavin.\n  You could like throw it.\n  You might throw it. Is that what you were going to say Dana? Alright.\n  Shoot it.\n  You could shoot it, alright, very good.\n  You could bend it back.\n  Yep, you could bend it back and shoot, very good. How about if I asked you to shoot it from one side of the room to the other? Jade, I'll start with you.\n  Sling it.\n  You could sling it. Lewis.\n  Like you said, you could shoot it.\n  Yeah, you could shoot it. Anthony.\n  You could throw it.\n  You could throw it. So we're kind of hearing the same things, right? We're kind of hearing-- Go ahead.\n  You could walk over and drop it.\n  You could walk over and drop it. I didn't say you had to stay in your seat. Alright. What would be the difference, though, between the bucket at your table, the bucket your neighbor's table, shooting it across the room, going out on the football field and going for distance? What would be the difference between what you did? What difference would you have between this bucket here, the bucket at your neighbor's table and so forth? John, what do you think?\n  The amount of energy you're putting into it.\n  Can you just show me without actually shooting it, for example?\n  Like if you're trying to get it into this bucket, I only have to go like this or drop it in there. If I were trying to send it across the room I'd have to really stretch it out.\n  Okay.\n  The distance away from the bucket.\n  Okay, so what would you do differently to make it go a different distance?\n  Stretch it more.\n  I might stretch it further, is that what you two were going to say?\n  The more potential energy or kinetic energy it has.\n  The more potential energy, the more kinetic energy it has? So when you talk about the lizard, what do you mean when you say the potential energy that it has? How's it getting potential energy? What does that mean?\n  Before you sling it, it's just sitting there-- .\n  Alright, so when it's just sitting there it's potential. What about when you stretch it, what do you think that is?\n  Kinetic.\n  Okay, have you let it go yet?\n  No.\n  Alright, so we'll think about that for a little bit. What I'd like for you guys to do is talk to your neighbors at your table, or if you don't like what they have to say, you can think about it on your own. I'd like for you to make a hypothesis and I'd like for your hypothesis to start with \"I think\" and then think about what we just said about how you would get the lizard in the bucket at your table versus your neighbor's table. What do you think you would do differently? \"I think if I\", do what to the lizard it's going to go in the bucket at my table versus the one at the next table. So make a hypothesis about how you could test how can you get the lizard in that bucket versus the next one.\n  By slinging it.\n  Yeah, talk amongst yourselves and see what you guys think. Alright, I'll give you \n  But then compare it to the next table as well. What would you have to do differently to the lizard to get it in this bucket versus the next one? That's what I want you to do. Okay, alright. So let me just have... Let's hear one table. Gavin, I kind of liked what I was hearing from yours. Ready guys? Gavin, I liked what I was hearing from your table when I was walking around. Tell me what you guys came up with for a hypothesis.\n  That if you were shooting it at your table you'd only pull back a little bit, but if you're shooting it across to another person's table, you'd have to pull it back farther.\n  Okay, any other table have a similar hypothesis? So their hypothesis then was if they want to shoot it into the bucket at their table, and correct me if I'm wrong, they'd only have to stretch it a little bit, but if they wanted to shoot it at their neighbor's table, they'd have to stretch it further. Did anybody have a similar hypothesis to that? You guys did. How about you guys, what did you say Nicole?\n  We said that maybe we'd have to aim our trajectory much different that we would between tables.\n  Okay, so not only the amount of stretch, but also the trajectory of how you aim it. Alright, very good. How about you guys over there?\n  You'd have to really aim and focus on how much power you put into it.\n  Alright, very good. And I know you guys were coming up with the same thing. So we're going to do an experiment in just a minute to test that hypothesis about the amount of stretch. Is the amount of stretch related to how far your lizard can fly? Okay, so if that's your hypothesis, I think the amount of stretch that I give the lizard will make it fly a different length, what would the manipulated variable be? What would the thing be that you change between the different steps? Anthony.\n  How far you pull it back.\n  How far you pull it back, very good. How far you pull it or can I put stretch also? Good. What would our dependent variable be? What are you going to watch for? How do you know if that stretch has made a difference? Jada?\n  \n  Alright, very good and where else might it go?\n  \n  Right, but you're talking about your bucket and you're also talking about--\n  \n  Very good. So we're talking about--\n  Distance.\n  Alright, so can I put that down for the dependent?\n  Yes.\n  Okay, good. How about some constants. What are some things that have to stay the same? Guys, don't let that table do all the work, come on now. Alright, Ada.\n  The type of lizard.\n  The type of lizard, very good. Would it be fair if I gave one table battery powered and the other table not, right? Alright, very good. Sierra, what else?\n  The size and shape of it.\n  Size and shape of it, very good. Anything else that has to stay constant or the same?\n  How big is the container.\n  Alright, very good. How big is the container. Wilson?\n  How stretchy it is.\n  Okay, how stretchy it is. Alright, I'm going to give you 30 seconds and what I would like for you to do with those 30 seconds, is I'd like for you to practice. Alright, I'd like for you to practice at this point just at your table. If you want to practice on moving the bucket to one end and you guys try from the other end, that's fine, but I would like for you guys to control the lizards so they stay at your area, okay. Alright, go ahead. Without hitting your neighbor. Maybe move to the side, Kendra. Go ahead and practice and see the amount of stretch you give the lizard makes a difference. Gavin. \n  See if you have some information when you're done besides that it sticks to your neighbor's head. Alright, hold on and we'll try it again. I promise we'll try it again  at further distances in just a minute. Let's think guys. Can anyone make a conclusion that starts with: \"When I change the amount of stretch...\"? Can anyone make a conclusion that starts-- Good job. Nicole.\n  When I change the amount of stretch... If I change the amount of stretch far then it goes further.\n  Okay, if I change the amount of stretch when I make it further, it goes further? Alright, Lewis.\n  You might plan for it to go one way, but the way that you shoot it really, it doesn't exactly go where you plan. It's all over the place.\n  But if we just focus back to the amount of stretch and the distance--\n", "filename": ["Copy of 161 SCI EA 161 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.162286], "annotations": [["Teacher", "Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Shawn"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["Blaire"], ["Teacher"], ["Blaire"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Arrington"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Robert"], ["Teacher"], ["Robert"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Dylan"], ["Teacher"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["Anthony"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Javious"], ["Teacher"], ["Arrington"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Gavin"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Jade"], ["Teacher"], ["Lewis"], ["Teacher"], ["Anthony"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["John"], ["Teacher"], ["John"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Gavin"], ["Teacher"], ["Nicole"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Anthony"], ["Teacher"], ["Jada"], ["Teacher"], ["Jada"], ["Teacher"], ["Jada"], ["Teacher"], ["Jada"], ["Teacher"], ["Jada"], ["Teacher"], ["Ada"], ["Teacher"], ["Sierra"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Wilson"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Nicole"], ["Teacher"], ["Lewis"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW04", "TW06s", "TW11", "TW20", "TW24"]}, "129": {"text": " ... and your ideas, and we're learning from each other, right?

Okay, Kelly if you would move the book away from the projector so we can see the screen. We're going to watch another weather forecast, and as you're viewing this, I want you to pay really close attention to how she...\n Talks.\n How she speaks. Okay. As a good listener and a viewer, what are some things that we need to concentrate on while we're watching this?\n How she, her face, her expression and how she moves and looks.\n Okay, and how are you going to find out if she does those things?\n By watching her?\n You're going to be watching her, okay... Sarah?\n Watch how her body is moving because...  Watch her eyes.\n Okay, catch your eye. And I like that you said watching. What are you doing while you're watching? Are you just staring at the screen?\n No. You are looking at them and you're making eye contact, and you're looking; you're watching their mouths because there are people who can't really hear, so they would read people's mouths, and that's really important to do.\n Anything else that you can do while you're viewing this?\n Listening.\n Okay, and how are you going to be listening? We talked about this a lot. How are we going to listen?\n With our ears and with our whole entire bodies.\n With our whole entire bodies. Why are we going to listen with our whole entire body? Naomi.\n Because if we're listening with our ears, then our hands are up here saying, \"Oh, I've got something to say,\" then you're not really listening, you're not really listening competently.\n All right, can you go ahead and hit play for us, please? Yup, just like you did yesterday.\n Good afternoon, I'm Julie Wunder with your forecast. A north wind, five to ten miles per hour. Tonight 28, it's going to be partly cloudy out, and we can head to a 7-day forecast. About a 50 percent chance of rain transitioning over to some snow overnight Saturday and into Sunday. Temperatures fall next week, what a cold forecast we have. Coming up at 5 o'clock, we'll have the latest on that possibility of snow.\n Turn and talk to your buddy. We're going to do two right here, two, two, two...\n I noticed that under one of the clouds we had snow instead of rain. \n Turn your face...\n Okay and what kind of body language did she use?\n She was pointing and ... \n So why do you think she was pointing like that? \n Okay.\n And because you saw her looking at you, did that make you listen any differently? \n Did it help you listen more or less? \n When she looked away, what was she doing? \n Alright, so why do you think she wasn't doing this? Okay like you say, she was like. Why is that? \n Would you be listening as well if she were making those faces? Or would you  her face?\n Right, not necessarily what she was saying but you were focusing on her expressions. \n Alright guys let's come back in three, two, and one. Okay, you guys had some amazing things that you saw when you watched this little clip.\n What kind of things did you notice? Tell me what you and your buddy were talking about.\n We used this chart. If she was just like there... she was pointing at it so then it made me understand more but if she was just like there... ?\n  When you did your presentation, what did you feel like you were looking at?\n My poster.\n  You looked at your poster the whole time? Okay, and the second time when you did your presentation again, you said you were really focusing on your eye contact, were you able to achieve that goal?\n No -  No? Why not?\n Because I was looking at my poster again.\n  You say you were looking at your poster again. Okay, why do you think you did that? Were you nervous? What do you think you could've done to ease that nervousness?\n Take a breath. -  Going to take a breath? What do you guys think? What could Adrian have done to maybe be a little less nervous when he was doing his presentation?\n He could think about somewhere he was comfortable.\n Okay, think about somewhere where's he's comfortable.\n Picture everyone else in their underwear.\n Oh, underwear. Sarah.\n Be himself and just act like it's just any other day. \n The information we were presenting was it a little bit more in depth than what we usually talk about? What do you think? Was the topic you were sharing a little bit, you have a little bit more information than if you were just sitting here having a conversation?\n Yeah.\n So that make some of us nervous that we have a lot of information trying to remember?\n Yes.\n And then, was anyone able to get over that nervousness?\n Okay. Sarah, how were you guys able to get over that nervousness?\n I followed my goals and I just tried to be myself. I just followed my goals and I just had fun.\n Okay, do you want to show us part of your presentation where you did that?\n Mhmm.\n Avril, will you move the book away from the projector while she gets the computer ready? Alright, make sure you get to a spot where you can see. Got it?\n My project is about Legends of the  I'm going to start over with Werewolves people think that ... I don't know why because wolves howl at the moon This is a werewolf, a full moon is sometimes called a Wolf's Moon... since its yellow . This one is my favorite. It's about  ... she calls her brother Helius to find her sister Herse.  The study of geography to the moon is called Selenology. Okay this is ...  This is vampires, vampires are said to come out on every moon except for new moon I guess because they can see better. This is a vampire person trying to get his girlfriend to become a vampire. This is people, people think  to people that are aggressive and violent...  This is a witch from... \n Okay turn to your buddy for a second. Do you think she was able; she said she acted like she was comfortable. Like it was just any other day.\n Yeah.\n Talk to your buddy about that. Do you think that she accomplished that goal?\n Yes. \n Because she's a pretty funny girl, right? Alright. Let's come back together. Let's come back together please. Alright. So her goal, she said that she wanted to be more comfortable. And she was just going to act like it was any other ...\n Day.\n Did she accomplish that?\n Yes.\n Okay. How do we know that she accomplished that? What do you think Arizona?\n  Because she was really comfortable with her surroundings and those people just wanted to get their talking over with and done but Sarah actually talked like we were just talking face to face acting like the camera wasn't even there.\n Okay. And as a listener, how did Sarah's confidence make you listen better? Did it make you listen better or did it not make you listen better? It did? Okay. Why did it make you listen better, Levin?\n Because it was fun.\n Because it was fun? Okay. And what made it fun?\n She was acting like, the way she was acting\n The way she was acting? Okay. What did you think, Dillon?\n Because she's usually funny and she was being quite funny on this.\n Okay.\n And I like to... \n Yup. Alright, anybody else?\n What were some other goal that you guys created? Sit up and join the circle please. Alright, let's see. Someone I haven't heard from yet. Isabelle, what was one of your goals?\n One of my goals was to stop making really distracting movements because I was like twisting it and twirling it and I was really nervous.\n Alright so that was the first time you did your presentation, you felt you were doing too many movements.\n Yeah.\n And so your goal was to cut down on that and why did you choose that as a goal?\n Really, when we watched my first video, we decided that,  she said that she was kind of watching that and she couldn't really have her attention stay on what I was saying.\n And did you agree with her?\n Mhmm.\n Okay, so what did you do with your second presentation?\n I really was concentr...\n", "filename": ["Copy of 129 LRLA EMC 129edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.0191723], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Arizona"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW04", "TW05", "TW07", "TW15", "TW16", "TW19"]}, "163": {"text": " Our is, like, Crown-- Crown Royal, and, like, it shows, like, a helmet, and, like, an ad for it, and it says, \"He who wears the crown, \" I think that's, like, if you wear the helmet, you will seem cool.\n Mm-hmm, and the helmet is for what, do you think? Motorcycles or cars, kind of racing kind of stuff? And Crown Royal, tobacco or alcohol? Alcohol, and racing a car. Thoughts?\n Drinking and driving. Huh.\n Well, that's bad.\n But they appeal to your-- your, uh, love of racecars and motorcycles and cool stuff, but those two don't really mix, do they? Next group.\n Ours is tobacco, and it has a picture of a firefighter, and it says, A bit braver, so it's trying to hook you by you wanting to be braver, and trying tobacco.\n So the inference there would be that tobacco makes you braver? What do you think? Could it really work? If I chew tobacco? Am I gonna be able to fight a fire?\n No.\n But firefighting appeals to a lot of young children, right? That bravery, that toughness, that rugged fireman thing. It's like, if I do chewing tobacco, I'm a rugged fireman type. Um, what are my teeth gonna look like, though?\n  Yellow.\n Not gonna look like the rugged fireman type, am I? \n Fireman sounds like he smiles, is that what you said?

You're appealing to the family nature? And the message is, drink our drink.\n Yeah, it says that, like, all stories weren't about family, they also had some other stuff.\n Family and Budweiser.\n Yeah.\n No.\n Yeah, you're getting it now. All right. Ladies?\n Um, ours is, um--\n There's isn't really an ad. There's is a display at a grocery store.\n Yeah, like, there is, um, a whole bunch of, like, alcohol in the background, and up closer, there's tobacco, and then there's a bunch a candy bars that should appeal to the little kids.\n Right next to the... ?\n The tobacco.\n Tobacco, okay. Candy bars.\n Like right there, and then, um, also you have pretty much the candy.\n Alcohol behind the booth, tobacco right up front, and candy bars right at hand level.\n Kids would probably think that tobacco's candy.\n They might.\n Or as good as candy.\n Does tobacco come in flavors like candy does?\n  Yeah.\n No.\n Yes, it does.\n Oh.\n Mint, berry, apple.\n Ew, really?\n Really. Hey, I think I missed a group. Did I miss a group? This one up front? Nope. Did I get you guys already? Did you guys share? Oh, you did share, just with me. Share with the rest of the group. It's\n Ours is alcohol and, like, if you're a rockstar, you'll drink, like, if you drink this, then you will become a rockstar.\n What hook did they use?\n The girls in bikinis.\n So how many guys are in that picture?\n One.\n One guy, and he's the one who's drinking the alcohol, and... ?\n Fifteen girls.\n Fifteen girls in bikinis. So if-- the message is, if you drink this... ?\n You'll get hot girls.\n You'll get hot girls, yeah. \n All right, you've had a chance to let-- Oh, sorry. Eyes. Ears. Mouth. Thanks. You've had a chance to look at these ads. Um, you've got a chance to see how they're trying to hook you in. You're knowing that the messages that they're sending are slightly warped. It's their trick to pull you in, but it's your job to think and process through using your critical thinking skills. Weigh it out. Consider, but then choose something else that's healthier. So we've looked at negative influences. It's time to talk about positive influences in your life, things that can help you say no to all of that, no matter how appealing it is, no matter how many girls in bikinis show up. Leave your cards right where they are in the center. It's time to take a look at the charts that are around the room. There are five of them. These are activities you can do instead of things like using drugs, alcohol, tobacco, like a social activity, um, something you can do with someone else. Ideas?\n Have a sleepover.\n Sleepover, good. All right, so in just a few minutes, we're gonna be rotating around the charts with different groupings. We're gonna be writing down our ideas of other positive things instead of this. Can anyone name one physical activity, something you can do that would be instead of using drugs, a positive thing? Football? Yeah. Did you want to share too? Go ahead.\n Um, riding your bike around the block.\n Good. You're on the right track, guys. Keep those ideas in your head. When you get to the chart, you'll have to write it down. What's something you can do with your brain, a mental activity that would be positive?\n Chess.\n Chess.\n I like chess.\n Math. Not for everybody, I understand. Um, this chart over here says \"Emotional.\" What's something you can do, um, that can make your emotions feel better, your passions, or whatever? How can you support yourself emotionally, so you can say no to this?\n Trying to think happy.\n Yep. Positive thoughts.\n Watching emotional movies.\n Definitely gets your mind off those. I know you got great ideas, and I'm gonna be willing to see those on those papers in just a few minutes, so save them in your head.\n Okay.\n The last one is spiritual. Spiritual. Somehow you can nurture your spirit, so you have the ability to say no to negative influences.\n Go to church.\n Church. All right. Save it. You'll get a chance. Time to look at your pencils again. Leave your papers right where they are, okay? Face-up. This time, we're gonna go by color, and you might notice that there are markers at each station, for the right color. So when you get to the station, if you are-- patience. I promise I'll explain it. No worries. When you get to your station, we're gonna start with your bag of colors. You will take your bag of colors and your marker, and you will only use your color marker. So if you are a green guy, you would grab a green marker and you will be writing at this station first. You'll write down however many ideas you want. You'll talk it out with your group. You might notice, Mitchell, that I also put group work, uh, reminders up here, about how to work with others in your group. One, everybody has the right to speak, so make sure you give everybody a chance to talk it out if they need to, and to write it down, the topic. Don't interrupt. Give everybody a chance to share their side. Two, everybody has the right to be respected. We're not looking for put downs. We're looking for ones that can encourage us, positive things, so when you're getting ready to write positive things, speak positively to each other as well. And three, everyone has to agree to work together to solve a conflict. So if you're having a difficulty in your group, talk it out. Work together to solve that problem. If it's not working, and you can't solve the problem, who can you turn to for help?\n You?\n Me. And others in your group. So if you're a green person, you're gonna get one green marker, and there are multiple in here, in case your marker doesn't work. Get a different one. Write down whatever ideas you want. When you hear me say, \"Switch,\" or, \"Rotate,\" you move to the next chart around like the face of a clock. Take your marker with you. So there'll be multiple colors on here. You'll get a chance to write on every one. Yes?\n How does this work? Are you supposed to write it down like a list?\n You can write all over that paper. Yeah. Anywhere, as long as we're on the front. Everywhere, all over that paper, so you can all be on there at the same time as you want, you can take turns, you can arrange however you and your group want to. You each can have a marker, though. There's plenty of them for everyone. Yellow's are over here at \"Emotional,\" um, I believe blue's are \"Social,\" purple's are \"Physical,\" and oranges are \"Mental.\" Questions before we begin? Think about something to do besides. You'll have approximately 30 seconds to a minute, so listen for me to say, \"Switch.\" Keep writing until I say it. Go! \n Here. How about we take this and put it on the floor. Does that work better? I know, it's going everywhere, isn't it? Here you go. You guys want to take that one down, too, put it on the floor, so it's a little easier to write on?\n Yeah.\n Good.\n I know, isn't it cool?\n Yeah.\n So I see you got chess on there. Anyone think of some other ones? Other mental, ways to use your brain, things you can think about it? \n Think of school kind of activities, things related to learning, using the brain. Spelling. You can practice your spelling. You can do your math. I think you guys are in right place. You have a lot of good ideas. Tell me your favorite one so far. \n Give him a spot.\n Good.\n How do you spell \"baseball\"? \n Oh, online. The Playstation, yeah, that is definitely a social event.\n I've got XBox Live.\n So social means involving what? Talking to other people, human beings, a relationship with them? All right. Ready in 10, nine, finish what you're writing, eight, seven, six, taking your marker with you in five...\n Oh, our marker?\n Four. Yep. Your writing in your color. Three, two, one, rotate. \n Spiritual. All things that are spiritual. What does that really mean?\n Your spirit?\n Your spirit, yeah. It could be feelings. I think we did emotions, though, right?\n Yeah.\n So this one would be more nurturing your soul, yourself.\n We've got meditation.\n We've got mediation, right.\n Yoga!\n Oh, yeah! Why don't you write that one down?\n How do you spell \"yoga\"?\n Yes, perfect. The Bible, poems. How much do you connect with your spirit or your soul? Any other resources or people? Pastor from a church. Friends you know from the church, or wherever you attend services. Who else besides a pastor can lead, um, a group?\n You can pray.\n Pray, good. You guys are on the right track. Emotional support. Where can we find emotional support? Family, friends, good. Who are some other resources for emotional support? Culture? How can we nurture your own good feelings? What do you do to feel better?\n Cuddle your pets.\n Cuddle your pets. You know that one's my favorite, too.\n It's okay, you don't have to spell things.

I want to know what your question is, what is your variable that you're isolating, and what are you measuring? You guys ready? Okay, so, table two? Or table one?\n Our central question is how does different types of oil stains clothes, even after they've been rinsed. And our independent variable is going through the different oils that we used, and the dependent variable is how they changed from before, when we first stained them to after when we rinsed them.\n Cool, and you may be able to use the light probe to determine the intensity of that stain. Tomorrow--\n We also were planning on taking pictures from before and after, so we could like, compare those.\n So, you may want to do a scale, like Marley did with the intensity of her hair dye, as well, okay? But get it set up today, make it really controlled with all your measurements, and just change the type of oil. Alright, scientists, do you have any?\n Our experiment is we're going to mix oil and water and then try and separate the oil using positive and negative charges.\n Okay, using positively and negatively charged particles to separate oil from water? I don't know, I read your document, I don't know what the positively-charged particles you are, but did you work it out? Okay, so what's your question then?\n Our question is does charged particles affect the oil scum?\n Okay, does charged particles affect the shape of oil balls, them coming together, scum balls? Okay, good. Table three, what's your question?\n Um, how long does it take to make scum on the surface of the water, like, using what we're going to use, mainly olive oil and toilet paper.\n Okay.\n Perfect.\n And testing, the independent variable is testing how long we're going to stir. How long it takes to make scum, and then our dependent variable, we're going to take the observations of time.\n Okay, so the question is, how long does it take to form scum balls? Independent variable is the stir time, and the dependent variable is the...\n How long it takes.\n How long it takes to do it?\n Uh-huh.\n What are you going to measure, though?\n We're going to actually try to measure the surface area of the .\n Cool, so you're going to say how much is covered by scum at that point in time? Okay, that should be pretty easy to do with a camera shot. Okay, table four, what's your question?\n How does temperature affect the oil and water?\n How does temperature affect the oil and water? Awesome.\n And we're trying to figure out how it will separate.\n How can you separate it? What are you changing in the experiment?\n We're changing, we're going to use regular temperature and put it on a Bunsen burner and put it in the freezer.\n Cool, and you're more than welcome to use the freezer in the back. Good idea. Alright, table five, what's your question?\n Does heat affect the scum ball?\n Does heat affect the scum ball?\n And our independent's going to be amount of scum and the amount of water, and the dependent's going to be heat .\n Okay, so your independent, now you said heat and then you said the amount of water in whatever, so your independent is really going to be temperature. So, I feel like you have two independent variables. Why don't you just spend a minute and talking about which one you want to isolate. Is it the amount of water and the amount of scum? Or is it temperature? Okay?\n We were going to change the temperature.\n Then keep the amount of water and the scum constant. Because you can't do different amounts of water and scum and different temperatures. It means you're testing for two different things. While you could do that, it's two experiments and we don't have time today. So, just one experiment. Alright, table six?\n So, our central question is, is it possible to create scum balls in different shapes?\n Okay.\n And our independent variable was the amount of oil. And the dependent was the shape.\n Okay, so is it possible to make scum balls of different shapes? Independent variable is the amount of oil or scum, dependent variable is the shapes. While I'm over here, I just want to draw your attention to the back of the room. That is the waste beaker, which has scum on top of it right now. It's every kind of oil that Copper used yesterday. So if you want pre-made scum, I encourage you to use Copper's waste from yesterday. So, the bottom portion of it is a lot of soap and soap water. But the top portion of it is just that less dense, oily scum, okay? Alright, table seven, what's your question?\n It's can we filter out oil from the water using the gravel filter?\n Okay.\n So, we're trying two different types of oil and we're going to put it through a bunch of gravel in the container.\n Okay, and you may need to use two of the same identical filters, so just make sure you're really consistent with your measurements between those two filters. Good. Alright, I'm excited about their project because Copper had one group that did a filter yesterday and their results were very interesting. So, check back in with this group later on if you want to see what's going on with the filters. And table eight, what's your central question?\n Does oil collect some of the things in the surrounding body of water?\n Does oil collect the most what?\n Does oil collect the most of each thing?\n Oh, the most of each thing in the surrounding body of water? Okay, so you're going to look and see what it attracts? And what are some of the materials you're going to use?\n Dirt, sand, and pebbles.\n Dirt, sand, and pebbles, awesome. So, your independent variable is type of material that it would possibly attract. How are you going to measure those results?\n Mass.\n Mass? Okay, cool. You may want to work on a microscope slide just so you can have a little bit of an easier time measuring the mass. If you get too big, it won't measure on our balances. Which brings me to my next topic, which is safety talk. Conservation of materials. \n  Did you guys get a lecture yet?\n  No, because Sam is too busy with her.\n  Why don't you go over there and see what they're doing. Go, talk to her. Thank you. Alright, lady scientists. What's going on?\n We're like, I thought that we didn't need to do the middle one because yesterday we didn't have enough time, so we just did the small amount and then the larger...\n  Amount? Okay.\n  Now that we did the middle speed, we're actually seeing a lot different stuff, because the balls are actually coming together. That underneath, and we noticed also under here that everything settled to the bottom except the dirt and oil that reached to the top.\n  Okay.\n  And this is thicker than that one.\n  Okay, let me get another group over here because they're also trying to form a scum ball, and I'd like them to see your results. Terrence and Catherine and Maddy, can you guys pause and come and check out this group's experiment?\n  I don't see scum. It makes me mad.\n  Ooh, this is so cool.\n  Why does it look like that? I want it to look like that.\n  Come on over. These guys are also doing an experiment on scum balls. Can you guys talk about what's your independent variable? What are you changing?\n  We're just changing the different speeds.\n  Okay, and Yasmine, what were some of the things you added that were controlled within all three?\n  The dirt, oil, and the water.\n  Okay, and they used the black potting soil dirt. Is it the peat moss? In the plastic bag? That's peat moss.  Okay, good. And Taylor, it looks like you have some cloudy stuff in the bottom, what's that? Don't know? Can you guys fill her in?\n  Toilet paper.\n  Toilet paper, which makes sense because there's a lot of toilet paper over there. Okay, and so far, your results have been, they've just done the high speed and the low speed, right? And they're like, oh it's the same, nothing happened, nothing happened, right? They came back today, and this is the medium speed, and what's going on?\n  A lot of dirt, balls are actually coming down and forming together. Because they were all little pieces of dirt, and now they're making big globs of dirt. And that's weird.\n  So, does time, sitting overnight, have anything to do with it?\n  That's what we talked about with these two. Actually this one, because, and this one too, because we didn't see a lot of carbon bubbles in the first one. And then this one, I just noticed that it's actually the toilet paper is on the bottom and actually attached to the bottom layer of the oil.\n  Okay, are the highs and the lows working, the speeds, yet? Have you tried to re-run the highs and the lows today?\n No.\n  Re-run the highs and lows, you have a good seven, six minutes. See if they start to form clump balls. Not sure if you can use this one.\n  Can I go get a funnel?\n  Sure. There's one on the table. I am not sure if your choice of particles simply is inhibiting the formation of the scum balls or not. If you want to add another part to your experiment to make it more controlled, maybe you could add some toilet paper and see if that adds anything, or you could leave it how it is. It's your choice. Got about seven minutes, okay?\n  Thank you.\n  Yes, cool. Hey, you guys have some diesel fuel on your table? Any information, research, observations that could be made about the shapes of the molecules would be awesome. The three of you all together. Alright, so...\n  We got 97, no, 47, 94 for all of them.\n  Okay, let me put the camera on you four. Ready? Let's talk about it. Is that okay?\n Okay, so you isolated your variable, different types of oil. You made everything the same, same size, same amount of water, same amount of soap, time, soaking, everything was super-controlled, right? Okay, and then you just did a light prep on all of them and the look was the same across the board.\n Yeah, it was 47, 94, like it jumped between them two numbers, constantly. None of them, like...\n Consistent, so it was consistent. Alright, so any initial conclusions? Yes.\n I said that since all the things were like a darker color, and the oils were kind of close, I guess, in like, how they felt and what color they were, I guess that maybe if we used a white shirt, maybe there would've been a difference because it would've soiled it more.\n Do you feel like there is still oil in this fabric?\n Yes.\n Yes, okay, alright. Let me hear your conclusions, and then I'm going to--\n This one that had water on it is different-looking than this one, like the material looks more like--\n Like dry or something, right? So, there's some qualitative difference. I know that this one needs to be flipped over. Because then it's the same side of the fabric. Okay, so water--\n That one's whiter.\n Lighter, okay, so you feel like these are a little bit darker looking. And your control?\n This one is darker.\n Your control was the same as all of them? The 47, 94.  Okay. And you? Any conclusions yet?\n Um, I don't know. I kind of think the sand thing is sand because I know the one we put on the paper, like it went all the way down to 40-something, so maybe the fabric was too dark to the point where it was .\n Okay, and Lauren, what was your central question?\n My central question?\n The central question of your experiment.\n Oh, it was to see after we washed it how much of it was still there.\n How much of it was still there? Okay, or if it would affect the fabrics differently?  Okay, but your light probe is saying, no they're all the same, so maybe your eyes are off or maybe the probe is a little bit off or whatever.\n Should I take that as data?\n I think you should take it as data, yeah. And it's okay, you addressed your question, which was, how does oil affect it different among shirts? In your case, with the soap, maybe not at all differently. I'd like you to try one more thing involving paper towels. And what you're going to do, is you're going to see, you're going to press down as hard as you can with a paper towel and see if there's any oil that's absorbed on the paper towels, okay? So, that can be one other way to take data. To see if there's still any oil still stuck in the shirts.\n Okay.\n Okay? Goggles on. Goggles on! Goggles on!\n  What's the highest temperature we could put it at?\n  Are you guys boiling?\n  You can put it all the way up, you just have to be really cautious. Get your Hot Hands out, the big glove. Alright, Heather's group, I'm coming over to you guys. Ready? Okay, what's going on over here?\n  We put 10 millileters of motor oil in 150 mls of water and we added five grams of salt.\n Okay, ooh. Salt, when I was a waitress, we used to put salt on our oil stains to get the oil out.\n Maybe you could put a second... Wait, that's kind of like clay. I was going to say flour, because that's what we do if I spill.\n What do you notice?\n It's starting to kind of clump.\n When we had the clay, it was really, really clumpy, but then it...\n It, the, uh...\n Yeah, like the clay just clumped. And then we had to get before and that didn't really make a difference, it just sat at the bottom.\n My hands are sticky.\n Oh, thank you. While you're here, do you remember the charge of the particles of clay? Positive or negative?\n Negative.\n Okay, so, negatively-charged particles, and now you've added sodium chloride, which dissolves in water. You've got an A plus, positive, CL minus negative. And you're clearly getting a scum ball. No? What happens when you turn it off?\n It just all settles at the top.\n When we put clay in there for the first time, it was all little clay balls that slowly rose to the top. But nothing of the magnitude...\n So, that motion really helps it to stay together.\n Yeah, that's what we did. We put it at 500 RPMs first, and then we dialed it back down to 100.\n Let's apply this to the water treatment plant. Was there motion at the water treatment plant?\n  Yes.\n Was there clay in the water?\n Probably.\n From where?\n From the sediment on the bottom of the Schuylkill.\n From the sediment on the river? Now remember, the stuff that's going in the water treatment plant is coming directly from the home, so it hasn't had a chance to go in the Schuylkill River yet.\n Okay.\n Would there be any clay in the homes?\n Not in the homes, no.\n Not in the homes? Not in anything flushed down the toilet?\n Yeah.\n So, yeah, there could be some, like, clay-like sediment, sand particles going through. Or at the very least, we could say that there's probably some negatively-charged particles going through, some kind of silicates.\n  Shall we throw away the fabric?\n Sure.\n Who knows what's in feces, right? Alright so, what I think is cool about your experiment is the motion is really important in getting those scum balls to form. Have you talked about CeCe's experiment yet?\n  No.\n Go ahead and give that a whirl because they actually put peat moss in theirs, and they started to get scum balls to form on medium speed. Also, Matt, Ian's, sorry, Catherine's station is using sand, specifically, and I forget what the other material is. It looks like peat moss, and they're having no success. So, go ahead and do a little quick walk-around. And clean up.\n Motion.\n Can you let them, give them a 10 second overview?\n Yeah.\n And then go? Taylor, pull it together, you'll be okay. You're good? Okay. \n  Did you get any scum?\n No we didn't, we just got into lumps. The fastest way we got a layer, and then everything, the soil settled on the bottom. And then for the middle speed, it actually formed big clumps of balls with the oil mixed in. \n  Clean up, clean up. \n", "filename": ["Copy of 1026 SCI AYA 1026edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.242554], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["Voicover"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["Yasmine"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["All"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW09s", "TW15", "TW24TW08"]}, "1022": {"text": " You're going to test and be coming up here for materials. Okay, go.\n You just follow the lines.\n If, no, if the lines, if red lines are drawn on a white piece of paper, the termites will follow the lines.\n We should draw, like a bunch of different circles and different colors and see which one they follow.\n  And we'll make it like this.\n Well, it's not going to be on a circle.\n  It can be like this and see if they'll follow that circle.\n  Yeah.\n  Would that be a good, may I bother you with this?\n  I'm just covering them up.\n  What are you saying?\n  Yeah, well beside this one. If termites... we'll place on a red piece, on a white piece of paper with a red circle and red lines, then the termites will follow the lines, in the circle.\n Okay, so you're going to use the color red line again. What color paper would you use?\n White.\n White paper?\n Yeah.\n And I think since we've already used colored paper, I think that's a result of that.\n Well, again you could do yours and yours and tie them together. Use different colored papers, so what's the point of your test?\n That depending on the colored paper we'll determine what the termites sight can do.\n I would think it's the color of the line because that's what they're following.\n So, you think they're following the color of the line?\n  Yes.\n Yeah, but when they went to the end of the white paper, they went to the black and they came right back.\n  Well, no, that's because they knew what it was, that's because I, like, kept hitting them back.\n  Okay, so you're kind of going along with the idea of color. How could you prove that color was...\n That color effects their...\n  You draw a bunch of different circles, draw a bunch of circles about the exact same size, but of different colors and see which one they go to?\n I like that.\n Nice, okay.\n On a white piece of paper?\n  Yeah.\n Again I've got colored paper. The more tests you do, the more accurate your results would be.\n All right, so let's do the same test but on two different types of paper. So, if termites are placed on a white piece of paper...\n  Put that on top of it just so we block some of the light out. No, that down. Good, and there you go. So, what were we thinking about testing?\n Um, putting tables in line using different color.\n And to see if, we're not going to finish the circle and see if they follow it around.\n  Oh, very nice.\n Yeah, because we drew a line leading back to the thing and they followed it down.\n  They followed it down...\n  Tricky, okay.\n  They went, it's true.\n  So they didn't follow this part?\n  Yeah, because it curves.\n  No, because they...\n  We drew the circle.\n  They go, like, then they curve and go down.\n  And they came here and went back up. They all followed.\n  Hmm, interesting. Thank you, four. You've got about two more, about a minute and a half actually. What are we thinking? I'm going to go ahead and cover these up.\n We were planning on doing, um, like, we think they're attracted to the ink and I'm going to test it with like a marker, a pen, and a crayon.\n  Okay.\n To see if, like, if they follow the ink better than the other ones.\n Nice, would you use the same color of ink?\n Yeah, because it would be the control.\n  There you go, very nice? Um, what color paper are you going to use?\n Should we use regular?\n White.\n I would say white yeah.\n All right, good. Okay, sounds good. Where are your termites? Stop playing with them and we're going to actually cover them to kind of get the light out. What were you guys thinking about testing?\n Mainly, if they are going to follow the red line, then they must be attracted to red.\n  They must be attracted to what?\n  Red.\n  Red? Okay, so how could you test that they are just attracted to red?\n We're going to make two large circles.\n  Two large circles...\n  And some other lines.\n  And some other lines...\n But, what are you testing again?\n If they go to the red line then they must be attracted to red.\n Okay, so you're talking about the color red. Um, would you use, so you tell me what you're going to set up. I'm trying to follow.\n  Probably just a black one and a red one.\n Lines or circles?\n  Circles.\n Circles? Okay, all right.\n Yeah, basically just for fun.\n  Okay, okay, just for fun, all right. Um, you should be collecting materials. If pens and things aren't working, let me know.\n \n  Dude, get the line.\n  What happened to your situations?\n Well we put tape over this and now it doesn't follow it over here.\n  I think they like the color red.\n  None of them are following any of these lines.\n  How could you continue to test that they like the color red?\n  Put more red over here?\n  I mean, we also put the tape there and it doesn't like the tape. It gets confused.\n  And we have the red paper and it didn't follow the black lines.\n  Or the pencil.\n  Yeah, that's what I mean.\n  None of them here are even doing anything.\n  They get tired and just start standing there twitching.\n  Do you need some new ones? No, there are still pretty lively.\n  Yeah.\n  So, what are some of the conclusions that you're thinking? Oh, Terrance, be sweet.\n  Ah, be sweet.\n  Ah, white on red.\n  They only like that. Also they only follow that type of pen. They don't follow any other type of pen or pencil. Um, they don't necessarily have an affiliation to red.\n  Okay, how do you know that?\n 'Cause they walked off the red paper?\n  Okay, they walked off the red paper? So, you threw that one out. How could you continue to say that they like that particular pen, and not having to do red?\n  We tried black pen.\n  We haven't tried another color on white yet.\n  See look, it stopped at the tape.\n  It's confused at the tape.\n  No, Neal, what I asked you is that a pen or a marker? It's a pen.\n  It's a pen.\n  Oh, he's following the other...\n  We drew it on the other side...\n  We drew a circle on the other side.\n  It looked like he was following it.\n  Is it something inside of them?\n  No.\n  Like, what the ink's made out of?\n  How could you test that?\n  Using the red pen on this?\n  Okay.\n  Taking two different pens...\n  Go grab some more. That's a good idea.\n Red color pen, red color pencil.\n You killed the ant...\n  Gentlemen, be nice to your termites.\n  Oh, oh, wait... wait?\n  Here Neal, let's get...\n  All right, group, here's a red pen, colored pencil.\n  Oh, look! That one's alive!\n  Okay, now then, so what are you saying is going on?\n They're still following the red one. Yeah, they're still following the red pen. So, it's not necessarily an affiliation to the color red.\n  So, it is something inside the ink.\n  So, how can you test if it's something inside the ink?\n I just got the other colored pencil.\n  Take another red pen.\n  Go grab some.\n  It's right there.\n  That's a pencil.\n  It's the color red, look.\n  Stick with the, no, you just threw out the idea that it's red. Stick with the color... stick with the pen idea.\n  We need a pen like this.\n  No, I think we have the exact same pen.\n  No, no, the blue one like this.\n  They have a blue one like that?\n  Go see, there's blue pens up there.\n  Hey, can we borrow a red pen? I meant blue, you know what I meant.\n  Bam, it's a different type of pen.\n  It's all right.\n  Different type of pen, but it's blue now.\n  Did you get a blue one?\n  No, I just got red ones. I got bundles. \n  Nice.\n  Now they're going to follow it.\n  Now, I thought we were going to get away from the red idea and go with the pen.\n  I think it's that pen.\n  I've got the same pen.\n  They're still the red. I think they are.\n  Okay, try that one.\n  There's a hole there, by the way. If you press through it, it will break.\n  Go.\n  Are you going to make it intercept the line?\n  Yeah I'm going to.\n  Oh, look, he's following the little one.\n  Maybe it likes circles.\n  Wait, wait.\n  I still think it's something inside the ink.\n  Draw a square. See if it follows a square.\n  So, that would be able, you would be able to throw out your idea that it likes circles if you drew the square. So draw a square, see what happens.\n  Yeah, draw a square.\n  I've got another black pen. I have all these pens.\n \n  Why not draw the square inside of there?\n  Inscribe the square in the circle. Terms...terminology.\n  You're a professor now.\n  Oh, it's following it!\n  It is the pen.\n  Curves are easier.\n  It didn't know where the line was.\n  Okay, five, four.\n  Um, we drew different lines in the different types of pens, markers, colored pencils.\n  Did you do it all on the same page or on different pages?\n On different colored pages.\n  Why would you do it on different colored pages?\n  Ah, to make sure the tests varied?\n  Okay, did you use the same color of ink on each page? Describe to me your experiment web. The whole group can chime in too.\n  Um, like we drew, like a black circle on a black sheet of paper.\n  Okay.\n  To see if they could only like...\n  Please don't be rude.\n  Black circle on a black sheet of paper. Keep going, what else?\n  And that didn't work. They could not see it or follow it or anything so we decided to go with an experiment that Christian came up with, that take a white piece of paper and we drew, like,  every kind of color their was all at once and they seemed to only the follow the blue or red circles. None of the other colors.\n What were the blue and the red circles drawn with?\n  I believe different types of stuff. Mainly pen though.\n And this was all on one sheet of paper?\n  Well, we tried it on different sheets too.\n Okay.\n  That's what started us off.\n Okay. Um, did you have it all on one sheet at first?\n Yeah.\n Okay, what did you realize was wrong with that?\n They were pretty much getting confused.\n As in we're going to have issues with what? Maintaining?\n  A control?\n A control, good. Only one independent variable, nice. Um, Nick's group, how did you go through the indentation?\n We drew several circles using each of the utensils and then I think we placed the termites in the middle and they all sort of, if they weren't in the middle, sort of eating off of the wood or, like, just exploring around, they were following the pen.\n Okay, um, your indentation line, did you draw that with just pens, different types of pens, did you draw it with markers, did you draw it with a paper clip?\n We just used the same color but we used different things. Like we used pens, Vis-A-Vis, colored pencils, stuff like that.\n  Okay, and what was your conclusion with that?\n They followed the pen because we thought it was the one that had the most distinct indentation.\n  Because they came, the termites, into that line, because we saw them go up to the edge and because they would feel there is a drop, and I figured oh, well they must be blind because they can't see that there's a drop there.\n  Interesting point. Why might you have used a paper clip as well to create the indentation, instead of a pen?\n Because it wouldn't have shown a color, but it would have still left the same indentation as a pen.\n Okay, so any components within that pen, color, chemicals, type of pen, whatever, if you would have used the paper clip and then followed that indentation, you would have been able to do what? Pen verses paper clip.\n Pen would have looked, I think it would have looked...\n  The paper clip  would have looked deeper,\n but the thing is, like,  would it prove if you had it or not.\n  Had what or not?\n  If they followed the dent or not. Not just like, the color or the like, smell, or whatever.\n  Very good, very good. So, by using the paper clip to create the indentation, they would have been able to rule out any type of color from the pen that left the indent, maybe the scent from the pen, the chemical from the pen that left the indent. By doing the paper clip just by itself, we would have been able to say okay, that obviously doesn't leave any chemicals, it doesn't leave any color, and if they're following that indentation, we know that that's what they are drawn too. Okay? Carly, your group had an interesting set up.\n Um, we, well we kind of did two.\n  All right.\n But the first one, we have like a black piece of paper and we bordered it with, like, white pieces of paper and we drew a white circle in the black piece of paper to see if they would go away from the white to go to the darker paper. And that didn't really work, so we did the other one and, um, with, like, the different colors of circles on a white piece of paper, and they only went on the red pen one.\n  Okay, what could have been a variable in your experiment that you just described? As in something that might have thrown off the results?\n Paper? I don't know.\n  Well, notice in one of the experiments you used a what, to create the circle?\n The pen.\n  Okay, you used a pen and in the other experiment you used a what?\n Paper?\n  But you used a... Oh, white, yeah, you used a white colored pencil. So, by using a colored pen and then a white colored pencil, what are those two things now? Added on what?\n  Variables.\n  Added on variables. Okay, for one you're using pen and pencil, another you're using colors. So, how could you have made your experiment a little bit more definite that would of maybe ruled out some of the other variables? Gentlemen, calm down.\n We could have used colored pencils the whole time.\n Okay, could have used the same color colored pencil the whole time. Good. Um, what group haven't I talked to? Matthew, explain to us the set up of your group.\n Do you want to start?\n I don't know what to say.\n Oh, okay then we started off thinking that they followed the color and so we drew with a different type of pen and it did not follow it, so we decided maybe it's not color. So, we took a black pen, a big one. Um, we took a black pen,  and then two red pens of different type, and two blue pens of different type, and they only followed the specific type of pen red and blue. It was the BIC pens, so we decided there must be something in that, in the chemical structure of that ink that's, you know, similar to some sort of pheromone of some sort. Um, and the termites followed it.\n Okay, um, did you think of the pheromone thing yesterday?\n Yeah.\n After school.\n That was extracurricular.\n  All right so...\n But we figured out the BIC pens. We figured that out.\n Okay, good. Excellent set up there. Were there any variables that, when I was over there earlier you had different shapes with the different pens?\n You got this?\n Yeah, we were drawing with different shapes 'cause it followed the circle and then we were trying to get them back inside the thing. So, we drew a line pointing down there so they would follow it. And they did follow it but then we realized it might not be the shape, it might be in the pen or the color.\n  They don't really like sharp angles though. We drew a square and they got lost.\n  Yeah.\n They couldn't find the angle.\n  Okay, interesting. So, um, if any of you did do any sort of research , you were able to find that the pheromone that termites emit, and we learned that those were what? Pheromones?\n  Enzymes.\n Enzymes, not enzymes. What are pheromones having to do with? We just spent three days on it.\n  Animal behavior.\n Animal behavior, communication, their chemical signals. Okay, so we learned that termites emit these pheromones. We might have encountered this last time and that's the same thing why ants follow a specific trail. Um, when honeybees sense danger, they emit a warning pheromone that tells everybody in the hive to freak out, that danger's coming. But the pheromone that termite's emit to have them follow each other in the hole trails and all of that, the chemical in that mimics or the chemical in the pen, in Bic and PaperMate pens actually, mimics the chemical in the pheromones, which is why they followed certain pens.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 1022 SCI AYA 1022 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.000264962], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Neal"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Students"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW06s", "TW09s"]}, "840": {"text": " Tell them what you wrote. Describe your three pictures, and then they're going to share what they saw, and the three pictures they picked.\n \n The cat.\n I picked the roller coaster.\n Man.\n What did you get for what ?\n I only did two.\n \n I think the Earth .\n \n Y'all did the roller coaster?\n  Max, is that possible? Why not, what did you write?\n  There's no gravity.\n  So, in that picture he's weightless, but where is he?\n  In front of a building.\n  So, he's on a planet, right?\n  Yeah.\n  So, what should happen, if this was a video and we saw the next two seconds of that video?\n  He's falling?\n  He should fall, right? All right, write that down next to that picture.\n \n I don't mean to do that.\n  All right, so let's look at the roller coaster.\n He couldn't even fall like that because you got the gravity pushing down, so that's why why he wouldn't fall like that. And that's either like, strange stuff. But I don't think he could fall like that.\n Unless he... .\n He can't fall like that. That's impossible. Get his weight, and . Yeah, exactly, 'cause he can't do that. Yeah, 'cause you can see his shadow under that. And don't think he, I think he got like a hoop or something. So, like a little string or something.\n Or like, he fall?\n Yeah, 'cause he can't do that. They must have took that while he was. 'Cause that's impossible. Earth's gravity pulling him like that. Unless he in space or something.\n \n  All right, so why would he fall?\n Because the force of gravity pushing down.\n  So, why would he fall that way and not fall that way?\n The gravity would push him down, and not up, so . There's like, there's gravity on Earth, so like if you consider, like how Newton found the apple when it fell to the ground.\n  Okay, so you know there's something going on that's pulling you down. And you say, \"What if you were on the \"other side of the Earth?\" Would it be pulling you up then? If you were on the other side? Or, would it still pull you down to the ground?\n It would still pull you down  to the ground.\n  All right, so on the planet, what can we say about gravity? Where is it trying to pull you?\n To the center.\n Ah, to the center, so it doesn't matter where you stand, it's not pulling you down, it's just trying to pull you where?\n To the center.\n To the center, okay. All right, one more minute for sharing. Make sure you have three pictures described on your T-chart. If you need to borrow an idea from your neighbor, do that now.\n  And you got the Solar System? Okay so, it says planets can move because of gravity. Where are they moving?\n \n   around the sun. And what has them go in a circle and not flying away? All right, who would like to share what they wrote with their group? Their favorite one, their favorite picture? All right, Arquel, which one was your favorite picture?\n  The roller coaster.\n Roller coaster, who picked roller coaster? All right, so let's all look at the roller coaster. And Arquel, tell us what your team wrote down and Sarah will add it to our list.\n  We had put that the gravity brings the speed to the... to the roller coaster. So, if you wanted to make the speed increase, you would want to bring your hill higher. So, therefore the... the speed will increase and it'll go faster.\n  All right, so Arquel says that gravity makes roller coasters go faster? So, if you want a faster roller coaster, you need to build a higher roller coaster. Did anybody write anything different for roller coaster? Carlos, what did you write?\n  Oh, the same thing, but the steepness of the hill when it's going down it increases its velocity, and it's more G's.\n  All right, so he says the steeper the hill, more velocity, more G's. What's a G? Let's have Carlos try first, then we can help him out if he needs help. What's a G? You said G.\n  Yeah. A G is a pull.\n Okay, so it's a pull. Adriana, you want to add to it?\n It's a force pushing against you.\n All right, pushing against you. Anybody else want to add to that? It's a pull, its a force, it's pushing against you. How do we get a G force? What do you think, Austin?\n  You have a push or pull, you have excess friction, air accelerates.\n Push or pull, excess friction. Arquel?\n All the forces together.\n All the forces put together on you? Okay. So, let's write \"G force\" down and put a question. 'Cause we're still not sure what that is, maybe we can get there. So, we're not sure quite what a G is. But we know it has something to do with gravity. All right, let's pick another picture. Who had a favorite picture that we haven't talked about that wasn't a roller coaster? What was your favorite picture, Greg?\n  The dude.\n The dude, who is the dude?\n \n He has a name. We know who that is. Who is that, Enrique?\n  Johnson.\n  It was Newton, right? What was Newton's first name? Not John.\n  Isaac?\n  Issac, there we go. Issac Newton, all right. And what does the dude say? Isaac Newton? What's he saying? What's his quote?\n  Not that dude, this one.\n Oh, the floating dude. Okay, the floating dude. He'd rather talk about the floating dude above Isaac Newton. Okay, so let's look at the guy floating in the middle of the air. He looks like he's planking. Is this a possible picture if you just saw the picture?\n  No.\n Greg, why do you say this is impossible? Because the Earth's gravitational pull, right?\n Okay, so he says the Earth's gravitational pull, what?\n Like, this wouldn't work because when you pull... .\n Okay, he should be being pulled down to the center of the Earth. Why do you say the center?\n 'Cause that's where the gravitational pull's coming from.\n 'Cause that's where all the gravity wants to take you and that's where all the gravity's coming from, I like that answer. Anybody want to add to it? Vanessa.\n  But if you have pressure against both forces, you could possibly stay up longer?\n Okay, so how could you get pressure to make you stay up longer? Chloe?\n  Force?\n  Where would that force come from?\n Your body?\n  So, how could he, if he's not touching the ground, make himself float? What's underneath you that you don't see?\n  Gravity?\n Well, we don't see gravity, but what's underneath him? It's around us right now.\n  Air?\n The air, right? So, let's think about the air. If we could make the air thicker, what would we also increase?\n  The gravity?\n  Not the gravity, we're trying  to go against the force of gravity.\n  The weight? The force against our weight. What's that called, let's think about a boat. Floating in the water.\n  Bouyance? Bouyant force, right? So, if you could increase the bouyant force of the air, and Vanessa said if you could make that strong enough, you should be able to float. Does anyone know a planet where there's more thick clouds than we have here? It's our neighbor.\n  Mars.\n He has clouds? Who has clouds, who has thick clouds? Jarissa?\n Venus?\n Venus. Yeah, is that what you were going to say? Venus has super thick clouds, right? And if we could go there, maybe there'd be enough air underneath you, that you could float in the air. If they was pushing enough bouyant force on your body, okay? All right, anymore for the floating guy? Did anybody write anything different for the guy who looked like he was floating in the air? I know that Karima and Anthony had a good answer. What did you guys write down Anthony?\n Put that... I put that the gravity will pull you to the center of the Earth, and it will like... Like it would...\n  It pulls you to the center of the Earth, and what did we decide about where you stand on Earth?\n Like on the other side?\n  So, what would happen if you went to the other side of the Earth? Would it still pull you the same way? Or is it going to pull you an opposite way?\n The same way.\n  The same way, where is it always going to pull you?\n Down.\n  Towards the center?\n  To the center, to the middle, okay? It doesn't matter what planet you stand on, doesn't matter where you are, it's trying to take you to the center of the object, okay? So, why do we get stuck to the Earth, and that the Earth's stuck to us in this picture?\n 'Cause the Earth's solid and it doesn't let us go out into the .\n Okay, so he said the Earth is solid. Are we solid?\n  Yes. Hmm, okay, so maybe it's not that we're solid, 'cause maybe there's something else going on. What do you think, Carlos?\n  The Earth has more mass than us.\n  The Earth has more mass than us. Jenny, what's mass?\n  Mass is, well, all of us then?\n  We all have it. How would you give a definition of mass, what is it about us?\n  The type of weight?\n  It's the type of weight. Okay, we're on the right track. Who wants to help her out? What's mass?\n  The amount of density?\n  Amount of density. Okay, we're getting better. Jarissa?\n The amount of space that it takes.\n  Well, what would that be, what's your space? Volume, okay? So, space is volume. We're still trying to figure out what's mass? We've heard some density words, we've heard volume words, what do you think, Ky?\n The amount of electrons?\n  Oh, we're getting closer. So, it's your electrons, your...?\n  Atoms?\n  Ah, your atoms. So, it's how many atoms you have inside your body. That's your mass. So, now someone else said weight, so let's go back to that. How do you get weight? So, you stand on the scale. How do you know your weight? What is going on? What do you think Hakeem?\n  Pounds?\n  We measure it in pounds? Okay, so how do me measure it? How do you get pounds? What's happening to your mass? What happens when you stand on the scale? What is it measuring?\n  Your weight.\n  Your weight. So, then how do we figure that out? What's going on? What's going on on a scale? Carlos.\n  The gravity is pushing you down?\n  Gravity is pushing you down. So, what happens to your weight, if you have more mass?\n  You're heavier?\n You're heavier. So, your weight, how would we give a description of weight now? We know mass is how many atoms you have. We know volume is how much space you take up. So, now what's weight? Carlos has kind of said it for us. How would we put it as a definition? It's the pull of what on your mass?\n  Gravity?\n Pull of gravity. So, let's look at the guy in the picture again. If this was going to be true, what would we have to say about his mass to be able to float? Would he be allowed to have a mass on Earth? Hakeem says \"no,\" Vanessa says \"yes.\" If you're going to float, and there's gravity, always trying to pull you down, in order to float, what do we have to do? With our mass? Decrease our mass, okay? So, let's think about if we go to another planet with our weight. Does your mass change if  you go to another planet?\n  Yes, no.\n Do all of a sudden, you have more atoms in you?\n  No.\n  Depending on the gravity.\n What did you say?\n  You have the same atoms, but your weight and mass changes.\n You said the same amount of atoms, so your weight and mass changes. But if you have the same amount of atoms, isn't your mass the same?\n  Yeah.\n Okay, so what's the only thing that would change, Jarissa?\n  The gravity.\n The gravity, so then what would that change about your weight? Would it change, or would it stay the same?\n  It would change.\n  It will change. So, what can we say if we went to a smaller planet?\n  You'll become lighter.\n  You'll become lighter. Why?\n  Because it has less gravity.\n Has less gravity, so less pull. You weight less, okay? So, let's put \"weightless\" next to \"G force\" as another word we should look up. Ready? All right, so, what I want you to do now, using all your notes that we just took and what we just talked about, I want you to flip your paper over. And in the circle, I would like you to try with your partner, to write a definition for what you think gravity is. I'll give you one minute. You and your partner try to figure out what you think the definition of gravity is, and write that in your circle back.\n  Make sure you guys share that, okay?\n  A lot of weight, or... What's the other word of how many atoms you have? What's it pulling on? Very good, so it pulls on your mass. And think about where it's trying to pull. Oh, that's a good definition.\n  of gravity, try to write your definition on your paper. Make sure your neighbor also has a definition on their paper.\n  Pulls what? Pulls the...\n  Weight?\n  You almost said it.\n  Mass?\n  Mass.  Make sure you guys share that, okay? You guys done? Okay, so what is gravity? It's a force, so that means it's a what?\n  A...\n  A short pull? Gravity's pulling us, right? Okay, so what's, so what do you think, is it pushing or pulling?\n  Pushing.\n  Pulling.\n  Ooh, we have a disagreement. Better figure out which ones right.\n  Okay, so it's a pull. So, where is it trying to take you to?\n  And what is it trying to take about? Your... Your definition. All right, what are you having?\n I wrote that gravity is an invisible force that pushes or pulls you towards the center.\n  Okay, so the word I want you to make sure we say is \"invisible.\" 'Cause we'll talk about that, okay? All right, so let's share our definitions. Who would like to share their definition first? All right, Ky.\n  We put gravity is a force that always brings you to the middle.\n  All right, Gravity is a force that always brings you to the middle. So Sarah, can you add that to the circle? Arquel, what did you guys write?\n  Gravity is a pulling force that brings you to the center of the Earth, and it wants to  the mass.\n  Okay, so you added \"mass\" to that. Okay, so it's pulling on mass. What do you want to add Angel?\n I want to add to Kyle's answer that it's invisible.\n  Invisible. So, let's think about what we learned about forces. If it's invisible, you can't see it. Is it touching you?\n  Yes.\n Or is it everywhere?\n  It's everywhere.\n Everywhere. So, is it a contact force, or a non-contact force?\n  Non-contact.\n Why do you say that, Israel?\n  Because it's not touching you.\n It's not touching you. So, even if you're floating in outer space, will gravity still be there?\n  Yes.\n What do you think, Carlos?\n  Yes. You say \"yes.\" So, those astronauts, will they still feel some gravity? Even though they're out at the space station? What do you think, Angel?\n Outer space has some gravity, but greater than, that's why they wouldn't feel it.\n What do you think it depends on? We have mass so far. But the strength of gravity also depends on something else. We have mass, but what could it also depend on, Vanessa?\n  Force?\n Okay, gravity is a force. Angel was getting there, he was saying that it's still pulling on you, it's just not as strong.\n  The weight?\n That's mass. We talked about mass and weight. Trying to get the other thing that's going to control gravity.\n  How big the planet is?\n Okay, so that's mass. Let's think about the astronauts who are not as close to the Earth. Are they weightless? They have the same amount of mass, their mass didn't change. But they went farther away from the Earth. So, why are they weightless? Why do they float? What's the other factor going on with gravity? Moving away from the center of the Earth. So, what do we call that? Has to do with how the gravitational pull depends on... We have mass, and we're looking for the other factor we could change to change gravity. What do you guys think? If I'm really far away from Jarissa, am I able to grab her as much as if I was closer?\n  No.\n If I go real close to her, is it easier for me to pull on her?\n  Yes.\n But what happens if I go far away? I have the same mass, my mass doesn't change, can I reach her as easily now?\n  No.\n So, what's the other thing going on with gravity?\n  Distance?\n Distance. So, if you're far away from the Earth, can gravity pull on you as hard?\n  No.\n No. But the closer you get, the little bit stronger, little bit stronger. So, then why do we feel the pull of gravity here on Earth, but I don't feel the Sun?\n  We're closer to the Earth than we are the Sun. So, we're going to feel the Earth before we would feel the Sun. But now if we left the planet, we started going somewhere else, say I was going to Mars. What would happen the closer I got to Mars? Who would start pulling me now?\n  Mars.\n The Mars center of its planet would start to pull me. Okay? So let's look at the picture of the planets. Thinking about pulling to the center, why in the picture of the planets is the Sun in the middle of all the planets?\n  Because it's the biggest.\n  Oh, it's the biggest one.\n We got a couple of different answers, so let's share with our neighbor first. See if you know why the sun is in the center. You got 30 seconds.\n It's got the biggest mass.\n It got the biggest mass, and it's the biggest. So like, it got the most gravitational pull. That's why it's in the middle.\n \n  All right, Marco. Why do you think the Sun is in the center of our solar system?\n Because... I don't know.\n  You don't know. Okay, Javier, what do you think? You're his partner, what did you guys talk about? Based on what we just talked about, why would the Sun go in the center?\n It has more mass?\n  It has more mass. So, what does it also have more?\n  Gravity. So, he's always going to be in the middle, right? What if we had a bigger star come our way? Like what about a black hole? Say one of our neighbors blew up.

Yeah.\n Well, sometimes in the mountains, they have places where the snow has melted and there are actually small lakes or ponds up inside the mountains. So you could actually either be looking at a lake where you could drive up to or something that's hidden in the mountains. So if you're calm, that's a pretty good idea. All right, guys, what are y'all working on now.\n We're on judging the building. I keep working on one.\n Okay. Can you tell me what you have about interpretation?\n I think of this art as a rainy day. The sky is a dull gray.\n I like the bright colors on the doors.\n It's like a mixture of happiness and boredom. Since it looks like it's raining, the dark clouds at the top of the painting when it goes from white to dark.\n Like from light and it's going to dark, that's when you can tell it's about to rain.\n Okay, gotcha, gotcha. Sounds good.\n That, sir, is my interpretation.\n Okay, and with judgment, what are y'all think about the work of art right now?\n My judgment of the art is that it's kind of a boring day. It's slightly dull but you don't know what's about to happen.\n Sounds good so far. Keep working. Y'all doing all right over here?\n Yeah, we're doing...\n I wrote my opinion. Now he's gonna write his opinion.\n Yeah.\n And then Brody will write his opinion? Sounds great.\n All right. Y'all on interpretation. What y'all had? Oh, y'all are each doing interpretation?\n Yes, sir. We were going to do that for judgment and interpretation.\n Sounds great. And what are y'all looking at now for interpretation with the subway painting?\n We're doing what it makes you feel.\n Okay, what do you have so far?\n Well, he wrote most of them.\n Okay, so he can read it?\n Okay, actually it makes me feel like traveling...\n Okay.\n ...since they're on a train. And that's pretty much it.\n All right. Who would like to tell me what they are thinking of for interpretation on valley flowers?\n I don't know. I mean, it's a good painting but it's not really my favorite.\n Okay.\n It's not very exciting.\n So that would be for judgment? You don't find it exciting? Okay, kind of boring. What do you think of the work of art?\n I think it's a bit dull because there's not really any colors or anything like that, and it's got the same colors where each... Right here is green, and right here is orange, and blues back there.\n You know, if I was using my imagination, I would think of maybe The Incredibles in where the mole men came up at the end and were taking over the Earth. So these could be tunnel boring machines.\n,  Start using the principles of design, okay? So you look at the packet for the principles of design. With the principles of design, you gonna be telling me what you see in the work of art. So instead of shapes, you may be telling me, what's something you see in your work of art. You've got \"Gold Is Where You Find It.\" What's one thing you see in the work of art?\n  Gold.\n  You see gold, what else do you see?\n  The miner.\n  Miner, and what is the miner doing?\n  Drilling.\n  Drilling, okay, so those would be all stuff that you see in the work of art. So go ahead and start on the second part with analysis, if you're ready to start on that. \n  Alright, are we doin' alright here?\n  Yeah, we don't get how was the work created.\n  Okay, you may have actually answered that when you were up here. If you look at the packet right here, and the title of the work of art is \"The Sky Pond.\" read the rest for me? Who it was who created it?\n  Kauvar--\n  Kauvar--yeah, close enough.\n  Smith--\n  Smith.\n --Born: Cape--Ugh, this is hard.\n  If you can't pronounce it, just do the best you can.\n  Giradeau, Missouri-- Missouri, 1893. Died: Denver, Colorado, 1977. Oil on canvas.\n  Uh! What did you say?\n  Oil on canvas.\n  Is how it was created and it was about, this size right here, okay? So that tells you how the work of art was created. Later on, you're gonna look at why the work of art was created, and what purpose it served. \n  Yes?\n  What do I say, how--\n  I know what we do! It says, if they draw it in three-dimensional--\n  Okay.\n  And they take some kind of colored pencil, or painting, and then sketch it like you do, and then they go from dark to light.\n  Yeah.\n  And, then they make the texture from, the sun is over here, and there's a little bit of shade because, this would be covering all this. There would be a shade right here. So it's over here, it would be lighting everything on this side of the tree,\n  Yeah.\n  and this side of the house, roof, and that side of the house.\n  And you've got, are these shapes back here? Or are those somethin' else?\n  These are shapes.\n  Okay, are shapes flat or three-dimensional?\n  Three-dimensional.\n  Shape forms are three-dimensional, alright?\n  Oh yeah.\n  Yeah.\n  So those are forms?\n  So those are forms, yeah. But you were right about everything, You were right about the sun, you were right about the texture, the shading, everything, that's really good. So you can tell a little about this on how you think the work was made, and also relate it to playing with your pen on your finger, and also oil on canvas. Continue working, please.  Alright, so y'all are on analysis now? And what work of art do y'all have? Y'all have got \"Subway.\" Alright, so what are y'all lookin' at in the Subway for analysis so far?\n  It's something, asymmetrical balance.\n  It's asymmetrical balance?\n  Yeah.\n  There are three types. You've got symmetrical balance, when everything is exactly the same, you've got asymmetrical balance when it's weighted the same. So there's the same amount of weight visually. It's not exactly the same. And then you've got radial symmetry, which is a project we did a little bit earlier. Okay? Good. \n  So, is it saying that shapes, especially right here, these shapes are more rounded versus straight and flat. 'Cause these are more 3-D than these. These kind of have shadows and are free. So, we were saying how that makes the consistence more complex than the simpleness of the, outside factors, I guess?\n  Yes, mm-hmm. Good! Keep going. Alright.\n  Would this be water?\n  That is possibly water right there. Yes it is. And what part are y'all on? Y'all are on the analysis right now? Okay. And y'all are lookin' at the \"Valley Farms\" by Rose Dickinson? Okay, cool. So what do y'all have so far for analysis?\n  Colors from the scene go together, it can show--\n  Could you speak a little louder? Sorry.\n  Colors from the scene go together. It can show, a straight web is going along the farm with the bridge in there. A small fire is going on, with smoke coming from the flames. Smoke is coming from the mountains.\n  Sounds good, keep going. Alright, let's check in over here. How are y'all doin'?\n  Good.\n  Okay, wow, y'all have got a lot for an analysis.  Alright, what else do you have? So y'all are about ready to start on analysis?\n  Yes, sir.\n  Okay, so let's look here. Now tell me how all the answers from the description you just made, are related to each other, i.e., how the effects were organized, complement one another, or create harmony or distress. This step can often be the most confusing, because it is very similar to the first, and can easily overlap. A good suggestion is think about all the principles of art: movement, rhythm, variety, portion, emphasis, and balance, and contrast work together, okay? So think about how they work together to create this work of art, and tell me everything you see in the work of art, but not by shape and colors. Alright.\n  The shapes and colors of the background create a texture that will--\n  What?\n  A texture--\n  What?\n  The--  The shapes and colors of the background, create a texture that will--\n  Like he is actually drilling near a cave.\n  Creative.\n  Now, would you say, these warm colors or cool colors?\n  Warm\n  Warm, way warm.\n  Warm? Now why would you say they're warm colors?\n  'Cause they're darker.\n  They're darker? Okay.\n  It shows that the colors of the background...\n  Yeah.\n  Now something else. Does it look like he blends into the background?\n  No.\n  He doesn't?\n  Yeah, uh-huh.\n  Okay, so think about that too. If he stood out, he would look like he maybe didn't belong, but it kind of looks like he belongs there. I like what you said, keep working. I'll be back in a minute to check on you. Alright, Guys. Turn around. Alright, what are y'all workin' on now? Analysis?\n Analysis.\n  What do y'all have for analysis so far, Patrick?\n  I didn't get that. I got one for variety and balances.\n  Okay, so something is different from this picture. Can you just read to me what you have so far, please?\n  Something's different from this top picture, because the floor is green beneath the room, because it's different, because I thought, I thought the floor's just one color, so that's why it's different.\n  Okay, that's good, and it's also different from up here. You could say that there's a contrast. Let's look for the definition of contrast in here. Do you all know what the definition of contrast is, or what contrast is?\n  Two things are very different from--\n  I was on balance, I'm on balance now.\n  Okay, so contrast is what? One more time, I'm sorry.\n  Two things that are very different, and have a large contrast.\n  Okay, so would you say cool colors and warm colors have a strong contrast?\n  Yeah, because they're bright colors and they give out perspective.\n  What about the two Cs?\n  Okay, two C's, so? Keep going. Alright, what part are y'all on now? Analysis? And y'all have got \"The Subway\", okay? So, can you read to me what you have, or tell me something that you haven't added, but you were about to?\n  Jaymen's adding that.\n  Okay.\n  I wanna add, it has radial balance, because you can kinda see where the center print is, and then you can kind of see all these people, all these stuff.\n  Okay, now I have a question. Have y'all seen that there's a commercial on a few months ago?\n  It's a radio commercial!\n  Yeah!\n  The TV, where she's sitting in the train, and she's watching the TV, someone's reading the newspaper and she's watching the TV? And she steps out, and it looks like they may have gotten the idea, from that ad, from this work of art, 'cause there's lots of people on the train car, they're reading newspapers and she steps into the future, by actually reading her's on a Samsung Galaxy or something like that. So that'd be a good connection to popular culture, okay?\n  Hello, I was just \n  Which one we were talkin' about earlier? Okay, sounds good. What's up? Okay. Alright, what ya on? Okay, what added, or what  have y'all gotten to since I was last over here?\n  We see the ocean behind the mountains, green grass is covering the farmland, and the lines on the mountains are curved, not pointed. The mountains are curved.\n  Okay.\n  The houses are spread apart, the sky is a light green-blue.\n  Sounds good, and it sounds like y'all are just about finished with analysis, so are y'all gonna be moving on to interpretation next? Okay.\n  Yeah.\n  Active listening, right hand. Active listening, left hand. Ladies and gentlemen, a lot of people are having really great and meaningful discussions in the groups, but please remember that we are all doing different works of art, studying them, and we're also discussing them together. So that everybody's able to work without yelling across, can we take it down just a notch, a little bit, please? Keep it a little bit lower? I'm not telling you to whisper, and I'm not telling you to stop what you're doing, 'cause your doing a great job. Just let us take it down a notch, please. Keep working, please. Alright, how are y'all doin' over here?\n  We're doing really good.\n  Okay, what can you tell me about your analysis on this work of art?\n  It said that for the first question, well, the first thing, we said the artist Douglass Crockwell is using repetit-- well, is  repeating shapes and colors to create a visual image of the painting. And right now, we're writing, how classes are organized.\n  And how it's saying what we introduced for description.\n  Okay, now, with \"Paper Workers\", Now let's look at the workers. The workers, do they look like they stand out from the industry and from the industrial aspects of this work of art?\n  No.\n  They kind of look like they blend in. So could they actually be considered to be parts of the machinery?\n  Mhmm.\n  Okay, so that's something you may wanna think about when you're working on analysis, or when you switch over to interpretation in just a little bit. Can you go touch the keyboard to bring the Smart Board back on, please? Alright, what are y'all workin' on now?\n  I don't know.\n  You don't know, okay. You don't know what principles you've covered, or you don't know what aspect of the painting you're working on right now?\n  We're working on analysts, and so far we've covered how the miner and the vat ground relate to each other. We covered what colors they have and how they can relate. We're about to work on shapes. Shapes are in there.\n  So let's think about texture, some.\n  Yeah, we are.\n  Look at the definitions, okay. And let's look at... I wouldn't look at space or balance, variety, and you may wanna look at the definitions of proportion, okay?\n  Okay, we are completely, totally, and absolutely, confused of analysis.\n  I'm not! You're just--\n  Analysis, okay.\n  I'm not!\n  I'm completely finished.\n  She's going all haywire.\n  Okay, what's wrong with analysis here?\n  I don't know.\n  Nothing!\n  Nothing's wrong with the analysis.\n  Nothing's wrong with analysis?\n  She's going haywire.\n  I do not understand what art is.\n  Active listening, right hand please. Active listening, left hand. Table four, please. Ladies and gentlemen, when we stopped a moment ago, because we had gotten too loud, let's take it down to a whisper now. That way everybody can hear themselves without getting too loud. So right now, let's take it to a whisper, for our discussions, please. Alright, with analysis what you're doing is you're looking at the principles of design. Don't worry about balance. Let's flip to the beginning. Now, let's look at texture. Do you have a texture in here?\n  Yeah.\n  And what kind of texture do you have?\n  Well it's really bumpy, but some of it is smoother, like a snow.\n  Okay, so that's what you could talk about in the analysis. Also in the analysis, with balance: is it asymmetrical, symmetrical, or radial? Now, symmetrical is when things are the same on both sides. Radial is when it's radiating out from a point, like a rim or a pizza. Is it either one of those? So, I'd look a little bit at asymmetrical balance, and then variety. I look at the definition, and then determine what variety you see in here, and after that, go ahead and move over to interpretation, okay? That way, if you're being frustrated, you don't have to get bogged down and worry about it, you can move to the next step. You might find that easier, okay? Keep going, thanks. Alright, so y'all are on interpretation now?\n  Yep.\n  Okay, what are y'all about to do for interpretation? Can someone read me the interpretation part?\n  Basically, how does the painting make you feel? What does it make you think of? Don't say you think a painting sucks, artwork sucks. That said, that goes in the next step. What do you think, What do you think the artist is trying to communicate to you as a viewer?\n  Okay, so let's bring the painting back over here so you can see it while you're working on the questions, and think about telling me a story, or what's going on. Now, does this look like you're in a cafeteria?\n  No.\n  Does it look like you're in a school?\n  Oh yeah.\n  No.\n  It looks like a barber shop.\n  Okay, and what does it look like is going on in the barber shop?\n  He's shaving, cutting someone's hair.\n  Now what about over here?\n  These guys are probably waiting for their turn.\n  Okay, that's what you need to tell me in interpretation. What all is going on, or everything the artist had within the work of art that tells a story. We're talking about the story that's created in the work of art. Alright, what part are y'all on, interpretation?\n  Yeah.\n  Okay, so...\n  It kind of makes me feel like...\n  It makes me feel sad.\n  It was, when I think of it before, and it really doesn't make me feel sad. I'm not really sure how it makes me feel, but I kind of think that maybe he was trying to say, it went from-- 'cause this is kind of simple.\n  Okay.\n  And I keep going back to the simple and complex for some reason. But, I think he was trying to say that maybe things were simpler, and it kind of got more modern.\n  I like that, I like that. And also, one thing that this makes me think of, is earlier this year, we studied the artist Jacob Lawrence, and one of his was a work of art of a guy on a train, controlling that with only industry in the background. With the big cog or wheel here, it kind of looks like a train over here, with industry in the background. But I like what you're saying about the calmer times, and the more difficult times, and I think that would be a great thing to have in your interpretation.\n  It doesn't look like a train, though.\n  Yeah.  Alright, how are y'all doing? Y'all doin' alright? Hey, what part are y'all workin' on now? Y'all got \"Valley Farm?\"\n  Yeah.\n  Yeah.\n  Interpretation.\n  Okay, what do y'all have so far for interpretation?\n  This painting makes us feel bright, but kind of boring. The smoke from the mountains make us wonder who is making it. We also wonder, \"Why is there a fire with nobody there?\"\n  Okay, sounds good. Ah, can you put your stool back up on two legs? One more time? Thanks. Alright, what are y'all on right now? Analysis, and y'all have moved on to interpretation?\n  Mhmm.\n  Sounds good. Active listening, right hand. Active listening, left hand. Right in here, we have about seven minutes left. This should give enough time for most everybody to finish their interpretation, and start on their judgment today. After you get finished with your interpretation, one thing I would like you to focus on, is why you think the work of art was created. Think about the time period, in which it was created, and why the artists were creating works of art. Think about your work of art particularly, and you'll be able to have a space on your paper to answer that, so continue working on what you're working on. We have about seven minutes. Next time you come in, what we're gonna be doing is we're gonna be working on presenting. So, those groups that have enjoyed this, will be able to look at the Smithsonian packet, find their information, add that to what they've been doing today, and then present on their findings regarding what they thought about the work of art along with what the historians thought about--\n", "filename": ["Copy of 151B ART EMC 151 B.srt.txt", "Copy of 151A ART EMC 151A edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.176577], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW04", "TW05", "TW09", "TW11", "TW13"]}, "102 ": {"text": "  First are your group activity, your group creations. Now, you all created, in your group--\n  Sorry.\n You created in your groups eight counts of dance that incorporated, in some form or fashion, the time step. I don't want - don't grade right now, just look, just watch the first one. \u266a  \u266a \u266a  \u266a What are you noticing? \u266a  \u266a\n,  Good, right? So I was telling you that these are the piece of bread and these were a piece of bread and I could have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on white bread, or I can have a peanut butter and jelly on wheat bread. We're going to keep the white bread for right now. Pop push. Then this made me laugh. Think about this as the heel of the bread.\n  I don't get it. \n  I'm glad to know that you're like \"I don't get it.\" There's a piece of bread and there's a heel of the bread--\n  Oh! \n  The butt of the bread?\n Yeah! Oh, that's why! Because you call it the \"butt of the bread\". Oh! But it's the heel of the bread. Ok so not so funny. \n  So we have pop push, step as our ingredient and then as our butt of the bread, good flap step dig, right? So today we're going to do pop push, step, good flap, step dig as a review on the right and on the left. And then we're going to do pop push, flap, we're going to add another ingredient, flap step dig. Okay? Flap step dig. Now remember--this-- is important, why?\n  It's the ingredient.\n  barely comes up, think about it.\n  Good flap because when you step flap means that it's two sounds to .\n  Boo ya! Remember it's two sounds and that's why you say \"Good flap\" and to get it up, she said, real high. Alright, everybody up,  spread out. Pop push. Pop push again is spank, kick. It's exactly what we did as warm up the one across the board. Put your right heel out. I need a good pop push. Ready and . I need a good step.  As we step, what do we do? What happens to the body?\n  We swing right.\n  We sure did, pick up that foot. Good flap,  step dig.  Alright, do it one more time. Let's do an echo. Let me do it. I'll do pop push, step, you do\n  Pop push, step.\n  I do good flap, step dig. You do--\n  Good flap, step dig.\n  Right, right. And I go.   Okay, I go.  \n Better. \n  Ok by now our muscle memory is either going \"I got it! I've worked it out\" or \"I don't got it\" and we need to correct it before it becomes muscle memory. So here's what I want you to do. Say \"Pop push step\".\n  Pop push step.\n  Good flap step dig.\n  Good flap step dig.\n  Pop push step.\n  Pop push step.\n  Good flap step dig.\n  Good flap step dig.\n  Pop push step.\n  Pop push step.\n  Good flap step dig.\n  Good flap step dig.\n  Right foot out. Six,  here you go. You take--\n  Pop push step\n  Good flap step dig.\n  Pop push step Good flap step dig.\n  You can do a shuffle. Pop push step Good flap step dig. You want to? Okay. \n  Not too bad! Look at y'all keep on going just like wonderful kids! Now let me take a dip. What I need you to do real quick: bunch up right here. Bunch up. Do me a favor and... bunch up right there. Do you body roll?\n  Not really.\n  Yeah you do. \n  No.\n  Sure you do. Ok well I got it wrong. You don't body roll but you will. You rock, you rock, knee right.  No?  Come on, right hand. Flap, step, dig. See you're doing this really well.  Alright point your leg, listen. We're going flap, step, dig.  Flap, step, dig. Ready? And right foot, step, flap step dig. Yes! \n  How is this group doing? Okay everybody look, everybody look! Here we go. Five, six oh you precious thing. Are you ready? Deep breaths. You need your right foot out. Six, ready, and pop push step. Good flap step dig. Almost, left foot. Pop push step Left foot, good flap step dig. Okay, let me tell you why. You're doing a shuffle. We do pop push, step, lift your foot up, good flap step dig, on left foot. Pop push step. Good flap, step dig. These were all two things. Okay, body roll. Do a body roll. Now you can't do a body roll back here.  Hold my hand. Here we go. Pop push. Step. Shift it over. Good, flap step dig, right here. Good flap step dig. Did you get all this? Again the right foot. Flex your toes. Good flap step dig. Good flap step dig.  bring it in. Oh, no you gotta body roll! Bring it in. Good flap step dig. That's better. And since the problem is your weight distribution it's back here and it's hard to do it like this. So you gotta do like this. Yeah? Okay. Alright, let me see the middle group. Middle group! Right foot out. Ready, oh sorry, I got all excited. You were ready. Six, ready, and pop push step. Yes, okay. Let's go pop push step, hold for a second, good flap step dig. Ready? Right foot. And pop push step, hold for a second, good flap step dig. Yes! Left foot, left, foot, left foot. Six, ready, and pop push step, good flap step dig. Almost, almost. I saw it on the right, do it on the left real quick. Left foot and... pop push, push your heel down. Base.  Let me hear some base, do it again. Pop push step, pick up that foot, good flap step dig. Good flap step dig. Left foot, good flap, come on baby.\n  With the lift?\n  With the lift. Oh sorry, my bad, my bad, to the right. Good flap, step dig. That's it!  Show some love, very nice! Alright this group, come on. Right foot out. Six, ready, and pop push step. Oh I got overachievers I love it! This time with the hold punched in it. Now let me see the hold. Six, ready and pop push step hold for a second good flag step dig. Left foot. Pop push step, hold for a sec, good flap step dig. Love it! Let's take out the hold. Let's take out the hold. Pop push step, good flap step dig. Pop push step, good flap step dig. Five, six, right foot ready and Pop push step, good flap step dig. \n  And ready stop. You know what? Not so bad. Alright this is what we're going to do. We're going to move on, we're going to move on. I want to see pop push FLAP. Pop push flap on the right foot. Put your right heel out. Put your right heel out. We're gonna go pop push flap. Where's my head?\n  Over you.\n  Over the front of the body, that's right. Five, six, ready and pop push flap. Five, six, ready and pop push flap. Yes, five, six, ready and pop push flap. Five, six, ready and pop push flap. Not bad. Five, six, last time in push and freeze. We're going to take a second piece of bread, that heel and go good flap step dig. It happens with the left foot. Five, six, ready and good flap step dig. You already know that part! Isn't that fabulous? So we're going to put together pop push flap, flap step good. Five, six, right foot goes pop push flap, flap step dig. Oh! Wah! Say it for a second.\n  Pop push flap, flap step dig. Pop push flap, flap step dig. Pop push flap, flap step dig.\n  Say it!\n  Pop push flap, flap step dig. Pop push flap, flap step dig. Pop push flap, flap step dig.\n  Let me see the next move.\n  In the shower?  Be careful you might slip. That's a hazard, always safety first. Yes? Okay, Andra?\n  In Walmart.\n  In Walmart, really?\n  Love it!\n  Okay.\n  I do mines in Kroger. \n  Do you find--okay.\n  I do mines in the kitchen.\n You do yours in the kitchen. Does your mom yell at you?  No.\n Be careful.\n  Like when you sit down on the desk in class and you just sit there, all year.\n  Okay so Jasline, do your teachers get on to you when you practice in class?\n  No cause I'm quiet.\n  Because you're quiet. \n  Well number one, I'm super proud of you for practicing everywhere. And do you find that you do it all the time? In the store, in the school. So it's not just something that you're going to do in class. You see this? And what you're going to find is odd a lot of former students come back and they go: \"Oh, well I continue to do this \"and I'm not even taking tapping. \"I wish I could go find and tap more.\" Okay when that's gonna happen, because it is going to happen to you, it's like a bug, it's like a virus, you just get all excited and all that. Go to Youtube for me, and on Youtube, there are lots of how-to videos. Do you know you could look up how to do this time-step on the Youtube video? Now is it going to be your standard buck and wing arc, buck times step?\n  No.\n  No, it may not be because remember the sandwiches it may be a different kind of sandwich, a different kind of time-step. So, if you're ever curious and you want to continue this through like, because you're gonna. Do you have to have tap shoes by the way?\n  No.\n  No. What do you have to have?\n  Hard floor.\n  Tammy, sit up for me. You what?\n  A shoe with a hard bottom.\n  Yeah. Look, I'm in heels right? That's all you have to do. Now one of the things that I wanted to point out to you as we're about to evaluate yourselves and evaluate your peers, I want you to look at weight distribution. Say \"weight distribution\".\n  Weight distribution.\n  What is weight distribution?\n  Can I use an example?\n  Yes.\n  Like when we're doing the good flap ball change, you have to move your body up for the good flap and you move it back down for the step-beat.\n  Okay, so great, Jasline said that you have to move your body forward on the good flap and then back, and sit it back down, for the step dig. Anybody had something to add?\n  Shift your weight.\n  Yes, you're right you shift your weight which way?\n  Opposite of which way you switch your knee.\n  Oh, opposite of which way of whatever foot I'm using because if I have this foot up I've got...  right? Does my body have to turn?\n  No.\n  No, but it kind of does, don't it? Got some hip action going on right here.  Alright anybody else see any weight distribution? \n  We can do the sink, you're kind of down a little bit.\n  Okay, I was going to say, I was trying to get to you. The weight distribution doesn't necessarily have to go right to left, right? Or front to back. It can go, up and down. What is the reason we want out weight distribution kind of lowered?\n  So we can move.\n  Move.\n  To have \n  to have a better base for what?\n  \n  Okay so we can keep the rhythm. Because if the rate of speed, speeds up then our rhythm has to stay with it, right? Tell me how different, how important is weight distribution as opposed to females and males? Anybody know the difference? We covered this one. Where's the woman's center of gravity?\n  In her glut. \n  You are absolutely correct. In her glut, right through here and that's where women tend to put on weight right gravity centers, her center of gravity around her belly, the baby belly and around...\n  Idk.\n  Oh Idk, alright you don't know? So where is the men's center of gravity? Where do they tend to...\n  Torso.\n  Torso. Right, their diaphragm and that's where we get that spare tire from. A man's center of gravity, and this is what it means, are we here? There we are. Here's what it means. As the woman's center of gravity if your body can be forward and your bottom is still back and you're fine and dandy. A man, if this is him, he's going forward. He's going to fall. He's not going to be able to keep his weight. So it makes a difference in your body posture and your weight distribution. Yes? Let's look really quickly... Oh, how many of you have taught your significant adult? You taught a significant adult and you taught the time-step. What did you see, anybody?\n  Sometimes your parents got the rhythm  has lost. If your parents are a little older than most average parents, let's say like 40s to 50s.\n  Good, good.\n  Their rhythm has kind lost it. It takes a longer time to teach them. They have to be concentrated because they're like \"Uh uh do that again, do that again!\".\n  Okay, Jasline, that is awesome I'm going to put you on hold for a minute because I have heard from you several times. Let me hear from somebody new. Come on, Audrey.\n  I found that I really got my skills from my mom. My fast-learning skills.\n  You got your fast learning skills from your mom, awesome!\n  She learned real fast.\n  She picked it up good. Alright who else?\n  Instead of teaching a significant adult I taught my whole family to tap.\n  You taught your whole family? Rock on!\n  I found out that my youngest brother learned faster than even my mother.\n  So why do you think your youngest brother learned faster than your mom?\n  I think she slowed down over the years.\n  Over the years, okay. Okay let me hear from somebody up here because I haven't heard anything from up here.\n  While I was teaching my mama, my daddy got excited and he wanted to,  so I taught both of them and they decided upon themselves who was going to learn it the quickest and--\n  Right, competition--\n  And my mama, she actually learned it faster but although it took my daddy more time, once he got it, he could do it over and over again. He actually got pretty good, like speed-wise.\n  See? Tap is for all ages guys. It'll keep you in good health, it's something fun, it'll keep you active. You don't have to learn a certain... you know we learned a step and I hate to teach a step but that's the beautiful thing about tapping, it's you can come up with all kinds of stuff. And you know-- Hey, look here,  I want you to hear. How many of you like step, step dancing? Oh, all around the room. Oh, we love the step dancing right? Step and tap are similar, do you see the correlations? You're making rhythms, there are prescribed movements. So we need to really think about the ways that they intersect and it may become the next big thing. You just never know. You might have tap groups all around. Let's go ahead and do some peer evaluation real quick. I want you to watch the screen. Now what I want you to watch--\n", "filename": ["Copy of 102B PE EAYA 102 B.srt.txt", "Copy of 102A PE EAYA 102A edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.137747], "annotations": [["Instructor"], ["Student"], ["music", "music", "music"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW05", "TW06", "TW09", "TW10", "TW17"]}, "064 ": {"text": " ...boys and girls, for the last week, we have been looking at videos about Dr. Martin Luther King. We've been reading books about Dr. Martin Luther King to get a feel for who he was, why people loved him so much, why laws were changed because of things that he said and things that he did. So, today, we are going to watch another clip of Dr. Martin Luther King. This is probably one of the most famous speeches he ever gave. It was his \"I Have a Dream\" speech. I don't want you to so much listen to his words today as I want you to think about what else he does as he speaks or while he's speaking that makes him such a great speaker. How does he capture his audience? How does he get people to want to listen to him? Alright. So, I want you to pay close attention. It's just a short clip. Then you'll turn to your partners. So, let's see... Let me go ahead and get this started.\n  I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of \"interposition\" and \"nullification,\" one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together. This is our hope. This is our hope and this is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to...\n Okay. I'm going to stop it there. And I want you to tell me first of all, what are some things that you notice that he did to capture his audience? I want you to think about it for a minute. I see lots of hands up. What I want you to do is turn to your share partner first. Talk to your partner about what you saw.  Okay. Let me have your attention back up here. I'm going to write Dr. King in the middle of this web. What I want you all to do is to tell me what are some things that you and your partner discussed about what you saw that made people want to listen and to focus and pay attention to what Dr. King had to say? Sara?\n He had hand motions.\n He had hand motions.\n But there was no hand motions in that clip.\n Yeah, there was.\n I'm glad that you all saw that. I almost said something. You could kind of see this hand go up, but it was so close. The video was so close. That's why I picked that particular segment because I saw his arm and I thought, \"Oh, I hope they get that,\" because I couldn't find a better clip. Zachary?\n The way he said a few words at a time .\n Okay.\n He said  words at a time and stopped...\n Very good. He spaced his words, for lack of something, a better term to use. Zachary said he would say a few words and then he would stop so that people could absorb almost what he was saying and then he could go on. Annie? Okay. Emma?\n He spoke in a very low voice so it was really easy to hear him.\n Okay. So, his tone of voice, right? We'll put tone of voice. So, it was easy to hear him.\n Yeah. And then he didn't mumble. He spoke up really loud.\n He spoke loudly. He did not mumble, she said. He spoke loudly.\n He spoke very serious.\n Yes. He spoke very serious. Jesenya?\n He shook his head.\n He shook his head, didn't he? He nodded. Very good.\n That was my idea. He shook his head.\n Or nodded. Dalen?\n He was looking at the audience.\n Very good. He was looking at the audience. We call that eye contact. He had notes in front of him, but he didn't do this, did he?\n No.\n He looked up constantly. He might have looked down to see where he was in his speech, but he always looked back at his audience. Lenare?\n He said nice words that the people knew.\n Okay. The words that he spoke, he had a good message, didn't he? If you have a good message, people are willing to listen to you, too. He was a good, good man. One more. Kalen?\n He even had a gooder life-- a better life.\n Very good. And that goes kind of along with the words that he spoke-- the good message about having a better life. All right. So, you guys came up with some really good points right here. What I want you to think about when you do your readers theater, I want you to think about how you can incorporate what Dr. Martin Luther King incorporated into his speeches to get people to listen to him so that you're believable in your part, that people can understand what you're saying. So, what we're going to do is we're going to create a rubric together that's going to help you. So, it's called Rubric For Speaking Out for Justice: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a readers theater play, grade two because you guys are second graders. Now, let's take a look at what I've written-- listening, speaking viewing. There's a three, a two and a one. Let's do listening first, okay? Now, if three is the highest, how do you think you can get a three? Sayid?\n By getting a one plus two?\n Okay. But don't think about math right this moment.\n Oh...\n I want you to think about if I were grading you, you were grading yourself or your peers were grading you, how would you give yourself a three or someone else a three? Emma?\n We start with listening. You wouldn't be just fumbling through your pages of your book and just traveling around. You'd be listening to the other people because you have to know when your part is. You have to be ready.\n Very good. You have to know where your part is. Part of doing readers theater is listening to the people that are reading before you because that is going to give you your cue of when it's your turn to speak, okay? So, \"I was a good listener.\" Let's look at number two. How do you think you would get a two? How would you score a two for listening? If the best is that you were a good listener, what would two be? Annie?\n Looking at your paper and then like doing something else.\n Looking at your paper but doing something else. Maybe looking away, maybe fidgeting. So maybe you tried to listen most of the time, but you had difficulty with it. So, we could say, \"I tried to listen most of the time.\"\n Most of the time.\n So, what about a one? Kennedy?\n I didn't listen at all.\n Very good.\n Like purposefully not paying attention.\n \"I forgot to listen.\" Yeah, you don't decide to do that on purpose, Whitney. Now, the next thing you're going to be scored on is speaking. So, how could you get a three for speaking? Sara?\n Don't speak like just normal, like how the actor would speak.\n Speak how the actor would speak. Good. Lenore? Let's do a body check, please. I need you all on the carpet.\n You're supposed to like listen to what he said .\n Okay. Annie?\n Like speak a little louder. When you speak loudly, then .\n \"I spoke loudly enough for people to hear.\"\n, I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. I have a dream that one day the state of Alabama will--\n Will be.\n Will be transformed into a situation where little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.\n My dad and I have that dream too.\n When we let freedom ring, we will let it rumble. We will let it ring from every village and every hamlet and every state in every city. We will be able to see that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics will join hands and sing the words of the old Negro spirit, \"Free at last. Free at last. Thank God almighty. We are free at last.\"\n Dad, when I listen to Reverend King, I know that he's right. I know that things are going to change.\n I think you're right.\n Act IV--It is now spring of 1963. The speech of Reverend King has continued to lead people and speak out their . He has met with another president, Lyndon B. Johnson, and has seen changes sweep across the country.\n May, Billy, please come in here. I have some news.\n What is it Mom?\n Reverend King is dead. He was shot in Memphis, Tennessee.\n No, Mom. That's not fair. He was helping all of us.\n I agree, Billy. It isn't fair. But remember, Reverend King lives on in us. Every time we remember the words, every time we speak out against things that are unfair, we are giving remembrance.\n Okay? So, go find the people that had your card and have your conversations, get your feedback about how you did.\n Miss Walters, I got all three too.\n Great. Great.\n Did you see me? I had nine points.\n You were a good listener.\n Very good. Great feedback.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 064A LRLAEM 064A.srt.txt", "Copy of 064B LRLA EMC 064 B.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.110135], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW04", "TW06", "TW11", "TW16", "TW19"]}, "076": {"text": "  Most friends have finished their first trials. I wanted to talk real quick about what's happened on your first trial. Who wants to share what happened on your first three trials? And I want to know was it something that you predicted would happen? Cody?\n  At first we kinda got a little, it kind of got a little complicated. Since you came around it fixed it a little.\n  Why was it complicated, cause the rest of the group didn't see your experiment. Why was it complicated?\n  Because it keep turning and the wax paper was--\n  What kept turning?\n  The car\n  Your car kept turning?\n  Yeah and the wax paper  kept coming off and turning it. So it was a little complicated.\n  So after you got it fixed, and after I helped you then what did you find out?\n  That it was kind of easy to do.\n  So did your measurement, did that end up being what you predicted it was going to be? When it closed did you think the car was going to travel that far or did you think it was gonna go a shorter distance?\n  We thought it was gonna-- I thought it was gonna go very far. Because that's a little bit slicker.\n  Because that it's slippery. Well I was listening to another group talk about something, I think it was at Bhavana's group, raise your hand if you're in Bhavana's group. And really deep had really good observation. Because they were thinking that it was gonna go a little bit farther too. But you told me something about the surface that we were testing on.\n  I said the... the wax paper was a little bit smooth and the carpet was a little bit rough.\n  So do you guys agree that the wax paper being smooth and the carpet that we're testing on being rough, if you agree that that has anything to do with how far the car's going to travel, give me a thumb's up. I think that makes a difference. Lucy, why do you think it makes a difference?\n  The carpet, there's a  feel of bumps if you could feel it, and the wax paper is slippery. So that's how it makes the difference cause slippery kind of makes stuff fast, like if they have wheels or something, it makes stuff fast.\n  That's true. So as we get ready for our next test, you probably only will have time to do maybe one trial. But I want you to predict, now that you've kind of explored the wax paper and you know how far the car will travel, looking at your information, your measurements, I want you to talk with your group about how far you think the car will go on the bumpy surface. And we're choosing to use the shelf liner today. The black shelf liner in your tub. Do you think the car's going to go farther or a shorter distance than what you measured on your first trial? We may only get through one trial. And that is okay. Alright but I want you to talk about it with your groups first and then start. So Lawson what are you gonna do first before you test?\n  Get in a group meeting and sit down and meet\n  Yeah and talk about your predictions first. That's what good scientists do. They're always making really good predictions about what they've observed. Alright. Go. \n  I'm setting the timer.\n  I think it will go really bumpy, well not really bumpy but a little bumpy. And it might go just a little less than the smooth.\n  I think that it will go slower because the surface it's really bumpy and one time I went on this bumpy slide and I did not go down very quickly. \n  Don't worry about recording the information right now but we'll record in a little bit.\n  I think they're gonna go a little bit far.\n  I bet slower.\n  Hey, you can't pick off of me!\n  I think that it's gonna go farther and faster.\n  I think it's gonna go a little bit farther and a little bit faster.\n  I think it's gonna go a little bit slower.\n  I think it's  kind of gonna go, since it's bumpy it's gonna slow it down.\n  I think it was gonna go farther.\n  Group meeting's over! \n  So you think it's gonna go faster than it did on the wax paper?\n  No I think it's going a little bit slower but still a little fast, like medium.\n  So you don't think it's gonna change that much, why do you think that?\n  Cause it doesn't feel too too bumpy.\n  It doesn't feel too too bumpy, she's making a really good observation. What do you think Jaylin?\n  My predict is  when you put the car on it it's gonna kinda go medium, it might go a little bit slower and a little bit fast, and then when it gets to the carpet it's gonna go slower and then it's gonna turn.\n  It's gonna go a lot slower and then it's going to turn?\n  I think like that fast.\n  Okay.\n  Not too fast, not as fast as the wax paper\n  Go ahead and test but let's think about your setup here. Before you move this, let's look at your setup. As the car rolls, what would happen maybe if it stays in motion until it gets to that green rug? What might happen?\n  It might get stopped.\n  Remember the car's going to continue to move until something makes it stop. So what might you want to do with your ramp?\n  We might want it to  be here so it will go straighter?\n  But it might bump  into the black box.\n  It may, well you know the rug is going to--\n  I don't mean there, but I mean...\n  I know what we could do, we could do it this way so it won't crash.\n  Well you could either move it over just a little bit so that it has nothing in its way.\n  Javier could you go get us some tape?\n  It may not even need tape it might cling to it without the tape. Try it and see.\n  Let's try it without some.\n  Yeah it doesn't even need tape.\n  Who's the task manager here?\n  Me\n  Look out he's doing the first test.\n  I think it should be Jaylin.\n  Okay, Jaylin now do you test sideways, we talked about this yesterday when you wouldn't agree. And you guys talked about that if some friends tested sideways and some friends teted behind the ramp that it may make a difference. Then you guys said you wanted to keep it the same.\n  Javier can you move out of the way?\n  You ready?\n  Now wait a minute, wait a minute. Cause I bet you probably got his on tape. Jaylin show me how you did that again, go get the car. Watch what he did with his popsicle stick. Cause I hadn't seen that before. Do it just like you did the first time. What did he do with his popsicle stick?\n  He flipped it down\n  Do you think that makes a difference in your test if he flips it down or raises it up? Why might it make a difference Olivia?\n  Because it might, when you put it down you're putting it down fast and I bet it makes the car go a little bit faster. And it gives it some force.\n  Did it give it more force? So, Jaylin is this surface the same as this surface? Is this the same as this?\n  Yes, I think\n  Is this popsicle stick the same as this here?\n  No.\n  So if you test the car on this and this is that going to be the same as testing it on something bumpy?\n  No.\n  So what do you need to do with the popsicle stick?\n  Raise it up.\n  You might want to raise it up next time. Alright? Try it again. I'll come back and see if you guys are ready.\n  One, two, and go!\n  Wow that was great!\n  Now let's start measuring\n  Now we're gonna start measuring.\n  Okay \n  Okay, one, two...\n  No, Tessa's gotta do that.\n  One, two three ready.\n  Oh my gosh we were right.  \n  Our first prediction is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight! \n  It's eight!\n  Oh my gosh!\n  Why's it eight? \n  And ours keeps getting a mess up!\n  I predicted eight, too, see?\n  I predicted seven mostly.\n  We got eight cubes on this one\n  Eight cubes, really? Before we clean up I would like for you to have a quick group meeting about what you learned about the different surfaces so far. Quickly sit down with your group and have a quick group meeting. I'm gonna come around and be watching. Quick, quick, quick! It's almost time for us to go.\n  About what you learned?\n  What you learned today about the wax paper and the bumpy surface that you used, the shelf liner. What did you learn from what you tested?\n  I learned that the bumpy surface made it go, that bumpy makes things go slower and that smooth makes things go faster.\n  How do you know that?\n  Because when we use the smooth it went further\n  How far did it go?\n  It went about-- \n  eight cubes.\n  No\n  I think it actually went seven. I don't know we didn't put the lines behind it.\n  36 about further than this because it went 36 or so and this only went eight cubes. So that makes it the point where bumpy is slower.\n  So 35 on the wax and only eight on the bumpy? The shelf liner?\n  I think it was seven on the bumpy.\n  Big difference isn't it? Is that what you predicted?\n  No I didn't predict eight\n  I predicted 16\n  No I didn't predict on the bumpy, but I predicted... I predicted one and I got the right answer for it on smooth.\n  Alright. Well you guys have two more trials to do so we'll see if your numbers are close when you use trial two and three. Alright? Go ahead and get cleaned up.\n  We already cleaned most of them first\n  Well no you need to clean all your things up everything back in your tub. You can go ahead and record your data but we're gonna get cleaned up. Go ahead and get cleaned up.\n  Alright push the red button, you can push the red button. Mary, come over here. Tell us what you learned.\n  Okay Mary, come over here.\n  I learned that different surfaces can make something different, whatever you're testing make it go fast and slow.\n Mary what did you learn?\n  I learned mostly the same thing except when we did that, you know how this is less bumpy than the carpet? It makes this go faster than the carpet, which makes a difference.\n  Yeah. Jaylin what did you learn?\n  I learned if you put the car on this it's gonna go a little bit faster. If you put it on this it's gonna go a little bit almost fast. And it's gonna stop and go slower and that's why it went right there.\n  Okay does anybody have anything else?\n  Javier what did you learn?\n  Well I learned that if it's smoother it's quicker. But if it's a little bumpy, it's slower. That's it.\n  Alright everyone put  your things in the bucket. \n", "filename": ["Copy of 076 GEN EC 076 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.181452], "annotations": [["Teacher"], ["Cody"], ["Teacher"], ["Cody"], ["Teacher"], ["Cody"], ["Teacher"], ["Cody"], ["Teacher"], ["Cody"], ["Teacher"], ["Cody"], ["Teacher"], ["Girl"], ["Teacher"], ["Lucy"], ["Teacher"], ["Lawson"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Lawson"], ["Girl"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Boy"], ["Girl"], ["NaN"], ["Boy"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["Mary"], ["Teacher"], ["Mary"], ["Teacher"], ["Jaylin"], ["Teacher"], ["Mary"], ["Teacher"], ["Mary"], ["Teacher"], ["Olivia"], ["Teacher"], ["Mary"], ["Olivia"], ["Teacher"], ["Mary"], ["Jaylin"], ["Teacher"], ["Olivia"], ["Teacher"], ["Olivia"], ["Mary"], ["Teacher"], ["Girl"], ["Teacher"], ["Girl"], ["Teacher"], ["Girl"], ["Jaylin"], ["Teacher"], ["Girls"], ["Teacher"], ["Olivia"], ["Teacher"], ["Jaylin"], ["Teacher"], ["Jaylin"], ["Teacher"], ["Jaylin"], ["Teacher"], ["Jaylin"], ["Teacher"], ["Kids"], ["Mary"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Jaylin"], ["Voiceover"], ["Girl"], ["Voiceover"], ["Lucy"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["Girl"], ["Teacher"], ["Girl"], ["Teacher"], ["Girl"], ["NaN"], ["Girl"], ["NaN"], ["Girl"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Lawson"], ["Voiceover"], ["Lawson"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["Olivia"], ["Javier"], ["Olivia"], ["Javier"], ["Mary"], ["Javier"], ["Jaylin"], ["Javier"], ["Olivia"], ["Javier"], ["Olivia"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW08", "TW09", "TW09s", "TW13", "TW17", "TW18"]}, "150": {"text": "  She saw sparks in the sky and a beautiful panda bear appeared in front of her.\n  Don't be scared, I'm your Fairy Panda Bear.

Alright, this morning when we were talking about the books about China, Xander wrote down a lot of the things we were talking about that were different between us and the people that live in China. So as a class we figured out that they have a different flag, they eat with chopsticks, which is really neat,\n  We do too.\n  Sometimes we do,  right?

So Toban, I'm gonna be coming around and I'm gonna give a listening stone to one of the people in the group, and if you're holding the listening stone you're gonna say one thing that's the same and then you're gonna pass it to your partner and they're going to say one thing that's the same. And then they're gonna pass it back, and we're gonna go back and forth and see if we can start to talk about what's the same. We know a lot of things that are different. I'm curious of what's the same. Could you please sit knee-to-knee with your partner? Can we show them knee-to-knee Zoe? Like this? Facing your partner, like we do-- There you go! I'll give you a Band-Aid in a minute Finn, okay? Can you sit knee-to-knee with Graham? Like this?\n  I have another thing that is dis--\n  Another thing that's different?\n  Uh-huh.\n  What?\n  They have more dramatic designs on their clothes.\n  They have more dramatic designs on their clothes? We saw that in our research material. As soon as you get the listening stone, I want you to say something that's the same-- and RJ you might want to start saying like, \"we both...\" might be a way to help okay?  RJ you have the listening stone. Okay? So look at Zoe, listen with your eyes and your body and say, \"we both...\" and see how many things you can think of. \n  Can I be the stone keeper?\n  You may, yes.\n  We are the same as them, because we all... \n  We all have eyes.\n  We all have eyes, yep.\n  We all have clothing.\n  We all have hands. We both can see!\n  We are the same as them.\n  How are we the same as them?\n  We wear clothes.\n  We all have to wear clothes, right?\n  We all have beds?\n  We all have beds.\n  Can we do something different?\n  You may say something different, yeah.\n  We both have to sit down.\n  We both have a mouth.\n  We all have hair, yep.\n  No, some people can be bald.\n  That's true,  some people can be bald. What else between us and the Chinese culture is the same? We all have shoes.  We can all walk and we can all do things.\n  We all have bodies.\n  Did you guys see  anything from the puppet show that made you think of something that's the same between us? What?\n  We all can make things.\n  We can all create things and be really creative. Did you see something from the puppet show that made you think we were the same? \n  We all have clothes. Did you see the clothes on the puppet show?\n  We all have dragon puppets?\n  There are a lot of dragon puppets at Chinese New Year.\n  Oh, we all have puppets.\n  We all use puppets.\n  That's what I was just going to say!\n  Okay, we all use puppets.\n  We all have an alphabet.\n  We all have an alphabet, even though it looks different. Alright I'm going to see if we can earn another point. Class?\n  Yes?\n   That was so good. Boys and girls hey, can everyone turn their bodies this way? Alright let's share out now, we had the chance to pass the stone back and forth, I just wanted to quickly hear one thing per group of something that you thought of that was the same. Zoe and RJ can you tell me one thing that you talked about in your group?\n  We both have imaginations.\n  We both have imaginations!\n  And RJ said we both have brains.\n  We're all pretty smart aren't we? Finn and Graham, can you tell me something that was the same?\n  We both see.\n  We both see.\n  We both have rotten teeth.\n  What do you mean by that?\n  We sometimes all have rotten teeth.\n  We have to go to the dentist sometimes? Yeah, okay. Xander and Nazarette, what did you guys find in your group? What? You tell me, what's the same? We both...\n  We both can make things like necklaces and fireworks and actually Chinese people were the first people to invent gunpowder and that's what makes fireworks.\n  Did you hear that boys and girls? Finn did you hear what Xander said? He said that the Chinese were the first to invent fireworks.\n  Because they were the first to invent gunpowder and gunpowder is what powers the fireworks a lot.\n  That's cool. Wait wait wait, it's Anna and Toban's turn. Anna and Toban, tell me something that's the same.\n  We both have families.\n  We both have families. Did you think of one Toban?\n  We all have dragons.\n  We all have dragons?\n  What does that say?\n  I'll tell you in  just a minute, okay? And DeShaun and Gabrielle you're the last ones. What's something from your group?\n  We talked about...\n  We both...\n  We both...\n  What's something that's the same?\n  We all have rainbows.\n  We all have rainbows?  Yeah, they see rainbows in China and we see rainbows here. And DeShaun what about you? What's something that's the same between us and the people in China?\n  We're gonna have the same melanin as somebody.\n  We have the same melanin?\n  Yeah.\n  What do you mean by, \"we have the same melanin as somebody?\" Here sit up so I can hear you.\n  I think he means we have the same melanin in our skin.\n  We have the same melanin in our skin?\n  Cuz we both have light skin.\n  Yeah but what if the people in Africa have...\n  I'm not talking about them.\n  The people in Africa have dark skin, they have more... melanin.\n  Yeah but the people in Asheville.\n  Oh, in Asheville. In our city we have lots of different colors of skin and different kinds of melanin but in China did it look like their skin was pretty similar? Yeah, yeah. Alright, so this is what we're gonna do. Does everyone see these circles over here?\n  Yeah.\n  You're gonna come up and you're gonna pick one off our chart and you're gonna go draw a picture of something that's the same between us and the people in China and then you're gonna come and you're gonna stick it back up. And this is actually a word bubble chart. Okay? So when I see you're sitting nicely I'm gonna call you up and you come pick your color and I have brand new markers at the table. Alright, Zoe and Finn come pick your color. Xander and Nancy come pick your circle. You're gonna draw a picture of something that's the same between us and the Chinese culture. You can write words too. Okay, the rest of you. It says, \"We will go on hug patrol today.\" We're gonna see if we can earn it. You're gonna do orange?\n  I wanna do pink. \n  Can I do green?\n  You have to do orange or... Alright. So what's the same boys and girls? Thank you. \n  I love brand new markers!\n  We have to do something on the same.\n  Something that's the same. Anna what are you gonna do?\n  We all have families.\n  We all have families.\n  Can I sit by Anna?\n  I'm doing green.\n  Can you sit by Anna, yes. Anna, Toban's gonna sit next to you. Sometimes you can say, \"we both...\" Or \"we all...\" \n  Xander that was cool. How do you spell melanin? You just sound it out. We all have brains, we're all pretty smart? Can you write that in words on there? You guys are such good writers. RJ, what are you writing? what are you writing RJ? Can you read it to me? What do you mean by it, \"we all have rooms\"?\n  We all have our rooms.\n  We all have art rooms?\n  Bedrooms.\n  Oh bedrooms, we all have bedrooms. We're gonna make a word bubble. Can you read it to me? We all...\n  We all have a heart.\n  We all have a heart.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 150 GEN EC 150 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.0479777], "annotations": [["Narrator"], ["Panda"], ["Daisy"], ["Panda"], ["Narrator"], ["Panda"], ["Narrator"], ["Prince"], ["Daisy"], ["Narrator"], ["Daisy"], ["Narrator"], ["Prince"], ["Narrator"], ["Daisy"], ["Narrator"], ["Prince"], ["Daisy"], ["Everyone"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["Everyone"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Child"], ["NaN"], ["Everyone"], ["NaN"], ["Child"], ["NaN"], ["Child"], ["NaN"], ["Child"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Child"], ["Child"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["Zoe"], ["NaN"], ["Zoe"], ["NaN"], ["Finn"], ["NaN"], ["Graham"], ["NaN"], ["Graham"], ["NaN"], ["Xander"], ["NaN"], ["Xander"], ["NaN"], ["Anna"], ["NaN"], ["Toban"], ["NaN"], ["Toban"], ["NaN"], ["Gabrielle"], ["NaN"], ["Gabrielle"], ["NaN"], ["Gabrielle"], ["NaN"], ["DeShaun"], ["NaN"], ["DeShaun"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Zoe"], ["Anna"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Anna"], ["NaN"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Anna"], ["NaN"], ["Anna"], ["NaN"], ["Toban"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["RJ"], ["NaN"], ["RJ"], ["NaN"], ["Finn"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW03", "TW05", "TW06", "TW07", "TW08", "TW17", "TW18", "TW19", "TW24"]}, "153": {"text": "  I'm not gonna have no peace with that. If you feel something, I don't know, something  like done bothered me that done made me like... brought me down to the point where I was crying about it The first thing he say, \"I ain't gonna tell nobody, \"but I feel where you coming from.\" He tell me it shouldn't get to that point where you mad over something that doesn't matter. If it's good or not, that seriously don't matter. That's in the past; the past ain't gonna do nothing. The past can't hurt you.\n  Okay. Alright.\n  That's what I'd tell him.\n  So, really this kind of conversation should've been held with what kind of friend?\n  A pretty good friend.\n  A pretty good friend, or maybe even your best friend. Nope? Not your best friend?\n   Oh yes, my best friend. You already know who I'm talking about. He's my best friend. Now, he one of them people that he done did some stuff to me that made me mad. I ask him, \"Man, why you doing this? \"I thought you was different from everybody else.\" But, not once have I actually went out there and played the cards while I'm at home. How I'm not gonna tell nobody, and then come two days later, everybody and their momma walking up to him, and asking him questions. \"Uh, why you did this to her?\"\n  So, let me ask you this. So, your saying you've had conversations with your best friend before, and then he's divulged information that you've said to him?\n  No, from time to time, he might get mad, and he'll say something, then we have to have that one on one talk. \"OK, this was between me and you. I don't want to hear this coming out nobody else's mouth.\" Cause then I know point blank that you done said something.\n  Let me ask you this, if you would have that conversation with someone, is he truly your best friend? Is that a conversation that... Jay, chime in any time. If you got to keep reminding him that, hey man, if you tell somebody something and you gotta be worried about whether their gonna tell it to someone else,\n  Honestly. are they really your best friend?\n  No. Like I said before, that's another acquaintance, because you can't trust him like that man. He telling you he ain't gonna tell nobody, but he going back on his word.\n  He going to get a friend to turn on you in a heartbeat, that's why I said it's about you.\n  Johnny? No.\n  Between what you say...\n  I don't blame Johnny.\n  If he's truly your best friend...\n  He won't tell nobody.\n  He won't tell anybody.\n  But then, you got like... it's a boundary between stuff you tell. You can tell your best, best friend something deep, but it's a certain boundary between that which you wouldn't tell him certain stuff. I tell my best friend almost everything, but certain stuff. he don't need to know.\n  Right, cause certain things we...\n  My business don't need to be his. He have one of those days when he feeling down, then I come over there, \"Blah, blah, blah, don't say nothing to me.\" Then, he flips out on me, and he wanna tell something that's so deep to me that I'm sitting there looking like, did he really just say this.\n  Cause your shocked. You're in shock, and...\n  You don't never expect, well anybody wouldn't expect their best friend to spill the beans or say something that's not meant to be told. Me, I would never expect Chris to say anything I tell him. So far, he has been a best friend. He don't tell nothing I say. I don't want to have to tell what he tells me, because we got that best friend relationship.\n  Cause a best friend should be loyal, all the way to the end.\n  Not when it's necessary or needed.\n  That's right. Not when it's necessary, but at all times, right?\n  Yes ma'am.\n  Okay. Alright. Let me go to the next scenario. You decide you would like to take in a movie, but you choose not to go alone. You finally reach someone by phone, who is just as bored as you, and is dying to be in the company of someone pleasant. You both enjoy yourselves so much, you plan to do this again. Where is that person at on the grading scale?\n  I'd say that's a group thing, because they interested in the same thing that you're interested in.\n  Group friend.\n  Okay. Alright, group friend?\n  Group friend.\n  Someone that you  know through association. Now, in this scenario, it's just you and that person. And, it could be someone that you met through the group. Or, it could be... It's not necessarily your best friend.\n  You just started hanging out out of the blue. You met them, and when your friends not around, y'all started to talk a little and get to know more about each other then.\n  I'd say that's a pretty good friend.\n  Pretty good friend?\n  I could say a pretty good friend, cause I would hang out with a pretty good friend.\n  A pretty good friend you can take on the outside of school and you can go do activities that both of y'all enjoy.\n  Yeah, because a group friend is normally someone you hang out with in a group. Kind of like we're together. Because, once again, you know that person through association of someone else. But, a good friend is someone that you actually can call up and say\n  \"Okay, you want to go out?\"\n  Yeah \"You wanna go out? Let's go...\" It's nothing between you guys. If its a girl, you understand that she just want to see the movie, and I want to see the movie. We laugh, we joke, we go out eat pizza together, but it's nothing else there. We ain't trying to be boyfriend-girlfriend.\n  You can't try to make it more then what it is.\n  Right. Then, if it's just a friend, one of your dudes that you hang out with, y'all like the same movie. Like, I... You know... You can't call me, cause we're not on the same level. I'm your teacher at all times. Even though you know I like the same type movies you like, and we always discuss the same type of movie, we're not going to go to the movies together.\n  Cause you on the adult level, we on the young people level.\n  Right, and we're different types of... Our friendship scale is different.\n  Is not even up here, it's...\n  Right. Okay? Now... Someone approaches you about going to see an exhibit at the museum. You were glad to hear it, because it just happens to be an exhibit that you wanted to see anyway. So, your parents tell you both that you can go, and you can... The exhibit is in a different city. Your parents tell you both that you can go, and you can spend the night over out of town. What kind of friend is that? Is that just an acquaintance?\n  That would probably be with like with my best friend. I wouldn't go out of town with somebody that's not by best friend.\n  I ain't going to go out of town... I got to go with somebody that I know is going to speak to me. You know what I'm saying?\n  mm-hmm\n  Got to be somebody I can trust. I don't have to many friends I can trust. I don't know why, but all my friends is just the reason why I don't get too close to them. I can't exactly tell you why. I just don't. Because, I can't trust everybody.\n  Okay. Alright.\n  Because, you'll never know who will be your best friend today. and, they might turn on you tomorrow, so you'll never know.\n  Okay. So, that's why this is a good piece to do. Because, we got to figure out who is just an acquaintance, who is someone we that we will just see on the hall, \"hi, how you doing, bye\". Got to figure out who is the acquaintance, and then we got to figure out who is the group friend, who is a good friend, who is the best friend. Because, there's somewhere... There's a fine line, like you guys said, there's a fine line between all five of them, but you got to know the line. You got to know where the line is drawn. You got to know the conversations to have with all of them, because there are certain conversations that you would have with that best friend...\n  That you want to tell somebody that you just met in the hall.\n  Right! Right!\n  'Cause there like, \"you just telling me your whole business, but you don't really know my name or nothing about me.\" That's something... The stuff you telling me, I wouldn't tell you. I would tell it to my best friend, but as far as what's going on in my house, I'll probably let you know I got sisters and brothers, the basic stuff, but not oh my momma's strung out, or doing this and that. Cause everybody's business is not your business. Your business is not  are you.\n  That's right. We always got to keep that in mind, because so many times I'll get calls from parents, and they'll say, \"So and so... Just talking too much.\" Especially when people are getting into a lot of issues, or getting into confusion at school, or what have you. And, a lot of that comes from the fact that they don't know when to be quiet, or they don't know what to say, or how to say it, or who to approach. Because, if someone says to you... stand up for a minute. In the morning, when you first come in, and the first thing I say to you is what?\n  Good morning.\n  Good morning. Good morning, Vincent. How you doing?\n  Good morning Ms. Jenson.\n  How was your weekend?\n  I went to my cousin house, I got to spend time with my Godmother, and I went grocery shopping.\n  Okay. so that... Now, you told me... I didn't say what did you do.\n  Oh.\n  I said how was your weekend.\n  It was good.\n  It was good. And, that's basics of that conversation. It should not be oh guess what? My momma... My momma and her boyfriend was fighting, and they threw the cat out the window, and then the police came over. Because, at that moment, you have just did what?\n  Stepped out of bounds.\n  You've stepped out of bounds. You've divulged way...\n  Too much.\n  Too much.\n  You done opened the book before it could be read.\n   Or you done read the book before it could be bought. Because, really, I didn't buy into all of that. I didn't want all of that.\n  You just wanted to know your name, and how was your weekend.\n  I just wanted the generalities of it was a good weekend. And then there are times that we could probably get a little deeper.\n  But you not asking for that. You just asking for the simple.\n  That's right. That's right. Jeremy, I'm going to ask you.... Stand up for a minute. Jay... 'cause you're a pretty secretive guy.\n   Mmhm.\n  So normally we got to pull stuff out of you. 'Cause I said to you earlier, I said, \"Your Dad called. And what was that about?\"\n    I was stuck on the river.\n  And he said, \"I was stuck on the river.\" My first thought was Jeremy got a boat?  So I said, \"You got a boat?\" That's what I said, right?\n  Yeah. I was over there at the Wafflehouse, over there by Brian Gates behind over there at the apartments. I went to see someone.\n  And so he went to see someone, but again, sometimes you got to know when to hold your conversation--\n  ...and when to divulge it.\n  --and when to divulge it. Because, even though he went to see someone, he didn't give me no elaborate details, yeah this honey, she was... Because a lot of times,\n  You don't need that.\n  I don't need that.\n  You just wanted to know where I was at.\n  Just wanted to know where you was at. I want to make sure you was okay. Make sure that your Dad got in touch with someone to be able to say, \"Jeremy's okay\". Okay? Alright?\n  Alright.\n  Yeah.\n  You can have a seat.\n  That was a good conversation.\n  Huh?\n  This was a good conversation.\n  This was a good conversation? You thought this was a good lesson?\n  Today was a good day. It was a good day.\n  Because some people don't know their boundaries of talking and telling it all.\n  Some people just give up too much information.\n  Some people around here got to even say what  did to you and everything.\n  From here we're going actually, the next thing we're going to discuss is conversations. That's where we're going to go from here. I wanted us to... because, the other day, we kind of looked at friendship, but I wanted to go a little deeper, because I know.... I want us to realize that friendships... they should be reciprocal.\n  Not always.\n  And when I say reciprocal, everybody understands what I'm saying?\n  The same.\n  No.\n  Should be the same, like how I feel about you, you should feel that same way about me.\n  I feel like you trustworthy, but you feel like I'm going to tell on you any chance I get.\n  Right. Exactly. But, they're not always reciprocal, but... keep in mind that friendships are always changing. Because, who you put down on your friendship scale on Thursday...\n  It change.\n  It changed. You gave me a whole different... not a whole different set, but you gave me some different people, and you actually moved some people. Where you had Yolanda as a good friend, she became just a group friend four days later. Okay, and you had valid reasons, and keep in mind that things do change. Just because someone was a best friend last week....\n  Don't mean they going to stay your best friend.\n  They're not. Nine times out of 10, I promise you guys. When I was in high school, I could..... there were three, there was four of us, and I considered them my very best friends. Now, I don't know how deep they would've had my back, but I considered them my good friends. We talked on the phone, we shared secrets, we shared stuff, you know, when we was sneaking and doing stuff. We shared those things, but today, I really can't tell you where they're at. Now, there was some friends that I met in college that we're still friends to this day. They're friends that I've had since I came into teaching, that I don't know where those people are. Because I've been teaching... when you think of teaching for 18 years, people have friends... people have come and gone in the teaching profession, but I haven't kept in touch with all of them, because there has to be a... there has to be something in common that's going to keep you friends. It can't just be, I see... if I see them just at school, and that's all we ever talk about is school, and schoolwork, and complain, and fussing, and about lesson plans and stuff, then nine times out of 10 those are just my associates. Those are just acquaintances, people that I pass in the hall. We laugh, we joke, but we don't share any intimate conversation. Okay? I'm glad this was a good exercise for you guys, and next time we're going to look into conversations. The type of conversations you have with each one of those type people.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 153 ENS ECYA 153 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.00458044], "annotations": [["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Jay"], ["Jay"], ["Vincent"], ["Jay"], ["Vincent"], ["Jay"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Voiceover"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Jay"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Jay"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Jay"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Jay"], ["Teacher"], ["Jay"], ["Teacher"], ["Jay"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Jay"], ["Teacher"], ["Jay"], ["Teacher"], ["Jay"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Jay"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Jay"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Jay"], ["Vincent"], ["Jay"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Jay"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["Vincent"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW06c", "TW21"]}, "075": {"text": "  All right. So, I showed you all that video for three reasons. Number one, I want you to see that volleyball is not a girl's sport. Here in the South a lot of people think of volleyball as a girl sport because we don't have a lot of male high school volleyball teams. I don't know why, we just don't. That's a common misconception, that volleyball is a girl's sport. Everybody in that video was a male. Everybody in that video was over 50 years of age. That means volleyball is a lifetime activity. Raise your hand if you can take a guess at what a lifetime activity is. Yes ma'am.\n  A lifetime activity is something you can do when you're older.\n  A lifetime activity is something you can do basically for the rest of your life. Would golf be a lifetime activity?\n  No.\n  Golf?\n  Yes.\n  Golf would be a lifetime activity. There's people 70, 80, 90 years old that are playing golf. As a matter of fact, playing golf is an accomplishment, to be able to go out and shoot your age. So, I'm if I'm 70 and I go out and shoot a good. Golf is a lifetime activity. How about bowling?\n  Yes.\n  How about tackle football?\n  No.\n  No. Tackle football would not be a lifetime activity. If I was to go to the YMCA, do you think I would be able to find a league to sign up for tackle football at my age?\n  No.\n  No. Can I go out to the YMCA and find a volleyball league for somebody my age?\n  Yeah.\n  Yes. So, volleyball is what we consider a lifetime activity. Something you can do the rest of your life. Okay, the third thing, those guys were pretty good.\n  Mmhmm.\n  And they were pretty athletic. So by playing volleyball and staying active, you're going to be more athletic than a lot of people that are your age. So, not only is volleyball a lifetime activity, it's going to help you stay in shape, help you stay active, okay? First thing we're going to do is the serve. With the serve there are a few things we need to remember, okay? First thing I want us to remember with the serve is that the ball must stay at the waist. When we hit it out of our hand, we want it to stay at our waist. If I hold the ball up here and I hit, the ball is going to go up. It's all about the angles, okay? If I hit the ball right here it's going to go up and out like I want  it to go, all right? So, then I want to hit it at my waist. Second thing that we're going to remember is that my opposite foot needs to be forward. If I hit it with my right hand, I want my left leg to be up front, like this. What other activities have we done that your opposite foot is forward? Yes?\n  Catching.\n  Throwing, right? With the overhand throw we step with our opposite foot. What else? Yes, ma'am?\n  The underhand toss.\n  The underhand toss, that is exactly right. I think Ms. Beldo taught y'all the underhand toss. Step, tick-tock point. Which foot do we step with?\n  The opposite.\n  The opposite foot. Do you see a trend? Can you make a little connection there? Opposite foot forwards, okay? Now, the next things that I want you to remember kind of go hand in hand. They are tick-tock. Tick-tock looks like this. Tick. Tock. Pretty easy, right? Tick. Tock. Tick, I want to pull it back. Back here. Tock, our arm is coming forward. Now, we are going to add a little something to the tock part. All the tock, when we do tock, I want you standing like this and do tock. When we do tock, we are actually going to transfer our weight from our back foot going forward into the front foot. What do you think that's going to do? If we transfer that weight forward. Yes?\n  If we transfer our weight forward it's going to put more pressure.\n  It's going to put more pressure on the ball. Am I plugging it harder or softer?\n  Harder.\n  Harder. It's going to produce more force. Right? I'm going to hit the ball harder if I do this than if I do this. Does that make sense? Because you're getting that momentum going forward. It's just like in baseball. If I'm playing baseball and I'm standing in the outfield, am I going to throw it harder if I do this or if I do this?\n  The one with more force.\n  The second one, right? Because my momentum is going forward. Does that make sense? So, my momentum is going forward. Just like in four square. If I'm playing four square and I want to hit the ball and I'm trying to get somebody out in four square am I going to hit it harder if I do this or if I do this?\n  That.\n  The second one. I get my force from the momentum going forward. That's right, and the last thing I want you to remember with the serve is the follow through. Follow the ball, John will you stand up please? If I want the ball to go to John, my follow through should be towards John, right? If I want the ball going towards the flag, my follow through...\n  The flag.\n  ...towards the flag. If I want the ball going to the cougar, my follow through...\n  The cougar.\n  ...going to the cougar. But right now we're working on hitting it straight so my follow through goes to my target. Watch, see me take everything out. Ball's at my waist, my opposite foot is forward, tick...\n  Tock.\n  Tock, just like that. Okay? We'll do it a little bit farther. Ready, John? Opposite foot forward, ball at the waist, tick, tock. All right. Did you see everything that we had just talked about? Opposite foot forward, ball at the waist, tick, transfer my weight into tock. All right.\n  You're kind of hitting it like that.\n  I hit it.\n  Good. That's great.  Tony, you ready? ...Tony? You ready? Tossin' it up and hittin' it...\n And stop just a second, put the ball on the ground. Ball on the ground. A lot of people are doing a good job getting that opposite food forward, but they're not transferring their weight to that foot, they're getting that opposite foot forward and they're standing like this. Am I going to generate much force by doing this?\n  No.\n  Think about baseball. I could step with that opposite foot, but if I step and then throw is that helping me generate any force?\n  No.\n  No. I want to step into it. Same way in baseball. When I throw a baseball, I want to step and throw at the same time to get my momentum going forward. We're generating force. So, instead of... Tony, are you ready? Instead of this, opposite foot forward and...like that. I want to generate more force, so I'm going to start with my weight back here and go into it. You see the difference? Ball on the ground please.\n  Yes. So, work on generating that force going forward. Okay? Continue. Go.  And... stop just a second. Ball on the ground. All right. One more way that we're going to try to generate force is by following through after we hit the ball. So, instead of... Alex, are you ready? I'm going to serve this to you. Instead of doing this, kind of almost like you're punching the ball and stopping, I'm going to follow through to my target. If Alex is my target, my arm should finish up here at my target. Watch. Do you see the difference in the force between punching it and following through to your target? So, that's another thing to work on. Remember,  if you are doing a good job with the ball that you've got, you can switch to another ball. If you've got one of these big yellow ones and you're doing perfect every time I would recommend switching to either this or one of the yellow and blue ones. Challenge yourself a little bit. Let's go ahead and switch stations so that if you were here, one person walk up here and get a clipboard and paper so you can leave notes for your partner. If you were over there, come over here.\n If you weren't over here just put your clipboard on the steps there. \n And everybody stop. Put the ball on the ground just a second. No balls in the air. Everybody stand up. Everybody stand up. Alright, put everything on the ground. Everybody should have to free hands. Together, let's work on tick, transfer your weight through to your target. Ryan, go in his place. Tick, arm back, transfer weight, follow through to your target. I still see some people doing this. Where's that ball going to go?\n  That way.\n  That way. If I'm aiming at the... Ball on the ground. If I'm aiming at the white poster, my follow through is to the white poster. Everybody pick out a target. Tick, step, follow through. Go. Pick out a target, tick, step, follow through. \n Go get that ball. We'll get you another ball. Who can raise their hand and tell me the first thing we need to remember for the volleyball serve. Yes, sir?\n   \n  The first thing we talked about. Yes, ma'am?\n   \n  The ball should be at your-\n  Waist.\n  The ball's at your waist. And what is that going to impact? And what's it going to influence?\n  How far the ball goes.\n  It's going to influence how far the ball goes. All right? So, if the ball is up here, it's going to go where?\n  Up.\n  Up. If I'm down here, the ball's going to go... Go out, so I want to add my weight in order to get that angle so the ball will go over the net and drop. What's the second thing to remember? Yes, sir?\n \n Remember, it's what we talked about with the underhand throw, four square, and the overhand throw. Our opposite foot is...\n  Forward.\n  Forward, right. Our opposite foot is forward. Like this. What's the third thing.\n  Shift your weight.\n  I want to shift my weight. We actually did tick-tock when I talk about shifting my weight, but shifting our weight is one of the most important things, because that is how we produce--\n", "filename": ["Copy of 075 PE EMC 075.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.179926], "annotations": [["Instructor"], ["Girl"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["Boy"], ["Instructor"], ["Girl"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["Boy"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["Student"], ["Instructor"], ["Student"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["Student"], ["Instructor"], ["Instructor"], ["Student"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Boy", "Inaudible"], ["Instructor"], ["Girl", "Inaudible"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["Boy"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["Boy", "Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["Boy"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW05", "TW06", "TW08", "TW10", "TW17", "TW24"]}, "073": {"text": " Like compared to osteoblasts... the osteoclasts to be more efficient, and work harder than the osteoclasts, therefore you're  more than you are building, so that ratio can cause brittle bones.\n  So what--Okay,  right?\n Yeah.\n One's up, one goes down.\n Yeah, if you're taking away more than you're putting back--\n No, I'm sorry, why don't osteo...\n 'Cause there's a lack of estrogen and, or testosterone that is triggering the osteoblasts to work.\n We kind of hit on that a little, I don't know.\n I kinda did, but I kinda didn't.\n What causes osteoblasts to work?\n That it? Okay, so when they're saying that the osteoclasts are working more, what they're not saying more than they used to work, they're saying more compared to the osteoblasts, okay? It's not like the osteoclasts have been activated and are elevating their activity. They're just doing what they do. It's just because the blast activity dropped, which you guys got that, the blast activity dropped. Why did that blast activity drop?\n Because there weren't enough hormones to trigger the action of osteoblasting Good.\n Is everybody get that? 'Cause see now, the blast activity's what's really dropping. And the clast activity keeps going, like it normally goes, but relative to one another, you have more clast activity, less blast activity and therefore you're losing bone. Everybody got that idea? Okay, good, you did a good job reasoning that out. Okay, you can keep going, Matt.\n Okay, our next question kind of gets off of like, the description of osteoblasts and it says, \"How can osteoblasts-- or, how can osteoporosis be prevented?\" Brooke? \n Well, they recommend having, like, a good number, a good amount of calcium intake, a day, about 1,000, 1,500 milligrams, you could do that, something simple like that could prevent like, osteoporosis in the long run.\n All right.\n I would also suggest regular exercise in order to, kind of build up the bones with weight bearing exercise, so that there's less, there's more bone actually broken down.\n Basically, a healthy lifestyle and refraining from smoking and alcohol lots of other stuff and then bisphosphonate for extremely high risk.\n Along with everything else, there's a, I went to the Food and Drug Administration, you can have Zoledronic acid, which can be injected every two years for, like, prevention along with the diet and exercise.\n Anybody else have anything they'd like to add?\n I was going to say hormone replacement therapy then some other... \n Nobody else? Okay. Now who's on to how is osteoporosis diagnosed?\n Yeah, I found the most current one is a form called Dual Energy X-ray Reabsorption Test to test the bone density, you get a score of either one or below, means you're normal, one to 2.5 is osteoporosis, 2.5 and above it's just, your bones are gonna break any time.\n All right. Anybody else?\n There's just a bunch of ways that they measure the bone density, so there's like a centimeter scanner and then a quantitative,  that's what they use, 'cause it's like really hard to detect osteoporosis sometimes and not   so you kinda need more ways to test...\n Good.\n You can also take a sample of your  and analyze it to see if there's any signs of erosion or anything that'll lead to osteoporosis.\n Okay, what's that called? Anybody know what that's called? What is it?\n Bioscan.\n Good.\n Before you even go to the doctor, like, it's  really hard to diag--, like, there's not really symptoms of it. But some of the symptoms are like  bone pain and tenderness and stuff like that, and breaking bones with little or no trauma.\n What do we call that when a bone breaks with little or no trauma? What kind of fracture?\n Traumatic.\n Traumatic would be if it was, kind of trauma. Pathological, good job, yeah! Pathological fracture, that would be a pathological fracture, if there's a disease under there, like osteoporosis, which has made it weak enough to break. Good call! So, somebody mentioned the scanner, Zach, right? You talked about that? The abbreviated, what did, what was the full name of that scan again?\n Dual Energy X-ray Absorption.\n Okay, has anyone ever heard of a DEX scan? DEXA scanner, that's where the D-E-X comes from, Dual Energy X-ray, DEXA scan, and that's very common, yeah?\n Is that like what the guy from Pursuit of Happiness, ... ?\n Yeah.\n I don't know if you ever saw that movie.\n I didn't.\n Yeah, the bone density scanner.\n I didn't know if that was it.\n Yeah, okay, so, how did they, what the general, how they actually, what bones do they look at in the scanner?\n I think it was the wrist, the hip and the spine those are the most common places for osteoporosis.\n The lumbar part of your spine, because that's the first to go\n Why?\n What else is important to consider if you, if you think about the type of bone being affected, what type of bone being affected? What type of bone? I should remember.\n Trabeculae.\n Yeah, so that's a spongy bone, right? So trabeculae of the spongy bone, why would the lumbar vertebrae be particularly vulnerable now?\n It's a spongy bone.\n Yeah, it's an irregular shaped bone, but the body of the vertebrae, is basically a cortex in, and it's a spongy bone in there, it's all trabeculae. What was the other bones that you said, Madhura?\n Wrist and hip.\n Okay, so hip as in, what do you mean by that do you think, Robert?\n Ilium.\n Ilium!\n It's all a spongy bone.\n A spongy bone in the ilium, good place to look for it. But, here's the thing, what about the wrist? How come, think from a practical scenario, how come the wrist? Yeah, Lexi.\n I think it's 'cause you use it like, so often, that they  is probably the most common  because you use your wrist for like basically...\n Do you use it a lot? Another possible reason?\n Yeah, Kevin?\n Because it's a lot of like small bones so, they  may be easier to break, or like, be more fragile.\n Okay, that's a possibility. Mikey?\n I would say 'cause it's easy to get to, like, it's pretty hard to take like--, and actually have your hip where they do like biopsies going in to your hip. It's kinda hard to get like a good angle, but like your wrist can, there's not a lot of like skin or muscle covering it, so they can like put it under a scanner and get a pretty good picture.\n Okay, thank you for that. That's exactly  why they use the wrist. I mean the wrist bones, when you think about 'em, you know, they're not weight bearing, so they're probably not the best to evaluate for osteoporosis, it would be better to evaluate weight bearing bones, but they do have spongy bone in them, they're little irregular shaped bones, which have a cortex with some spongy bone. So there is some material in there to evaluate, but you don't have to disrobe, you don't have to do anything, you just put your arm in the machine and they can do what's called a screening, a screening test. Has anyone had a screening test for anything ever before? Or thought of, ever heard of screening tests being done for other things? No? Not familiar with the screening tests?\n I think I've had one.\n Have you?\n Yeah, because, if I had, like, it wasn't for bones though--\n It could be for anything.\n Like they were looking for appendicitis, but they couldn't find it so they were doing other-- all these other kinds of tests, I don't know if that...\n Well, a screening test, it could be, it could be a screening test. Screening tests are basically more generalized testing, not the most specific, but meant just to give you a clue if something needs further evaluation, okay? So if you put your arm in the scanner, and it was towards the low end, it's not the best for making an end all, you know, quantitative diagnosis. But it's a good for determining if we should go ahead and do a scan of the lumbar spine or ilium, you see? So that's why the arm. So it's interesting that you brought that up, that was really good, 'cause it really helps us look at the whole, \"Where is this occurring?\" and \"Why do they use those specific bones?\" Okay, Matt, anything else there?\n Our next question, we have already said how it's diagnosed, we know what it is. So, how can we treat osteoporosis?\n Well I said, I found online that there were really no treatments, like true treatments for osteoporosis. It's more of trying to prevent it, by getting enough calcium and all the other stuff we said before, because you can't really treat it once it's gone.\n Well, that's funny, I found something a little different, there's a few medicines right now, like talking about, you've seen all those commercials and weird stuff that actually do prevent it. Now, they're actually saying, like helping you actually reabsorb the calcium that you've lost from the bones. But it's, also something kind of funny I saw, if the bones start to become more dense, they also found that like around your jaw, starts to deteriorate faster, some reason actually get like sore throat. So I was wondering if anyone, try to reason that out. Because I could not figure out why, just your jaw starts losing calcium, but your long bones, start gaining it.\n Are you saying that they're taking medication and then they're experiencing pain? So that--\n Yeah, like the calcium  to deteriorate. But like your long bones it's like your limbs and everything start to become more dense.\n Is your jaw a lot of , is it one of those bones... ?\n Yeah, some, but there isn't a whole lot in there, there is some. \n Is it a more compact bone?\n Probably a more compact bone in your jaw, there isn't a lot of cavity space, or spongy bone space there. Maybe that has something to do with that?\n Even having a sore throat, I don't know why that would affect it at all. Maybe because it's a horrible medicine.\n I don't know, like the thyroid gland, like this one, or the parathyroid, this is like calcium  like bone absorption, so maybe, I don't know, it's not working as efficiently, so it's not getting the through to the jawbone.\n Or maybe it's working too much or something. Maybe since your jaw is losing calcium, and it's kinda gaining, like losing its calcium, so it's probably starting the beginning phases of osteoporosis. Your hyoid bone, isn't your hyoid bone isn't it... ?\n Sort of high.\n It doesn't really touch any other bones, but it's... kinda in there.\n So it's kinda in your throat, so that could be like, I don't know, it's kinda unusual.\n Just answer this one with the general area, 'cause there's a lot of instances where you couldn't sit or lay down, for like three hours after you took it because it would deteriorate your esophagus. So I don't know, there were a lot of really bad side effects just...\n Well, what I was wondering, I kinda see like some doctors like, just wanted you to be aware in order to treat it would be prevention, would be the other side to treatment, just go do like those lifestyle changes. Instead of like thinking \"Oh, I'll wait until these signs come up, and have platelet scans and I'll take medicine.\" Just to be proactive about it and have those lifestyle changes like not being a smoker and don't drink excessively, and like, have those good workout regimens so you prevent it  rather than treat it.\n Yeah, seems like a disease that's either prevented or managed, not so much treated, but I thought, I think someone mentioned this before but the bisphosphonates... 'cause other people who get osteoporosis are people who take corticosteroids, for like, asthma, like in your inhaler. So it's something that inhibits bone breakdown, so it doesn't sound like it treats it, but it kind of manages it so you don't break bones...\n Yeah, did anyone request a name, a name brand Fosamax? Did we see that? Yeah? Did they tell you how it worked?\n No, actually--\n No, well, Fosamax is like, did you see something there, Zach?\n Yeah, wasn't that the bisphosphonates bind to the hydrocapsin crystals in bone and inhibit osteo, osteo-something bone reabsorption?\n So they're inhibiting which cells?\n  Osteoclasts.\n Okay, yeah, so that's how Fosamax and those work. They inhibit the osteoclasts, so they're not building bone, though You see the difference?\n Yeah.\n They're not really building the bone, they're stopping the erosion, it's a little different.\n But if you have like dead bone, or old bone that needs to be replaced, wouldn't that just inhibit it just as much because there's still old calcium sitting in your leg that... ? I don't know, whenever there's waste in your body that doesn't get dealt with, I mean, like when you have an appendectomy and there's waste in your appendix, that like, it can kill you if there's like waste in your body. So, maybe that would just prolong the process of osteoporosis, not so much as help it in the long run. I'm thinking, 'cause, any time you're keeping like, something that's old in your body that's not good. Like, you eat something, you have to like, you have to digest it, and I don't know.\n Yeah, it's a good thought process. Good thought process. So that's what Fosamax works that way. So if we were gonna try and design something and our job is to design a drug that helps, let's say someone who has osteoporosis, let's assume they have it now. What types of mechanisms, in other words, what types of things will we try and get a drug to do? What would we want it to do?\n You want it to like stimulate the osteoblasts like a little bit better. And someone already mentioned this, but they had like estrogen supplements, like supposedly like help out with that. Maybe stimulating more osteoblast ability.\n Okay, well go with that a little bit about the estrogen replacement. Did anyone request that as a therapy? Yeah, Kevin?\n And there's like these, like it's, like hormone therapy and we have like estrogen patches, where you can take it as a pill. So it adds estrogen to your body so, it balances out your loss of estrogen, and raises it.\n Yeah, there's like, he was talking about the hormone replacement, but I also read on Google Health that it's rarely used and it's not used twice with women. I don't know if that has anything to do with it,  I can Google it. I guess like if you use the treatment once .\n Any ideas why? Anybody find out why estrogen replacement, they used to, you know what? They used to give estrogen like they give vitamins, it used to be \"prevent osteoporosis by taking extra estrogen.\" Seriously, and it wasn't all that long ago, how come it isn't get--\n Because then your body stops producing, its like, natural estrogen, so...\n Good idea, maybe. Any other poss--, Nick any idea you can think of?\n I don't know, you're not producing enough?\n So because you're not, we should get more, well, how come, have anybody heard of anything that's related to estrogen therapy, bad things? \nFacial hair growth\n Well, testosterone can increase facial hair growth, someone else over here?\nCancer.\n Cancer, and that's the problem, they saw incidences of, particularly breast cancer, went up substantially, and so that's why, Artie, they're saying that, you know, hormone replacement, it's still being used--\n It's rarely used.\n Yeah, but not like it used to be, not like it used to be.\n So if we could stimulate the osteoclasts to work properly, or blasts, to work properly then shouldn't you like, have like some sort of treatment to, like,  make the osteoclasts work as efficiently as the osteoblasts? We would have like, sort of a difference in their relationship.\n Good idea.\n But isn't that the job of the osteocytes to basically maintain the bone? So shouldn't we find a way to, like, make sure that the osteocytes are maintaining the bone? Because if the osteoblasts are going to do their job once they're stimulated. But they have to be stimulated, so show me if you're looking for a way to stimulate them more than... make a more efficient solution at the osteocytes.\n No, that would be more like a genetic thing, 'cause your osteocytes, your DNA is like breaking down as you get older. So it's like not, it's like, I don't know, is it mutating? When it gets older? I don't know a lot about genetics, but I know your DNA kinda breaks down as you get older, and so that makes your cells not as efficient. So it might be more of a DNA kinda thing. Where you have to engineer that DNA-wise to make your osteocytes work just as well when you're, like, 78 as when you're 12. So it might be in like that area, but I don't know a lot about that, so...\n Yeah, it's interesting where you can go with it. All right? You can take this, because even Artie even you were saying something about hormones before with maybe why that treatment gave a sore throat. What were you saying about that?\n I don't know, maybe it had to do with the parathyroid gland. I don't know, maybe it like produced too much, I don't know, the jaw bone, and it reached the jawbone first and I thought that it had too much and like released all of it and went to, the rest of the body...\n So which hormone of the calcium related hormones would we wanna increase if we thought along those lines?\n Maybe that's why your jaw's--, if you release a lot of that hormone then it's building your jaw up and when you're building bone you get growing pains. Maybe it was like a growing pain thing in your jaw? Maybe.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 073 SCI AYA 073.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.177378], "annotations": [["inaudible"], ["Instructor", "inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible", "inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW06", "TW08", "TW13", "TW15", "TW24"]}, "157": {"text": " Like a long A?\n Not long A.\n Long O?\n No, I'll give you a hint.

You should have U-R right here, okay? And now we're going to... So what was the answer to my clue?\n  Fur.\n Fur. Spell it.\n  F-U-R. Fur.\n Keep your U-R and I want you to make the word spur. Spur. We talked about this word last week. A spur. Okay? Yes.\n Who put the things out?\n I did. Okay. Who remembers what a spur is?\n Something that you kick?\n Very good. Here's a picture of a spur. Remember there was a thing that the cowboy has on his boots that he kicks the horse and it makes the horse go fast? Okay. So I should pull down my S-P and this word is?\n  Spur.\n Very good. All right. I want you to pull down your U-R-S-E. U-R-S-E. And you shouldn't have anything in front of the U-R-S-E. You should just have it just like Madison has it here. She doesn't have anything for onset. She only has her rhyme. Okay? All right. What does that part say?\n  \"Urse.\"\n \"Urse.\" Okay. I want you to add a P and see what word you get and if you have a D, you might want to flip it over. It's also a P. Okay? All right. What word is that?\n  Purse.\n Purse. Very good. Okay. I want you to take your I-R and pull it down. And this time, I want you to make your own word with I-R. It might not be the same word your neighbor makes. I want you to make your own word with I-R. Look at all the onset parts that you have and see what you can add to \"ir.\" Good job.\n All right. Let's look at what we came up with. What did you come up with?\n Sir.\n Sir. Okay. So I'll pull down my S here. This word is sir. That is correct and I see a few people have sir. Let's see. Let's look at this one. What did you make?\n Spir.\n But what two letters actually say \"ur\" in spur?\n I-R?\n Not I-R. Remember?\n U-R.\n Yep. Let's put it up here so we remember it. Spur is S-P-U-R.\n I've got another one.\n All right.\n Dirt.\n Okay.\n Oh, yeah.\n How do you spell dirt?\n Oh, yeah. Wait. Oh yeah.\n We might not have that ending, but do you know how to spell dirt? D...\n I-R-T.\n Very good. All right. Let's move on to another one. Oh, I see that you have G-I-R. \"Gir.\" What were you thinking when you wrote that? Can you use that in a sentence? No? Okay. This one is not a word, okay? Now we're going to pull out our E-R-V-E. E-R-V-E. Let's see how quickly we can get it up. You all are doing a good job. You're all probably going to get another point. E-R-V-E. Okay? And I want you to fill in the blank. The ladies in the cafeteria blank us our food. The ladies in the cafeteria blank us our food. What can we put in front of the E-R-V-E that would complete that sentence? It's got to make sense. All right. What is this word?\n \"Erve.\"\n Let's see. What if I were to put an S? What word would I have?\n Serve?\n Serve. Does that make sense in my sentence? Do the ladies in the cafeteria serve us our food? Yeah. So what word did we come up with?\n  Serve.\n Serve. Very good. Okay. So this is what I want you to do. I want you to take all your cards just like Miss Dodd's doing here and I'm just going to put them together pretty quick. I don't have to really take my time here and then I'm going to stick them on my page. We're going to make a pile in the middle. Good job. All right. Good. And remember, it doesn't have to be perfect. Good job. And let's take it all...\n Is this yours?\n Good job.\n No.\n All right. I'm going to go ahead and hand you our story. We're going to take what we've learned and take it to text. We're going to read a story that has lots of words that have the \"er\" sound.\n This looks like .\n I have one.\n Yeah. That one's his.\n Curls that swirl.\n All right.\n I can't put it...\n Whoa. It's got 12 pages.\n Okay. All right. Let me go ahead and take those so we can go ahead and start reading, okay? Okay. You can give the students a point because you did a good job last time. Okay. I'm going to give everybody a highlighter because as we're reading, I want you highlighting words that have the \"er\" sound. Okay? So what's my title?\n  Curls that swirl.\n Very good. Do you see some words that have the \"er\" sound?\n Yes, ma'am.\n Let's highlight them. What's my first word?\n Curls.\n U-R.\n Curls. What's my next word that has \"er\"?\n  Swirl.\n Swirl. Very good. All right. Curls that swirl. What are they talking about, about curls? What kind of curls are they talking about?\n Like curls in your hair.\n Curls in your hair. Very good. Okay. As we're going, I'm going to be putting the words up here, okay? So we have curls and we have swirl and we will use these words again tomorrow. Okay, so let's open up to the first page.\n Miss Dodd? Miss Dodd?\n Highlight it again?\n No highlighting yet, okay?\n Cheryl? Oh, okay. Well, come up. No, no. We're on this page here. Page three at the bottom, okay?\n Okay.\n Okay. So let's see how quickly we can get to page three. All right. What we're going to do is I want you following along. Miss Dodd's going to model how we're going to read this page. As I'm reading, you can highlight when I say an \"er\" word. Does everybody understand the directions?\n  Yes, ma'am.\n Okay, but you need to be listening because after this, we're going to read it all together, okay? Here we go. Once there was a small girl who had hair that curled and swirled and twirled. Drop where you hand is.\n I messed up.\n That's okay. We'll go back and look at it.\n This one?\n We'll talk about it. It swirled over her shirt and way past her skirt. Okay. Now. Stop. No, no. We're going to just look at that one page because I see some things that make me ask some questions. What word did you ask me about?\n That wasn't me.\n Did you ask me about a word? What word?\n There.\n There. Okay. Let's look at the word there. Okay. Now should we highlight there?\n Yes, ma'am.\n Raise your hand if you say yes we should. Raise your hand if you say no we shouldn't. Okay. Well, let's look at it. Does it have E-R like we're looking for?\n  Yes.\n It does, but does it say \"er\"?\n No.\n No. It has a different sound. Every E-R isn't going to say \"er.\" It's just going to be special times, so in this case, should we highlight it?\n  No.\n No, okay. And it's okay if you did, okay? All right. Let's go ahead and read it together now. Everybody follow along. Let's put our finger under the first word or your highlighter is fine.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 157 LRLA EMC 157.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0113285], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW06", "TW09", "TW16"]}, "156": {"text": "  How old are you?\n  Five years old! \n  Five years old!

You said it's a good thing. Explain why you think it's a good thing.\n  It's a good thing  because we could stock the food, Drake.\n  OK, so he said two things.\n  But he might  shoot us because we might be starving and he might start to shoot us. \n  We could take him,  he wouldn't shoot us.\n  Where you at, Riley, it looks like you're sweating.\n  I'm trying to think between you two.\n  So you write down what you said you'd do, and you worry about everybody here. Who do you think is the most important? Eileen says the policeman, does everybody agree with that or not?\n  Yeah.\n  Why?\n   Because  if someone gets hurt-- He can respond to medical stuff? yeah, they're First Responders. It's a good idea. Anybody else? Can you write down reasons why you should keep somebody? Would anybody that you know that works here already? That's good, he's too old, his life would be long. So, the old sir will be able to be productive to society. Think about that. Anything else about the male professor that you maybe thought about?\n   --in support of communism.

Folks, we're about, I don't know,\n  Hey, why should we keep the male professor?\n  What's the issue you have?\n \n  OK, now this is just a question, guys, If someone's not fit, does that mean they have no potential to be helpful to society?\n  Nah, they could be really smart.\n  OK, they could be really smart. \n  But she's nine--\n  She's nine?  \n  She's nine, so,  are you looking for right now or are you looking for the long run?\n  We're talking  about the long run.\n  The long run, so you got time. So just consider all aspects, just because maybe just because she has... does she have anything to offer? Let the group decide, it sounds like some people are really for and some maybe are against it. \n  If you want a male farmer, say aye.\n  Aye.\n  If you want the male professional, say aye.\n  Aye. \n  If you want the female  scientist, say aye.\n  Aye.  If you want the  male preacher, say aye.  Aye.\n  Definitely female nurse.\n  We already have a nurse.\n  We already have a nurse!\n  Who cares?\n  I do.\n  In case he dies-- \n  But the female med student's only in second year, she hasn't even been to the hospital.\n  It might go for four years.\n  Exactly.\n  We got the scientist and the nurse to help her.\n  Plus she'd be off breeding.\n  Excuse me?\n  No offence. \n  You know we only got like thirty minutes.\n  We only have fifteen, so...\n  Hey, we're about 5 or 10 more minutes, and then I'm gonna stop you in groups and you'll listen. If you have not managed to already make your decisions, here's the key point, here's the key point... Still got a group talking, you need to listen. About five or ten more minutes, you need to come down to your five, you need to have the reasons why you chose the five, and we're gonna share those, and reasons why you did not choose the five you didn't choose. Keep in mind, Edna, keep in mind that five are going with you to start this new civilization that's gonna hopefully flourish, and I hope you're all taking people with, uh, that you know will make it. But there's also, you gotta keep in mind, there's five people you're leaving behind, that most likely is not gonna make it. But you, you're concentrating on who you need to start this new productive society, OK? OK, start closing up in the next five or ten minutes, about who you're choosing, who you're not choosing. Those radiation levels are getting high, very high. Over here especially.\n  I know, really!\n  I kinda changed  my mind about that. Because she's cute. \n  You can't change times and down.\n  I'm agreeing with that.\n  Say aye again,  if you want-- .\n  Aye.\n  Finally...\n  They wanna take  cripple girl and I'm saying...\n  He's still overruled.\n  I posed this question  just a minute ago. So, this is, so we can look at mass... So we can look at it two ways, one you're looking at: \"She can't do anything, she's gonna be hard to keep, because someone will have to do it, second way of looking at it, she... And she doesn't have her doctor. Uh, is that true? Once she had a doctor. \n  OK, and then what else? \n  Have you ever heard anything about...\n  Yup. \n  So what if this person could be maybe a scientist or a...\n  It didn't say that.\n  But again you're not saying that she is... \n  ...you can combine that. OK, continue on. You need to start choosing, maybe 3 or 4 of your 5. And why you're gonna take or why you're not gonna take 'em. \n  OK, male professor, too old. \n  He's too old!\n \n  Five minutes! I'm giving you five minutes! Start making decisions. \n  But why do we need a  policeman if we got a lot of money? \n  Hey, I wanna share some of the tips that some of you were talking about... And one person said, \"well, she has the potential to become \"any of these things here, she has \"the potential to be any of those,\" so it might something to consider. \n  We need extra little kids, and she won't help us with no extra little kids. \n  Somebody's ready to go, just about, so you need to make sure you get your five choices. \n", "filename": ["Copy of 158 SSH EA 158 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.122567], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Riley"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Loudspeaker"], ["Teacher"], ["Loudspeaker"], ["Teacher"], ["Loudspeaker"], ["Teacher"], ["Loudspeaker"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Students"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW05", "TW09", "TW17", "TW24"]}, "108 ": {"text": " Okay. So if you're having trouble seeing it, you can go back in with a regular pencil brush. Visible enough for you? You can go back in and make it lighter. But right now, the mark makings you're doing is really good. As you want to turn, if you're having trouble making curved lines, you can turn--\n Oh, okay. All right, that helps.\n Instead of turning the tool, turn the plate and keep pulling towards you.\n Okay.\n It might make it a little bit easier to make those curves.\n Yeah, they're really tough to do. Other than that, it's been fine.\n Good.\n Is that working now that you, what we talked about yesterday with this little...\n Yeah.\n ...shadow?\n I thought it was kind of--\n Okay. And the same thing that I just told Kim, if you're having trouble with the curved lines, you can turn your plate and keep pulling towards you instead of using the tool to curve. All right, but so far what you're doing is good. You're adding all these different values. Continue with that type of texture on the edges because that's working.\n I'm just going--\n That's okay. Be patient. Have you decided yet how you're gonna treat this area in here?\n No, I'm probably gonna do what you initially told me treating the light areas from start from this bottom half and doing--\n Okay, so adding a different texture. Are you leaving the text?\n I never... I forgot to reprint it so if I do decide...\n You'll just have to reverse the text.\n Yeah, I know, and I'll, right, add it in.\n That's fine.\n I think I'll just decide it later.\n Yeah, finish your whole overall design first.\n Yes, exactly.\n And then if you want the text in it, as long as it's reversed so you print it the right way.\n Yeah.\n You can just reprint it. Okay, sounds good.\n Awesome.\n Yeah.\n So you're just... \n  Yeah.\n All right, the way you're doing the crosshatching here is really strong so continue that to make sure that it's consistent.\n Do I have to make it identical?\n No. Well, what do you think? Are these identical persons?\n It's like supposed to be but I know I'm not gonna be able to get the exact family on the other side but I think it would look fine if it was different. I kinda want it to look a little messy.\n You want there to be a little bit of a different expressive line on each one. I don't think there's anything wrong with making them separate. I know that they're trying to be echoing each other symmetrically.\n Yeah.\n But all of the textures can be different...\n Okay.\n ...to add some interest to it.\n I think it would be difficult to try to get the exact same thing on the other side.\n Right. Don't you think that it might be more expressive to add different types of textures anyway?\n Yeah, definitely.\n That's good. How did you decide that you're going to treat the inside of the mouth area? Are you gonna leave that dark or do you want it to be light?\n Well, there's supposed to be some tongue over here, but over here I'm gonna make it like... I'm gonna try to go solid black in some parts. Like I tried to do that inside the mouth.\n Yeah! That's good. That's good.\n I want mine to seem .\n So then all of those areas then will stay dark?\n Yeah.\n It'll create a nice shadow. Excellent, that's really good. Are you gonna go off the edge?\n Yeah.\n Nice, that's really good. Keep it up. And Emily, how's yours coming? Yeah, the same thing. All those little dark areas that you're working on inside in between teeth, now that you've carved out all that area, it's gonna create a darkened tone. And as I mentioned before, all the different stippling areas, that's really good. It's adding some more dimension and more depth to the figure. If you're finding that it's easier for you to pull it off of your initial drawing, if you wanna get a white piece of paper to put underneath or use a separate sheet, it might be a little bit easier to see than using the table.\n Okay.\n Good, good. This is good.\n I'm getting confused of where I'm going because if I did the backgrounds, this is the negative space that I do the crosshatching. Then it would have to continue down here.\n So you want to decide all the different types of textures that you're using in between all of it.\n Yeah.\n All right, so you've got a little bit of the crosshatching here, okay, and you're using illustrative lines over here. So you wanna try and find something in between that's a little bit different. Right?\n Uh-huh.\n Well, you haven't done any stippling texture yet.\n I was working on...\n In here? Okay, so in here's gonna be stippling. So right, then this can't be the stippling because it's gonna be next to it.\n I was thinking of here, kind of, moving this pattern down and then maybe just, sort of...\n Okay, I think that would be a good solution to that.\n It's like this area in the background.\n Okay. Now what if you decided to leave it for now by following just some of the shadows that are there and creating textures just where these shadows are and then leaving that solid? And then you can make a test print to see if you like the way that looks keeping it solid. Then if you really feel that it needs to have more texture, you can go back into it and add it again.\n Okay.\n Okay, so in here, like you said, follow the movement of these objects. Okay, this is all the chain inside the bike. So following that movement with your line would make a nice gesture. And then in here just because you have all this texture in here, you might not need to put anything else there.\n Okay.\n What's your instinct as far as feeling how busy it is now to add extra?\n Yeah, it's hard to tell because I'm not sure how it's gonna look when it's printed but I think that might be good. Because it would get kind of crazy. I think it might be nice to have--\n And you wanna still have it have a focal point. So if you go crazy with other textures in here, you might be taking away from the focal point of your art work.\n Okay.\n I'm having a hard time seeing it so you--\n I might need to get one of those blue sheets.\n Okay. The blue sheets are working? I think, you know what? Emily's been using the table. So maybe that helps her to see her white lines. That has been helping. So if you don't wanna use one of those blue sheets, you can do what she's doing and use the table.\n Yeah, I'll do that.\n I think I wanna lift it off of the book.\n So you can keep it taped to this and then flip the book out from underneath to use it or get a darker sheet of paper to help you see all your lines.\n Okay.\n Okay. You're still working on your design right?\n Yeah.\n I think you might be ready to go on to the plexiglass soon.\n Yeah.\n Because once you figure out what's going on over here...\n Yeah, I just have to...\n Yeah and all of this positive and negative space is really strong. So what are you deciding to do with all of the other areas? Are you gonna fill them in, too?\n Yeah, I think so.\n Okay, then did you decide what kind of texture that you wanna put in there when you start etching it, engraving it?\n I don't know. I don't know if I should do really fine crosshatching.\n Mm-hmm.\n But then should I put a new texture on these?\n What do you think? Do you want it to be solid or do you want to have the texture when you make the print?\n Because I think if I texture both of them, it'll be a little confusing so maybe these should be plain and not have texture.\n Okay, so you can texture crosshatching in the background and then if you make a test print first, you can decide. If they're too solid, then you can go back in with a different texture.\n Okay.\n Okay. So finish up the regular part of your design first and start working on the engraving part and then you can do a test print and decide if you want to add more later.\n Okay.\n, Room 221. Students enter through a small entryway. To their right are inspirational displays and to their left is the entryway to a traditional darkroom. This classroom is shared by two teachers. Storage space is limited. In this room, I teach three sections of Photography, Advanced Placement Studio Art, and Advanced Placement Art History. As we open up into the main part of the classroom, storage areas are visible for each class' photographic prints, a whiteboard is visible with posted assignments, and storage space where students retrieve gloves and archival sheets for their negatives. As I pan the room, you can see heated dryers for prints and negatives clearly labeled and accessible. Bulletin boards are set up for project instructions, visual examples, and critique displays. Along the back of the room is a dry-mount press and negative developing chemicals with directions and safety instructions posted throughout. Hanging from above are art history displays created by students to aid in the analysis of modern art movements. Cabinets along the back of the room are clearly labeled for easy retrieval of student supplies. In the center of the room, the printing press is stored for AP Studio Art and set up to allow for safe and organized used. Along the right-hand side of the room, there is a drawing rack for students to store work-in-progress and a light table for the preparing and viewing of photographic negatives. There is an exhaust fan here for safety as well as a paper cutter with a safety guard to avoid accidents. The file cabinets are clearly labeled for storage of student binders. The large cabinet in the back of the room is locked to safely store blades and other potentially dangerous supplies. And at the front of the room are storage bins for students to retrieve missing work or work that they might have been absent to accept. And at the front of the room is the computer for student and teacher use. The projector screen lifts to reveal a whiteboard for demonstrations and instructions.\n, Some of you are ready to print, so I wanted to go through the actual printing press process today. Some of you might even be ready to try that today. If you're not ready to try it right after I do the demonstration, you can go back to your etching or engraving, and then by tomorrow, you'll be able to run it through the press. Before I do that, I wanted to share something with you that's a little exciting, and the fact that I actually have a relative who was a professional engraver. My grandfather was an engraver. He started in the 1930s and '40s. After World War II, he was part of something called the GI Bill. Does anybody know what that is?\n Oh, I do.\n Yeah, what is it?\n They pay people to go to college.\n Yes, exactly. Yeah. After the World War II veterans came back from war, the government paid for them to go to college. And he went to a college called The Art Students League, which I was just talking with Alex about, and he had an extensive education in figure drawing and he chose the trade of an engraver. I'm going to pass some of these around. These are his actual engraved plates that he lent to me to show you. You can take some of those. So you can see that the tradition of engraving as we talked about yesterday goes back a long time. A hundred years at least or even more. But this is from the early '30s and '40s, these engravings. And these were actual etchings done with the acid bath that I explained that we don't do here because of the safety. You're doing a plexiglass engraving instead without the use of the acid. So I'm going to demonstrate how to do all that inking and you can get to see the difference between the copper plates that I'm passing around now and then the plexiglass plates that we're working with today. And it's kind of cool my grandfather gave those to me and asked if one of you would ink it up and print one for him while we were printing all of this. So I'm going to let one of you use his actual etched plates and then print it for him. All right, so the materials that we have out here include all the different colors of print-making ink. So for the most part, we're going to start with black today, but you can choose any color that you want. So you can see some of the examples that I put up here from past students. One student decided, instead of putting black ink on the white ground, he used white ink on black ground. So that's another method that you might choose to do after learning the basic process. So all the steps that we're going to go over are up here to remind you during the class period during the rest of the week. It's going to remind you of all the steps. So the first step after you've beveled all the edges in your plate that I demonstrated yesterday is to get yourself some print-making ink. And all of these materials will be out for you in front of the room and take it to your desk when you're ready. You'll take a little bit of print-making ink and put it on the plate like this. \n Just like that. And you'll use a tool called a brayer. And the brayer will hold your ink and it gives you a nice flat surface to apply the ink onto your plate. So once your brayer is filled with the ink, you'll apply it to the plate. And I'm actually using my grandfather's plate from several years ago. All right, so you'll gently apply the ink over the entire plate. \n Okay, just take a seat and I'll hand it out. \n All right. And after you have the entire plate inked, you'll check and make sure that you didn't miss any spots. All right, notice that I missed a spot there so I'm going to have to bring it back to the plate to get all of the areas covered. Once you have all the areas covered... And this is just in interest of time, I'll just show you the next step. Once the entire plate is covered, you'll take a small piece of mat board. \n I'll just use this instead. Okay, I have little pieces of mat boards for you. Okay, so you're going to take a little piece of mat board or you can use a piece of the wood that I have cut up here. After you apply the entire ground with ink, you have to remove it so you have the clean surface with everything except all the ink that's going to be on your inside lines. This has a dual purpose. It removes some of the ink for you plus it also pushes the ink down into the surface of the plate. This has been prepared for you to take off the excess ink when you're done. This will push all the ink in the surface. Okay, and then once you get most of it removed, then you can take the cheesecloth. I found one of my mat boards. Here we go. All right, so you can use the mat board here to get off most of the ink. And then you can take a piece of cheesecloth like this and you want to wad the cheesecloth into your hand like this so you have a nice solid piece of it in front. This will lift the ink off pretty easily. And after you do this process... This is the messy process, so you should take a paper towel and wash your hands after you're done with this before we move to the printing press. I'll show you how to do that. Sometimes a circular motion with this will help. So I'm going to show so you can all see. Circular motion to get off all of the ink from the surface. I'm showing you this quickly, all the steps, but I have one prepared for us to print with. Just like a cooking show, so it's ready to go. All right, so you're going to use... Flat on the table. I'm showing you this so you can see it, but you're going to do all of this flat at your desk. Get all of the ink off with the cheesecloth. If you run out of space, you could fold it over to a cleaner side and start again. Then the last step before you clean your edges... At this point, if you want to go clean your hands so you don't get it on anything again, you could go clean your hands as well. We'll take a piece of newsprint, a flat piece of newsprint and just buff the top of it again to make sure any last-minute or leftover fingerprints are taken off of it with this piece of paper. The newsprint works the best, so I have cut-up piece of newsprints for you also to make a nice, smooth surface. And before you're ready to print, you could take a Q-tip, dip it in some water, and then clean your edges. So the beveled edge that you made of your printing plates, you should take the Q-tip to clean any ink off of that bevel because the idea is to make sure the bevel around your image is clean. So this print was left up here for a reason. It doesn't have a clean edge. I wanted you to see the difference between a student that cleaned their edge and a student that didn't clean their edge. Okay, this has a nice, clean edge. This has a little bit of ink left on the edge. So when you pull a perfect print, you want to make sure you have a clean edge. And the way you guarantee that is cleaning it off--\n", "filename": ["Copy of 108B ART EAYA 108 B.srt.txt", "Copy of 108C ART EAYA 108 C.srt.txt", "Copy of 108A ART EAYA 108 A.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.139311], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW17", "TW20"]}, "608": {"text": " At first, we put only tap water in it, and then we all of a sudden changed it.\n So, but there's still tap water in with the oily water.\n So, you think that's why the control got messed up because it had too much\n  Well, that's not variables changed.\n  my only reason.\n What's the other reason?\n My other hypothesis for the control cup not growing was, like... the seeds were duds.\n  Were your guys's the oil ones? That one's not yours?\n  No. Ours is the one that's all grown.\n Oh, why don't you go get your cup and show people?\n So this is oil? Okay, well the oil one did grow really fast and all of a sudden, it died, it looks like. Kind of. So, like at first, it was normal with that thing, and then, well--\n  I don't understand that chart.\n Yeah, me neither because it looks like--\n It looks like it didn't grow, then it grew really, really fast, then it went down. Super .\n What happened was it grew, and then it over-polluted, and then it just died. Looks like that.\n Well, like. ... \n Well, like, what I don't get is, I see the other oil one, it seems like the oil one is growing bigger than the other ones.\n  It just, like, suddenly grew all of a sudden. All the oil is the same with the control, which you have all of a sudden, all of a sudden, also these diagrams. Also, in the control diagram, that went back down to zero centimeters.\n I don't know.\n Yeah, this chart might have messed up.  Because that means both these plants die.\n And then the control regrew.\n  Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.\n  It doesn't. \n It turned white, and then it died and turned brown because on my chart, it grew point... it grew ... it grew 0.14, and then 0.14 again, and then 0.04, so like alive, dead, alive and stuff.\n When it grew the second time, did it grow or did it subtract?\n The second time, I think it died, and then the last time it just kept on growing, but the first time it started growing, it grew, second time it grew one centimeter.\n What did you put in to help it grow? What did you put in it to help it grow?\n Oily water.\n So, did the oil or the manipulator control grow more?\n The...manipulative one  grew more because it grew and then it died.\n So, why do you think it did that?\n Because, like, I, what I thought is that it was too much oil on it, and then oil gets on the leaf, it like, it helps the plant grow or something. Just killing other--\n Doesn't the plant feed off the leaves? So, the oil got spread on the leaves, and then it's feeding the oil, then it died.\n Look at yours compared to mine because yours is way more controlled ones than ours does because the only one we had was the experiment plant. \n Do you, I think the reason why the vinegar or the acid rain made it grow because, like, acid is good for you, and it's mixed with water, so it's not too bad for the plant. But I think it got way too much acid, and acid actually eats things. It kills it, and that's why I think the plant is all dead because, like you said, Nolan, it did grow, because acid is good for us, but yet when we have too much, it dies. So, that's why I think this plant is all shriveled over.\n I agree with you because acid is part water, and that's what rain is, but there's a little bit of acid so water's good for you. But acid, it doesn't grow, it's not good for you, so--\n  Well, actually, it is good for you, but not a lot.\n I think you're--\n Maybe just a little bit of water in it more than acid rain, and then when we kept spraying the acid rain on, maybe it got too much acid rain. And then the acid rain overtook the water and died. So, it like decreased by a lot. That's why I think it's just like the Red Bull because Red Bull is, like gives you really much energy and then you just crash without any energy. See right there? Just like Red Bull.\n  It increases and then decreases.\n What'd you think, Misha?\n Well, yeah. I think like what you said, Nolan, because the regular plant grew just fine, and then that, the experiment grew, like, good, and better than the regular one, but then it, like, the acid overtook the plant just like Nolan said.\n What else I noticed about my control plant, it started big at first, and then it decreased in size. Then it got bigger, so it's going off and on in size. So, it actually did kind of better than this because at the end, it did better than that one and the last opposite ...\n It like, died, after the second one, it only stayed for a couple of days or a couple weeks.\n Yeah, but it was only to a point it was living because, when I did my second observation, it was still kind of full, but it was broken on the side. So it started falling into a point where it fell in and got buried in the oily water, basically. \n It died.\n My actual skin and everything, the plant grows faster, but it also dies faster, and I figured from like the oils on my hand--\n Why do you think it did that?\n Because the oil on your hand-- Because the oil on your hand may not be the exact same thing as, like, oils in a car, but oil still has the same base.\n But how does it make the plant grow faster if you touch it with your hand?\n I don't know. Instead of wearing gloves, maybe it's just the stuff inside of the oils and everything, but it grew faster, and also died faster. Like, the plant that we have now is dying faster, but this one, since it has water normally and everything, it's healthy, and stayed big the whole time. But the other one is like that  but it died.\n If you have, what you were saying earlier, when you have oil on your hand, and then it was, you polluted it with oil, don't you think you polluted that one too?\n No, well, like, it's, my whole point is that it speeded up the process.\n  What speeded up the process?\n Like the oil, when I plant a bean or something, when I plant bulbs for tulips or something, and I touch it with my hands instead of my gloves. Then it actually seems, I may just be paranoid, but it grows faster, and then my mom put hers with gloves and it didn't grow as fast. I don't know the depth of that part or something.\n I don't get what you're saying. Are you saying that you have a magic touch and you just make plants grow faster? \n No, I think it's just the oils of your skin.\n So, what would the oils in your skin do for a plant? Like the oil for your plant here?\n Is it the same like the oil that we used?\n Like, it didn't make them healthy, but it just made it grow faster because this one took a little bit longer to get bigger, but the other one-- Show me your data that suports that.\n This?\n  Yeah.\n  What's your data that supports that?\n The ... These ones.\n Yeah, the one the data that supported it was that, oops, is...  is it went with the control. It already had grown, and it was after a week, and ours still hasn't grown. And it was growing at 0.16 centimeters per day and then the next time, it was growing 2.7 centimeters a day.\n  So, what does that tell you?\n That it was growing a lot faster, but it wasn't necessarily growing as efficiently.\n Okay. What do you mean by inefficient?\n Efficient.\n What do you mean by efficient?\n I mean, like, it grew faster, but it wasn't necessarily healthy for the plant for it to grow so fast.\n So, was there other evidence that you would use that would prove that it wasn't healthy?\n Yeah, because the leaves now, they're all gross and blotchy, and they're dying and they're crunchy and not as soft and smooth as these. And they have a shine to them because of the oil.\n What, did the rate of growth confirm that?\n At first, it was kind of spiked for a little bit, and then it started going back down, and now it's dying a lot faster than the natural plant because these plants, it grows in a steady period of time. With that, it grew really fast, and now it's dying really fast.\n  So, what conclusion did you get?\n That oil still makes the plant grow, but it's not necessarily healthy for it.\n Do you agree?\n Yeah, because me and ... Because my group, my experiment, when we did this, it was growing super fast, and now it's like dying and stuff. And we think that the oil has a chemical in it that speeds up the process of the plant growing, but then it speeds up and of slows down the process of the plant dying because ...\n On the grass a little bit, and the number of leaves will only be like two, and then it shrivels up and died. And then the color would stay light green, and kind of brown, like how it is right now, and then my data was, according to my graph, the acid rain plant grew more than I thought. It grew 25 centimeters, but it started to die because of ...   It turns light brown, and started to die. The leaves increased from two, all the way to six leaves by the end.\n Okay. My question was, what would the effect be if I changed the water to salt water, and I put, if I change the water to salt, I predict that the plant will stay the same height as the control plant. I predict a number of leaves will stay the same as the control plant. I predict the color will be white-ish gray-ish. My manipulator variable is water to salt water. According to my data, I was correct because the height was the same, and the number of leaves were the same. The data shows the height of both plants were zero centimeters and the number of leaves was zero on both plants. The rate of the growth was zero. On the salt water, there was crust on it, and it was ...\n  Restate that so that Jessica gets it, and see if Jessica knows.\n And then like, we were saying, Olivia was talking about maybe how it looks burnt, and then, like, you know how water, it attracts a lot of light, and so people get tan.\n  Yeah.\n  Faster, and then so, maybe the shine for the oil maybe, it attracted more of the heat from the light, and it burnt the leaves, so.\n  Like, the glisten from it.\n  Yeah. Maybe that's why it looks all burnt and...\n Because it reminded me of when you see the old movies like how it's a burnt reel,\n Piece of paper.\n Something like sands off in the reel of a video, and you just see a hole get bigger on the burning screen. That's what it kind of reminded me of...\n Because it has a brown wrinkle around it.\n And then it's dark, and then it's kind of brown and crisp, so that's what it kind of reminded me of and that's what made me think of it.\n Yeah, and then, how I thought of the idea of it attracting the light and heat was how Olivia said that when you're in water, it attracts more heat and light to you, so maybe that's how. So, that's how I got the idea of maybe that's what happened. So, do you have anything to add, Jared?\n No.\n You, Jessica?\n No.\n Okay.\n Okay, so I think the reason why mine didn't grow like before how the salt would have absorbed the water. Because when Mr. Kelson sprayed it, all of the salt right here, you could feel it. It's all stuck to the top, so the water can't get down to the soil and all that. So, it can't grow at all.  \n", "filename": ["Copy of 608 GEN MC 608edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.170471], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW05", "TW06s", "TW23"]}, "079": {"text": "  Okay. Now, when we sang that music scale, we were... We were actually stepping up. We were going from low to high. And if you'll look over at this, you can tell these were the notes that we were singing, from low to high. The first note was a line note. Let's speak it together.\n  Line note, space note. Line note, space note. Line note, space note. Line note, space note.\n Good job. Those notes were stepping. And if you'll notice here, I've got carpet squares, and I have them with line note and space note.\n Line note, space note. Line note, space note. Line note, space note.\n Good job. That's what we sang when we sang our scale, and that's the notes that you're seeing up there, are those line notes and those space notes. All right. I'd like for us... Will you please come and find one of those carpet squares and sit behind it? Sit behind the carpet square of your choice. And let's go ahead and sit up tall on our knees. Sit nice and tall on your knees. And the next person, come in and find a carpet square, sit behind it, behind that hand chimes. And I don't think we'll need... We'll need one more person. The next person.\n  What about me? \n Five. Good job. All right. Now everyone, even if you're sitting in your chairs, you need to practice with me, because we're all going to be playing the hand chimes today. Do not touch your hand chime just yet. Let's all just practice. Start off with your hand up. Put your hand chime down a second. We're going to just practice with our arm only. And it's going to be important that you do a good wrist action because that's going to make a difference in the way that it sounds. All right, watching me. Hold, and again. Hold. Hold. Asanti. Hold. Hold. Okay, stop. Now, people down here, pick up your hand chime, and let's see if we can get that technique going. Get ready? \u266a  \u266a  One more time. Good, Now let's... Just place your fingers there under the bottom to get it to stop. Good. Now, when I point to each person, by yourself, you will play the music scale. So do not play until I point to you. Looking at me, we begin. Start with the low C. \u266a  \u266a Good job! Let's do it again. That's the scale. And these notes are stepping because it's line note, space note, line note, space note. Any time you've got two notes beside of each other, that's a stepping melody. One more time, starting with the lowest C. \u266a  \u266a Good job. Now, put your hand chime down a second. We just heard a stepping melody. Any time that you have a line note and a space note beside of each other, two neighbors playing, that's a stepping melody. I want you to stand up, please, and I'd like for you to stand up. Take your hand chime, hold it, and... \u266a  \u266a That melody. Someone raise your hand and tell me. What did it do, Logan?\n  Skipping.\n Actually.\n  It leaped.\n You're exactly right. It leaped. Because look at all these lines and these spaces that did not get to play. That's a leaping melody. Good job. London, do you remember what the difference was between leaping and stepping? I mean leaping and skipping? Can somebody help us? What's the difference between a leap and a skip?\n  If you leap, it's more than a skip.\n All right. The leaping is more than the skipping. Skipping... All right. You sit down. Put the hand chime down. And you stand up. You keep remaining standing. Take your hand chime and you play. \u266a  \u266a\n  That was a skip.\n You are exactly right. That's a skip when you just skip over one place, one person. All right. Have a seat. You have a seat. And I'd like for, Ashley, you stand up. And what I want her to do is for four times I'd like you to play your hand chime, watching me. I'm going to let her try. \u266a  \u266a Someone raise your hand. What was that? James, what was that?\n  Repeating.\n You're exactly right. That was a repeating note. The one person, that one pitch played four times. All right. Sit down, please. Now, will you please stand? You stand and you stand. Watching me. All right. \u266a  \u266a Raise your hand, please. Tell me what was that? Devon.\n  Stepping.\n A stepping pattern. And it went from high to low. You're exactly right. Have a seat. Now, last week I gave you a piece of paper, and it was something that I wanted you to do to see if you understood about leaping, stepping, and repeating on the music scale. If you'll look over at the Smartboard, there is some notes there on Number 1, some notes on Number 1. And you were last week going to circle an \"S\" if it was a stepping pattern. You were going to circle an \"R\" if it was a repeating pattern. Raise your hand if you know what those notes on Number 1 were doing. Christian, put your hand chime down and you can come up, and circle whether those notes in the Number 1, if they were stepping, or if they were repeating. You're exactly right, Christian. How did you know that?\n  It was staying on the same note.\n Staying on the same note, very good. And thank you for walking around behind those hand chimes. Number 2. Akrista, can you walk around that other way and come right here? And why don't you show us. Put the hand chime down, please. Show us what the notes in Number 2 are doing. Let's see if it's doing a space note, and then a what?\n   Line note.\n Line note and then a space note. And she is exactly right. Those notes were stepping what?\n  Down. \n Down. And Number 3. Thank you ma'am. Come this way, right around here. And she's looking at  those music notes, and she's going to be able to tell... They're right here, Number 3. All right. Let's say it with her. Line note.\n  Space note. Line note, space note. Line note.\n Right here. Are they staying all the same?\n  No!\n They staying all the same? What are those notes doing?\n  They're stepping.\n You're exactly right. They're stepping up. Thank you, ma'am. And tiptoe back to your seat. Very good job. Now, I would like for the last two people, B and C. If you'll tiptoe to your seat, I'm going to call you back up here in a few minutes. The rest of the folks, you've got to be sitting up nice and tall, sit up tall on your knees. Let's see if they can play a very familiar tune. I want you looking at the very first note, the... The very first note, Keiani. You have that low C. And what do you notice about C? C, Keiani, what's your note going to be doing? What's the word when you have the same pitch? Re...\n  -peating.\n Thank you. He has a repeating note. And G, Christian, what are you going to be doing?\n  Repeating.\n Repeating. Adam, what are you going to be doing?\n  Repeating.\n Repeating. So we have a lot of repeating notes in this song. Sit up tall on your knees. Sit up tall. Pick your hand chime up. We're going to see if we can play this familiar tune. Waiting. One, two, ready, sound. \u266a  \u266a Very good.\n  That was \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.\"\n It was Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star. You recognized it. All right. Put your hand chime down a second.\n  I was listening.\n You heard the melody. All right. Now let me see. Sitting tall. I'm going to get someone that's sitting back there in a chair to help us out a little bit. I think I would like for Christopher. Will you come and point to three people that will be able to show us a stepping melody? Oh, don't raise your hand. We'll let Christian choose. Three people that would be able to play...\n  Christopher.\n Oh, yeah, Christopher.\n Or you can call him \"Chris.\"\n That's Christian.\n All right. Tell me which three people. Just point to them. All right. He's pointing to you. Stand up with your hand chime. We're talking about stepping now. Stepping. All right. Okay. Chris has pointed to these three, tapped them on the shoulder. Let's see. \u266a  \u266a If you think he picked out three folks that did play a stepping pattern, will you just gives a thumbs up silently?  You're exactly right he did pick...\n  He did it.\n He did pick three. All right. Put your hand chime down and sit down. I'd like to call on Harmony. Will you pick two people that can show us a leaping melody? Leaping. So you can step behind them and just tap them on the shoulder. Leaping. Leaping. Leaping... Okay. Now, these two people are side by side. There's a line note, and a space note, and they're neighbors. Someone raise your hand and tell me what would they play? What would they be playing if they're neighbors? That would be a stepping. And I wanted a leap, like a frog leaps over a whole lot. So come and see if you can fix it. Real quick. Somebody needs to sit down. Who do you want to sit down? All right. Sit down. And pick somebody that will be a leaping melody. Like a frog leaping, leaps over a whole lot. All right. He stands. Take your hand chime. Play. \u266a  \u266a Now, she leaped over a space note and a line note. Give a thumbs up if you think she did it correctly. Yes, that is a leaping melody. Good. All right. Sit down. Hand chimes still on the floor. I'd like for you to tiptoe very quietly back to your chair. What we did in that song, we had several times that there was repeating notes. We had a few times where we had some stepping, side by side. And we had some leaping melodies. When we played the hand chimes it took several of us to be able to play those melodies, the melody. If you're playing a xylophone though, you could do it right by yourself.\n  I can!\n I would like, Keiani, will you step around behind here? And Sheridan, you come over and sit behind the xylophone that you choose. And Dev, Devuan, Devuan, walk around here. Walk this way. And he's going to be the teacher. I want you to choose. Sit down on your knees so that they can see what you want them to do. Choose something that you want them to play, and let them see it. Turn it so that they can see it. All right. What do you want them to play?\n  Step.\n Play a stepping melody. \u266a  \u266a All right. Good, and stop. Now, someone... Both of them did do a stepping melody. But he was playing right here. Can somebody help him out as to what might make it sound better?\n  A hit in the middle.\n He says, \"Hit it in the middle.\" Hit where the music notes are, those steps. Let's try it again. \u266a  \u266a Play 'em soft. \u266a  \u266a Great job. That is stepping. All right. Choose another one. Oh, now he wants a leap. \u266a  \u266a Good job! What do you want, Devon?\n  Devuan!\n Devuan. Repeat. \u266a  \u266a Good job. All right, thank you. Put your mallet right there on the instrument. Lay it on the top. That will be quicker for today. And tiptoe back to your seat, walking around the instruments. I'd like for Wes H. to step around and find yourself a xylophone. Step around over here. Akrista.  Sit down tall on your knees. And what do you want them to play? Tell them. She wants you to play a repeating note. \u266a  \u266a Now those were both kind of high repeating notes, very high. Do you think you could play a low one? \u266a  \u266a Good job. Now how did you know that was going to be low, Akrista?\n  'Cause the little ones are higher. Bigger ones are low.\n You are exactly right. What else do you want them to do. She'd like a what?\n", "filename": ["Copy of 079 MUSIC EMC 079.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.0286414], "annotations": [["Teacher"], ["Together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Boy"], ["music", "music", "music", "music"], ["Logan"], ["NaN"], ["Child"], ["NaN"], ["Child"], ["music"], ["Child"], ["music"], ["James"], ["music"], ["Devon"], ["NaN"], ["Christian"], ["NaN"], ["Child"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Together"], ["NaN"], ["Child"], ["NaN"], ["Child"], ["NaN"], ["Keiani"], ["NaN"], ["Christian"], ["NaN"], ["Adam"], ["music"], ["Child"], ["NaN"], ["Child"], ["NaN"], ["Child"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["music"], ["Child"], ["music"], ["Child"], ["NaN"], ["Devuan"], ["music"], ["Child"], ["music", "music", "music"], ["Child"], ["music", "music", "music"], ["Akrista"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW06", "TW12", "TW13", "TW14", "TW16", "TW24"]}, "238": {"text": " Okay, guys. I see we'll be looking at investigating fraction multiplication. Okay, so can you read the objective with me please? So, I ...\n I will be able to do fraction multiplication.\n Okay. I've also put it in Spanish just in case that helps you. Okay, so the first thing I want to discuss with you today, is, what do you think about that? Do you agree or disagree? And then, why? So, one-half, does one-half equal one-half? Why or why not? And then, give me some examples. Okay, Raul.\n It's becuase it is one-half. They're the same.\n Okay.  Abraham.\n It's like you cut a pear in half, it's gonna be in equal parts.\n Okay, so you guys are saying it's equal?\n Yes. \n Okay. What do you think? Eddie believes he thinks the same thing. Taleah, what do you think?\n I think it's the same.\n You think it's the same? Does everyone think it's the same?\n I do.\n Until you think, why wouldn't it be the same.\n Okay, so Jose is saying why wouldn't they be the same. Okay, so one thing Jose says is he's trying to think of are there any examples why it wouldn't be the same. Joe.\n It's not the same because \n No, that's just the board point.\n Is there a times?\n Nope, it's just one over two equals one over two.\n I was thinking it was a half times a half.\n Okay, so sounds to me like you guys all agree that it's the same. Right?\n Yeah.\n So now, how do you explain to me why you think it's the same? Why you think it's the same? Joe?\n Because they have equal parts.\n Okay. Equal parts. What do you mean by equal parts?\n They have the same fraction.\n Okay. Jose.\n They're both practically the same thing.\n What do you mean by practically the same thing?\n That once you cut a square in half, you have equal parts, and they're gonna be the same thing.\n Okay. Who is someone we haven't heard from? Madeline, what do you think? So I heard you say they are the same, right?\n Yeah.\n So why do you think they are the same?\n 'Cause they're both equal parts and the same 'cause half equals a half.\n Okay. Antonio, what do you think? Think it's the same? So, sounds like we're all thinking it's the same, okay. Abraham, what do you think?\n I think they equal the same thing.\n Equals the same thing. Okay, so now let's take a look at ... maybe, 'cause it sounds like we're all on the same path here. So let's take a look at something else. Are they really the same? Is that half of a ...\n Cookie.\n Cookie. Half of a cookie. Half a ...\n Pizza.\n Are they the same?\n No.\n Yes.\n One at a time, 'cause I'm hearing a lot of good stuff, but you guys are all saying it at the same time. Okay. Miguel.\n They're the same, 'cause if they weren't,  the same is just half.\n So I'm hearing, they're the same, but one's bigger than the other one, 'cause one's a pizza and one's a cookie.\n Yeah.\n Tina, you're kind of shaking your head. What do you think about that?\n I think they're both the same, 'cause they're still one-half they are just different size.\n Victoria, what do you think? Same or not the same?\n Same 'cause it's still half.\n Okay, so let me ask you this: I'm hearing a couple things, and it's kind of contradicting itself. Meaning you're saying one thing, but you're also saying the opposite. Like I heard it's the same because it's one-half, but it's different because it's ..\n Different sizes?\n different sizes. You just told me it's the same, but now you're telling me it's different sizes. \n They are both fattening!\n Oh, cookies and pizza are both fattening? Okay. Felice.\n Why I think they're still the same is because a half is a half no matter whether it's big or small because it's still chopped in half.\n Okay. So if a half of a half, so would you rather have half of $10, or half of $100?\n Half of a $100!\n Why?\n Because it's bigger!\n Because it's bigger. But I thought it was the same?\n No.\n No, 'cause it's the same thing.\n It's still half, but you're commenting, half of a hundred ...\n It has to be the same thing. Like the pizza, a whole pizza, and you cut it in half.\n Okay, you say it has to be the same thing for what to happen?\n For it to be half.\n For it to be half. But here, it's not the same thing. You're saying to me that it is equal. So which is it? \n So now you're saying you don't think they're the same.\n No. You get more pieces than a cookie.\n They're still the same.\n They're still half.\n Okay, so who still agrees that the one-half equals one-half? Raise your hand. Okay. Alright now, who says that one-half maybe, sometimes doesn't equal one-half? Okay. So we got a couple. Alright. So, Delphina, what's your thinking? I haven't heard from you. What's your thinking?\n I think it depends on what you are looking at.\n So, in case you didn't hear her, Delphina said it depends, okay. Hear what she said? It depends on what you're looking at. 'Cause she said with the money example, that you guys, well all of you unanimously, chose half of a hundred, that's $50, as opposed to $5, half of $10. So it does matter. So now we just go back to the question, does one-half equal one-half? Okay, Raul?\n I think one-half equals one-half. I think it's still the same. It's not talking about how big it is, it's just talking about a half.\n But it didn't say in the question what it was. I think the question is supposed to say what it was  to say if it's the same or not.\n Okay, so what Dallas is saying, what Dallas is saying, that it needs to tell you what one-half is. 'Cause she's saying here, the previous question just had the number, one over two, one over two. Equal. Alright, here, she's saying well all of a sudden yeah, the numbers are gone, but you have half of a pizza and a half of a cookie. So now it's not the same.\n But it's the same question. What Dallas is saying, in the question it should tell you what is it.\n It's actually like 10 fives ... five-tenths and and one-half.\n So what do you think? What's your final thought as far as one-half equals one-half? What's your final thought?\n They're still the same, it's a half.\n It's still the same ...\n because it's half.\n Okay.\n It's the same and different.\n It's the same and different. Miguel.\n  and they tell you it's different.\n Okay, so, good question. Good question. I like the look of that. Yes.\n If they are, are they the same? They're the same, it's one-half or something. One is bigger than the other one.\n Okay. Rodrigo. What about you, bud? What's your thoughts on this?\n I'm still thinking.\n You're still thinking? Or are you still, will you compete?\n I'm still basically undecided.\n Okay.  You think they're basically the same? So, you added that 'basically'. Why don't you just put they're the same? Why did you put 'basically'?\n Because one's bigger than the other.\n It will obviously still be different. Where we're going with this is, you have to understand that it depends on what your unit is. Your whole unit. Okay? Alright? So that's why sometimes you have to be careful, what it's asking you to do. Okay? Let's go on to the next one. Okay, so what does one-half look like to you? So just think right now in your head, when you think of one-half, okay? What do you see?\n Half a dollar.\n Half of a dollar.\n Half a fifty.\n Half a fifty.\n Half a gallon of juice.\n Half a gallon of juice.\n Half a body.\n Half of a body. Half of a cake.\n Half of a cake. Okay, Guadalupe, what do you see?\n Half a paper.\n Half a paper, okay. So let me take it to the next step. So what if we said the half a paper times half of a juice. Does it make sense?\n No.\n Does it make sense?\n No!\n It doesn't make sense. So we have to make sure that we know what?\n You have to make sense.\n Well, it makes sense, but how is it gonna make sense? It's what?\n If they're the same.\n If they're the same. But what's the same?\n The object!\n The object, or the whole unit, right? Like, what is it we're talking about? We talking about pizza? We talking about cookies?\n Paper.\n Paper. Juice.\n People.\n People.\n Eggs.\n Alright, so the other thing I wanna talk to you about is, does multiplication always make things larger? Bigger?\n Yes!\n No!\n So I heard yes, yes, yes and then ...\n No.\n So now then, what?\n 'Cause sometimes it makes it smaller. If you do nine times one, it's gonna be nine and if you do nine times zero, it makes it zero.\n Jessie. Did you hear her example?\n No.\n Okay, so what she said was, 'cause it's important. I want you to make sure you understood. She said that no, because nine times one is nine. Then when you go nine times zero, it's zero. So it actually made it less, right? What do you think though? When you multiply in general, when you multiply, does it make things larger? When you multiply two things together?\n Yes.\n Okay. Abraham\n It gets bigger, because like six times two, it's 12, and it gets bigger.\n Okay.  Raul, what do you think? Raul V. When you multiply, does it always get bigger?\n It depends on the number.\n What?\n It depends on the number.\n It depends on the number so give me an example.\n Zero times 8100, is gonna be zero.\n Okay. So can we ... so I'm hearing kind of like, a lot of you are saying yes, it makes it larger. But there's still like some of you who are like saying maybe not always. Like if we go back to, if we go back to that one-half, if we go back to that one-half and that dollar. Gino, what's 100 times one-half?\n Times one-half is ... a hundred and a half?\n A hundred and a half?\n 50?\n 50. I got 150.\n 150? Taylor, do you agree? One hundred times one-half is 150? Raul B.\n 500?\n Five hundred? How'd you get five hundred?\n I thought it was half of a thousand.\n A hundred though. No more thousand, one hundred. One hundred times one-half.\n Is it 110? Half of 10 is five.  Half of 10 is five.\n So what is your answer? The one hundred times one-half?\n Five hundred.\n Five hundred? Okay, so one hundred times one-half is five hundred? Tina?\n We don't know because we don't know what one-half equals.\n Okay, so Tina's saying now, you don't know what the one-half is. What if we're just talking about numbers? One hundred times one-half, what would that be? One hundred times one-half.  Let's say it's money. A hundred dollars times one-half. \n It could be five or 50. If we're talking about $100, then it's gonna be one-half of $100 is 35.\n Okay, so,\n 45. there was a lot of people talking, so you couldn't hear, but Louis is saying it depends, but if you're talking about money, if it was hundred dollars times one-half, it'd be half of $100, which is $50. Let's take that example. One hundred times one-half is 50. So then when we multiply that, did it get larger?\n No.\n Yeah.\n It got smaller. Didn't it? You start with a hundred, and you multiply and you got 50, which is less. So what do you think now? Do you think it always makes things bigger?\n No.\n Sometimes it makes it smaller.\n So, let's ... can you give me another example then? That's just ... make sure we prove it. Is there another example you can give me that makes it smaller then?\n Like five times four?\n Five times four? We start with five times four, you get what?\n 20. It's a bigger number.\n Okay, so that's if you multiply it times a half, right?\n Ten times one-half?\n Ten times one-half would be?\n Five.\n Raise your hand if you think it doesn't always make it bigger. It depends on what you multiply it by. Alright. Very good. So, we're gonna use the area model to show one-half times one-half.\n That's a whole.\n One-half times one-half Abraham says it's a whole, but let's go ahead and ... let's take a look. I'm gonna go ahead and shade in one-half, okay. And then we'll take a look to see what it actually equals. Here's a half. There's a half. How many squares are shaded both colors?\n One.\n Two.\n One out of how many total?\n Four.\n One-fourth. So, one-half times one-half is one-fourth. Is one fourth smaller than one-half?\n Yes.\n That's another proof that when you multiply, it doesn't always get bigger.\n You could make it into money. Like one-fourth is 25 cents.\n Alright, very good.\n A hundred divided by...\n So, let's take a look at another example. If we're to use an area models for this, what would that look like?\n Three-fourth. It'd be one-half, right? We'd see one-half times one-fourth. So what do you think?\n Half of a fourth? One-eighth?\n Half of a fourth, which is one eighth, he said. One-half of one-fourth is one-eighth, do you agree?\n Yeah.\n Okay.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 238 MATH EA 238 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.233604], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW06m", "TW08m", "TW16", "TW20", "TW24"]}, "033": {"text": "  Three, four, five, six!\n We have six friends at the table!

Let me see if I can untangle it. Okay, that's right, now we need a red bead. Surafel, can you sit down now? It looked like you almost fell. Alright, Alex, yours is on. Look! We have orange and blue. So now what do you do?\n My turn!\n Oh is that right? Surafel's turn! Oh you guys are great.\n Seven! I have seven beads!\n  You have seven beads?\n I'll count how many beads I have. One, two, three, four, five...\n Very good.\n Six, seven!\n Oh good! You have seven too! You have the same number. Okay, now what are we gonna do?\n It was my turn!\n Okay, who's turn is it?\n Alex!\n Okay good, take this, give it to Alex and tell him, it's, give him this part, and say Alex, it's your turn now.\n His turn.\n Oh, very nice.\n Now we can count!

I've got six!\n Look, give this to Natalie and tell her, it's your turn now Natalie. Wow, we are doing some nice work! Did you give it back to Surafel for his turn? Alex, yay! Alright, there's an orange one. Surafel, what are you going to do now?\n This is  of it all.\n What do you do now?\n  Alex!\n Pretty, yay!\n  Tell him, Alex your turn!  Uh oh! Did we have a bead get away?  Uh oh! Uh oh!  This bead doesn't want to go on the string!\n It's five, I have five!\n I like the way you're taking turns. Okay, you are almost finished! Eulet, you're working so nicely with friends.\n And the red has...\n Okay.\n One, two, three, four, five, six...\n Uh oh!\n seven, eight, nine, ten... That's okay, how did that happen?

Okay, and you have finished your turn, so what do you do now?\n You only have two left! One, two!\n Is it your turn?\n Nah.\n Okay, so what do you say? You say, Alex!\n Alex!\n Your turn! Okay friends, we're almost done. Let me see, uh oh, we need a red one! You know what? I'm going to make it so that you have the same number as your friend. Okay? Your turn! Let's see...\n My turn!\n Here we go, and you have the same number. Okay! \n Eulet, can you talk to your partner?\n Your turn!\n What are you going to say? Oh, okay, she said it's your turn. Can you say, thank you?\n Thank you.\n Okay and we are almost finished. Uh oh, we're doing some different turn taking here, but that's okay! Alright, okay, so now who's turn is it?\n Alex!\n Okay, give it to Alex, say, Alex, your turn!\n Your turn!\n Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen.\n Okay, we're not counting so much right now, we're taking turns. Who's turn is it now?\n My turn.\n Natalie's turn.\n Okay, so you tell her...\n It's Lily's turn, I'm next.\n That's right, tell her, this is Lily, Lily's turn.  Look! What happened? Did you finish?\n Yeah!\n Did you string all your beads?\n Yeah!\n You did! All of your beads are on your string. Let's look! Oh, and you too! Nice Job! Look! You did orange and blue, orange and blue, orange and lots of blue, orange and blue, orange and blue. Beautiful. Okay, I'm gonna lay it right here. Let's look at yours, because you finished and you used all of your beads. Oh look, you used different colors. You did blue, can you say it with me? Red, blue, red, blue, red.  azul, rojo, azul, rojo Can you say that, Brianna?  Azul, rojo, azul, rojo, azul.  You guys did a great job of taking turns!\n We finished! We finished!\n You finished! Look, you used all of your beads, your trays are empty. Let's hold it up and look at the colors, and the pattern you made. Can you tell me the pattern?\n  Purple, yellow... purple, yellow, purple, yellow, purple, yellow, purple, yellow, purple, yellow, purple, yellow, purple, yellow, purple, yellow, purple, yellow, purple, yellow!\n Yay! And we know that you took turns because the colors changed every time.\n It's clean up time!\n You guys did a great job! And you're right, it is, we are finished.

And what is yours?\n A substance that has nothing mixed into it or added to it.\n  Okay, so I hear three different things here, okay? I hear, pure means one substance, not mixed with anything else. I hear, pure is something that's not altered or manipulated in any way. And then I hear something's that natural. I want to know what your thoughts are about those three definitions. So do you agree with those three definitions or not? And tell me why. And tell them why.\n Well I don't think it's natural because natural is stuff that can be mixtures.\n  Can you give me examples of natural things that you think are mixtures?\n Um, like trees.\n  So what? And you're saying a tree is a mixture because why?\n Because it like, has different colors and different like, feels to it.\n  Oh, so different colors, and different feels, so like different textures? Is that what you're saying? And why does that mean that it's a mixture?\n Cause it's not all the same.\n How do you know?\n I don't know, I don't.\n What do you guys think? Do you agree with her that a tree is something that's natural, but it's a mixture? So and that was your definition, that you got natural.\n I would say it's natural. Like, some things are natural, some things aren't natural, I guess, 'cause... Think about like when a diamond forms. It's a natural thing, and it's only that substance.\n  Sure, I agree with you with that example. A diamond is a naturally occurring substance that is pure. But for your definition, what I want you guys to think about is a definition that's true all of the time. So, for a tree, I want us to use that example about a tree really quick. 'Cause you're saying it's a mixture, right? So you're saying it's a mixture 'cause you have different colors and different textures. Why is that statement, \"different colors\" an indication that it's a mixture?\n Well it's, like it, .\n  Okay. And a difference between substances? What is color an example of? Michelle?\n  Characteristic properties?\n  Characteristic property, which we know what about characteristic properties?\n  It is characteristic to that one substance.\n It's characteristic to that one substance. Okay? So would you change your definitions based on what we just talked about?\n  Yes.\n  Okay. So what I want you to do is write down what you guys now agree is the definition of pure on this piece of paper.  Okay. Hey you guys. I know you're discussing it, and I hope that you're kind of arguing against one another and defending your argument for your definitions. Here's what I'm going to have you do. Based on your conversations, it is now your job to write one definition for the word pure on this sheet of paper, that your whole group agrees on. I'll then share all those with the rest of the class to see if we're all on the same page or not. Okay? We already had one discussion where we had three different definitions. My guess is when I read what they write down, they're now going to have an agreement on what a definition is. But, I may be wrong, so let's see. Write your definition. As soon as you have it done, hold it up in the air. Pure substance, same thing. Pure, or pure substance.  Okay, so what do you want to do? What was your definition?\n My definition, well, huh?\n  What did you write, literally?\n First time, the first time?\n  Yeah, the first time. What did you write initially?\n I wrote that a pure substance is a substance that is like, clean. It's not dirty or anything.\n  Good, and then what did you change it to?\n A pure substance is a substance that has not been touched.\n  Okay, and why did you change your definition to that? Like, what made you? Did it happen because you guys talked about it?\n Yeah.\n  Okay, so what did he say that made you think that you should change it to \"something that hasn't been touched?\"\n He said like, a pure substance is something that naturally comes from the Earth.\n  Okay. So, you said it's something that naturally comes from the Earth. So is that what you mean by \"not been touched?\"\n Yeah.\n  So it's just natural and not manipulated by people?\n Yeah.\n  So it could have been literally touched, but...\n Unprocessed.\n  Unprocessed, okay. So, give me an example of a pure substance that naturally exists.\n Um... Tree?\n  Okay, so tell my why you think a tree is pure.\n It hasn't been really, been really processed or anything, it's in the forest.\n  Okay, so then, what do you know about color of substances?\n Um... Sometimes it's a characteristic property.\n  It is a characteristic property, right? Which means each substance has it's, a certain color. And for that substance it will always be that color. When you think of a tree, do you see one color, or do you see multiple colors?\n Sometimes multiple.\n  Multiple colors, so what is that evidence of? Multiple colors?\n Characteristic property?\n  It is a characteristic property, but I mean, how is having... Hey Brett? Can you please focus on what you need to be doing? Do you have your definition done?\n  Yes.\n  Okay, here's what I would like the rest of you guys to do, including Brett's group. You now, if you have your definition written down, I want you to go ahead and start doing number two. Give me your examples of pure substances. And give me your explanations. I'm going to give five minutes for that. That means 10:38. So... A tree has multiple colors. Green is going to be an indication of, of what? Would you be able to say that green would be an indication of one substance?\n Not really.\n  No, okay why not?\n Because, leaves or grass. Bark is a tree.\n Okay, so you're saying that more than, there's more than one substance maybe that can be green. Okay? But, okay, so that's fine. If there are different colors of green, do you think that means different substances? No? What about characteristic properties though? What do you know about a characteristic property?\n It never changes for a substance.\n  It never changes for a substance. So if I have two different greens, do you think I have two different substances?\n No.\n I would. 'Cause that's the definition of a characteristic property. Right, one green would be characteristic for that one substance, always. Never, ever something different. If I see a different color, that must mean I have a different substance. Okay? If I have two substances together, do you think that's a mixture or pure?\n  Mixture.\n Mixture. So, a tree. Do you see multiple colors on a tree?\n Yeah.\n What does that indicate?\n A mixture.\n A mixture of multiple substances. Is a tree natural?\n Yeah.\n Yeah, so does that affect your definition for pure? If you're saying it's a mixture, it can't be pure, but it's natural, so maybe our definition needs adjustment? So think about what you might change your definition to be now, okay? Okay, and write one down .  Are you done with this problem?   It's anonymous. Okay, well then--\n  Water isn't, is it?\n  Oh, interesting, so you guys, you don't know if water is or isn't.\n You explained on the board that one time that it was a mixture of oxygen and... Something else.\n  Okay, so let's... Okay, well what's the chemical formula for water?\n  H two O.\n H two O, so, what elements are combined to make water? Hydrogen and oxygen, okay? So I agree with you there, hydrogen and oxygen are bonded together, which makes water, okay? So do you think water is pure or a mixture?\n  Well, when they do the water definition, we were trying to decide like, if something's straight, like we could some  not a mixture .\n  Okay.\n  Then is it pure? Okay, I'm going to read your definition really quick, okay? So a pure substance is a raw substance. Nothing inside of a pure substance has been changed or added, it came straight from nature. There is no trace of any other substance. It is not a mixture. Okay, I see two definitions in there. Here's what I see. I see a definition that talks about it being, I see three. One, your definition is, \"something that \"comes from nature.\" Another one I see is, \"Something that \"has not been changed.\" Another one I see is, \"no trace of another substance.\" So that sounds like one substance. Okay, those are the three definitions I see.\n  But is there a substance from nature that hasn't been changed?\n  No.\n  Water is a substance from nature that hasn't been changed. I mean, yeah, we add things to it.\n It hasn't been changed, but it is a mixture.\n  Is it a mixture though?\n Yeah.\n But what about when like, animal live in it and stuff, does it change?\n  So you're kind of thinking maybe it gets contaminated that way? If it gets in contact with something else?\n Yeah, if they're even from nature .\n  So here's what, today, we should be able to figure out by the end of the period. And you guys pretty confidently should be able to tell me if water is or is not pure. Here is my hint. My hint to you, is the way we can tell by looking at something, if it's pure or a mixture, 'cause you can, or maybe not just by looking, but experimenting with it. It's based on characteristic properties of matter. That's what I want you to think about.\n So, it's just the primary colors, then?\n  What do you mean?\n  Primary colors?\n Well, the primary colors, I don't know. It's just that color .\n  So is color a characteristic property of matter? Yes. What does that mean then?\n  Wait, but can't you change it? When something's a color? But when you add one color to... Something . Like if I add a color to the water, doesn't it change the water?\n  When you add a color into water, it mixes with the water.\n So it's not still water?\n It still tastes like water?\n  I didn't say that. I just said it was mixed.\n  It's a mixture, oh.\n Okay, I didn't say that either, but,\n  If you put the food coloring in it...\n So, and why are you saying that's all of a sudden a mixture? Because they're .\n  So different substances together, okay. So what then does \"pure\" mean?\n Not mixed, a substance by itself.\n  A substance by itself. So you believe water is just a substance. Okay? Alright. Alright you guys! These crutches are going to kill me. Are you okay? Those hurt, you're hurt. Okay, you're okay.  We're going to talk about it right now, okay? Do I have everybody's piece of paper? Are you done? Okay.  This is not true.\n  Really?\n  Yes. Alright, turn here and stop what you're doing. Listen to what? What I want, I know that you may not be done with your examples yet. Because you're still struggling with your definition of pure. I want to show you what other groups are thinking. So I'm going to show you all these. I'll ready them for you too so that, you're going to see that we have differences. And the idea is, by the end of today, based on what we do, you should be able to change and finalize your definition. Okay? And competently be able to give me examples. Alright? So, the first one, and I'll try to move this. Let's make sure you can see this. If it's hard to see Tim, will you turn off, actually why don't you go ahead and do that now Tim? I think it will be better. I don't know. But just the front set of lights? Thank you. We'll come down. Okay. The first definition. \"An unprocessed material which is one \"substance by itself, instead of combining \"multiple substances to get the material.\" I see two different definitions. I see one, \"pure means to be unprocessed,\" and then I see another, \"one substance by itself.\" Okay? Here's another one. \"A pure substance is only one substance \"that is not a mixture.\" So you're starting to see that pure and mixture, which I will agree with, are basically opposites of one another. So you've got to explain the difference between them. So a pure substance is one substance that is not a mixture. So I'm wondering what your definition of mixture is. Who wrote, does anyone? Who wrote this one, are you willing to share? Do you have a definition for mixture then?\n  Um well, multiple substances that are mixed together.\n  Good so, you're saying, so great, your definition for pure is one substance, while mixture would be more than one substance. Okay. This one says \"a substance that has no mixture involved.\" So you're saying that there's a clear difference between the two. I still don't quite see a definition for the word \"pure\" yet in this definition. \"A pure substance is a substance with \"no other substances mixed in.\" \"It is one single substance.\" So I'm starting to see a little bit of a trend. \"A pure substance is a raw substance.\" \"Nothing inside of a pure substance has been \"changed or added.\" \"It came straight from nature.\" \"There's no trace of any other substance.\" \"It is not a mixture.\" So, we definitely have agreement that mixture and pure are something different, but I see three definitions. One, it's something that is raw, or something that, and I think this is what this is saying. Correct me if I'm wrong, but you mean by \"raw,\" kind of, in some way connected to natural. Okay, so, something that is natural versus something that has no trace of any other. So I kind of see the idea of one substance versus multiple. Okay, as a definition. Okay, maybe I only saw two. Okay. Oh I thought this one was typed. I was like, \"How did that happen?\" How did... Was that you, is that your handwriting? That's insane. Okay, I like it. It's like, prefect.\n  Woah.\n  Okay.\n  There you go.\n  Alright. \"A pure substance is a substance or material \"that hasn't been mixed with any other substance.\" \"It is only one substance.\" Okay, um. Two.  Two more. \"A substance is only one substance, \"and it is not mixed with any other substance,\" right? And our last one. Oh, this one's actually different. \"A pure substance is an element.\" Okay that's a different definition than the other things I've heard. \"They are made up of one atom.\" \"They are not mixed with other substances \"nor do they contain other substances within them.\" So I hear two definitions in here. One, being pure means that it's just an element. And then I see another one that it's a single substance. Okay? So I want to hear some of the examples you're coming up with right now. And I'm not going to say if they're right or wrong, I'm just going to try to probe you with some questions. Okay? Naud! What is one of your examples?\n  Salt.\n  Okay, so you say salt is pure. Why do you say salt is pure?\n Because we don't think any other substance is combined with salt to make salt.\n  So you're saying that to be pure means one thing, one thing in that container, and you're saying if it's just salt, that must be pure?\n  Mm hmm.\n  Okay. Miriam.\n  It has to be raw and like, like, plain, like raw salt. Like, not like mixed with preservatives or...\n  Okay, so literally just salt, that's it.\n  Yea.\n Okay. Alright, so let's take another example. Or if you disagree with them, you can also offer up your argument for that. Shaina, what do you think?\n, Well, we all thought that a diamond might be a pure substance.\n  Why?\n Well, I think a diamond can only be cut by itself, and can only be cut with a different diamond.\n  OK.\n So that's really dense, so we thought that if anything was added to it, something else would be able to cut it. And that would be something else that was less dense.\n So, interesting. What is, um ... You're talking about density. What is density?\n It's a characteristic property.\n A characteristic property. So this is good. You definitely should be starting to lean towards what you know about characteristic properties of matter. Okay? That is key to helping you understand the difference between pure and mixture. Who can tell me what a characteristic property of matter is? Hannah?\n A property that stays the same regardless of the amount of the substance.\n Yeah, a property that stays the same for a substance regardless of the amount. So what I'm hearing you say, is that you think the ability to cut into a diamond has to do with its density. And you're saying that because you can only cut a diamond with a diamond, it must mean that the densities are the same. And so, since the density is the same for the whole diamond, that means it's one substance.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 274A SCI EA 274 Aedited.srt.txt", "Copy of 274B SCI EA 274 Bedited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.00607736], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["Michelle"], ["Instructor"], ["Michelle"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["Brett"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Instructor"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["Student"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["Student"], ["Instructor"], ["Student"], ["Instructor"], ["Student"], ["Instructor"], ["Student"], ["Instructor"], ["Student"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["Student"], ["Instructor"], ["Miriam"], ["Instructor"], ["Miriam"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW05", "TW08", "TW09", "TW17", "TW19", "TW22", "TW23", "TW24"]}, "1053": {"text": " Alright. I heard the term velocity. So, I think that sounds pretty good.  Velocity of a skateboarder, the more important you're going to have. I like velocity. Keep talking amongst yourselves. I'm just kind of here to guide you along. Make sure the people here, I don't want anyone to have their back to each other. I know the room is difficult to do that, but if you guys could try to make sure you look at everyone inside of the group. I know it's difficult.\n Wait. The whole class?\n Oh, yeah. I want the whole class to discuss this.\n I thought you were doing like table and table? No, no, no. I want everyone to talk. Sorry.\n Okay.\n You guys can talk, just like I talk across the room. Feel free to do so. \n  So, someone, when we ask their velocity.\n  You need more length to the tracks.\n  Steeper.\n  You don't have to raise your hand. If you're looking in that person's eye, or you're looking in my eye, feel free to....\n  You need a longer track.\n  Distance. \n Is it the friction? \n  I will tell you that we're not going to look at friction as part of the system. \n Let's look back at that proposal for one second. Just want to make sure I didn't miss anything.  It's always good to look at what they give us.  Let's see. What science terms are in there?\n  Quantitative. Qualitative.\n  Okay.\n  Energy.\n  Oh. We got energy in there.\n  Energy transfer.\n  Oh, energy transfer. Okay. So, I think they want something to do with energy.\n It said quantitative. We should probably use the formulas for kinetic and potential energy, right?\n  Do we have them?\n Yeah.\n  We do?\n It's half mv squared, right? And then... \n What Christina said, we're going to be collecting data, quantitative, we'll probably have to use some formula that associates with this.\n I agree.\n Okay.\n  Okay.\n  He gave us the formula. \n E sub k 1/2 mv squared. Energy due to the gravitational field, E sub g mg. Alright. Let's make sure we know what each of these letters stands for. M, mass and the unit. Kilogram. G? \n Acceleration due to gravity.\n Lauren said force of gravity.  Okay. You want me to write that in? Which one is it?  Oh, its the effect from the gravitational field. Okay, that's fine. You will sometimes see textbooks that read gravitational force, but what are the units for this?  Meters per second squared. So, that can be kind of confusing, if they're calling it gravitational force, and then they're saying meters per second squared because what do you think when you see those units?\n Acceleration.\n  Acceleration, right. So, I'm going to put acceleration due to gravity. Okay. Good.\n  H is height.\n  Yeah, h is height. And that's in? \n Meters. Sounds good. Okay. So, now we go over here. Mass and kilograms and then, velocity, and that's in meters per second. Good. And then, if you remember that force doesn't like careless errors, so, maybe we should make sure that we get from these fundamental units the derived units. So, what are the units that we're going to have for E sub g and E sub k?  What is it?\n  Joules.\n Joules. Oh, that's right. How do you remember that?\n  I'm smart.\n Okay. That's good, too.  \n Oh, there was a pretest that had that on there. That sounds good. \n Okay. Great. You're taking that prior knowledge.\n  Energy is a jewel.\n Energy is a precious jewel. Alright. You want precious? Okay, there's jewels. There's semi-precious and there's precious. What are they, diamonds and rubies? So, energy is a precious jewel. Kilogram times a meter per second squared.\n  Newton.\n  Newton. Good. Newton times a meter?\n A joule?\n A joule. Right. Over here, mass and kilograms. Kilogram times meters squared over seconds squared, don't forget the square. Kilograms times a meter, again is a newton. Newton times a meter, that's going to be kilogram times a meter over seconds squared is a newton and then, multiply that by that meter, and, again, you get joules. Okay. We want to make sure that we don't, did everyone see how we got that joule there? \n Meter times another meter, right?\n  Yeah.\n Because kilogram times a meter per seconds squared gives me a newton. Times a meter, remember this is meters squared, because of that.\n Oh, okay.\n Okay. So, you know the boss doesn't like careless errors, so let's make sure that we have the appropriate units. Okay. I don't mean to interrupt you guys. Why don't you continue with that? You've got some formulas here now.\n For potential energy, wouldn't mass and acceleration due to gravity be constants, so height is the only one that that could manipulate. So, if the height is the greater distance from the Earth then it would have more potential energy because they're directly proportional. \n  Yes.\n Let me ask you guys... I can't help but interrupt once in a while, right? But, I just wanted to... If I put this marker on the table, does this marker have potential energy?\n What is the reference point?\n Oh, oh, oh. The table.\n No.\n The center of our planet.\n Yes.\n Okay. So, I heard a fight, I think that's a good thing. \n The more danger, the more fun I thought, right?\n Yes.\n They're going to wear their headgear. Is this guy wearing any head, oh he's wearing head protection.  Why is that important, by the way?\n So, the force doesn't apply to your head... \n Okay, I like that. \n Ah. Inversely proportional, right? I like that, yeah. So, it increases the amount of time, decreases the force. So, yeah, danger is an aspect here, but this guy seems like he's doing okay. He's got his headgear on, but, that's definitely, if you're designing a park, you want to make sure that the people that visit the park aren't going to be injured. There are going to be accidents with skateboards but they'll wear their gear. I'm going to step back and let you guys continue your thought earlier.\n  Okay. So, how high do we want the...\n If we want it to have a bigger potential energy, transferring the bigger kinetic energy, we might want to have the height from the reference point, which is the ground and kind of higher.\n  I heard reference point. Let me see if I can put a reference point on this.  I did just put a little, click a button and get the reference point, okay?\n  I think the thing should be on the ground. \n  Yeah.\n The weight's, like it's safer and it's possible. \n Do you want me to just to extend the...  We've got a couple of things going on here. I'm sorry. A couple people said yes, they wanted me to put that on the ground? So, if those people could say that again, that would be great. Say that again?  You want to put it on the ground. And, I think I heard a dissenting voice in the crowd. Someone that said something else?\n  I did.\n Oh, okay.\n  I said that if you increase the height, it's still possible to have it above the ground because you would have two supports on either side, technically, you'd be able to go back and forth. \n  They haven't brought in the supports for this herculean innovation. That's right. I mean, I don't think it really is going to affect the design structure, so...\n Whether it's on the ground or...\n  I'll just pull that down. That's fine.  Yeah, I don't think that's going to make a difference. That might make it easier for the person to step off the track, too, when they're done. You know, this guy's going to get really tired. There's no friction, so he won't have to step off on the nice safe track.\n But, you notice how as long as the track is longer he doesn't go back up as high, so if you have... \n  Alright. One at a time. I like this. Someone said something. Christina said something, and I think Karuna wanted to add to that.\n He goes just as high...  like there's no change because there's no friction. So...\n Yeah, then he doesn't go up to the top.  \n  I could put the pie chart in, sure.\n And, can you start him at the top? \n  Alright. So, I'm going to put the pie chart in and then you want me to, he's going to climb up the ladder, right? There's like, a pretend ladder here. And then, how's that?\n Yeah.\n  Okay. Now, I noticed when I did that, something happened.\n The pie chart. \n Oh, yeah. Why?  Sounds like a height there that's increasing, reference point is greater, I like that. Okay, I'm going to let him go.  I don't know if I can do that, actually, but I will try. Yeah, we can play around with it.\n  Make the sides taller, then he'll have a greater distance to travel and it'll actually be more.\n  I don't know if I can, yeah, I don't think I can do that. I don't think it'll, it only allows me to click on the blue dots there.\n You have to add track to do that. \n You want me to pull those off to the side? Okay.  Okay. So, you made a little bit different half-pipe.  Oh, no! Alright. So, you don't want to, look there's some thermal energy. What's going on with that?  Okay. That might've happened. But why do I now see red in the pie chart?  Yeah. There's a force that will allow for the energy to transfer. Good. Let's get him back on that half-pipe and you know guys, I don't think that it makes much of a difference in the design or engineering of this, whether we make the bottom hit the ground or have it up. So, I don't really think that is going to make much of a difference. But, we do need to collect some data, and start with this proposal, so... Where did we leave off? I think there was something that we were looking to collect there.\n  Height.\n Okay, good. Let's continue with that, please.\n Well, measuring tape.\n Oooh! There is a measuring tape. I don't even see these things. Measuring tape, oh. It even says fet, okay good. So, how's that look?\n No, no!\n  Well, what do you want me to do with it?  Going to the ground.  That's not the ground?\n From the reference point.\n  Oh, alright. I'm right on the reference point!\n Go up a little. \n  So, what do you want me to measure?  Well, where am I going to measure? From what to what?\n The reference point to the highest point.\n  Okay. I think the highest point would probably be the center of him, but they do have that nice, little red dot. Can we just agree that we're going to go with the red dot?\n Yes.\n  Yeah. Why don't we go there?\n It can't be diagonal.\n  Okay.  Is that good?\n Yeah. \n  Yes.  Shut the lights off for this measure. Okay.  Now, this measuring tape is a little tricky to work with. I wonder if there's any easier way for me to get this.  Oh. Oh, that's pretty neat. I suppose I could use a measuring tape or I actually have that, so maybe that will help make it a little bit easier, if it could speed things up. So, what do we want to say for the height?\n Seven. \n I don't know if I'd say seven.  So, we all agree it's somewhere between six and eight, yes?\n Yes. I'd say 7.2.\n And it does go over the seven a little bit, so height equals seven point...  Two. Four. Six. Zero.  You tell me or it's going to go forever! Let's start over again. Seven.  I don't think it goes to the half mark.  7.1?  Maybe we need a show of hands on this? Who believes it's 7? Who believes it's 7 meters? No one's raising their hands, that's good. How about 7.1? 7.1 meters? Alright. I got one person there. Now, I'm looking at this from an angle, right? And anytime you want to make a measure, you do want to have your eyes right above what you're measuring and obviously...  I'm just going to move over here, just so I can get, a little bit better. And then what else can I do to try to really measure this well?\n  Pause it.\n Yeah. I think I'm going to pause the animation. Now, if I was making an actual measurement, I'd make sure my eyes were perpendicular to whatever I was measuring. What do we say about, oh, that's good. What do we say about these measures that we make in science?\n  They should be, you're only as good as your measures.\n  Yeah. You're only as good as your measures. What does that mean? Kristen?\n It means that if your measures are not precise and consistent, then everything else won't be precise and consistent.\n  Can someone elaborate on that a little bit? Or do you want to add to that?\n No, someone else can elaborate on it.\n  Okay. Are you sure? I can give you a little more...\n No. \n  Okay. Let's see. Who haven't I called on at all today because I want to make sure I get everyone. \n You haven't called on Jill.  \n  Alright. I'm sure she doesn't mind repeating it for you.  I think you said, you're only as good as your measures. \n Because if your measures aren't precise, then all your other work that you're using the measures for...  Yeah, if you measure something for speed...  It would be wrong.\n  Why?\n Well no, if you...\n  It could be, you're right. If you make some poor measures, and then you go to graph it.\n No. If you take distance and then multiply it by time, then speed would be wrong. Like, if you had the wrong distance, then speed would be wrong, and then making it after that, your graph would be wrong.\n  Well, it would be wrong, right from the perspective, you said, distance times time, and speed is distance divided by time. Did everyone hear that?\n Yeah.\n  That's okay, though. You're saying, we don't want to get off the main idea here. If you're getting these distances wrong and then you're going to graph, your slope is going to be incorrect, yes? So, remember in science, we collect data. From that data, we put it in a nice data table to organize it and then we look at trends and patterns, graph it, look at trends and patterns. So, if everything starts from our measures, those next steps aren't going to be correct.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 1053 SCI AYA 1053edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0133782], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW16"]}, "1054": {"text": "  Okay, so tell us a little background about Ed.\n Alright, well it showed that he had chest pains and also his vital signs showed that his heart was very weak so we thought he was having a heart attack and also he was unconscious.\n  Okay, so because of his complaining of chest pains, be subtle from conscious or no?\n He called and he talked to the paramedics, but it also said he was obese and so that could contribute to it as well.\n  How do you suppose that contributes to having a cardiac condition?\n Generally, it can clog your arteries.\n  What can clog your arteries?\n The fat that builds up.\n  Okay, from being obese?\n Yeah.\n  Okay, is that one of the, I guess, physical signs that someone may have a heart condition?\n Yes.\n  Okay, okay, alright. Go ahead.\n It is also his blood pressure. It said it's at variable levels, so that means his heart isn't working properly or consistently. So, that means it could also contribute to a circulatory system, it could damage it. It's also another sign of a heart attack.\n  Okay, so the variable heart, or actually the variable blood pressure. And some of you had questions about that when you were doing your research. You were wondering what did this variable mean and I think what you said is exactly right, it's not normal, okay. They state the variable meaning, it wasn't working how it should. Okay, so sounds like this guy had some definite issues both with his vital signs and with his history. So, tell us a little bit why you ranked him number one compared to let's say, you ranked, who was your number, hmm? Who was your second, who proceeded him? Nelson. Nelson, so you got Ed ranked over Nelson where some other people had Nelson ranked number one, so, what do you think?\n Well, he's unconscious now so that means his heart attack started some time ago and once you have a heart attack you need treatment immediately, and since his heart attacks aren't his title, he needs it. I think it's important to see, to get treatment.\n  To get medical care?\n Yeah.\n  Okay, if he doesn't get treatment what do you think could happen?\n Probably, he'll die from the heart attack if he doesn't get treatment or paralyzed.\n  What do you mean by paralysis? Why do you think he could become paralyzed?\n I'm not sure if it's a stroke or a heart attack if you go through it if you get paralyzed or not.\n  Okay, you're not sure if it's a stroke or a heart attack that leads to possible paralysis?\n Yeah.\n  Anybody like to comment on that? Question, go ahead Jordan.\n It's a stroke. It has a brain clot and then that will cause partial, I can't say it.\n Paralysis.\n Yeah that word, but heart attack. You could have a heart attack after that using different parts, not paralysis.\n  Good point. So, Jordan says having a stroke can cause paralysis. What system is being affected when you have a stroke that could lead to paralysis? What system in our body is that?\n  Nervous system.\n  Yeah, nervous system. Okay, understand? Doban, Jake, got that? Alright, so you guys have Ed, you ranked him number one and then you ranked Nelson number two along with quite a few other people. It looks like we have some consistencies there. Let's look at group B. You had Nelson ranked number one, but then you did have Ed ranked number three. So, you didn't think Ed was as serious having this heart condition compared to Nelson and/or Monique?\n Well, Nelson and Monique had the most critical vital signs. They seemed the most, the worst, because their temperatures were in the critical zone and above where they started, so they were overheated and they probably had heatstroke or hyperthermic. So, they were not, and they were dehydrated too. When your body starts to dehydrate that's not, it really messes up all your systems. So they were...\n  What systems?\n Cardiovascular system, the respiratory system, the immune system, everything's just being attacked here because with Eve, let me see this, his heart rate was way below normal and that's the cardiovascular system. His temperature was completely 109 from all the heat from the canyon.\n  What's the normal body temperature for that of a human?\n The normal temperature is 98.6 and he's at 109.\n  He's at 109 folks. Okay, I think this was one of our hypers if you remember, Nelson and Monique were our two hypers that were airlifted into the hospital, okay? So, he's at 109.\n Isn't this like the immune system?\n  Mmhmm.\n Yeah, so that's the immune system and then his breathing rate is way down. It's at 10 respirations per minute.\n  10 respirations per minute?\n And the normal's like 20, so he's down to half. So, I think that his vital signs were way more out of whack.\n  Did you count in on the blood pressure?\n The blood pressure?\n It's really low and that means his circulatory system's not working right which means blood's not getting everywhere it needs to be. Which means he could end up having, I don't actually know if it would lead to a stroke, but like if everything's not getting blood everywhere, his brain might not get enough blood. He could have brain damage or something like that.\n  It's interesting she said stroke, talking about Nelson. Was Nelson having any type of nervous system symptoms?\n  Seizures.\n  It was seizures.\n  He was having seizures. Is that, is a seizure an event that occurs as a result of something going wrong with the nervous system? Absolutely. Think about all the systems you just named. What's going on with Nelson? Cardiac, nervous, circulatory, immune.\n Dehydration.\n Entire  bringing in dehydration. Digestive, not enough water. This guy is having a rough time, isn't he? So, if you're pretty confident in why you ranked him number one.\n  Yeah.\n Okay, comments? Anybody?\n Well, the reason we ranked him three was because we thought that he was most likely going to die and so we thought that his daughter was a higher priority because...\n  Monique?\n Yeah, because she has a better chance of survival.\n  So, you ranked him three, and it's interesting you said, \"We thought he was going to die.\" He was maybe beyond that point of help.\n Yeah.\n  Okay, so why'd you rank him three? Why not rank him seven?\n  Well, what if he has a shot?\n  He's got a chance.\n Yeah.\n  Okay, he has a chance over Mark.\n That wound to the chest.\n  Yeah, because Mark got shot in the chest, didn't he?\n You'd save him though.\n  It's interesting you said if he has a shot. Mark's the one that got shot. \n He was more stable than Nelson was though. Mark was.\n  Mark was more stable?\n Yeah.\n  Interesting, you're bringing in the whole fact of, now you're triaging it. You're saying okay, Mark's a little bit more stable even though he's got this gun shot and they were kind of vague in what they said about the gun shot. We don't know what kind of gun it was.\n But I feel like if you rank him a three, he's at such a critical position that it's either you rank him one, because he needs treatment right away or he's going to die.\n  Okay, so you're saying, he's got to be one, based upon all the symptoms, based upon his vital signs, the condition that he was brought in. If you're not going to rank him one you might as well just let him die. Is that what you're saying?\n Or early on. Like, you can't wait too long, I guess.\n You've got to rank him one to three, otherwise.\n  So he's like, what group were you?\n We're F.\n  You're F, so you had him, okay you had him at a two.\n Yeah.\n  Okay, alright,  so you're saying he's a top three?\n Yeah, especially.\n  You had a hand up.\n Oh, I was just agreeing with him. If we thought we had any chance we should be like let's not waste any time to finish this either that or just make him seven.\n  Okay, good point. Brian?\n Well, were were thinking...\n  Speak up a little bit please.\n Well, we were thinking that even though he's unconscious and having seizures he was a crooked patient, but compared to like the other ones like Albert or Mark, his symptoms weren't that of like great danger as the others, and even though his body temperature was 109, that could have been because he was going through heat stroke, but now that he's in Asprins they're a cool environment.\n  You bring up heatstroke. Why do you think he's going through a heatstroke?\n Well, I don't know, because he was unconscious, and they said he was dehydrated and everything. Well dehydration can be due to heatstroke and like I also figured it'd be heatstroke because his daughter...\n  Monique.\n Yeah, I'm sorry, Monique, it said that she was dizzy and nauseous and if she was in the same environment as Nelson was, then it's more likely that their symptoms are close to each other because if she's going through like nauseous and like dizziness then it's most likely that he is too because they're both in the same environment.\n  Very interesting. I want to come back to this point. Ryan you've got your hand up. What were you going to say?\n I was just going to say that Monique has the same symptoms for heatstroke.\n  You're exactly right. Now my mind instantly goes somewhere here. Jordan, your hand was up first.\n I was just going to say that since their temperature's so high, they're probably in shock and always their temperature is almost basically fatal levels, so just putting them, they're going from a really hot environment to a really cold environment. Or really cool compared to where they were. If they'll put them into more shock which can also be fatal, which means they're not exactly just because they're in a hospital, doesn't mean they're necessarily going to get better right away.\n  Okay, obviously they need some treatment. You don't want to go from one extreme to the other, but do you agree that they need to be cooled down quite a bit?\n Yeah.\n  They need to get cooled down and what else do they need?\n Water.\n  Water, lots of water, correct? Yes?\n You can't really say that Monique's symptoms can apply for Albert too because Monique was having like an allergic reaction to the bee sting. So, that's probably what most of the symptoms are from.\n  We forgot about the bee sting. It says she's dizzy, nauseousness, has cracked lips, is having difficulty breathing, has a rash on her legs and stomach. Okay, she got stung by a bee.\n Like, you were saying, the reason we put Monique as number one besides experiencing possible heatstroke, we also have her experiencing a very bad allergic reaction to the bee. It shows here that with the difficulty breathing, the bee sting, her body is having a very poor reaction to the bee sting and that if left untreated for longer times without getting pills and stuff like that or EpiPen.\n Getting what?\n  EpiPen.\n  You know what it is?\n  Just say EpiPen.\n  EpiPen, yeah. Epinephrine.\n Epinephrine.\n Yes.\n It should elevate them in the  largest sense where she could potentially have life threatening without her entire like, respiratory system is closing off, she loses her breathing possibly.\n Absolutely, she's having the preliminary signs of an allergic reaction here. Here's where my thought went and I said we'd come back to this point. Maybe Sean, you were going to comment or somebody else. They're both out in the wilderness, this canyon, they're both having heatstroke symptoms. Actually, Monique got stung by the bee, she's having separate issues there. You don't see anything else different about these two individuals? Sean.\n One got to stay put for a long period of time and assured a maybe cooler spot while the other still had to keep going up through the sun and the heat to try to get to the top.\n  Do you think that would have a difference in their physical?\n One gets to rest while the other still has to keep going and going and going another what, third of the way.\n  Excellent point, you know. What's the other issue between these two? Jack, you know?\n Well like, they're both in the same environment and they both have symptoms of heatstroke, but Monique got stung by a bee and at the same time Nelson has no signs of any external trauma or anything that happened to him that caused the symptoms. So, it could have even been a seizure or a stroke made him lose consciousness and causes a temperature to rise so high is because he was probably thinking that there was something off.\n  Interesting, interesting. Yes?\n Would it be their age?\n  Age, excellent. Look at the difference in their age. How old's Monique?\n 18.\n Yeah, she's 18. Nelson, the dad right? He's 51. I'm not saying 51 is old, but there's a big difference between 18 and 51, plus the fact you add in what Sean said, he's got to hike out of this canyon, he's going to try to find help, right? Is he having to expend a lot more energy?\n Yeah.\n And he's got to go uphill.\n He's go to go uphill, yeah. It's hot, he's got no water, he's got to go uphill, he's losing, basically, control of his body. No energy, no water. Erin?\n And that's why we had Nelson as number one and then Monique would go second because they both had like the heat problem, but Nelson was having, it was much more severe with him because of his age and everything. And Monique, she was sitting there for three hours after being stung by a bee, so it wasn't like, so we put her close up to the top because there was, she's already been waiting for long enough. She needs to get help like right away because she was sitting in the shade waiting for hours while her dad had to go struggle up the top of the canyon. So, they were in a really bad situation and they just needed help immediately because they'd been struggling long enough.\n  Absolutely. What?\n During our discussion we were kind of using...\n  Speak up a little bit, sorry.\n Okay so, during when we were discussing the age, we were thinking also Monique but...\n  Which group were you real quick?\n E.\n  You were E, okay.\n So, like what we thought was that since Monique is 18 years old, verses Nelson is a 51 year old, well like, it makes sense that Monique has a stronger immune system because she's more young and she has more nutrients in her body whereas Nelson could be different, but we don't know if he has any diseases like diabetes or high blood pressure. It doesn't show, but I'm just saying in general. We were writing specific about his other health because I wrote that down.\n  Age related diseases.\n  Age related diseases, yeah. So, we're missing some medical history.\n Yeah, so it's possible there because he's older and because his immune system isn't as strong as Monique's is, we have to like, or doctors have to like protect them with treatment more early because his immune system is much more weak compared to his daughter's.\n  Absolutely. As doctors, medical history is so important. It's so important in the triage process and we've been through this folks. You know, you go to the doctor's office, you go into the hospital, you know, in addition to while they're taking your vital signs, what are they asking? What are they asking when you go in?\n Medical history.\n  Oswell?\n Have you had any previous stuff?\n  What's stuff mean?\n Like surgery, so like problems.\n  Okay, other medical conditions.\n Yeah.\n  Okay, what's another question they ask? Very simple.\n  Has it ever happened before?\n  Has it happened before?\n  Is it hereditary?\n  Could it be hereditary, what's your family's history? And I think that's what Brian, you were relating to back there. What are you here for today? Okay, let's look back in the chart, should I?\n At this moment when he comes into the hospital, he's obviously not having symptoms of having high blood pressure in the past and high blood pressure might have actually helped.\n  Oh, so you're asking about, you're referring to Nelson?\n Yeah, because if he had high blood pressure then that might have actually helped keep his blood pressure up to normal if it went down severely because of what happened in the canyon. But because it's so low, I would guess that he doesn't have a history of high blood pressure.\n  Okay, you might want to disagree with that and take history out of it. Blood pressure is obviously low. I think we addressed this a second ago. Why do you think it's low? Sarah?\n Because everything else that's going on, it's also affecting blood pressure.\n  Yeah, I think, I truly believe with the limited amount of information we have, I truly believe that because of the dehydration, the heatstroke, the no energy, no nutrients, I literally think this entire body, all the systems...\n  Shutting down? Shutting down. I really do think that. But it's a good point that you bring up because his blood pressure's 85 over 50. Does anybody, has anybody ever taken their blood pressure before? Okay, 85 over 50, that's low. I mean that gets to borderline point where, you know, you're dizzy, I mean you could have an episode because that pressure of your blood going through the circulatory system, it's not high enough. I mean that gets borderline, with instead of having to take medicines for high blood pressure, you got to take medicines to bring your blood pressure up. I think his body's just shutting down and you bring up a good point, but I think in this case just with everything else going on, I think his body's just shutting down. Okay.\n Honestly on the side of that, besides you were saying like high blood pressure could actually help. During the scenario that he's in, high blood pressure like with it's problems that it could cause with it's possible weakens the heart, could have actually killed him during the long, extended time of trying to get to the paramedics. That was due to the fact that the high blood pressure has the  of hurting muscles at a much different rate than most people. That this test could have possibly failed during the time to get to a paramedic without . And plus even had he survived the high blood pressure and got on the top, the shut down of major systems in his body would have still caused the blood pressure to get down so that there's no possible low levels that could even cause problems.\n True, yeah Blythe?\n Like on the graphs, I feel like there's Nelson, his blood pressure and the blood pressure of Elders was like similar because it was 80 over 50 whereas Nelson was 85 over 50. But we just talked about how like, Nelson's blood pressure could be low and this other instance it might not be, but with Elder he has a head injury and...\n", "filename": ["Copy of 1054 SCI AYA 1054edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.393297], "annotations": [["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW08"]}, "1057": {"text": "  Yes, I think if it's really, really quiet, and you want to talk about something, then, go ahead. But if a lot of people obviously want to talk, probably a good idea to raise our hands. Okay, what else?\n  Be involved?\n Be involved, yes. I will be keeping track of who contributes to the discussion. Because everybody has an opinion, but I need you to express that opinion. What else?\n  Don't criticize other peoples' ideas.\n Don't criticize other peoples' ideas. Okay? What might you do instead?  Suggest something, give your outlook, give your opinion. Okay. Give your argument. But don't insult the other person's ideas. This is a safe place to share ideas, okay? Now we're going to have three jobs. I'm going to need a task master, a reader, and a time-keeper.\n  Time-keeper!\n You want to be the time-keeper? Alright, you need to let us know when we've got about two minutes left of the class.\n  I want to be the task master.\n  Okay, so what does the task master do?\n  They make sure that everybody's on task.\n  Yeah, what else? What might that look like?\n  Subjects get off, or out of control.\n  So, people get off subject, we could, a little bit of crowd control. What about if everybody wants to talk and they start raising their hands?\n  You get to pick on one.\n  Yeah, task master gets to call and make sure every body gets their chance to talk. Okay? Yes?\n  Is there a praiser?\n  Actually, that's a good idea. Let's have a praiser.\n  I want to be him.\n  You want to be the praiser? Alright, Michael is the praiser. What's the praiser do?\n  Oh, can I do that? \n  Dang it, always.\n  You can team up with me.\n  Can we?\n  This class, yeah, you guys want to be a team? Okay. So, what is a praiser? What are you guys going to do?\n  Give compliments.\n  Okay, give compliments. Compliment their ideas, their expressions, okay? And then I need a reader. Preferably somebody on that side of the room.\n  I don't know how to read. I'm unavailable.\n  You'll read?\n  No.\n  Who would like to read? \n  About five seconds before I call on someone.\n  I'll do it.\n  Okay so, the questions are all up here, there's five of them. You're going to read them so the whole group can hear.\n  Okay.\n  Okay? Alright, so, task master...\n  Oh, I'm here.\n  Okay, you're on task now, and we're going to start by having the reader read us the first question.\n  Okay, should people own ideas? \n  I don't really think so, I think it should be shared, like for public opinion. Like, public knowledge, like how they were putting the genome stuff out on the internet.\n  Great thought.\n  Thanks.\n  You're doing good.\n  Well, I think that the information should be shared, but the people who found it or came up with the idea should get credit for it.\n  I think that if you come up with an idea, shouldn't you have some like, you have conferences, everybody gets together and talks about stuff. So, why don't you have scientists and stuff, that like created this idea, come together and have a conference and talk about it, so then ideas are spread out through all those companies and stuff. And then the people that made, that contributed to it, have like a patent, I guess you would say, or just like, copy, or not copyright it.\n  Like discovered by, or?\n  Yeah, like that.\n  Good opinion.\n  So, coming together would be easier then.\n  Sometimes I feel like, if... If no one gets credited, or gets, yeah.  They won't want to like... They won't want to--\n  Put the information out there.\n  Yeah, put the information out there. Like they won't have something to, you know...\n  Work for?\n  Work for! There you go. \n  Yeah, because I think that everybody like wants a part of getting like . Because you want that credit, because you put all that effort into it. So, why not get a little bit of credit? That makes it worth it. How do you like that one?\n  Okay, second question. Should people own genes?\n  No.\n  Yes. \n  Well, you kind of already own your own genes. I mean you kind of, they're your own. Like any, unless you clone yourself, I mean, nobody else has the exact same stuff.  You could.\n  Let me give you an example of an idea of somebody owning a gene. The breast cancer gene that was discussed in the video, which is actually a lack thereof, of a particular part of a gene, that is patented by a particular company. Which means they found it, they spent money to find it, so they own the patent on it. If you are a person, you don't have to be female just to look for this, but if you are a person who would like to go look for that gene, you have to pay a patent fee to that company because they found it. That's what it means to own a gene.\n  I think owning a gene is just having a company that has a lot of money, that can be like, \"Oh I'm going to put a patent on that, \"so boo-ya, can't take it.\"\n  Yeah I don't think that's right. I mean, if someone, they should like put it open to the public, because I mean if it's a gene like, say breast cancer, they should't just keep that private and make they pay for it.\n  Yeah.\n  So, it's sort of like owning a part of a human. If you own a gene by a corporation, it's like owning a part of the person who has that gene, or doesn't have that gene. So... It's sort of a moral issue. Would you want to be owned by a company, just that little tiny part of your DNA? I wouldn't.\n  Excellent point.\n  You would?\n  Good job, Jenna.\n  I wouldn't.\n  Oh, okay.\n  You practically just went against everything we just said. \n  Anybody else have any input? \n  I agree with Jen.\n  Okay, third question. Would you want to know if you carried a gene for cancer?\n  Yeah.\n  No.\n  I would not.\n  Well, it depends on what age I'm at.\n  Because like, then you have that whole impending like, doom your whole entire life, like, \"Oh, I'm eventually going to get cancer, \"might as well just die.\"\n  That's why I die, \n  But if you do know, then you have the chance to actually deal with it.\n  You're going to have to deal with it, anyway.\n  Yeah, but if you knew, you would have all that time to realize and to put things in order in your life. You would know, you would live life to the fullest, I would. I would live life to the fullest if I knew that I actually had this cancer. I would know and I would do the best I could to live my life without settling.\n  Yeah, so the shadow of you, that eventually .\n  And that would just push me forward, considering--\n  Drive yourself.\n  Whatever I do. Yeah. And maybe, just maybe if I knew, I would work to try to cure it myself. So, then I would be helping other people as well. I would want to know.\n  Remember that there are no right or wrong answers to these questions. Please feel free to share.\n  I think my, what's it called, my opinion, I'd want to know so that, if you didn't know, and you have kids you could be passing it on to them, and wouldn't that hurt you to see that, to have your kids have cancer? Like, I would think that. And then, if like I did, I would want to know, I would, like Jen said, live life to my fullest, and... Because some things, like, if I was, per se white, I would go tanning, wouldn't that hurt your cancer? Because like, radiat-- Well that's what causes it, you know what I mean? I'd just do things differently if I had it.\n  Remember what they said in the video, it's often a maybe. It's not a \"you will have this,\" it's a maybe. There are things that they can check for that they can say definitely, you will or will not get, like Huntington's Disease, which is a very devastating disease. Remember how they talked about Tay-Sachs, which kills very early? Huntington's is somewhat similar, but it kills later in life. And starts to show signs mid-30's, and usually death is somewhere in the 40's or 50's, so that's significantly earlier, since life expectancy is in the 70's in this country. So... Would you want to know, yes or no, if you had something like Huntington's, which is definitely a yes or no, but what about in a situation that's a maybe?\n  I don't want to know if it's a maybe, because then you live with that fear that you might get it or you might not.\n  I would still want to know.\n  Yeah, because what if your body starts shutting down like, one night, and you just start twitching in your sleep?  Wouldn't you want to know that's from cancer, rather than your brain's messed up, and drugs or something, I don't know.\n  Yeah, I think I'd want to know. I mean like, instead of just not knowing what's causing all this stuff happening in your body. Some think it's because I'm a very curious person.  I'd want to know what's going on.\n  I would want to know. Because like Jenna said, like one night you're just having a seizure or something, you could take, like, medicine, like that they prescribe to you because they know what you have, rather than just like, trying to deal with it, and like, that you could die, because you never even knew what was happening. So I'd like, want to have that back-up plan with me.\n  So, just to clarify, we're talking about an offense end, rather than a defense team. So, rather than waiting until you have it and reacting, taking preventative measures ahead of time.\n  Like an inhaler for asthma. Some people have to take their inhaler every single day, twice a day, morning and the afternoon, but there's other people who don't have it as severe, or a higher risk, not as high as a risk, who only take it when they're having an asthma attack. So, what you're saying is, having like the pill every day, constantly. I would still want to take that chance.\n  So, you would you want to take the pill?\n  Yeah.\n  If you know you have cancer early enough, can't you get rid of it? Can't they get rid of it? If it's like... \n  Yes, the earlier you know, the better chance you have.\n  Yeah, that's why I would want to know.\n  I don't think it would matter that much because even if you do have cancer, that doesn't mean you're going to die from it. Like, you could get hit by a car today, and nobody could tell you that, nobody could predict that. So, I don't think... I wouldn't want to know, like if I was going to, if I have cancer or anything. I don't know, I don't think it's--\n  You don't know that that cancer's going to .\n  Yeah, and then I'm just going to be in fear all my life, like, thinking, like \"Oh, I'm going to die from that.\" When that's not necessarily... Like, the, you know, exact thing that you're going to die from. Like, it's not a guarantee, so.\n  Very good.\n  Yeah, it's because of that--\n  Great job!\n  It's because of that maybe, that maybe, like you might be, like how that guy on the video said, you have a 99% of getting a heart disorder, you might be that one percent that doesn't get it. And you spend your whole life preparing, spending all this money on preventative measures, and getting all these pills, setting up stuff, and then you go through your whole entire life, and you don't even get it.\n  That's true.\n  That, he does have a point.\n  But then wouldn't you want to take those precautions, because--\n  You'd be happy that you did, but then you spent all that extra stuff.\n  But what if that extra stuff is what made you not get it?\n  No I mean, you don't like, you don't, get all the stuff just in case, and you don't take, it's like, you don't even take the medicine. It's only for like, when you have like, Travis said, if you have a seizure, you can take that, it stops it.\n  Well, that's kind of just like getting hit by a car.\n  Exactly.\n  Preventative measures is like, looking to see if there's cars, and if you don't look I mean, you could get run over, you could not. \n  But then you also, like, what if you lived in fear of getting that, taking all these precautions, is kind of wasting your life, trying to prepare for something that may or may not happen.\n  That's why people should, at the right age when you have the right maturity, decide whether you want to know or not, and not have it mapped out when you're born, whether you're going to die or not. Or by what.\n  In the movie, how they just like, took that thing.\n  Right.\n  That would be freaky as a woman. Like, you just went all throughout nine months of that, and now you get to find out that your child's going to die in it's kind of freaky.\n  That actually brings us to our next question.\n  Okay. What genes would you want to know your children had? Why, and how would that change you as a parent?\n  I wouldn't want to know, at all. I mean, that's part of giving like, human birth, the surprise, I guess.\n  It's a gamble.\n  You can't always like, create the perfect human being.\n  Well, if you could find out, what genes they were going to have, could you fix them? Like how that person got rid of the forehead thing?\n  Right now, no. But that is a direction we're heading in. You can, right now, completely sequence your child's genome, if you have the money, and get an approximation of what they will look like and what effects that--\n  That's messed up.\n  I don't care what my child would look like, I don't really care. But, I just don't, like you could prevent it from having, these like, life-threatening diseases, like cancer or Huntington's, or like Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's.\n  But then again, that's a way of like too, like... I would want to know life-threatening diseases, but not, because like you can cure, like seizures. You can like, can't you? Like, my friend's been cured of that. She had them and then now she doesn't anymore because she took medicine and stuff, now she doesn't have it. But there's people that have been taking those medicines, and then still have it now, which doesn't make sense.\n  Is that cured, or treated?\n  Treated.\n  Yeah. Cured means that you no longer have the disease. Treated means that it's managed with medication, or--\n  It's treated, then. Wait, it's cured. Yeah, it is cured.  But, anyways .\n  How would that change you as a parent, knowing that?\n  You would know what to do if you have it.\n  Stay with your child at all times.  I don't want my kid dying.\n  Your kid's going to be in like a stroller, until age 13.\n  See, it wouldn't change me as a parent. It just wouldn't change me.\n  I think it'd make someone stronger. Because going through all of that hard times, like with your child and it being sick and stuff, wouldn't that make you stronger than having a normal, healthy child? And make you closer to them?\n  But you would still love your child the same way. You would still try to have the best memories with your child, either way. If you knew that this, that your child was going to die, or not. You would still do the same thing. Except maybe change their diet, or...\n  Take more precautions.\n  Yeah, more precautions. Pad their room. They're going to be falling over and hurting themselves or something. But, you wouldn't change your experiences with your child.\n  I would.\n Well, I wouldn't. Would you Bernard?\n  What?\n  Change your experience with your child?\n Yeah.\n  Just don't go to Disneyland, it's not worth it.\n  It's not worth it, he won't even remember it.\n  Nope.\n  Oh, the fifth question. What does any of this have to do with you?\n  Like as in personally, or as in?\n  That's a good question.\n  I'm confused.\n  Say that again.\n  As in personally?\n  Yeah, both ways, as in persoanlly and as in a generation. \n  Give yourself super powers?\n  Hey, stay on task. \n  Good job, Stella.\n  Thanks. \n  I guess you're just kind of getting us ready for the future, you know? Like, thinking, like about your children, like, in the future, like what if, like what if you really wanted to know, and then like, what would you actually do about it, if you've never thought about this before.\n  Is this technology possible?\n  Yeah.\n  Not quite yet. So, who's going to have to make those decisions?\n  Us.\n  Our generation.\n  This generation and next generation. \n  The genes are us. And if you want to know everything about yourself, if you want to know, then you have to go through the genes. But if you don't want to know, then you don't have to.\n  Yeah. And so those people that think it's like... That want to know, should... Wait, what? Never mind.\n  Should be able to.\n  Yeah, should be able to. And then, the people that don't want to know, shouldn't harp on them, they should just keep their opinions to themselves. And see it from their eyes too, and just have an open eye to it, not being so negative.\n  So what happens if, say half of society, would like to have their genomes sequenced, or their children's genome sequenced, and the other half does not want to, or doesn't have the means to, because it's probably going to cost money. Right? What might that, how might that impact society as a whole? Not just the individual. As in this country, individual's rights are paramount, right? Hmm?\n  So, it'll be messed up like it is already. \n How?\n", "filename": ["Copy of 1057 SCI AYA 1057edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.138056], "annotations": [["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW06s", "TW08", "TW11"]}, "065 ": {"text": " So, we go back, remember this. Do not breathe at the end of a measure unless you have a rest. Okay? What's happening is things are getting not broken up. Another example of that would be measure 16 to 17. You would not want to breathe at the end of 16. Now, I want to go back to 13, and I want you to do what we did yesterday, where we changed all counted eighth notes to sixteenths and we get rid of ties. So what that does at 13 is it should da, da, da, da, da, da, da... da, da, da, da, da, da... da, da, daa, da, da, da, da... da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, dum. Okay? It's kind of funny to do that on the bass drum, so just play the regular part on the bass drum, okay?\n I can try to.\n Nah, I'd rather you not, because it's going to muffle-- it's going to kind of muddy up what everyone else is doing. Try it at 13, everybody. Da, da, da, da, da, da, da. Working on accents. One, two, and ready, and go. \u266a  \u266a Look at measure 15. Da, da, daa, da, da, da, da. What's happening is some of you are changing 15 to this. Tell me what's wrong with this. \u266a  \u266a Anybody recognize what's wrong with that? Adrian?\n  You played four.\n Yeah, I played four sixteenth notes, and then I played a note on beat four. It's got a one and two, three e and up. Listen again, here's the correct way. Oops, wrong finger. \u266a  \u266a Listen again. \u266a  \u266a Try that. Measure 15. One and two and ready and go. \u266a  \u266a Again. More accent. That last note's really short, and it's really strong. One, two, 15, and play. \u266a  \u266a Now, play it the way it's written, but feel it the way you just played it. That will give you the perfect subdivision of the dotted eighth sixteenth note. One, two, ready and go, and... \u266a  \u266a Okay, see how it places it very crisply.  Let's go back to 13. Play it. Break it down into the sixteenths. Da, da, da, da, da, da, da. Ready 13, we're going to go all the way through 20. One and two and ready and play, and... \u266a  \u266a\n,  Now, I'm going to get to what we are beginning to learn today. I'm going to go ahead and put my tie up here... Now, is there anyone who can tell me what this is? What is that, Daniel?\n  A dotted eighth note.\n This is a dotted eighth note. Who can tell me what this note is? Sedekia?\n  One sixteenth note.\n It is a sixteenth note, so we have a dotted eighth note and a sixteenth note. Now remember our rule that we just went over this morning about the dot. With that in mind, can somebody tell me what the value of that note is? Cole?\n  It would last for like three beats.\n  Three beats...\n  And then you would have a sixteenth note. Okay, I think you're on the right track, it would last for three of something, but not three beats, Landon?\n  Three fourths of a beat?\n It would be three fourths of a beat, so let's think about this, remember, an eighth note in 4/4 time gets half of a beat. Everybody, what's half of a half?\n  One fourth.\n One fourth, so the dot is worth one fourth of a beat, that means that this dotted eighth note is three fourths of a beat. Well that sounds a little bit complicated, but all you need to do is think about this and apply it down here. So who can tell me what I would write for counts under this dotted eighth note? Raise your hand. Lydon?\n  Would it be one, e &?\n One e &, because that's the same as having three of both, and Jaylin what would go here?\n  a e.\n Okay, so this is just another way of writing this. Let's do a measure of counting that. Ready? And, go, and...\n  One e and a two, and one e and a two, and one e and a two, and one e and a two, and...\n Now, I want all my first row to do that four times, okay? And, go, and...\n  One e and a two, and one e and a two, and one e and a two, and one e and a two, and\n Second row, ready, and, go, and...\n  One e and a two, and one e and a two.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 065B MUSIC EAYA 065 B.srt.txt", "Copy of 065A MUSIC EAYA 065 A.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.266272], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["music", "music"], ["Adrian"], ["music", "music", "music", "music", "music", "music"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW04", "TW06", "TW07", "TW13", "TW15", "TW20"]}, "1365": {"text": " Tyler pushed the ball.\n  Okay, well how does that, how does that affect the ball?\n It makes it go faster.

Because why?\n She didn't win.\n  Oh, what do you mean win?\n She win the game.\n  Oh, did you all make a game out of it?\n Uh uh, we didn't turn a game into it.\n  Okay, well what are you doing then? He's playing a game, what are you doing Kylie?\n He's rolling and see, not playing a game. Just rolling and seeing where they go.\n  Wait a minute what? Rolling them to see what?\n How many sticks it takes.\n  So did you push all of them or are you all taking turns doing each one?\n Taking turns.\n  Oh, okay. So do you think that to find out really how far they go everyone either needs to push them or everyone needs to not push them?\n Not push them.\n  So is that what you're saying, it wouldn't be fair if she pushes hers, but no one else pushes theirs? Because pushing makes it go faster you said. Okay. Alright so, it makes it what? Makes it go farther okay. Alright, so do you wanna, do you want, was anybody else pushing theirs?\n  Rebekah.\n  Okay, do you want Rebekah and Kylie to do theirs over again? Alright, show them how you and Todd did yours so that everybody can do theirs the same.\n Now I guess I'm gonna have to get our ball. \n I need ball number two. We need a Captain.\n Miss Henderson, can I be the Captain?\n  We don't need a Captain. You're all doing what, you're being what? We're not being Captain's, we're being what?\n  Scientists.\n  Scientists. So work together. \n  Wait, don't pick up her ball. She hasn't measured it yet.\n Five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11,\n  21 sticks.\n Where is 21?\n  You looking for it on the hundreds chart? Are you looking for it on the calendar?

Do you need more sticks honey?\n 17, yes.\n  Okay, go ask another group, can you borrow some sticks?\n Another ball. \n 12, So it takes half of 14.\n Because she said, \"No, I'm using it.\" And she, and I said I have a idea and she said no.\n  What was your idea John?\n I was just trying do it on my head, like on my back of my head then down.\n  Use your head as a ramp?\n Uh huh.\n  And where did you have the ball hun?\n In her pocket the whole time.\n  Why Em? Does the ball belong to you or to the group?\n Group.\n  So if you're not using it, should you let someone else in the group use it? Okay, go ahead.  \n Roll it on my back. And now roll it. If it does it... Right here. No, I mean like right here.\n  Where do you want them to, where do you want them to start the ball? I think is what they're asking.\n In my head, somewhere like right here.\n  Because a ramp starts where?\n On the top.\n  Up high. And goes down. So if you're using his head?\n I would lay like this.\n  Oh. Did that work?\n Yeah.\n  What do we do with it, after we do our balls?\n  Okay, you can just keep experimenting with the balls and the ramps and we're gonna clean up in just a second. Put your name at the top of your paper please.\n  We used it on this one.\n  You're supposed to do all four of the balls. Ball number one, ball number two, ball number three, ball number four.\n  We would do ball number three?\n Number one is this one. How about number one?\n But this one. Which number is that one?\n So get number three, we'll have a race and we'll...   \n  So what are you all doing with the ramp now?\n We're putting it on the chair. And whoever gets it, whoever gets down to the bottom first. \n We were actually gonna roll off it.\n  Well, why won't it roll off that ramp? Because why? What stops it?\n The block.\n  The block stops it, okay. So.\n How much does it go? Try the little one. Whoever is in front of me move.\n I got 10. \n Miss Henderson, everybody is taking our balls.\n  Okay, guys I would like for you to clean up your things please. I saw some great science learning, science work, put everything back in your basket and then please meet me on the rug.  Put your paper at your seat. Quickly. Let's see how quickly we can clean up. Id like for you to come to the rug and share some things you've learned. John, you have to put everything back in your basket buddy. All the sticks and balls please. And then you may put your basket on the art table.  Thank you to everybody who's moving quickly. Thank you to everybody who's moving quickly.   Okay, let's come to the rug and let's share some things that you learned today. Move that way please. I said put your paper at your seat for now.\n Miss Henderson, Braxton said this isn't whistling. \n  Okay, well we're not gonna debate whistling right now. Okay, thanks so much for everybody coming back to the rug. Okay, I would like to know who learned something about balls or ramps or forces in your science work today? Tell us something you did, something you figured out. Bryson.\n If you push the ball it goes farther. If you don't push the ball it goes not farther.\n  Okay, alright. Who else learned something else through their science work? John.\n That when you put like a stick in front of it and then you put another ball in front of it and then like you roll the ball and see how much it goes. And then you try another ball and see like if it gets to the stick and if it doesn't get to the stick then it gets farther and, and we tried whoever gets to the stick. It goes, it's the same height then we just rolled it and then the green ball got the farthest.\n  Okay, the green, okay. Todd, what's something you learned today through your science work?\n If you push it it'll go farther and that's it.\n  Okay, alright anything else we haven't mentioned, Eli?\n There's a block in front of it and if you move the block a little it, it will go past it. If you make a ball, if you make a block go all the way across it and you have a big ball it might bounce across it or it might stop.\n  So the block stopped it sometimes?\n Yes.\n  Sometimes the ball was going fast enough to jump over it?\n Yeah. But sometimes it stopped it. Okay, Grayson.\n Well, sometimes what I did was I kinda put the ramp like that and a little block across and then I was rolling this big ball and once it hit it, it kinda like jumped up in the air and went--\n  Harleigh.\n And moved in. And for like three blocks for three sticks.\n  Okay, Preston, what did you learn today?\n If you, like if your hand go fast, the ball goes fast. If your hand goes slow, the ball goes slow.\n  If your hand goes fast, what do you mean by if your hand goes fast?\n Like if you're at the bottom and  and you do that. And go like that it goes fast.\n  What is that called that you're doing?\n Pushing the thing.\n  So if you push the ball fast it goes fast and if you push it slow, it goes slow?\n The force.\n  Interesting. The force of pushing, okay Chloe.\n I learned that when you lay it diagonal it goes--\n  When you lay what diagonal?\n What is it called again?\n  What?\n A diagonal line.\n When you lay it down diagonal it goes down faster.\n  What is she talking about Eli, the what?\n She's talking about a ramp.\n  Oh the ramp, when you lay the ramp diagonal?\n Uh huh. The ball goes fast. When you lay it straight it doesn't go fast, it just sits there.\n  Oh, so if it's, if it's less. If it's a lower ramp it goes less.

They didn't have to stay, but they decided to stay. They didn't have to do that, but they just chose to do that because they felt it was more important.\n  Well, and it may have been a choice for safety also, if they stay with him. If they run to another village, they may be, you know, picked off.\n  Trying to stick  to the customs that they are so used to, like back in normal life, and stuff like that. So, trying to get back in that. But, the fact that they did wait kept them from their real life, like their parents, and stuff.\n  But saved their lives.\n  Yeah. Okay. Emily and Simon. Simon?\n  Emily.\n  Emily and Spencer, I mean.\n  Simon? \n  That's her last name.\n  Do you believe the boys were right for getting mad at whatever his name is after they got to the village, and blaming him for missing?\n  I think anyone would get mad. They need to get it out on someone.\n  What do you mean by being right to get mad?\n  Do they have, like...\n  A valid purpose?\n  A valid reason for getting mad.\n  I mean, yeah.\n  They were probably just mad out of frustration.\n  If you would have went in with them before, like earlier, before the rebels attacked, they wouldn't have been able to see their families. So, that's what their drive has been for the past couple months, or however long they've been running. It's to get back to their families. Even if they would have died, I mean. That's what he was saying, is that he was mad at him, at Dishmrael  for holding him back, because he could have seen his family,\n  He would have died.\n  But then, later on  when his mind cooled down, he was like, yeah well, he saved my life, 'cause I would have been killed.\n  It was probably  like an in-the-moment thing.\n  I think in that  kind of situation, you always look for someone to blame.\n  'Cause there is  no way he could have known soldiers were gonna attack them, so we should hurry, and go see them. He thought they had time to go and see their family. Like, let's stop and rest, and stuff like that. There's no way he could have known that was gonna happen, so they can't really blame him, but they need to blame someone.\n  Yeah.\n  I'd want  to punch someone too.\n  I'd be so mad if  that happened to me. I understand why they would blame him, but looking back on it...\n  And how does his age impact that, also?\n  Well he's not...\n  He' not really  old enough to really think about it.\n  All he's thinking about is his family.\n  With maturity,  you think before you act, but as a little kid, you just act, and don't know the consequences.\n  Well, and he has no life experience to prepare him for this at all. There's another aspect.\n  And he used to  follow Junior, and everything he did, but now that Junior's gone, he doesn't even have that.\n  Right. Exactly. Okay, keep going.\n  War is hell.\n  Oh yeah, you can...  Sorry about that.\n  It's okay.\n  So, want to go, Kaylee?\n  Okay.\n  Ask the question.\n  The question: Girda is a young woman at the time of the book, and so was Valentino and Wutuzuwut . How do they change through the course of the book, due to the tragic events in their lives.\n  I think they're  forced to grow up real fast, because of all the pressures. At the time, I mean, Valentino doesn't know his age, but let's say, like 15 and 20; and when, I haven't read the end of this book, but she comes home to America, and so does Valentino, and they just come over; and even though they're like like a 40-year-old. So, it's kinda weird coming back to America, and trying to enjoy all the child pleasures.\n  Yeah, the whole event  just kinda makes them, you know, kinda step it up a bit. If something like this happens to you, you don't easily forget it. It becomes more of a part of you. It kinda takes out who you really are inside.\n  Yeah, it shapes you.\n  Yeah.\n  Well, and how did the stages in their life coincide. That's a good question, Kaylee.\n  Well, first of all, genocide, I thought, was basically, kind of done the same, so it was usually like they lost their families, they're forced to go out on their own, they're forced to make a life for themselves. And both of them kind of think, or know, that their parents are dead. And so, they kind of use their families in a way to keep them going, and just like other people in their lives that have motivated them, 'cause I think Ile , or, I don't know how to say her name. She kind of motivated Girda to kind of stay in the camp with her, and have maybe a friend there, where with Abek's  family, she wouldn't really have a friend, she'd just have, like she'd owe it to their family to do things for them. And then with Achek , he had William K. to help him--\n  Just had a friend to make it through.\n  Yeah.\n  So they both had a  strong friend. What kind of life did they both live before disaster struck?\n  They both had the  perfect, ideal family life, you know. They were happy. They were all together. It was, you know, like what would happen in a Disney movie, pretty much. Everything's kinda perfect. And then, something happens in the first. Both, in the person that happens to meet, their family ties are cut. And their survival depends on whether they can kinda ban together with the people around them, and kinda grow, and become stronger.\n  Yeah. I think...\n  Yeah.\n  No, you go.\n  Okay. They were just,  I mean, they were forced to grow up. And they just lived, like Ryan said, like the ideal life, with their family, or whatever. But once their parents left, they had to find a friend, or someone to group with, in order to--\n  Well, what were they  replacing? What were they replacing, with William K and Ile ?\n  Yeah. They established a family without being blood related.\n  They just had  to make it through by that. It's 'cause if you don't have motivation, then you're not going to get through things, so even though they didn't know that their... I mean, they assumed their parents were dead, but they didn't know for sure. 'Cause on page 80 of this, I mean, she said that she never saw her father again. But, just to know that their parents are alive, and they just want to regroup with them at the end keeps them motivated and alive.\n  Not knowing. They  both have that in common.\n  Right.\n  Assuming that they're dead,  but not really knowing for sure.\n  Just to keep them  motivated to survive, so it's a good tactic.\n  So what is a really  simple message that we can take from that, from both of their stories? What do you need in your life?\n  Motivation.\n  You need family. You need some kind of family unit to...\n  Survive. Or friends.\n  Everyone needs like someone to kinda like go to, and they can depend on, no matter what the situation is.\n  Right, and if you're  going to friends a lot of time, at least in like a high school, or whatever; you go to friends with questions, instead of your family, or whatever, sometimes you'll get the wrong side of view on things, and it will change your life drastically. 'Cause your friends determine how your high school is gonna be, determines how the rest of your life...\n  But also, you  got a different perspective, 'cause your family doesn't necessarily know what's going on in your own high school.\n  Yeah, so it's  good to get both, but family is more important 'cause you can count on them more usually.\n  And they're older and wiser. You need that kind of like wise person, 'cause my mom knows more than I do or my friends.\n  Yeah.\n  But you need those  relationships as connections, right?\n  Right, to keep motivated.\n  Both of those stories show that really, literally life and death situations; those connections with other humans. It is a human basic need that we have to make those connections. Or you cannot survive. I think both of those stories... That's a really good question, in looking at the stages. It also shows globally... Globally, what can we say about families? At the beginning of the story... you were talking about, it's like a Disney movie, right?\n  Yeah.\n  So what can we say about families literally around the world?\n  They're all usually together. Nobody ever leaves their children when their toddlers to go find where, like how they're supposed to live, and like, what's good and bad. You usually nurture your kids 'til they're about nineteen, and then they go off to college. I think that's just how it is everywhere. It may not be that way in some places, but you usually have schooling, and then you go off, and then you figure out for yourself, once you've got a base.\n  Yeah, they're  usually pretty perfect or ideal, until like a third party, like Nazis or the Arabians come in and just wipe that out, and changes a lot drastically to where they have to depend on themselves, and I guess their friends, since they didn't have family.\n  And that family unit seems to lend to safety, even if you're living in  Sudan or if you're living in Poland. The children both at the beginning feel very safe in their lives, right?\n  Right.\n  And if nobody knows you, what makes you... if you die who would care? That's what I would think. Like, if nobody cared about me, or nobody knew who I was.\n  That's, what,  a lot of suicidal thoughts...\n  Yeah.\n \n  I was just thinking.  I don't think that, but I'm just saying, if I had nobody to be like I care about you. You need to stay alive, or like your parents. There wouldn't be a reason to live.\n  Yeah, but like  in those stories, like they find symbolic fixtures, or whatever. I think in both, yeah, the moon. They look at the moon and they see, they just see the moon, and it's like their kinda friend. But they also hope that the moon will find their parents somewhere, or wherever they are, 'cause they don't know.\n  Yeah, their parents  are looking at the same thing that they're seeing, kinda.\n  Yeah, so it's  kinda like, right there, keeping them together.\n  And what's funny,  is that's a main... the moon is a main symbol in a long way gone.\n  Yeah.\n  And he refers to that also.\n  I think 'cause the moon can be seen anywhere on earth. It's a connection, I think, somewhere. Yeah.\n  Yeah, totally.\n  It's kinda like the  bright light in darkness. You know, the night, it's a pictch black, but the moon's shining. You know, kinda there no matter what. Good. Okay, keep going.\n  And the German's  are just coming in, and everything's getting really bad. And like going back to their past, and showing it as such a nice place. What she does, is she ends up showing how much darker it is by comparison.\n  Okay, what was the question?\n  How does the author  implement setting to contrast, good and evil? How is it affected?\n  Okay.\n  ...purpose. And we just finished talking about how it shows the atrocities to be even darker, because it's happening in this nice place.\n  But she's forced  to saying the dark side of things, 'cause she's forced into her basement, where it's all dark, and you know, there's mildew on the wall, and it's flooded, and it's just really gross down there. And that's what's happening outside of the happy little hometown that she grew up in. And then, her childhood is marked with flowers and the sunny days. You know, running with her friends, and chasing butterflies, and eating sweets. And it's just really happy, and bright, and cheery. And so, there's a major contrast.\n  And, as you go into the  book, does that darkness continue? Or is it broken by light? How does she portray darkness and light even when she goes to the camps?\n  There's...\n  Go ahead, but I have an answer.\n  OK. \n  At least up to the point where we've read, she's kind of reached a climax of how bad things are when her parents were taken away from her and everything. Arthur's letters stopped coming. And that's kind of the climax from how far we've gotten, where the darkness is. So now it's about finding the good things that are in that darkness.\n  Right. I think she has little flashes of good things, and the smallest of things to us brings such hope to her, of a bright future. But it is surrounded by darkness.\n  And in the camp, did she talk about physically light and dark also?\n  Like the dramas,  and she wrote plays; And they had fun there.\n  The single light shining in the dark room .\n  Do you have anything to add, Abbey? Can you think of times when she talked about light? Physically, light in the camps? I was trying to think. And how does she portray it? 'Cause that is an interesting motif in the book, the light and dark. And it will continue to play a part. Which camp is she in at the middle part?\n  She's in the, I can't pronounce it. It's the first one, where she's, they're sewing, they're weaving.\n  So they're at the looms, right?\n  Yeah, they're at the looms.\n  Did she pass  through Auschwitz? Or was that the one, she was in jail? I think she passed through Volkenheim ?\n  Yeah. Does she ever get outside? That would be a key, at Volkenheim .\n  Outside of the camp itself?\n  Just outside, in the outside.\n  Well, here's a  reference to outside. She talks about how the night was starry and beautiful. \"From Heirgonk  I could see the hill through a window. Slowly, the full moon rose...\" So that is like a light in the darkness, literally. Because the stars... the moon and the stars are the brightest things at night in the sky, and just, her finding that comfort in that, also shows really extreme light and dark.\n  But her comfort comes at night, in the darkness. And she has one source of light. So keep looking for those motifs of light and dark 'cause they play a part throughout. Have any of you gotten past the halfway point?\n  Yeah.\n  Yeah, we've gotten  a little bit past.\n  In the march, you know that becomes very important. Alright, good. Good job. Alright, you guys! Bell's gonna ring. Keep your questions for tomorrow\n", "filename": ["Copy of 146 ELA AYA 146 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.131783], "annotations": [["sic"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["sic"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Kaylee"], ["NaN"], ["Kaylee", "sic"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Kaylee"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Kaylee", "sic", "sic", "sic"], ["NaN"], ["Kaylee"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Kaylee"], ["NaN"], ["Kaylee"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher", "sic"], ["Kaylee"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Kaylee"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Kaylee"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Kaylee"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Kaylee"], ["NaN"], ["Kaylee"], ["Boys"], ["Kaylee"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Kaylee"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["sic"], ["Teacher", "sic"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["sic"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW05", "TW08", "TW09", "TW21", "TW24TW09"]}, "203": {"text": " In the Lion King, like I was thinking about it, there's no democracy in any of the movie.\n  No, there isn't.\n Yeah, and how the Lion King's, like everything seems really British, you know, like very England, monarchy-type stuff. But in the Lion King, what bothered me is when it said like, the two hyenas, like Cheech from Cheech and Chong was one of them, and then Whoopi Goldberg was the other one. I was just like, how could they do that, and like not realize that they were feeding into this racial stereotype by being the voices of the hyenas? Like don't they think about that stuff?\n  Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.\n  Did you think about it before, when you first read Cinderella?\n I think when I watched the Lion King, like I thought about it. I mean, even when I was little, I think it registered in my mind, like, \"That's a black woman's voice. \"Why would her voice be in this animal, \"and not any of the other voices?\"\n  Right. I don't know Disney intentionally did this. They were building up into an already existing culture of racial stereotypes, so I think the mentality of that was why fix what's not been broken, and when they should have fixed it.\n  But at the same time, Mufasa was that really, what's his name? James Earl Jones, who's like Morgan Freeman.\n  Right, Mufasa was an evil--\n Like if I had to pick a God, it would be James Earl Jones or Morgan Freeman.\n  Mufasa was the good, Simba's father, right?\n  Yeah. With like the really deep voice.\n  You made a good point, though, about no democracy in Disney movies. There isn't, because there's no democracy in marketing. There's no democracy in the media. What are the six big media conglomerates? Disney.\n  Disney, GE ...\n What else?\n  GE.\n GE.\n  Newscorp.\n Yeah, Newscorp.\n  Then Viacom.\n Viacom.\n  Time Warner.\n And Time Warner.\n  But why can't Cinderella be a first lady? Why does she have to be a queen? Like why can't she have some other magical power?\n Why can't we instill some like, actual life in there?\n But that's still not, this is still not the classic, but then I wouldn't be surprised if Disney will come up with another story.\n  I hope they do.\n Well, they came up with Tiana, right? Which added the gender stereo- the roles, the racial roles, or the racial stereotypes. Tiana is absolutely beautiful. The image. However, there are, again, the pre-existing culture and norms that Disney is too scared to move away from, because that has provided them or given them this 80 billion dollar industry. I did promise you a reading on, we do have time, I promised you a reading on China, as to what happens in China. Before I do that, I just want your input on the Disneyfication of children's culture, with the article that you read. I know you wanted to talk about it, you were really excited. If you have your article in front of you, you can use that. You can look at it. I also jotted down plenty of notes, but when you reflect on what we did today, I want you to think, these books, these books are books are media, music is media, videos are media, okay? Food for thought for next time when we have our discussion: Does media construct an image or a message? There's no right or wrong answer, but think about it. Does the media construct an image or a message? Okay? As you read your read articles. So, Hannah, to you, go ahead.\n  The whole like Aladdin where, how they changed the verse, the lyrics, that was like awful.\n  That was crazy!\n Like, I think I have a different opinion from everybody, like, truth hurts, to me. I think it's just like, I don't care that it says that. Like, I didn't notice that, no one notices that while they're singing. Like, while they're singing that, no one like realizes, oh, \"Cut off your ear.\"\n  Kids don't. Like if your  was in--\n And that actually happened back then, that actually happened.\n  The ear one didn't bother me as much, because that's kind of true. But the whole, it's barbaric, the  like that was awful. It shouldn't be--\n  Because if you think about where it is, if you look into the history, it is barbaric, and they used to do it. And in some places, they still do it. It's the whole Hammurabi, \"An eye for an eye.\" You know, it's that culture.\n  Yeah, it's true, it's true, so why not teach what actually happened?\n But I don't really have a problem with it, I mean like--\n But if that's the only way that you're looking at the Middle East, then that's wrong. Because they have a history with beautiful art, they invented math, and like they gave us all this wonderful stuff, that you can't just look at the problems that they have now, or the violence that was in their culture, because there's violence everywhere.\n I mean, that's just stereotyping.\n They cut people's ears off in the Middle Ages in England just as much as they did, or at least as the same.\n They did worse things, probably, in the Middle Ages, than they did in cutting off people's ears.\n It's just unfair that they portayed the Middle East like strictly as a barbaric, violent place in that song. It just makes it wrong.\n  I think it was like in general, and it was because Arabia was so bad in an oasis like that.\n  Yeah, they weren't specific, it was just \"Arabia,\" but like it took, there was like Indian things about Aladdin that it wasn't supposed to be India, it was supposed to be like Israel, or totally different--\n There were a lot of like Middle Eastern elements rolled into one, so it would make one thing, like if you went to the Middle East, if you went to like Pakistan, it wouldn't be what they say it is, or if you went to India or you went to Israel, like they just took bits and pieces and combined it into one. Which looks like a different--\n  Why did they do that? What would you think--\n They didn't look into it, they didn't bother to do the research.\n  Yeah, they probably didn't--\n  Because their culture is so different than American culture, that they just thought that they could just skip over it. Like I thought it was gross that they didn't even bother to translate what they wanted to say on a manuscript. Like if it was in English, they would have had the actual letters on the piece of paper, but they just, you think that you can just go like this on the board, and that looks like Arabic writing? That's not--\n Arabic writing is really complicated.\n And the whole thing with all the accents, how all the bad guys had accents, and the good guys didn't. The bad guys had like--\n Oh, the beards and noses?\n Bigger beards, and then the good guys, they looked American.\n  I think it made you assume the worst, like reading that just made me like, \"Wow,\" like, \"Oh my gosh,\" it's not really giving you the information--\n  But yet, you didn't notice it when you watched it though, right?\n  Yeah, I mean, you didn't at all.\n  I did, though.\n But then when we're older, we go back in history--\n Maybe that's because I have that class and we realized that it's all war with religion, and like I know those times.\n  Go ahead. Religion, what about it?\n She noticed that--\n I did notice those things, like you can kind of tell like different culturally-wise, like the different Indian elements in Israel, or the different like Pakistani influences, but, and they had like Hindu going on. It's just really, really weird. But I did notice that, but like, I don't know, maybe like Hannah said, she didn't notice that, but because she didn't grow up like learning to write Arabic,\n  No.\n And like reading about all that stuff. I guess it's also like, how you grew up.\n Right.\n Someone who showed America, like  without photos.\n I have a question. When you think about it, when we talk about American culture, we view it as pretty homogeneous, of the American values. Okay, there are these values, and that's all there is. But we know that that's not true. Do you find that to be, with these movies, by blending all of those different spaces, and all those different cultures, do you find that to be the message is not carried out the right way to children, that the Middle East is highly diverse, okay? And not everybody looks the same, or writes the same, or behaves the same, but Disney has done something that the media does. What does the media assume? That everybody who watches a movie--\n  Is going to react the same way.\n  It's going to react the same way, right? So the media assumes that homogeneity attitude. Yes?\n The problems in the past 20 years in the Middle East, like when little kids grow up, and it's like, if I look at a picture of Osama bin Laden, I think, \"Jafar,\" because he has a beard and he looks like that. Like we're taught that that is evil.\n  Do you really? I don't.\n That the person with the turban and beard is evil, because the terrorists that are doing these awful things to people all over the world, just happen to be Muslim, totally extremist Muslims that most of the people that carry out their religion don't practice. Kind of like most Christians during the Middle Ages didn't go out and chop people's heads off in the name of Jesus. It's the same thing.\n  Right.\n You know? But we look at those pictures of those Middle Eastern men and we think bad because of it, which is like Jafar and Aladdin.\n  That's when acceptance comes in, like--\n  You have to accept what's true and what's not.\n Exactly.\n Talk about ignorance, I mean, why do we have to accept that?\n  Because it's not true.\n Because it's not true, there are thousand and thousands\n You don't see me going like, \"Oh, I'm making bombs.\"\n I'm not like saying acceptance like it's not true, I'm not like saying acceptance like, Osama bin Laden, like accepting that's what he looks like to like Jafar. Like, that's who he was, so that's what he looks like. You know what I'm saying?\n Yeah, but I don't see that. If I see, if I look at Osama bin Laden, I don't see Jafar.\n No I don't either.\n I don't identify it at all.\n I don't either, but you know what I'm saying?\n Yeah, like little kids like 10 years from now, if they watch Aladdin and they're going to grow up, and what's going to be in the news is September 11th and Osama bin Laden.\n But what the point is is that evil people look like everybody else. Like, Ursula could have just been a really pretty mermaid, and still done all the horrible things that she did to Ariel.\n  Right.\n Like it doesn't matter what you look like, they create these evil images of people, like all old ladies are either really smart or they're evil. They either have wisdom or they're out to get you. There's no in-between.\n  Or the zoo-keeper in , he had a German accent, he was evil, and that was during a war, the movie.\n Or like the three crows, right? That were talking in like the very like, I don't know, African-American, inner-city slang, and they were, just all that stuff that was just really--\n  It kinds of makes it, like just like the story was describing what a bad person must look like, we have that image like up here, like tell them it looks like this, so when we see them, we automatically assume like, \"Oh man, it could be a terrorist,\" just like when we watch a movie, like, \"Oh, that's the bad guy.\" So like it's the same as if they're doing a cartoon, and if we're in real life.\n Right, so that leads to problems that we have with profiling, for example. Putting people on one side, or, yes?\n  It doesn't really relate to the article, but I was watching a movie with my mom, and I don't know what it was called, but there's this like, I guess class project, or oral presentation that someone had to do, and this girl chose to write about her religion, which she was Muslim, and she wrote about like 9/11 and she was like, \"Just because they did that \"doesn't mean we're all evil.\" And like I don't know, she had all this stuff, and then the principal like told the FBI or something, and they came to her house and deported her family back to where she came from. Just because of that. That's it.\n  That's when like a school needs to teach acceptance. That's not the end. Or like families and the school needs to teach acceptance. Everyone was calling her like a suicide bomber, and like, \"Go kill yourself,\" or, \"Are you gonna bomb all of us?\"\n  And we call ourselves a country of freedom of religion.\n  I remember when I was in sixth grade, there was a girl, she was Muslim, and people used to throw markers at her and stuff, and call her a terrorist. It was around 9/11 and stuff like that, and it used to like upset me because I used to feel really bad. Because she like didn't do anything, she barely even knew how to talk. They'd like throw markers at her and stuff, just because she was Muslim.\n Like, because like no one has acceptance, like no one learns that, it's just like people make inferences, like, \"Oh, man, it's a bad person, \"so let's stay away, let's shy away, \"let's make fun of them,\" instead of like, when you're going down the street, and just like we were talking about earlier, how there's like, if you see a big black man, you're gonna put your phone away, you're going to take your phone out and try to call your mom, put her on speed dial. You don't have acceptance, either. Like you may say we should get it, but you don't have it. It's just the way we grow up.\n  We don't suspend judgment.\n  You don't suspend judgment. It's difficult to do so. There is this conflict between acceptance and our values. Because the values that we have, that think by this individualistic view of what it is, and in doing so, you divide people into groups, and construct images about those people, and it's as simple as reading a children's story, okay, or as watching or turning the TV on in the morning and just watching the Disney Channel, or Noggin, or Nick, Jr., or whatever. There's messages that we impart on our children, there's messages that we impart on ourselves. Or picking up the newspaper. I don't know if you guys have noticed in the newspaper, but there is a big, there's a dichotomy between how different areas are described. Immediate areas, our city compared to our surrounding areas.\n \n Right, so media is biased. They're systemically biased, okay? There is no democracy, but here is the fundamental thing as an American, we pride ourselves in democracy, we pride ourselves in leadership, so what do you do? What path do you follow?

I'm going to move it now. Yeah there's . Okay, I've already set my instrument, anybody not get a turn on the basses yet this year? Not had a turn on the basses yet.\n Everybody had a turn.\n I haven't.\n Yeah, you have. \n Okay, let's have Josh and Britney go to the back row and start their jobs.

Stop, we gotta do it again because Josh remembered half way through that he was supposed to speak while he played. Let's try it again, Josh. Ready, set, and here we go.  Excellent. Answer on the other F. Hold answer on the other F. Ready, set and here we go.  Yeah, we're going to try the answer again just some of you might have messed up the rhythm. Ready, set, and here we answer.  Make your X. This time you're to do the question again, but you may use two bars this time. But we have to start beating the question on what mill?\n  F.\n F, so one of your bars must be F. The other bar has to be next door to F in either direction. Here we go. Question only. Starting on F, only using two bars. Ready, set, and here we go.  Uh oh, what are we not supposed to end the question over? Dawn?\n F?\n F, this time you may use your whole instrument for the question, you have to start on F but don't end on F. Ready, set and get question here we go.  Good, didn't hear anybody end on F. I did, make your X for a second. I heard some people's questions that maybe sounded like this.  I don't really remember what notes I played, I was just kinda doing whatever I wanted to up and down up and down. Could I sing that?\n No? \u266b Valentine, valentine \u266b\n  Probably not. But if my question sounded like this--  Could I sing that? Probably. Did I use some patterns in that like a good musician? I did. \u266b Valentines, valentines \u266b Pink, red and blue \u266b Okay? Try it. You don't have to do the same thing I did, but let's do some repeated notes, let's use some patterns and let's not be all up and down our instrument. Ready, set and here you go.  Not bad. Let's try the answer, boys and girls. Start at any note you want but end on N. And let's make it memorable and singable. Something you can remember, something you can sing.

Yeah, go for it. When you are doing, yeah keep going. When you are doing your question, or when you are, keep going. Sorry, keep going. That's it, okay! Here's what I'm looking for. Are you alternating your mallets? Are you bouncing your mallets? Are you doing the correct rhythm? Did your question start on doe if you're the question? Did your answer end on doe if you're the answer? Was your melody memorable and singable? Here we go. My turn first, so we'll go question answer down the batch feels, and you get it.

Good, Sabrina, go.\n It's, um--\n  Question.\n Okay.  Nice job. Now, some of you didn't get a chance to do the question or didn't get a chance to do the answer. Right? So here's what I'm going to have you do. And we have 30 seconds to do this. With the person next to you, one of you do the question, one of you do the answer, okay?   Let's try it together! Ready, set and here we go.  Answer.  Nice. Here's the beauty of the pentatonic scale, boys and girls.

You have the names and faces there. That was great.\n  The game. \n  Are you doing the vocab though?\n  No.\n  Okay.\n  So wait, hang on. Should we do the pictures or the vocabulary words?\n  You can just do anything from that article. The pictures were just to get you thinking about it. That's why we did the words. And the vocab was just to help us understand. So it doesn't have to go off the vocab. But the vocab kind of connects with an idea. So it may kind of work out that way. You'll have to let Zach see, because you took what he had, which is great, and you added to it.\n  Do we put the name of the movie?\n  I'm doing . It's a song. The croak part is a song.\n Mm-hmm, that was part of the.\n  Okay, I was getting.\n  There, there's the song.\n  \n  I was stuck on the reading one too.\n  Got one left.\n Zach, what's the text structure?\n Sharpening his pencil.  Just go like that.\n  So was the Puppet in 1970? Or was it?\n Yep, 1970.\n  That must have been old.\n 1968 is when the Yellow Submarine came out. Yep.\n  \n All right. Do you guys want to put your pyramid up there? Zach, do you want to help do that? Do you agree that he was right on the text structure?\n  Yeah.\n See if you can build it. I tried to size it just about right, as close as I could get. So it should fit in there pretty good.\n  I don't think it's sized up very well.\n  What? I just got it as close as I could, Zach. It may not be 100% perfect. And then the person that didn't read the story can read us what you guys put for your answers.\n  That means we got to do another one.\n You each got a chance to read.\n  Yeah, that's the tone one.\n We need one more detail. Did I make it a little too big, or is it pretty close?\n  It's a little long.\n  Could be a little long, huh? Had a little extra at the bottom. Next time I'll shrink it up just a little bit.\n  We still have one more.\n That's fine. And who read it? Was it Zach?\n  \n We'll let Zach read those when the girls get done.\n  Okay. Do I read the summary?\n  Do you just want me to read? I don't know if he knows.\n  Start with the details.\n  Memoriad is an unforgettable competition. Memoriad games is memorize 50-line poems. People compete in the games called Memoriad. The game is to memorize it.  Memorize names and faces and memorize a 50-line poem.\n Very good. And what was your text structure?\n  Description.\n Description, because they were describing all about \n   He just talked.\n He did the talking, you did the writing. Somebody gave you ideas.\n Kinda maybe.\n It was a good partnership. The girls are just about done. We'll let them read theirs. And then we'll do our Jeopardy.\n  Can we tape the Jeopardy game?\n Mm-hmm, yep.\n  We have the same people in Jeopardy that were in here.\n Yes, it is the same group. Okay, let's not have a sword fight right now. She has one more task there.

Well, we can put a little piece of tape over it. Oh, here it is. There you go, that should hold it up good. All right, see if you agree with what the girls have here. Are you listening, Zach? Got a pyramid all set up.\n  Our text structure is, wait, do I start at the bottom?\n Start at the bottom, and the details kind of add to the summary.\n   The movie they were talking about was the Yellow Submarine, starring. Is it starring or staring?\n Starring, I bet.\n  Starring the Beatles.\n  The Beatles, okay. Their song called Being Green was made in 1970. Summary, the television was made in 1953. Kermit was in 1970. Stoplight was made in 1920. They all had one thing in common. They were in a color.\n Very good. I love that last sentence.

All right, Zach, Zach.\n  Where are the markers?\n  You can grab one back there. There's one up here. As long as you got one or two for your group, you can take turns. Now, these questions I think will flow pretty well today.\n  Whoa, I can't even see it. I think the yellow is better. I know with the lights on, it's a little harder, but it helps to have the lights on.\n  Did we run review?\n  What?\n  Did we run review?\n  \n  Text structure!\n  My music didn't come on.\n  Confucius says! Vocab. Text features.\n  Features. Thank you, Zach. Yes, they're different.\n  Confucius says?\n  Yeah. Okay who started first last time? Was it the guys?\n  Yeah.\n  Okay, we'll let the gals start today.\n  So do I do text structure?\n  Oh, you're gonna win.\n  Text structure 500.\n  Text structure 500.\n  Yeah, what's the \"Confucius Says\"?\n  We had done these little matching things way back at the beginning of the year when we did this unit, they were little sayings, and you decide just which text structure they go with.\n  So that might go with text structure.\n  Yes, it'll be a text structure question, yeah.\n  \n  Is that what you guys wanted was text structure, right?\n  Yeah.\n  Okay.\n  In our state, dams have been built\n  Zach.\n  on many rivers. These dams are used to product electricity we need. But they also create problems.\n  Scoot your chair closer to your partner. Scoot your chair back.\n  Prevents the other wildlife near the rivers. Therefore, we should not build any more dams. Instead, we should use solar energy, or energy from the sun, to produce electricity. This will help us protect our wildlife and enjoy the natural beauty around us.\n  Hmm, which of the five text structures?\n  We think it's problem solution.\n  Problem solution, correct. Give yourself 500 points\n  Because it said problem in there.\n  All right, what would the guys like? Hey.\n  Sorry. Zach, what do you want?\n  They did text structure 500. It'll pop up yellow after I click on the next one.\n  Vocab for 500.\n  Vocab for 500. Want to read that one, Zach?\n You should take some time to ponder the question before writing your response.\n  Hmm, what does ponder mean?\n  You think.\n  Ahh, perfect. To think about. Give yourself 500 points. All right, what would the gals like?\n  Should we try the Confucius question?\n  Yeah.\n  For 500.\n  Okay, Confucius says for 500. And Marissa can read this one.\n  Confucius says, \"A beautiful sunset is treasure for the eyes.\"\n  This is one of the five text structures.\n  Description?\n  Yeah, description.\n  Description, very good. And I'll just set these out. I got something that might help you guys, since a lot of these have them, you just kind of have your choices right there. What would the guys like? Very good.\n  Text features.\n Text features 500.\n  Text features 500.\n Which text feature is an alphabetical listing of subjects, people, and places you find in a book? Index, table of contents, title.\n  What do you guys think? Alphabetical listing.\n What do you think, Zach?\n Index.\n  Index.\n  Index would be correct. Good job, guys. What would the gals like?\n  Oh, 500.\n  Yeah, I just did that 500.\n  Should we text features for 400?\n  400, okay. All right, Judy can read this one.\n  What text feature gives definition for vocabulary words?\n  Wait, what is it? Wait.\n  Yeah, what do you mean for that?\n  Oh, I didn't, that one doesn't have the choices like the other one did. It would be an index, a glossary, or a title.\n  Glossary.\n  Glossary is correct. I put the choices on the other ones. I just must have missed that one. Very good. All right\n  Confucius says for 400.\n  Confucius says for 400. Could you go for Mrs. Lloyd's for just a couple minutes? Okay.\n  I wanna go tell Mr. Debush.\n  That's all right. I'll just get you guys a pass here in just a second. We'll do a couple more questions here. All right, whose turn to read?\n  It's Zach's.\n  Zach's turn? Okay.\n  Confucius say, \"First feed the lion, \"then enter cage.\"\n  Hmm.\n Sequence.\n  Sequence? Do you agree with him?\n Yeah.\n  Yes, very good. Sequence. All right, what would the gals like?\n  What one did they do?\n  They just did the Confucius says for 400.\n  I want to do that one for 400 or for 300, right?\n  I think, yeah.\n Confucius says 300? Okay.\n  Yeah.\n  Okay, all right.\n Oh man, basketball.\n  Whose turn to read?\n  Confucius says, \"Net in soccer \"is much larger than net in basketball.\"\n  Compare and.\n  Yeah, compare and contrast.\n  Very good. All right, so they did this one, Zach. What would you guys like?\n  You want to do vocab for 400?\n  Vocab for 400.\n Yeah, vocab.\n  Vocab for 400? Okay.\n  Many professional golfers first began playing as amateurs.\n  Very good. Just a second. What do you think?\n  First players.\n  Okay, the first players. You're exactly right.\n Oh, my gosh.\n People who have done something for the first time and they don't get paid. They're amateurs. All right, what would the gals like? They did vocab.\n  Structure.\n  Yeah.\n  Structure 400?\n  Yeah.\n  They want the big point ones.\n  Is it my turn?\n  Yeah, I think so.\n  Living in the country is very different than living in the city. A city dweller need to be careful of traffic and other people. In the country, there are fewer cars and people. In the city, many people can walk to the movies, stores, and other activities. In the country, people must drive to get to places.\n  Compare and contrast.\n  Yeah.\n  Compare and contrast? And she agrees. Very good. All right, what would the guys like?\n What do you want, Zach? Vocab for 300.\n  Vocab for 300.\n Oh, it's your turn, Zach.\n I depleted my savings when I bought my new basketball shoes.\n What do you think?\n  Hmm, what do you think? One for depleted.\n  Oh, I know this one.\n Drained?\n  Drained, yep. Empty, gone, you used all your savings. And basketball shoes can cost a lot of money, so I can see that happening. What would the gals like?\n  Confucius, oh wait, no, no, no. Did they do text structure 300?\n  Nope, he just did the vocab.\n  Okay, I want to do text structure for 300.\n  Features for 300?\n  No, text structure.\n  Oh, text structure. I can go back. Structure for 300.\n  The eye is made up of many parts. The white part of the eye is called the\n  Sclera.\n  sclera, and the colored part is called the iris. The iris comes in many colors, including brown, blue, green, and hazel. The iris is covered with the cornea, which is clear and round.

So we talked about what it sounds like to be a good speaker and what it looks like to be a good listener, and your teacher and I worked on a rubric, and you got a grade for some different things about speaking.

Do you remember what else we talked about being a good speaker looks like?\n Voice.\n  Okay. What about your voice? What should your voice do?\n Use your presentation voice.\n  Yeah, like a presentation voice. Does it sound like this? What does a presentation voice sound like?\n Kind of loud, but not like an outside voice.\n  Yeah, kind of loud, but not screaming, right? I like how you said not an outside voice. All right. What else for speaking? Do you remember what else?  One of them, I know, didn't really have to do with speaking, but it had more to do about your report. And it was did your report make sense? Right? Did what you write make sense? What about if I read my report really slow? Is that good?\n I can't remember...\n  It starts with an \"F\". Fl-...\n Fluency.\n  Fluency. Good. And what does that mean?\n You're not reading slow or too fast.\n  Good, not too slow, not too fast, just right. Okay. So we have posture, voice, makes sense, fluency, do you remember what the last one was? You're not doing it right now.\n Eye contact.\n  Good. All right. You want to make eye contact, right. Right. So when you're reading, you want to be able to do what?\n See the people.\n  Yeah, look at the audience, right? Kind of look over your paper and make eye contact with people. Okay, now, if I'm a good listener, if I'm the person sitting in the audience, how can I show my classmates that I'm being a good listener?\n No distractions.\n  Okay. So, don't distract them. What else?\n Don't be distracted by someone else.\n  Okay.\n \n  So you want to focus on the speaker. All right. How can you show them that you're focused on them. How would they know?\n Look at them.\n  Yeah, look at them. Right? Okay, look at the speaker. And what else? What about at the end, when they're done?\n Ask questions.\n  Good. Ask questions. Anything else?\n Sit up straight.\n  Okay. Good. Could you tell them, maybe, how they did? What do we call that? Like feedback? What they did well on, or maybe what they could do better? Right? Okay. Put a star next to the ones that you think you already do a good job at. What do you think you do a good job at? Okay. You're focused on the speaker. All right, you sit up straight. Okay. You don't distract others. That's good. Okay. Now, out of these two, which one do you think you need to work on? Which one could you do a better job? That one. Okay. So maybe you could ask more questions at the end? Okay. All right. What about speaking? Which ones do you think you do a good job at already?\n Posture.\n  Okay. You do a good job on that one.\n Make sense.\n  Mm-hmm.\n Eye contact.\n  Mm-hmm. Okay, so out of your voice and fluency, which one do you think you could do better? Which one could you work on?\n The voice.\n  Voice. All right. So what do you think you need to do better with your voice?\n Speak up louder.\n  Speak up louder? Maybe a little bit closer to, like, that presentation voice. Okay. On your rubric, it was what, five, four, three, two, one? Do you remember what you got on your volume?\n Three.\n  A three, okay. So Miss Welch thought you could do a little better too, so maybe next time you could get a four or a five. Okay. So we have been talking about famous African Americans, and you had said that Walter Payton was somebody that you had thought was interesting. Right? All right. So we are going to look at some information about Walter Payton, and then, see if we can maybe do better on asking questions, and maybe, working on your volume. Okay?\n Cool.\n  Okay. So, Austin, the other day, you and I met and we did a videotape of ourselves giving a little speech about Walter Payton, and the first one was I was speaking and you were videotaping me. And then we flipped it, and I videotaped you. So what I want to do is have us watch those and see how they turned out. And then we're going to use this rubric that you use in your classroom to kind of grade ourselves and see how we did and talk about what we can do better in the future. Okay? So we looked up some facts about Walter Payton, and let's watch my speech first. And I want you to be thinking about while you watch me, how did I do on eye contact? How did I do on my volume? How was my fluency? Did it make sense? And how was my posture? Okay, on a scale of one to five, five being, \"Woo-hoo, Miss Suzer, you did a great job,\" and one meaning, \"Miss Suzer, I didn't even see that at all.\" Okay? All right, you ready? All right. Let's see how I did. Walter Payton was one of the best running backs in the NFL. He played for the Bears after going to college in Mississippi. Sweetness has over 110 questions. But he died in 1999 of liver cancer. He's one of the best football players of all time. I wish I could have seen him play. He was my favorite football player. All right. So let's see. What do you think? Do you want to use purple or blue? You want to be purple? Okay. So how do you think I did on eye contact? What do you think? You think a four? Okay, why do you think a four? Did I give much eye contact?\n No.\n  No? Oh, you're saying yes? I only saw myself look up once, so I'm going to give myself a two. I don't think I did a very good job. You're too nice. Alright. How was my volume? Pretty good? Okay. I think I'll agree with you there. How was my fluency or my rate? Good? Okay. I think I'm going to give myself a four because there were kind of parts where I thought maybe I could have talked a little faster. I don't know. All right. Did it make sense what I said? Yeah? Okay. And how was my posture? Was I standing up straight, looking ahead. Okay. I wasn't like swaying or rocking or anything? All right, so it looks like, overall, I think I need to do better on eye contact. And you thought I could probably do a little better on eye contact. And I think I could do a little better on my fluency. I think I could have maybe spoke a little bit faster. It sounded like I was kind of in slow motion. Okay. So now, let's watch how you did. And then we'll grade you. Okay? All right, so here you are.\n .\n  Okay. Let's see. All right. How do you think your eye contact was? A one? Why did you give yourself a one?\n Because I didn't really look up.\n  You didn't look up at all, did you? Were you looking at your paper? What were you concentrating on?\n Paper.\n  The paper? Okay. Yeah, I would say, it would be good, maybe, if you held your paper down at your belly button, right, and then you could look up. All right. How was your volume? Not evident? Okay. I'm going to give you a two and a half for your volume because we could kind of hear you. I think the reason we couldn't hear you is because you had the paper in front of your face. I think your voice might have gone out a little bit more. All right. How was your fluency, or your rate? What do you think?\n I didn't hear myself at all.\n  Okay. All right. I thought it wasn't bad at all. I thought it was pretty good because when I could hear you, I thought it was probably like a three and a half or a four. You weren't reading really fast. You were reading so that I could understand you. It was just kind of hard to hear. All right. Do you think your facts made sense? Why did you give yourself a two?\n I don't know. I had some  in there and... I don't know.\n  All right. Because you could only hear parts of it? You think if your volume had been better, you could have heard more? Okay. All right. I'm going to give you a four because I think it made sense. All right. What about your posture? How was your posture? Man, you're being hard on yourself. Why did you give yourself a one?\n Because I wasn't, I was like...\n  Wiggling around a little bit?\n Yeah.\n  Okay. Well, I'm not going to be that hard. I'm going to give you a three. Okay, so if we were going to do this again, maybe in front of your class, or in front of your teacher, or something, what would you do differently next time? Now that you've seen yourself, what would you do differently? Maybe the things you got ones on, right? Okay. So, maybe looking up, over your paper. Maybe your volume. Yep. Maybe working on your fluency or your rate, maybe a little faster, right? What about your posture, what would you do differently?\n Stand straight.\n  Okay. Try to stand still. All right. So, it looks like we have a couple things we could work on, right, for next time. Okay. Sounds good.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 204 LRLA EMC 204.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.172662], "annotations": [["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["inaudible"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["inaudible"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW03", "TW07", "TW15", "TW16"]}, "207": {"text": " Welcome to Mrs. Dunford's first grade classroom.

Which one do you want to do?\n  I thought square pyramid was more like a real pyramid. You know, because it has four sides?\n  It does have four.\n  A pyramid only has four sides.\n  Well a triangle has four, too.\n  It does?\n  One, two, three, four.\n  That's a square, honey, because it has four. Well, if it has three sides, how many sides does it have?\n  Three.\n  Three. So, you have to decide.\n  So, we could take a square and make it like a ...\n  Dillon agrees a square pyramid,too. I love having y'all together.\n  Let's do square pyramid and rectangular prism.\n  Good deciding.\n Alright.\n What are you guys discussing, right now?\n We're discussing what all we wanna do.\n I like that.

That's what you need to tell them.\n The only time -- \n  Okay.\n  Aaron said something about the classroom and that I was going to be the teacher. Or something like that.\n  I wanna be assistant teacher.\n  Randy likes that.\n  And this is two people from the past and two people from the present.\n  Hear what Jacob said.\n  Jacob wants to be assistant teacher.\n  You're the teacher, assistant teacher.\n  So when will that be in the past or the present?\n  Present!\n  Haley could be a teacher from the present and then me and Randy can be from the past and then they can be from the present too. And then we'll come to where they are, then they'll have to show us what changed.\n  Did y'all hear Aaron's idea? You can say that to them.\n  I like Aaron's idea.\n  Listen to what Aaron just said guys. He has an idea that you may want to do.\n  Ian and Jacob and Haley are from the present. And me and Randy are from the past and we come. And, they show us all the stuff that has changed.\n  I agree with Aaron. I agree with Aaron.\n  I agree with Aaron.\n  Or we could do, like, you two are teachers and like me and Aaron and Ian are like students. And then, them two teach us.\n  Oh, that's an idea. You could do...\n  But then how do we do the past?\n  Well, but you could do the past and then, how, could you do a skit about the past, and a skit about the present?\n  Yeah.\n  They would be the same except one is the past and one is the present.\n  To where like, no one had desks and then in the present we have desks.\n  Oh. What do you think, Ian?\n  I wanted to do people from the past and future they all meet together and do things from the past and the future.\n  Well are we doing the future or the present?\n  Present\n  Well then people from present and past and they do things from the past and the present.\n Okay. Well, decide. It sounds like you got some really good ideas.\n  Why can't we just do one if they are doing stuff from the past and the present? And you choose your own people who live in the present.\n  Well, Ian, if your working in a group should everybody do their own thing or should we work and kind of come up with the same idea?\n  Yeah, you choose your own people but you do it in the present.\n Sounds like y'all have to just keep on. You may just have to make a decision. Ok? You may just have to make a decision. Sounds like you are doing great, guys.\n  How do you spell transfer trucks?\n  Huh?\n  How do you spell transfer trucks?\n Transfer trucks? Let's sound it, let's tap it. What letters?\n  T\n  Trrr\n  A- N- C- E- R, or something.\n  Trr, like tree.\n  T- R\n You got it, Shannon. Did you hear Shannon? Let's tap it, Ta'jarius. Trr..Aaa...\n  A\n What letter is that?

So, what are y'all doing with transfer trucks?\n  I don't know. He's the one who wanted to write it.\n  Why was this on Noah's desk?\n  Case has some names.\n Yeah.\n  Ok, but what... But why did y'all, um You're describing what each persons' job will be. And I have that, \"Noah and Ta'jarius and Madison are gonna\" do what?\n  The waves.\n  What kind of waves? What are y'all showing from the past and the present?\n  I wanna do waves in the present.\n  Do waves change from the past to the present? Do you mean like ocean waves? Have those changed over time?\n  I'm doing transfer trucks.\n  What's it suppose to be?\n  A.\n  I'm doing transfer trucks.\n  How have those changed over time?\n  Horses carried them, with like, umbrella's over them.\n  Very cool. And we saw that kind of wagon on the smart board earlier. And you said that was like a truck.\n  You could pull that up, back up there.\n  I could pull it back up. Do you wanna see that again? Cash, do you wanna do the illustrations for the trucks over time? Shannon, what are you doing? What are your illustrations gonna be, showing change over time?\n  She might do cars or something.\n  Do you wanna do cars?\n  You don't have to do cars.\n  You don't want to?\n  Lots of things have changed over time. \n  You can actually buy food and not hunt it.\n  How do you spell Shannon?\n That's one of the things you could draw the change from the, maybe you'll do washing machines?\n  Yeah. Yeah, that works.\n  Yeah. Cars change.\n Do you wanna do transfer trucks?\n  No. You're already doing them.\n  Guys!\n Do you wanna do washing machines, Madison? Draw a washing machine next to that?\n  You wanna do washing machines?\n  Can you hold that up so they can see it? because Shannon can't see it.\n Where did ya wash your clothes at?\n Turn it over like this, and you'd rub them against here.\n Different, isn't it?\n Yeah.\n When I was little, my great- great- great- great- great- great- great- grandma, grandfather he had a washing board he took a picture of and then when I was big I was allowed to see it.\n Very cool. There was a picture. Alright. It sounds like you've got some work to do guys. I love the idea of showing the illustrations of the trucks over time and the cars over time. I think we need to think about waves, though, because waves are a natural thing. People don't really build and change those, do we? No, so we need to think about something that has changed over time. And don't forget our books--\n  Buildings! Buildings!\n Buildings have definitely changed over time. Alright guys. Keep it up you are doing great. Alright, let's see what you guys are up to. Okay, what's going on over here?\n  Well, we're thinking about--\n  About Cassa coloring, Ann coloring, and me coloring and drawing, and her drawing.\n  I love drawing.\n  You love drawing.\n  That's what I love. I love typing at home. I love all of it.\n  Very cool. Alright, so what kind of things are you gonna show how are you gonna show past to present with your clothing?\n We're gonna show the style, the color...\n  Okay, can you tell me what you're gonna draw?\n  We're gonna draw dresses.\n  Oh, dresses.\n  And shoes. Like, dresses and the shoes that they would wear.\n  I can get my old dress, My mom's old dress she's got, I have it, and I can design it.\n You can?\n  Uh-huh. \n So are you all four going to show dresses from the past and present?\n Yes.\n Or are some of you gonna do past and some of you do present?\n We're gonna do it all together.\n I love that.\n Them two are coloring, I'm coloring, and me and her are drawing.\n Very nice.\n You're drawing?\n Yes, we're drawing, I'm coloring.\n Very, very nice. Well, it looks like you guys are ready for your next page. Let me ask you this, how has clothing changed over time?\n The color has definitely changed.\n The colors have changed?\n And the shoes.\n  Ladies used to wear long dresses and now they wear not that long of dresses.\n Oh, so they used to wear really long dresses and now...\n  They have short dresses that come up to here.\n  Yeah, and shoes they wear lace-up boots\n  Laced-up boots\n I think my mama has them, I won't be able to wear them, but I might be able to bring them.\n Oh, that'd be cool if you bring those. It sounds like you have great ideas.\n And they wore hats back then. \n 'cause I'm thinking about my mom's dress... I mean, I can design it.\n I am very, very pleased with how much you've accomplished together in your group, let me get you the next sheet.\n  Okay.\n  We all have our things done and we're going to get it.\n And we all have each others' phone numbers.\n Here's the next sheet. Let's look for a second. \"Who will design the piece from the past?\" and, \"Who will design the piece from the present?\" Now that doesn't mean it has to be separate. Right, you can take it home.\n  Well, me and her...\n Well, it sounded like we're all, okay?\n  Yeah, we're all basically doing it.\n Okay, \"Why is this change important to people today?\" and, \"How could this continue to change in the future?\" Hmmmm. There's some questions to think about.  So have you worked on this some more? You've decided to what you're gonna do? Skyscrapers and pyramids.\n They're doing the pyramids, me and him is doing the skyscrapers.\n Them two are doing the pyramids, we're doing the skyscrapers.\n That was nice. Good going, coming up with that. Good job.\n We're doing a square pyramid.\n  You're doing a square pyramid?\n Yeah.\n That's easy, all you gotta do is start out as a square and draw triangles at the top.\n So when I was with you before you said this is hard, we don't know what we're gonna do and all had different ideas, and as it turns out this is kind of easy. What made it easier?\n  Working as a team!\n Working as a team.\n Dillon, would you mind sitting over here, sweetie, so that everybody can hear and see what you're doing?\n  Yeah.\n Kinda off by himself over there, huh, sweetheart. Alright, the last thing you need to fill out on your papers is \"How has this changed over time?\" Buildings, how have buildings changed over time?\n Pyramids, pyramids been tooken down.\n Did we ever build buildings out of gold?\n No.\n I got something. Pyramids have been tooken down to make more space in Eygpt, like more land.\n  Okay. \n What about buildings in general? How is this building different from McWilliams?\n  It's bigger!\n It's bigger and has more space.\n Which one is bigger?\n  McWilliams!\n  And it's newer.\n It's newer, so how do you--\n It's newer or it's smaller?\n He says it's newer.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 206 GEN EC 206edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.237603], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Beau"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Glasses"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Jonathon"], ["Glasses"], ["Teacher"], ["Boys"], ["Jonathon"], ["Beau"], ["Teacher"], ["Glasses"], ["Teacher"], ["Glasses"], ["Teacher"], ["Beau"], ["Dillon"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Jonathan"], ["Dillon"], ["Teacher"], ["Jonathon"], ["Dillon"], ["Teacher"], ["Beau"], ["Teacher"], ["Jonathon"], ["Teacher"], ["Jonathon"], ["Dillon"], ["Teacher"], ["Dillon"], ["Teacher"], ["Dillon"], ["Teacher"], ["Dillon"], ["Teacher"], ["Jonathon"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Randy"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Jacob"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Jacob"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Jacob"], ["Teacher"], ["Aaron"], ["Jacob"], ["Haley"], ["Randy"], ["Teacher"], ["Aaron"], ["Teacher"], ["Kids"], ["Teacher"], ["Randy"], ["Teacher"], ["Ian"], ["Teacher"], ["Kids"], ["Ian"], ["NaN"], ["Ian"], ["Teacher"], ["Ian"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Shannon"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Kids"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Cash"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Cash"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Shannon"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Glasses"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Beau"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Dillon"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Dillon"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Kids"], ["Beau"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW06", "TW08"]}, "217": {"text": "  ...so you can't count it out completely.\n  Hmm. So we have three things going on here. I hear exponential decay, I hear an upside-down parabola, and I hear a negative-sloping line. Red, why don't you chime in? I haven't heard from you. Are you going with decay? Are you going with decreasing line? You going with upside-down parabola? What had you guys decided?\n We were going to go with decay but...\n  You were going to go with decay, okay\n But, I changed my mind because decay, it keeps decreasing all the way. But MySpace, it got to a point where it stopped decreasing... and it was  like what Rosetta said.\n  So it stopped decreasing, which is what you're saying, and you're saying that's in agreement with Rosetta. I have a serious issue with a line stopping. Can somebody talk to me about that? I have a serious issue with a line stopping or having some kind of decrease that then slows itself.\n It's the end of the line. Slows itself. Colin, I haven't heard from you.\n I don't think it's linear because the linear is going to signify that at one point there are going to be no users or people on MySpace. I agree with Elsie that it might be decay because it decreased, but decay doesn't ever touch the X-axis, which would signify there are no users.\n  Ah!\n And there will always be users.\n  Oooh, what's somebody thing about that? Really, really, really significant comment that was just made by Colin. What do we think? The fact that it's never going to... how did you say it?\n I said that the linear was going to, at one point, to hit zero, and with decay it's never going to hit zero. It's going to get really close but not touch it.\n  Jeffrey.\n I agree with Colin. Because if it was a negative line, like a negative line, right? You're going to go past zero, and you can't have a negative amount of users, 'cause a line keeps on going forever.\n  Ok, does exponential keep going forever?\n No. I mean yes! Yes, it does, but because it's so small that it never touches the X-axis, but it keeps on going so it just never hits zero.\n  So, if we all agree, are we getting closer to agreeing that it's exponential decay?\n  Yes.\n  If we are agreeing it's exponential decay, then what Jeffrey just said... what does that mean for MySpace the company? Will it go out of business?\n  no...\n  Based on what Jeffrey just said about an exponential decay, at the end. What does that mean for MySpace the company? What do you know about MySpace the company at this moment?\n It's still low. \n It's still low, but is it in existence?\n  Yes\n It is. Do you know what's keeping it You know?\n I think because you're always going to have that one user account \n  Ok, you might, you might always have that one user. There's something, though, that MySpace provides that other websites don't, that's very easy to do that other sites don't have. And this is what's keeping it from touching that X-axis. Do you know what it is? Alicia? Talk to us, I can't hear you.\n Music?\n  Yes, Alicia, who is in the band, would obviously know this, right? Tell them what you do on MySpace, Alicia.\n Bands can make pages and they can upload their songs and you can listen to them.\n  Yeah, you can upload your music on MySpace easier than any of the other sites. Very good, thank you for chiming in. Alright, let's shift gears from MySpace, now let's talk Twitter. Twitter, Twitter, Twitter. What do you think about the growth of Twitter? \n Alright, keywords. Red, start me off with keywords and then we'll bounce to Pink and around the room.  Give them your attention, ladies and gentlemen. Are you guys prepared and ready for Twitter?\n Rush\n  I'm sorry, rush?  Where, show me?\n It's missing...something there\n  What's your keyword?\n Rush\n It's in the middle of the sentence.\n  In the third sentence. Oh, rush, is that what you said? Ok, just speak up, I'm getting old, I can't hear.\n Growth continues steadily.\n  Okay... anything else?\n Yeah, but it's at the tweets.\n  This, the tweeted?\n Yeah.\n  It goes with this. Okay. So what do you guys pick for the growth? What function models Twitter's growth?\n Exponential growth.\n  You think it's exponential growth, as well? Alright, is there a team? Pink, you're up.\n I disagree with that. I think it's linear because it says that another keyword that they've given is with 40 million in May, that whole sentence right there.\n  Got it.\n That's like a slope, if you think about it. With 40 million in May, 2009, 6 months later 60 million, and then 80 million in May 2010. The slope, it would be 20 million. So it's linear. It's going positive slope. \n  Hmm... filling out those listening labs? Pink just gave some hard core evidence. Red, do you have a comeback? Or have they won you over? You have a comeback. Let's hear it, Lenny, what's your comeback?\n This can not be because  because it's going to get to a point where it's going to stop. It's not like we're going to take it like\n  Do you have a time machine? \n  Ok, so let's leave... Lenny, I think exponential growth isn't going to stop and I think a line isn't going to stop, right? And I think that, if we think about the future... I think that's what Star is maybe trying to do, is predict the future. We don't really know. But from the language here in your text, the information you do know, I think 40 million then is pretty concrete evidence of slope. Do you agree?\n yes\n  Yes? Anybody else want to chime in on this one that I haven't heard from? Maybe from... Elianna on Blue? Bleaker, I haven't heard from you. Carlia yet? What do you guys think? How 'bout anything you want to add about Twitter? Anything you want to add? Greg, go ahead.\n Well what Lenny was saying, I cannot beat and I agree with them. That's it.\n  Ok, thank you! Any...?\n I agree with Star because as you mentioned  what this does or hope is that they'll be able to Tweet via text messages. And that's something that Facebook didn't offer. So the more things that... the more things that Twitter puts out there the other social networks is going to increase.\n Ok, so as Twitter grows, you're saying the other networks might be slowed? Who though, is going to outperform it if it's a different type of graph? Who is going to outperform Twitter for sure, if Twitter is linear and the other one is a certain other graph we mentioned?  Facebook, right? Because Facebook is what?\n Exponential\n  Exponential. Very good. Ok! So let's go now to AIM. We're doing very well on time here. AIM. Who's going to start us off with AIM? Alright, Pink, you can start us off.  Keywords and reasoning, talk to me.\n Some key words we worked was AOL lost their dominance.\n  Lost their dominance. Okay? Yep?\n And then we put continuous fielding is growth today.\n  Okay.\n And we said that it was quadratic equations, because at one point it was really high, but then as time went by, it started decreasing, but then it started getting more popular again. Lately, teenagers liked using it, so it started going up again.\n  Ok. Is there another keyword up here that would help anybody? I think there's at least one more keyword that I haven't seen pointed up. Elianna?\n Is it comeback?\n Comeback? Where's comeback?  Beautiful. Made a comeback and maybe even one more thing a little earlier. Jermaine? Thank you. Sorry, say that again?\n Dominated\n  Dominated, very nice, Jermaine. So it started out dominating, then had to make a comeback. Does anybody want to add on to what Pink said about this being quadratic?\n Which way?\n  Which way?\n Would make it positive from earlier?\n  Positive what? Talk to me about the equation now.\n Quadratic is always going to...\n  Do quadratics always go up?\n  no, go down too, parabolic\n  This parabola? They always look like this?\n no\n  Think about inverses we learned through this year. Raise your hand and let me know what you want to say. Talk to me. Do parabolas always open upwards? Go ahead.\n  I just want to agree with them\n  You agree that it's a parabola?\n Yeah, because in a parabola... it says that it started off dominating, but you're on top if you're dominating. Then it said that it made a comeback. That means at one point it would have to be decreasing and then to make a comeback they come back, they come back up.\n  Beautiful. Wanna add to that? Go ahead.\n I was just going to say the other end \n Alright, so I just want to make sure I answered Purple's question in the back. You asked which way? Take a look at this. This is what you're talking about. Could the parabola be like this?  What would this mean if the parabola were down for the company?\n If it was down, then that means it's imaginary. Right?\n  You're thinking of something about imaginary and it's not if it's down. That has to do with a negative. Right, if there's a negative A coefficient. Something else, though. What would this mean for the company's trend? DeShawn? Go ahead, DeShawn\n They would have had a spiral at the bottom and then they would lift up\n  And come back down. Purple, are you alright with that now? You understand? This would not have worked based on what DeShawn just said. Here's my question for you on AOL. Why isn't AOL an absolute value graph? What starts high, comes down, and goes back up? We did do absolute value functions, right? Turn and talk first, and then you're going to tell me. Write that question down somewhere. I want to know why it's not an absolute value graph. \n Oh, yeah, we did talk about these today  \n if every five minutes they add ten members but every five minutes you're getting ten members then every five minutes you're gonna lose ten members so parabola is not possible  \n  Ok, guys... Bring it back. I want to know why isn't... Why didn't anybody say absolute value? I'm going to maybe put one over here, and then I have one more really important question about these graphs for you, and then we're in good shape. Absolute value... the reason I asked that is because that also starts high, comes down low and goes back up. I need some reasoning. Let's change it around, start with Gold and go around. Go.\n I don't think it's an absolute value graph even though it kind of follows the same kind of trend. Because in the absolute value, it's Y is equal to absolute value of X, meaning that as time passed, they would be losing and gaining a constant amount of people. So like, if you gained ten members every five minutes, every five minutes you would be gaining ten members no matter what. Every five minutes, or when it goes down, every five minutes you'd be losing ten members. Whereas a parabola that changes is not constant, you can lose and gain power then they'd be equal to join or don't join and you can't guarantee that you're going to gain that amount of members every time that amount of time passed.\n  So would it be fair to say it's too con-\n", "filename": ["Copy of 217 MATH EA 217edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0986964], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW08m", "TW18", "TW24TW08"]}, "082": {"text": " Take a look at that goal just to remind yourself whatever it is you're going to be working on. And this, we want to remind you that it's kind of dinner party conversation-ish. You agree with people at dinner parties. You disagree with people at dinner parties, but it's civil, because it's friends that you invited over to your house. You don't raise your, you don't raise your hand at dinner parties. You wait until, you wait until . You wait until someone else is finished speaking before you start speaking, of course, because that's polite dinner conversation. You add on to what one another says. But like I said, we don't necessarily have to agree. And then when the topic starts to die down at a dinner party, somebody else brings something else up. So you can raise your own questions as well. So the seminar is open, and my question to you guys is who you think is most to blame for the deaths that occurred at the end of \"The Veldt.\"\n What did it mean, like, George having, like, I think that, I know a lot of times, where he, especially in the, towards the back, he... it goes back a little ways. He's, like, talking a lot of things, like, comments turning, comment, commen-, I can't say that word. He says they're going to turn the house down possibly for a month, and how he pick out the picture painter. And he was telling his, he was, like, talking to his son a lot and, like, about not, about doing what his son would not want to have happen, and how he spoiled his children so much. So he takes out, there's a lot of things that his son, his son and daughter, it just doesn't say as much, wouldn't like, because... yeah. But he wasn't, like, he wasn't, like...\n I agree that...\n \"Oh yeah, I'm gonna go die today!\"\n I agree that it was...\n He didn't want to die.\n I agree that it was...\n Of course he didn't want to die. Who wants to die? Except for if you're suici-, you know, suicidal.\n I agree that , and on Page 15, where it says, um, it's mostly on 16, but starts on Page 15. \"Won't this house and this room replace you and your wife and your children's affections?\" It assumes their mother and father grow more important in their lives than their real parents, and now you want to come along and shut it off? Kind of shows why that they hate them. And because it, because it's, since the nursery is their parents, it's like some guy who thinks he can tell you, coming along and can tell you to kill your parents, you know?\n It's the same thing as they're doing, though. They're killing their parents.\n Well...\n But they think the nursery is their parents.\n...they don't think their parents are their parents. They don't matter as much as parents.\n If they'd been nice to them, and now they're going to turn everything off, then isn't it imbalanced? So now they're relying on the house, because that's what they've learned to do, as...\n Yeah.\n It'd be like, take an example, people are killing their parents.\n And on Page 15, it says, like... I also think that it's, the dad says, \"I sen-...\" The psychologist says, \"I sensed only that you had spoiled your children more than most, and now you're letting them die in some way.\" So if they, like, they don't really know, like, when someone says no to them, they've been spoiled so much they don't even, like...  well, they just can't take it. It makes them go all crazy and stuff. So they wanted to kill them, because they, like, couldn't fly to New York, so...\n Yeah. Because I think \n And if their parents, and if their parents, and if they felt that their parents were actually their parents, then maybe not. But since their parents don't really take care of them, it's the house that takes care of them.\n Yeah.\n And then the...\n The house and the room replaced their parents.\n Yeah. Their parents and friends.\n It's not like the parents could...\n They don't have friends, because they're, the room, they get all these adventures because of the room.\n Yeah.\n They don't have friends.\n And they kind of, like, rely on the house to give them stuff all the time.\n If the house refused them, if it could, then I don't think that they would want to kill it. I think that it's just because they don't feel like their parents are actually their, they don't, they feel, their parents aren't important to them. So when they say no...\n On page, on page 13, the mom's saying, \"That sounds stressful. Would I have to tie my own shoes instead of letting the shoe tier do it? And brush my own teeth, and comb my hair, and give myself a bath?\" The kid's, like, now relying on everything. He's never had to do something for himself. So he doesn't really, like, know.\n Yeah.\n He's gotten so, like, stuck on having everyone do things for him, he thinks, like, doing your own thing would be, like...\n A challenge.\n Yeah. Like, and I guess you can use an example as \"Wall-E,\" a show. People get, like, so fat, and they rely on everything so much that, like, they have to move in chairs, and they, when you golf, it's virtual golf, there's a robot for you. So they just, they take robotics and machines to the next level, and they, it's all they rely on. And so many people don't have to work.\n Yeah, and weren't the ones that, like, bought the house, that they were actually the cause, because they were the ones ... like, on Page 5 and 11, they even said that, \"We were the ones who bought the house. We were the ones who got us into this mess.\" So, but then all of a sudden they just took it away from their children, which made them mad. So again, they were the one who was causing all this madness in the house.\n I think it...\n Like, don't you think that people would be sort of obese, like Elliot said?\n Yeah. They would be.\n They would be.\n Yeah, but then they'd be like everyone else in the world.\n But then they also...\n Yeah, and...\n Getting exercise?\n But they're obese...\n And also, I think that it's George Hadley's fault, not necessarily both the parents, because the mom didn't really do as much. Because, like, well, the quote over there it said that, like, she's the one who let them in for a minute. But. . .\n She just wanted to be nice.\n She just wanted to be nice. But I think ... like on Page two, it says, \"But nothing's too good for our children,\" George said. So I don't think it's as much Lydia's fault, because she also tries to get them out of the house instead of just staying there. She just wanted to be nice to the kids because George had shut it off so abruptly. But I think it's more George's fault that they spoiled them, and that therefore gets himself killed.\n Does anyone know when this story was written? Because I'm guessing it was...\n 1950.\n All right. Because I was, I'm guessing it was wri- I was, guessing it was written when women weren't, like, thought of that highly. Because Wendy only actually speaks once, and is a sniveling idiot most of the time. And Lydia's, and Lydia Hadley is pretty passive. And it's the guys that are, have all the action, and have anything really going on.\n Except in the final scene.\n Well, yeah. But that... she on-...\n She says one line. One line in the whole book, basically.\n I know, but Lydia sort of has a bit of action.\n Yeah, but...\n She doesn't do much. She doesn't, like... . .\n She's pretty passive.\n She doesn't, like, um, disagree with her husband or her kids. She doesn't do anything like that. She just follows whatever her husband says. Maybe she has a few opinions, but not really.\n And Wendy says four words alone in the whole thing, so...\n Well, I mean, you hear her screaming, but other than that...\n Is that a word?\n Well, that was \n Unless she's saying it...\n Close enough.\n...at the same time as Peter, like, when they both come in and say, \"Hello, mom and dad\"...\n Doesn't really count.\n...or when they both say, \"Mommy, daddy, come quick.\" But she's saying it at the same time. She only says four words by herself in the entire story.\n The screams are actually their parents, when the kids were pretending in the nursery that their parents were being...\n Yeah, they realized that at the end, but they didn't really make that very clear. They're like, suddenly they realized why those screams sounded familiar. I thought the whole book, or the whole story, that it was, like, the kids' screams. But it's actually the parents.\n What are...\n Yeah, because it's really not clear on that. I figured that it's actually so they all .\n Well, I'm, it's more, it's nicer to have, like, a mystery, kind of.\n Mm-hmm. Yeah. I figured that it's the author's fault.\n The what?\n The author's.\n But...\n How is it the author's fault?\n Because it's his story.\n Well, the author wrote it.\n That doesn't make any sense.\n But Carl, the author .\n Yeah, that doesn't make much sense. It's not his fault. It's the... it's totally off topic.\n Yeah, I agree with Elise. When I didn't really get who the screams were until the very end, where they said, yeah, that... I think it's on Page... um, 19. But, yeah, that they were... it says on Page screamed, and suddenly they realized why those screams had sounded so familiar.\" So I thought it was the kids the whole time, I thought...\n Aaron was saying something before, but then everyone...\n What I was going to say is the, a little while ago, when I was going to ask you, why do people think it's, like, Peter Hadley or other... because, I mean...\n The other is both of them.\n Because more or less the majority did George Hadley. So why, just those people who did that, why did they do that?\n I understand with Peter Hadley, because it is his, he seems to have the main role of actually murdering the parents. But it's not his fault he got spoiled. He can't help it if his parents spoiled him.\n Yeah, because...\n Actually, even if the parents had been, played more of a parent role, they would still probably have preferred the nursery, because...\n You don't need to .\n...the parents could still say no, and the nursery does, they can, like, do whatever they want with it.\n I agree with the both parents part of it, even though the mom wasn't as involved as George was, the mother was not do-, posing a part in the kids' life as being the mom, and the house was. So that caused them to think the house was their parents, and the house was their family.\n This is... \n Indirectly... directly, I think...\n You can go.\n Directly, the, Peter was probably most responsible for the parents dying.\n Directly.\n Directly. But indirect... well, directly the lions were.\n Oh my God.\n Indirectly... but directly it was mostly Peter, but indirectly, it was, it was kind of everybody's fault.\n I kind of agree with, like, both the parents, and then the dad. Because in the beginning, the parents are, like, slowly taking away some things, like the painter, and not letting them go to New York. And that kind of builds up their anger. But in the end, the dad just wants to shut it all off. And then the son starts getting really mad and, like, threatening them, finally they, like, get really mad, and then they start imagining the parents dying, and then...\n They've been imagining the parents dying through the whole thing.\n I think it was the parents' fault, and the inventor. Because, I mean, none of it would have happened if they wouldn't have had the, just, like, the super technology house, and the nursery.\n So it's technology's fault.\n It's not the inventor's fault, because he didn't know.\n But it's not the, it's not the inventor's fault that they thought, though.\n If he wouldn't have made it, it would have never happened.\n And also, if the dad wouldn't have bought it, it would never happened, too. So that's my two opinions.\n They couldn't...\n But they bought it, but they made it and bought it to be a good thing, not a bad one.\n No one invented it so that you would, so that it'd be used as a murder machine. They didn't just make it, like, on the advertisement, \"Greatest Murder Machine Ever.\"\n Perfect for murdering your parents.\n We don't know, like, why he built it. Maybe it was because of that, but you don't know, like, exactly what his point of the invention was.\n It was to, like, study the children's thoughts.\n It was to study their minds.\n Because the children...\n He said that, but what if it's not?\n He's a liar.\n The children were mentally impaired, and they needed to be looked up on, and they wanted to know what they were thinking, so ...\n So a psychologist .\n Another good quote to show that it was, to show that it might have, that it could have been the parents' fault, was that, on Page 11, it said... yeah, George said, \"Who was it that... who was it said, 'Children are carpets. They should be stepped on occasionally.'\" Because the parents didn't, they didn't do anything to the kids. They...\n They didn't really step on them that much until the end.\n They just did what they want.\n They just all of a sudden just, like, flattened them.\n Yeah, they just did it so abruptly.\n Yeah, they just started and let it go.\n It was just like, bam, you're dead.\n No wonder they wanted them dead.\n Guys, let's try and talk one person at a time, or else we can't hear.\n My turn. Okay. On Page 15, it says that the dad went from Santa, Santa to Scrooge. And, like, if he would have taken away, like, one thing at a time over a period of time, I don't think the kids would be, like, like, killing them. But it says he just took all the good stuff away at once, and they got, like, really mad.\n That's also kind of dangerous, though. Because they started getting mad at him as soon as they took away the picture painter. So it was, they still could've gotten mad. It's also more dangerous for the parents to actually slowly take them away, because they get more and more mad.\n All the anger...\n I have another opinion that I was trying to say, but then I let Fiona go first. That's not fair.\n No, that's not, it's my fault. \n All the anger built up because...\n Anyway, um...\n", "filename": ["Copy of 082 ELAEA082.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.294695], "annotations": [["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW08", "TW17"]}, "081": {"text": " Viewing my art room from the front corner I have a storage area on the right hand side. Entry to the art room and paint storage is right by the door. Uh, a cart for paint supplies that can be wheeled out into the room. I have a large white cabinet for all of my paper and on the other side storage for student art work. I have a dry erase board, a digital white board and a bulletin board for instruction for students in the front of the room. We often sit right in the center of the room. There's also a birthday chair there for the birthday person to sit in. My tables are shaped around there in a U-shaped formation, each labeled by a colorful paint splot hanging from the ceiling. Indicating the table there's a red table, orange, yellow, green, blue and so forth. Each table has organized supplies in a painted shoebox and red caddies left on the tables. In the very back corner is the teacher desk. Two computers to the left of that as well as a laptop that's hooked up to the digital whiteboard. Across the back of the room I have work space for our student teacher and also to mount student art work, and store some ongoing large artworks. On the back wall I have more storage: metal cabinets, rolling cabinets and a light board that we can use to copy work from. And directly below me is our class pet this is where Shelly the turtle lives and she is currently hibernating.\n Like rabbits and dogs, dinosaurs. And kitty cats And puppies So first thing we are going to do today is look at pictures. Listen so that we have time for working. I need everyone to put in bubble. We are going to look at some pictures that artists have made long, long, long ago. The very oldest art in the whole world. Are horses and bulls inside of a cave. So the very first artists way back during cave people they were making art about animals. About horses and animals that ran around that they saw in their environment all around them. Put hands down, put hands down.\n ...dinosaurs ...yeah\n Well that was after the dinosaurs. But I'm looking for somebody that would be able to point out an animal that they recognize up here. Does anyone recognize some of those animals?\n Yeah\n Izaiah do you? Izaiah? Izaiah with a \"Z.\" Do you want to go up and point? Come up and show us some animals that you recognize.\n Only animals who... only, only...\n Listen! She's the teacher right now. What's it?\n Kangaroo\n What else? Let her answer.\n Fish and turtle and, um, crocodile and a duck.\n Yeah and some kind of a bird. Good job. Did you notice that these are all made with dots? That's how some artists who live in Australia... Kimberly come right here in front of me... Turn around so you can see. That's how some artists in Australia make animals. And they kind of show what's inside of them, don't they? It's really good that you notice that, Izaiah. Do you have a comment?\n I know all those animals\n Good so you were naming them right along with her? Raiden, why is your name up, your hand up?\n You said last time we have to finish our .\n Oh we do have to finish those you're right. We will, don't worry. Okay. Next. What kind of animal is that?\n A horse.\n A horse. You know what it says at the top? It's a horse of a different color. Because what color is it?\n  Blue.\n Kind of like the \"Wizard of Oz?\"  right there. Why, boys and girls? Why is the horse blue? What do you think? Why is the horse blue?\n To make the horse beautiful!\n To make it beautiful? Why else would it be blue?\n Maybe because it... ?\nThere's another one.\n It's a unicorn horse isn't it? What? \nShhhh... what? I'm curious...\n Izaiah, why would an artist make a horse blue?\n Because it might be a unicorn.\n Well, it could be. Why?\n Because it might be a different kind of animal.\n Yeah, it might be a different type of animal horse.\n Have you ever drawn a picture and maybe just used your imagination? And used your favorite colors in it? How many people do that sometimes? I know I do. Sometimes I might make an animal but instead of making him brown, maybe I'll make him pink and purple and yellow.\n Ooooooh!\n And make him a little bit more imaginative.\n Sometimes at my dad's house all by myself.\n What else do we have?\n Another horse.\n Here's a fancy prancy horse. Now the other horse was kind of looking down, but what's this horse doing? What's this horse doing?\n Jumping.\n Flying.\n He's walking or galloping, isn't he? He looks... Look how he's standing. Look at the two horses. If you had to tell me how this horse is feeling...\n  Sad.\n Why do we think sad? Emma why do you think sad?\n Because he's looking down.\n He is looking down, isn't he?\n Maybe he's sad because his family just got killed by another animal.\n Oh, I hope that didn't happen. He could be sad about something that happened. What about this horse?\n  Happy!\n Why Melanie why do you think he looks happy?\n Because he still has a family of his own.\n Because why?\n Because he still has a family of his own.\n That's not why! That's not why!\n Izaiah, you might have a different idea than Melanie. Isn't it okay to have a different idea?\n Yeah\n So, I need you sitting, Kimberly and Regan, you both need to be sitting right here where you can see hun. Izaiah so it's okay to have... what was your idea about why he might be happy?\n Because he's walking and his family is going to get killed by a pack of animals.\n Oh my, but that wouldn't be very happy would it? You think he looks happy? Are there any other words you can think of to describe him? He's prancing around. Usually if you're in a bad mood do you walk around like this? With your head up?\n No.\n I used to do this, too.\n That's not prancing, that's stomping. But prancing is when you have your head up, isn't it? Kimberly! Kimberly! Right here. Come over here by me.\n Maybe... maybe he was doing this because  on his arm. There's something on his arm.\n Oh, it could be like a bandage, couldn't it? It might just be the way it's painted like his knees are a little bit lighter than the rest of him. Is that what you're noticing? What are you noticing?\n  but one of my family died\n Awww. That is sad, isn't it?\n Really really really old.\n  \n That happens sometimes, I'm sorry. \n ...family died in a fire...\n Guess what? Guess what?\n Shhhh... Kimberly if you want to earn your star card today you have to come sit by me. Brandon if you want to earn yours you have to be sitting on your bottom, not crawling on the floor.\n You have to color inside of it? \n You might want to draw his shell first to make it really big.\n Look at mine!\n Can I see?\n Good job! Make these lines really, really dark.\n Hey, look at my turtle.\n Go back over it like this.\n Boys and girls, if your paper's kind of  'cause you're pushing so hard then you're drawing dark enough. Okay, they should really be pressing hard with that. Good, go over it really really dark. That's dark enough. It looks great.\n Oh Kimberly yes.\n And put your name on the front with the crayon. Well look Izaiah, here's two choices for your shell. You can start with an oval like that or you can start like this. Okay. Yeah but I think two different ways see the top one and the bottom was a half circle. Which one do you like? Make it really big. Perfect! There you go! \n Look at my turtle.\n Boys and girls I want you to darken your lines and draw for at least five more minutes before you paint. Okay? Keep darkening your lines. Okay, darken those lines.\n We have to go and get our paint.\n Boys and girls, darken every line and I'm going to come around and as soon as I see that yours is nice and dark I'll put the paint on your table. Okay? This is yours? That's good, that's good. This is dark enough. What I want you to trace over is the black parts. And see these pencil lines? You have to trace over top of them. Or the paint will cover them up. So, what color would you like to use there? What color would you like to trace these in? Come pick a color. Come sit down. Tyler start working on your design. No, start working on your designs in the middle. That's perfect. Nice and dark. Boys and girls, see how dark these lines are? This is a really good example of how dark you want your crayon to be. You want to go back over it and trace it really dark. That one looks good, too. Nice and dark. That's awesome!\n Start drawing. \n I need yellow\n Boys and girls, would you put your name on...\n Pardon the interruption,  please come to the office.  please come to the office.\n Put your name right here. While you're getting ready to paint, put your name on the front in crayon. Nice and dark, write your name nice and dark with your crayon. Well, trace over it with the crayon.\n Look at mine.\n As soon as you're sitting down, Caitlin. I'm coming around to look. Boys and girls, when you're ready, you may put your hand up and I'll come around and check your pictures. You are ready. Yours looks really nice. Good! He made me draw it for you. Very good! \n Melody, I'm waiting for that hand to go up. Isaiah, ah! That looks great! While you're waiting for your paint, make those darker. \n Shhhh... Darken these a little bit.\n Izaiah what are you doing?\n Oh, I like your turtle. \n", "filename": ["Copy of 081 ARTEMC081.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0588456], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Together"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible", "Inaudible"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW03", "TW08", "TW10", "TW15", "TW16", "TW19", "TW20", "TW24"]}, "611": {"text": "  That one hurts.\n  It says volume by, use the formula to find the volume...\n  Okay, so. I got 53 when I added up the numbers.\n  Yeah, I did, too.\n  I took it and divided by three.\n  17.6666.\n  Just do 17.6.\n  No, 17 point three sixes. So, we'll just...\n  Just, no, Hayden, we have to find 17.666 'cause all six of them, put 17.6.\n  I know, but, we are now, let's just round it up one to 18.\n  Okay.\n  Yeah.\n  So, with average, it's 18. Okay.\n  So, now, we have to do, based on our average, how close were you to your guess, so, how close were we to our guesses, so, like...\n  I was close by seven.\n  I was close by nine.\n  We have 18 here, how far was nine and 18?\n  I don't know. Nine.\n  Nine plus nine is 18, right?\n  Oh, yeah.\n  So, write nine right here. I was by five. Okay. All right, based on our average, how many drops would it take to make one liter?\n  18,000.\n  What? Oh, yeah.\n  You got us correct a few times.\n  Multiply it by...\n  If we had it to drops times 1000, 'cause that's how many milliliters are in a liter, we get 10,000.\n  Okay, so now, we do water disposal. Follow the directions to find the volume of three marbles using water fluid. So, first, we have to add milliliters of water to 100 milliliter... So, we have to add 20 milliliters of water into this. So, Giselle, you wanna do that?\n  No.\n  Okay.\n  That, yeah.\n  Pour it so this gets to 20, okay?\n  I'll pour it then. \n  Oops, whoa, okay.\n  Try not to put too much.\n  I'll pour it out.\n  Let's try again, it, with a dropper.\n  No, you're supposed to do it with a beaker.\n  I know, but if we're really, really close, and we can't do it with a beaker, then we're gonna have to do it with a dropper.\n  So, we just do this.\n  Okay, we're at 20. I think that's 20.\n  We're at 19\n  I got it.\n  Okay.\n  Just... Don't drop it too fast 'cause... I, okay. Okay. So, now we have to add the three marbles, so...\n  We'll bring 'em on this side.\n  Yeah, you have one, Hayden has one, and I have one.\n  No, let Alina have one. You do...\n  Alina poured the water. So, it's you, Amy, and Hayden.\n  Okay.\n  Okay, so, we have to like, tilt it to roll down the cylinder.\n  I think I can do it.\n  Yeah, I know, but it's the easiest way.\n  No, not that much, you don't wanna, don't wanna pour some out. Sayonara, sucker.\n  Okay, the water level now is 26 exactly. All right, so it went from 20 to 26. So, the difference in volume is six, and the volume of the three marbles is six, right? What do you think, Alina?\n  Yeah.\n  How do you think I got six?\n  I don't know.\n  Well, subtracted 20 from 26. Because it's 20 before the marbles and 26 after, so the marbles must be...\n  Okay.\n  Kay?\n  How we doin' over here?\n  Pretty good.\n  All right, I'm gonna ask you a couple of questions about volume. What have you learned about volume so far? Whenever you... Alina, look at the board that I made for you, okay? Whenever you drop drops of water into the graduated cylinder, what's happening to the volume?\n  What happened?\n  What happened to the volume of the water?\n  It was at 20 and then 26.\n  It got higher?\n  It went higher.\n  It went higher, okay, so we can say, then, that volume does what?\n  What did it do?\n  Rise.\n  It rose, okay. Volume rises, okay, so, the volume rose, good, and what did you find for the volume of the three marbles using water displacement? Did you get that far yet?\n  Yep.\n  Okay.\n  We got six because the water was at 20 before, and then after we put the marbles in, it was at 26, so, it's six 'cause you have to subtract the 26 minus 20.\n  Good, okay. If you can switch places with me, I wanna be able to hear Alina. Okay. All right, so, I'm gonna ask you another question. When you were doing-- if you got six, if the volume of those three marbles is six milliliters according to what you have, we need to change that to a solid measurement, okay? This is the solid measurement, cubes, that we use to measure solids. Marbles are solids. So, Alina, can you, can anyone tell me how we transfer that six milliliters to cubes? To centimeter cubes?\n  Each one of those is a gram, and if...\n  Each one of these is a gram, that's correct.\n  And if one milliliter is equal to one centimeter cubed, and all, and in that case, it must also be equal to one gram, so that's why for this, I wrote that the difference in volume was six grams and the volume of three marbles is six grams. I could also figure out that these are our three marbles, and we have six grams, then each one of them is 15 grams.\n  Okay, but grams, is that a unit of volume, or is that a unit of mass?\n  Mass.\n  Mass.\n  Good, Alina, it's a unit of mass. So, what Hayden said is correct. One centimeter, one milliliter is equal to one gram, one milliliter of water is equal to one gram, but what do we know about the cubic centimeters? We need to put the units in this term. So, if you got six milliliters for the volume of the three marbles, then how can we change it to centimeters cubed? How many milliliters is this, is one centimeter cubed? Do you remember, one. It's a one to one ratio, like Eli told us in home room. So, six milliliters must also be equal to six centimeters cubed. So, and this is the unit of volume, but you're also right, the mass must be, it will also be equal to one gram, but we're talking about volume, not mass.\n  So, it's the weight, it's the volume.\n  Yeah.\n  It has to do with three times three times four.\n  But you have to explain why.\n  Because...\n  So, how do we know this?\n  \n  But why do we do that?\n  You don't know the answer right now.\n  Because it said that... \n  Three cubic centimeters. And a height of three cubic centimeters...\n  I don't know if that's really a three with a height of four.\n  Yeah, with a height of four. So, we have to do our work.\n  'Cause we built the work right there. And like...  \n  Height from a... \n  And the height. Hold on. So... So, Summer, three times three, and then...\n  Yeah, times four.\n  I'm up to three times three. That's nine, and then times four gives you three times...\n  When I did this, it was four times three, I know that. \n  Is...\n  So, three times...\n  16.\n  No.\n  Three times three is nine, times four is...\n  Okay, it's three times four-- Okay, it's nine times four. Why would that be 60?\n  36.\n  Yeah, so, we did three times three, we calculated nine times three.\n  So, that gives you nine,  and then because there's a height of three, you multiply by four, which gives you 36 because it's a basic math problem.\n  And it gives you 36.  Okay. So, explain why you know that. And then...\n  And then we go on to number two.\n  But wait for her to finish.\n  I am. I'm just gonna be a little... Change the length, width, and height of the rectangular prism without changing its volume. Try and it and explain. Of course not, because we're gonna feel like I think is something's wrong.\n  Well, we can...\n  Well, I guess if...\n  No we can't 'cause you can take that one off the building height.\n  No, we could tip this  over this way. and solve for--\n  Why would you do that?\n  What? We're done with problem one. \n  So, now...\n  So, I guess we could. Yeah. But, no, but in, we'd still have, we would still have the same volume.\n  All right, so the next problem is can you change...\n  Summer, are you still--\n  I'm fine.\n  I know, but we already read it though.\n  She can read, she needs to read it, Ryan.\n  So, what, say we couldn't because the numbers, we'll have to do the, oh wait, no.\n  No, we could...\n  No, because like, we won't...\n  We're doing the height and we turn it sideways. \n  Yes, we would. It's true.\n  Okay.\n  So...\n  So... How are you guys doing?\n  For number two, we wanted to, we had it like this, and we wanted to turn it sideways 'cause that would change the height around...\n  Okay, so let's talk about number two, that's the one you're on?\n  I'm completely knocked it over.\n  All right, so, the question is, on number two, can you change the length, width? Can you change the length, width, and height of the rectangular prism without changing its volume? Try it and explain. Okay, so, first of all, the first rectangular prism, you built, so this rectangular prism, okay, was one centimeter, I mean, three centimeters long.\n  We did three times three, it was nine because it had a line...  So, three times three is nine, then times four, times height of four, I don't know.\n  Okay, so this is the rectangular prism you built for number one, correct? Okay, and then you just multiply its length times its width, times its height, and what did you get, Summer?\n  I got 36.\n  36.\n  And I'm thinking that more than one thing can equal 36, like if we had...\n  Okay, so, how many cubes did you use to get this?\n  Two for 36.\n  This 36? How many cubes were there in all?\n  In all, that was 36.\n  It was 36, you had to count out the cubes, right? So, can you use the same\n  But have like, a different height.\n  But have a different length, width, and height?\n  Well yeah, the answer would be yes because more, there are multiple pieces, you could do six like, well, you do two, three, and six.\n  Okay.\n  Two times three equals six, six times six equals 36.\n  Two times three times six would equal 36.\n  Right, as long as the three would be height.  So, six could be this.\n  Okay. Summer, what do you think? They think you can change these numbers and it still be 36 cubes. Could you still use 36 cubes, build a rectangular prism, and, but get different numbers here? You can, why do you think so?\n  Because it has to change it from, then, like, the 36 would still be the same.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 611 GEN MC 611 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.139356], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Amy"], ["Voiceover"], ["Amy"], ["Voiceover"], ["Amy"], ["Hayden"], ["Amy"], ["Hayden"], ["Amy"], ["Hayden"], ["Amy"], ["Amy"], ["Alina"], ["Hayden"], ["Amy"], ["Alina"], ["Amy"], ["Alina"], ["Amy"], ["Hayden"], ["Amy"], ["Hayden"], ["Alina"], ["Hayden"], ["Amy"], ["Giselle"], ["Amy"], ["Alina"], ["Amy"], ["Alina"], ["Amy"], ["Hayden"], ["Amy"], ["Hayden"], ["Amy"], ["Hayden"], ["Alina"], ["Amy"], ["Alina"], ["Hayden"], ["Amy"], ["Amy"], ["Giselle"], ["Amy"], ["Hayden"], ["Amy"], ["Hayden"], ["Amy"], ["Giselle"], ["Amy"], ["Hayden"], ["Amy"], ["Alina"], ["Amy"], ["Alina"], ["Amy"], ["Teacher"], ["Hayden"], ["Teacher"], ["Hayden"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Amy"], ["Alina"], ["Amy"], ["Teacher"], ["Amy"], ["Alina"], ["Teacher"], ["Amy"], ["Teacher"], ["Amy"], ["Teacher"], ["Hayden"], ["Teacher"], ["Hayden"], ["Teacher"], ["Alina"], ["Hayden"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Ryan"], ["NaN"], ["Summer"], ["Summer"], ["Ryan"], ["Summer"], ["NaN"], ["Summer"], ["NaN"], ["Summer"], ["NaN"], ["Summer"], ["Summer"], ["NaN"], ["Summer"], ["Ryan"], ["NaN"], ["Ryan"], ["Summer"], ["NaN"], ["Ryan"], ["NaN"], ["Ryan"], ["NaN"], ["Ryan"], ["NaN"], ["Ryan"], ["NaN"], ["Ryan"], ["NaN"], ["Ryan"], ["NaN"], ["Ryan"], ["Summer"], ["Ryan"], ["Summer"], ["Ryan"], ["NaN"], ["Ryan"], ["NaN"], ["Ryan"], ["NaN"], ["Ryan"], ["NaN"], ["Ryan"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Ryan"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Summer"], ["Teacher"], ["Ryan"], ["Teacher"], ["Ryan"], ["Teacher"], ["Ryan"], ["Teacher"], ["Ryan"], ["Teacher"], ["Ryan"], ["Teacher"], ["Ryan"], ["Teacher"], ["Ryan"], ["Teacher"], ["Summer"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW09m", "TW24TW11"]}, "087": {"text": " Yeah.

So, first, what was your group thinking? How did he feel?\n Sad.\n Why?\n Because the color blue is a sad color. And he looked down .\n So he had two reasons-- he had the body position, because he's kind of looking down like this and he also he had a connection with what you learned in kindergarten, good job, he said that sad and the color blue go together. What do you guys think? How does he feel?\n I think he feels happy. He's smiling and he's playing the guitar.\n Okay, because he's creating music. Maybe that's what makes him happy. I heard Miss Webster had a disagreement when they were pairing. Miss Webster, what is your take? What do you think he's feeling? Tell me what you think he is? Sit up, tell me what you think he is.\n I think he's sad because...\n Okay. Because why? \n He looks what? Say it again, honey. Don't be embarrassed. It's okay to have a different opinion.\n I think he is lonely because he doesn't have any friends.\n There's nobody else in that picture. He is by himself in the picture. Maybe he's lonely. We don't know. Okay. So, we had a difference of opinion. That's okay. Next pair.\n I think he's sad because he's looking down. If he was happy he'd be .\n Whoa. Wait a minute. She just said this man doesn't have anything to eat. Why do you think he doesn't have any?\n Because his shirt is torn, he don't have no pants and he don't have no socks.\n So, you're telling me he looks what? Is he rich or is he poor?\n No. He's poor.\n Okay. That is very good insight on not only the details, but also just what those details are telling us, okay? Do you have something else to add? What would you say?\n I said I think he was happy to sit alone. I think he's happy because he just \n Okay. So, you think the guitar looks-- even though his clothing looks torn, his guitar looks nice, right? Maybe he just puts a lot of value on keeping it nice. Maybe he puts a lot of value on keeping his guitar nice rather than his clothes. Maybe not. Last pair, tell me what you think he's feeling.\n I think he's--\n One at a time.\n I think he's . ...It looks like he's playing a sad song. He's playing a sad song and he's playing--\n Why do you think it looks like he's playing a sad song?\n Because he's bowing his head down and his face don't look very happy.\n Okay. You guys, next question-- I can see everyone sitting nice and tall in your seat. Did you have something different than that? Okay. Go ahead.\n I think he's sad because he looks like he's homeless.\n Oh, maybe he's homeless. Now, why do you think he's homeless?\n Because his shirt's torn on the side.\n Are there any other clues besides his clothing? We already had Miss Marshall tell us about his clothing. What other clues do we have that makes us think he's homeless?\n \n ...without talking and making noise. Jermaine, do you have a clue why he might be homeless? Why?\n Because he's outside by his self.\n He looks like me might be outside. This might be a step that he's sitting on. Next question... Next question--what do you think the artist is trying to tell us? What is the important message-- put your hands down. Think. What is the message? Why is the artist painting this picture of this man? I have one person, she's got herself in the thinking posture. She's thinking. Think please. Think, think, think. I've got a good thinker at this table. I hope you're thinking, honey. Okay. Now, pair up. Ready? Pair and share with your table mate. Get paired up.  Thirty more seconds to share. I hear some good talking so I'm giving you 30 more seconds. Why don't you share this time because you shared last time? Okay. So, you're going to share this time. Let's see you sitting up nice and tall. We're going to share with the entire group. We all learn from each other. You guys, we're going to start with the opposite way. I'm going to go this way. Can you tell me what the artist is trying to tell us, by painting this picture-- I'm sorry, just a second. Could you wait until your classmates are showing you the respect you deserve? You guys, when you're listening to what he's saying, he's trying to tell you what he thinks, what his table mate thinks. So, you need to turn your body, make eye contact and really listen to what he's saying, okay? Okay. Go again.\n I think the artist did this picture because he wanted kids to know how alone he is and how he's homeless. He doesn't have any money. He doesn't have any value.\n Okay. When you mean value, do you mean value like art value or what kind of value do you mean?\n Like he seems very sad.\n Okay. So, you're talking about the color, right? Okay. Next group.\n I think that the artist is trying to persuade him--\n Wait a minute. Say that word again. He's trying to what?\n Persuade.\n Persuade us what? Persuade us to think what?\n Persuade us  He feels real mad or trying to do music or something.\n Okay. Is that what your team came up with? You came up with something different than your team. You had a disagreement, right?\n I think that I was not .\n Do you think the artist wants you to be like him?\n No.\n What do you think the artist wants you to learn from him?\n He won't have nothing to work... .\n You can have a better life, right? Okay. This group-- could you put your feet down? It's your turn. You're going to share with us what your team came up with? You can share. Come on. You can talk to us. Remember that there's no wrong answer. It's just what you think.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 087 ARTEMC087.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.109069], "annotations": [["inaudible", "inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW03", "TW11", "TW13", "TW24"]}, "086": {"text": "  Present your position to the other side. Make sure that you include the SFI that backs up your position. Okay? After that three minutes, we'll swap sides. All right. So, three minutes, pros go right ahead. \n We're talking about how minorities have made a lot of progress since Reconstruction, and political things. Originally, there was  no black senators or congressman, but after  Reconstruction, around 1865, there was two black senators and fourteen congressmen, and now there's four black senators and I'm sure more black congressmen. \n It's like quadruple the representatives. \n And other minorities are representative-- represented in the House and Senate, so they've made a lot of  progress becoming a representative government.  \n They didn't have the knowledge of earlier.  So that's one way Reconstruction positively affected  education in the South... in America...  Also these statistics show that even though...  even though certain states are slightly low on the circulation per capita statistics Virginia is number fifteen, which is relatively high for   a Southern state.  Except Florida is number thirty-four. And not all Northern states were held higher than--   education held higher than Southern states.  Like Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Delaware,  which are all Northern states,   are in relatively low positions on the scale.  \n And former slaves were able to kind of give back  more to the culture, and they influenced technology, and science, and advances in those. And kind of started influencing culture in the South and  kind of in all the United States.   So... and it really basically spread freedom through the South and finally gave the former  former slaves a voice and a place in the country.  And finally brought them together.   Y'all have anything else? \n : I found...\n : The ones... they could like progress forward and they could ...   because they have so many African-American positions and authors for that... for that.  I think, overall, it finally gave blacks a place and gave the South a place in the country again,  where they had been separated for so long.  Kind of started bringing everybody together again. \n Because after the Civil War, the South still thought that 'We don't have to cooperate with the North...'  \n All right, guys. That was pro. All right. Three minutes, let's here the anti. Three minutes and then we'll after... Listen real quick, guys. After this three minutes, we'll give it another minute, okay, and one more minute after that for a rebuttal, okay. For the final statement of the pros, okay? Go ahead, antis.\n 1865  time of Reconstruction and during... nothing really got done.  If you look at the statistics, the infant mortality in Mississippi is number one and if you go on to the  lifestyle statistics, Mississippi is the very... has the least number of museums, concert halls, and observatories in city centers, showing the link between Reconstruction and just how it affected the South and how nothing got done  after the Civil War. \n : Let me, I'm sorry to interrupt,  let me ask you this... What caused... I mean, there had to have been something I mean... during Reconstruction, everything was progressing. Something happened to cause that overwhelming   shift in numbers that you just pointed out   That, you know, the Southern states - the old  Confederate states - dominated the bottom of that poll.  Why do you think that is? Why would that happen?\n Because the North is trying to punish the South. after the Civil War.\n They're more focused on helping themselves  and not helping the South\n Because they're more focused on slavery than  actually trying the help the South because they were trying to punish them. So they didn't... They were trying the free the slaves they weren't trying to help the South because they didn't want them to become stronger, also.\n : Was there a particular event that really  solidified this, that really made that come to fruition?  What is it the time frame of your question?\n 1865 to 1877\n Okay, so...\n During Reconstruction.\n Right. So what happened at the end of Reconstruction?  Why 1877?    What happened in 1877? \n They took the military out of the South. \n Exactly  So, if the military was pulled out, what do you  think caused this result?  \n ...economic constraints imposed by Northern owners  and eventual overseas competition hampered development and Birmingham never developed into the world-class steel-making center that it was supposed to be. So yeah, it did sort of improve, but it just  never reached its potential because, and it even says hampered by Northern constraints. So the North basically said you can't produce more steel because we say so. So you can't... so Birmingham just couldn't really get any better at that point.  \n So the South has more industry now, like everything in the South is  in the lower twenty-eight percent.\n Okay, guys, listen. We're going to give you one more minute. You have a one minute period, the pros, if you want to add a little rebuttal to what you just heard, okay. After this minute we're going to take two minutes to compile our final position, okay, like our final little thesis, all right, that we're going to present then to the class. Okay. So one minute for a rebuttal from the pros. Go ahead. \n Because, since the military left, everybody revolted, so...\n They had no motivation.\n Everything that had been implemented for those years went out the window and... \n But I think it's still, a positive way, was that it at  least it still left kind of some ideas of how to keep order  and the South still kind of had gotten a taste from the  military on how the Americans wanted things run and how  they needed to do to function as America and... so I think that mostly the military Reconstruction  like that was good, because it kind of came in and  helped them that way.  \n : What is the number of African-American senators and representatives? What does it show? What is the difference between  Reconstructive-Era... ... huge difference.\n All right, guys, listen up. You get two minutes. I need each side to compile your final argument, okay, your final statement. This is what you're going to present to the rest of the class. Remember you need SFI to back up your position, okay. That SFI can be census data. More importantly, it can be book data. Okay. Just normal, normal information from your text. So two minutes, go ahead and write it out if you want. Go.  Each side comes up with their final points. \n We could go into more detail on the three-fifths compromise and we could mention the Ku Klux Klan intimidated... even though they got the vote, they were still controlled by the white people.\n Yeah, the social system still was there.  OK, I'll write that down. \n Could this be applied too?\n : Absolutely Remember, you have to explain to the class in  a way that they can understand it, okay?  They don't have that particular census data in front of them. So make sure that you're clear  when you present that as SFI in front of the class. \n Tell them how many libraries and \n Virginia is the only one that's in the top fifty percent.\n Completed out of fifty, and so...  All the Southern states are in the bottom...  And then, this is trying to say, what? Twenty-five right here?  Oh, so the bottom twenty-five, half...  Existing at the time, which was...  Should we tell them that these states aren't...  or should we just not tell them? \n No, I would just...  \n Most African-Americans that were unskilled at the time,  worked through this program to become more independent workers  and to learn to read and write, and so... I'll go back to my statistics here, Virginia and Florida  All right, guys, we're going to go in this order. Listen up. We're going to go in this order. We're going to go economic, then social, political, then educational. Okay. The pros are going to give their positions first to the class. All right? Now, the chart that you have in front of you, what I want you guys to do is while the rest of the groups are presenting their findings, their positions, I want you to take down three different pieces of information that you hear, specific pieces of information that you guys hear from the presenter. All right. Because you're going to use this when you formulate your own response at the end of class to how you feel about, you know, the efficacy of Reconstruction, based on what you've heard. Okay. You're going to make your decision, so you need to make sure that you have information down to support that, okay, to support your idea. And make sure you're getting that from their presentations. All right? So we're going to go with economic first. Economic pro, you have two minutes. Camille, you it?\n  Yeah.\n All right. Everybody listen to Camille.\n Okay. So we came up with a thesis and it was, \"Reconstruction positively affected America economically by bringing a broader selection of products to the South and North. And the North was trying to find ways to help the South with the 13th and Alabama, and Mississippi, and everyone, they started mining for coal, and iron, and everything, and so that helped their economies because they were able to make more money with that instead of just cotton. And the North put a few restrictions on that, but that still helped their economy for more products. And the North manufactured more, like, grain. And we talked about other things that weren't really economic. That was about it, that we could come up with.\n Okay. Thank you. All right. Anti? Who is our speaker today? Okay, Grant, go ahead.\n  All right. So you mentioned the steel, and iron, and coal industries, and yes, those did help. But at the same time, the North industries, the North's economy was growing, and it was growing faster than the South. And there was the whole economic deals with inflation, where... So the South basically was making more, like a higher number of dollars, but it essentially was the same work as before the war.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 086 SSH AYA 086.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.0966634], "annotations": [["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Boy"], ["Girl", "inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["laughter"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Camille"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Grant"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW05", "TW13", "TW16", "TW17", "TW18", "TW24"]}, "148": {"text": "  Anything else?\n  So,  what composter would you want?\n  I think we would want maybe like a three-tray or four-tray vermicomposter. And I do now admit it would be helpful to get one that would be cheaper. Maybe you guys have a different idea?\n  Maybe, I was thinking that maybe we can make one, because I printed off some directions how to make a vermicomposter. So again, that would save us a lot of money just to make it. Like, this might cost $20 to get all these supplies. And I know some people have supplies at their houses that they could bring in to use for this. And this might cost $20, when a store-bought one off the internet may cost $100.\n  Yes, but the  store-bought one's are quality, and a professional makes it. So they know what they're doing.\n  I doesn't really  matter, I mean it has the same purpose, it does the same thing. I just matters on the worms.\n  The only thing that  we really have to buy is the worms.\n  Dylan and Ben, I got to admit, I do agree with Claire. Buying one would be a good quality and what do we know about, I know it says. . . what do we know, about...\n  Now, where are you guys in your conversation?\n  We're deciding  to do wood, metal, or plastic. But he said that the wood would rot and the metal could rust.\n  It could rust  because of the moistness of the compost.\n  Okay.\n  It's not metal.\n  We're not talking about metal.\n  So we might do plastic.\n  On what?\n  If we make it.\n  Purchasing one?\n  No, if we make our own. \n  But this one is award-winning. \n  Seventy dollars.\n  All right, and did you know what website you found that so you could share it as a class? \n  This is buying a vermicomposter that would cost $70. And what did you say about yours?\n  This is about like $20, because we need two of these eight to 10 gallon plastic storage boxes. And we need two of them, and it says the cost is about five dollars each. And that would save us a lot so we could get Weebly pro, tools, and then maybe later on we could by the reusable bags.\n  So what are your thoughts on helping the whole community?\n  I think we should build this because it's better and we would have more money left over.\n  And how would you spend the other money left over?\n  I would spend it on like, stuff that we need for composting, like for tools.\n  Okay, wait, we have multiple conversations going here in this group. So let's wait.\n  I would spend  it on the tools, Weebly Pro, and if we have some money left over we could probably get more from the compost. And then we could get that tea thing that gets the tea out. And that way you could get more money. And then we could get something else.\n  What's Weebly Pro?\n  It's like an extra, you can search it up on Google.\n  Isn't it a website?\n  It's 26 compost, and then you can have a many slides as you want, videos. And then we can sell our compost on the internet, and that would help a lot.\n  So, how is the Weebly Pro better than the Weebly that we already have? Because you were the webmaster on the class website, on the composting website. And you want to, what do you want us to do?\n  We can have,  buy the six-month plan, and then the guys for next year, they figure it out.\n  And how would us buying the Weebly Pro help the community?\n  It would help us  to sell it and to inform about compost.\n  Okay, any other comments or thought?\n  We could,  it could maybe inform the people more because we could make a video of how to compost so they could make their own.\n  Okay, inform who? Be more specific.\n  The viewers of the website.\n  All of our guests?\n  Yeah.\n  There's a  greater chance it's not gonna fail.\n  Guys, we're not playing the what-if game.\n  I not saying,  but we have a chance that the cups might break, because they're cups and they have an easier chance,\n  It has a  bigger chance of not failing.\n  We have to take risks. We have to.\n  Plus, you would have the pride of making your own. \n  If we make our own,  and we mess up, then we're just wasting money.\n  What if, what if, what if, what it.\n  I'm not doing the what-if!\n  ' Cause remember last time when we built a-- \n  If you make it,  there is a greater chance you will fail.\n  Maybe instead  of cups, we use PVC pipes. I mean, they're that cheap, and I mean they would hold longer than styrofoam cups. \n  Shhh, too many people.\n  That's better quality.\n  I do agree with you, Adam, but I also do agree with Dylan and Ben on two different subjects.\n  Guys, why don't  we just make everything? We can make the compost bin,\n  But if we make everything,\n  reusable bags. \n  Why don't we buy  the vermicomposter, and then we make the bags?\n  The reusable  bags are more like, for people to buy if they want to have an easy reusable bag. And then the tools, we might really need later on when we don't need the reusable bags. We might need the tools, or we said, we might need to go buy this now, and it might be too late already.\n  What's the major difference between the vermicomposter and the reusable bags? Jessica, what's the major difference between the two?\n  In vermicomposting, it keeps reproducing, there's three products. While the reusable bags, when you sell them once, and that's all you get from that bag.\n  And with the  vermicomposter, it keeps going. It's very unlikely, almost impossible, that all the worms are going to die in one night.\n  Plus,why would  you buy the bags if you can make them? 'Cause my mom has a friend that makes her own bags out of store bags, like Walmart and Target bags. And she melts them down and puts them into a bag.\n  Why don't we  buy the vermicomposter so it's a better quality, and we make the bags? They're easier.\n  It's very hard  to find a perfect vermicomposter that's plastic and won't break. Most of them are terracotta and they'll shatter if somebody knocks it over. It's also wood, and wood will start to absorb the smells of the compost and then it will start to smell bad.\n  How do you know  we're going to do wood?\n  Compost things on  the internet are using either terracotta or wood. Terracotta shatters really easily. \n  Okay, so we need to do more research on this.\n  I found a four-tray  bin that's plastic for $89.99.\n  But still, why  would we pay $100, when we can pay. . .\n  For quality.\n  ...a mere $20. \n  I know,  but the materials we use aren't made for composting.\n  Listen to Carly for a second. What Carly?\n  Because if  we do what Ben's mom's friend can do, you could easily save more money like you do if you make the vermicomposter.\n  Do you think you could get your mom's friend to come in and teach us as a class on how to make our own like she already does? \n  I think we should buy the vermicomposter first, like buy it or make it, and then buy the reusable bags. So, just like Ben's mom's friend's bags.\n  But we should make them both, because then we will still have some money left over to buy other things like tools.\n  Like a new aerator.\n  If we make the reusable bags we won't get to put our symbol on it, which I think is part of the bag.\n  We're thinking  about doing ovens.\n  'Cause it's like one, two, three, four, five, six.\n  If we made it, we wouldn't have a guarantee that it would work, because we could screw up the way we make it. Or we could just mess it up in general. But if we bought one, it would be kind of guaranteed to work.\n  But sometimes  we miss a part, or a tool that we need to put it together.\n  How do you know that sometimes, what experience do you have that sometimes all the parts aren't always there?\n  Because  when we were making the other one and forgot one of the tools, so we couldn't do one part of it. And then it just all got all messed up.\n  It just threw us off.\n  So from your experience you know that sometimes when we order something, we don't always get it.\n  This part is the leading thing right there, it comes built. All we have to do it put the plastic bars together, and it will be kind of easy. 'Cause it just like, goes. Yeah, and you can work as a group to make it. Because it's like those styrofoams where you pull it together. And you can just see where it's put together, the sticks.\n  Like the couplers on the sides.\n  So, we have  something to be proud of that we made.\n  Everybody said  that we wanted a see-through one so we could actually see the dirt.\n  And this one's not see-through. So, if we made our own, could we get a clear tote? \n  ...'cause the worms  don't like light. So you can lift to look. And the worms don't like light, so when you look at it, lift it up, look at it and then put it back down.\n  That's a good idea. No one else has thought about that, Christian. And how do you know that the worms don't like light?\n  Because we looked it up on the internet.\n  And then one time  I was in my house, and I saw a worm out in the street, and it was kind of like rattling, rattling in the sun. So then my sister kicked it in, back in the grass. So then it was much happier and I re-research that.\n  Okay, but  do we have to do vermicompost?\n  No, we don't have to do it at all. It's going to be our class. We need to vote on what's going to be the best for the community.\n  What about reusable bags?\n  I think the  reusable bags are .\n  And why? How is the reusable bags different than what we're already doing?\n  If we sell the,  if the people next year sell them at the Holiday Boutique, then if we sell compost, then it would be the same customers. And if we give the customer something different more people will come because, they'll yeah, and they need bags.\n  They could buy bags to put their stuff in that they buy?\n  And for backpacks and stuff for when they go grocery shopping they need something to put them in instead of just wasting all those plastic bag. They could use the reusable bag.\n  I have an idea, I think we should stick with our old compost in our tumbler, And then we should get the bags. And we should have the compost and the bags of compost tea. And then they could buy the bags, and they could buy the compost, and they could have the compost tea in the bag and they could carry it so it's not that hard.\n  So we could use our bags as the packaging for the compost?\n  Yeah, that's  what I was thinking.\n  It's gonna cost extra.\n  And then  make it just a bit more expensive 'cause then you get to keep the reusable bag and the compost.\n  You know, if you put your money in the bank they give you money? This would basically give you money, because you can make the compost, yeah the interest, yeah. So we can get the money from this, and then we can buy the bags for the high-level tea.\n  But that has no  holes for the worms. The sun is coming right into--  But would it fit in our room?\n  So, we need to get more information on this.\n  Remember we were talking about the internet could be wrong about its size?\n  Yeah, but normally they don't do false advertisement,\n  This is like in a this-- --the bottom is like this size of a desk.\n  You could compare this to this vase or this container that they would put the plant in.\n  It's like a shower, it's like the size of a shower.\n  Yeah, you guys need more information.\n  We need more information before you can make a decision on that?\n  A lot of information on this already.\n  But we won't  make tea if this one would have really worked, cause it's made. You know, the more it costs the better it works.\n  Do you agree with his comment?\n  No.\n  Yeah, that's what Cara said. \n  Can anyone give an example?\n  I don't agree  with that, because when I was real little I bought some toy cars and they didn't work as well as I got--some that were cheaper. And the cheaper ones worked better than the expensive ones.\n  Okay, you guys continue discussing that.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 148 GEN MC 148 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0421487], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW05", "TW19"]}, "003": {"text": " They're coming around.

Make sure you're sitting up with good posture. \u266a  \u266a Here we go. \u266a  \u266a I am so impressed that you remember so much of that. That was beautiful. We're gonna do it again. We want a really round ooh, and I need a little more emotion on. \u266a  \u266a Do you feel it? Think about it. You're singing to the stars. How cool is that? Right? Here we go. Not like celebrities either, like the actual stars in the sky. Here we go. \u266a  \u266a Love what  I'm hearing. Is the word \"do\" interesting? Or do we just kind of seem to hold it forever and it's kind of boring? Speak really loudly. Christopher, what was your idea?\n We could crescendo.\n We could crescendo. I think that's a great idea. I think it needs some kind of motion. So let's put a little crescendo on the word \"do.\" Ryan, what's your question? A sforzando? We'll try that in a second. Let's see. We'll choose which one we like better. Let's try just a crescendo on \"do,\" just to keep it interesting. So it's \u266a  \u266a Try and do it in one breath. If you have to breathe. Don't breathe at the same time as your neighbor. Stagger. Ready? Here we go. \u266a  \u266a I love the crescendo. We have to get it together for up. Right? Let's try Ryan's idea.

Raise a hand for crescendo. Quiet. A quick quiet hand. Raise that quiet hand for crescendo. Raise a quiet hand for sforzando. Okay. Sforzando wins.

Look at where the clouds, where the clouds can fly. Notice part three does \u266a  \u266a Is your pitch after the word higher, lower, or the same as the pitch in part three? Higher, lower, or the same as the pitch as \"below?\" Are you sure? We start on the same. So that's how you're gonna know to \u266a  \u266a Yeah. Is this gonna be beautiful? This is gonna be... Sorry. I think this is gonna be really beautiful, like which one we just did. Yeah. It has a lot of the same kind of qualities, but there's some really rich harmonies and some really rich, beautiful opportunities for crescendo and decrescendo and all that kind of stuff. Yes. The whole song isn't a cappella. It's a cappella in parts. Yeah. It starts out a cappella, which means no piano. Jeffrey, sit up. It's a cappella for a little while, and then the piano comes in. Then it's a cappella again, and then the piano comes in, and then it ends a cappella. So it kind of goes back and forth. What we want to get from this, for today, from this piece, is I want to hear your expression. I want to hear that crescendo, that decrescendo. Same thing on the word \"clouds.\" What do we think? What should... It's another one of those long notes. So we need to do something with it. What should we do with it? Decrescendo? Put a crescendo in it? Energize it a little bit? Should we try each? Should we try a decrescendo and try a crescendo and see which one we like better? So the long \"cloud\" \u266a  \u266a Two of them. We have two of them. So let's energize them, and then we'll try backing off. Let's see. Ready? I believe that's our pitch. Ready? Here we go. One. Two. \u266a  \u266a Do we like that? Just energize it a little bit? That was crescendo. Do we want to try backing off? \u266a  \u266a Which one do we like better, you guys? Let's try the decrescendo. Ryan, question? Oh, one of each. That's what you're thinking, Rose? So make one crescendo, one decrescendo? So maybe which one? So first one grow, second one decrescendo. Yeah, kind of pulling back a little. Posture. First one is gonna grow. Ready? \u266a  \u266a I love it. I love it. Let's do from the beginning of that piece. All right? Think about your expression. Singing about stars. One, two, three, one. \u266a  \u266a Beginning. So it's \u266a  \u266a and our \"do.\" What were we gonna do with it? I know it's hard when I'm by the piano. I won't be. Ready? Here we go. \u266a  \u266a \u266a  \u266a \u266a  \u266a Beautiful. Beautiful. I think that piece is gonna be gorgeous. I can't believe it's only your second day on it. Yeah. You know what? The clouds or the clouds can fly had a really beautiful crescendo, lovely expression.

Oh, okay okay.\n I used .\n  Oh, yeah yeah. All right, yeah I got it. So it's gonna be negative X minus one, okay. Okay, no I got it. So the first, it's gonna be, so what-- \n  Whatever. \n  Oh, come on.\n  I just wanted to find where it talks about--\n  It would be one minus one .\n  Oh we have one .\n  Is one over x the sum?\n  Do you see, see what I'm saying? Yeah.\n  I'm gonna put it in there, so negative X minus one, 'cause later it's gonna change\n  Wait, you don't really have to do it out since it's gonna change the  so it's higher. You'll have to, you gotta . Yeah. \n No no no no no, don't, don't don't don't. Don't even do that. Do you know why? Because it's part of a . Well-- \n  Yeah yeah yeah. 'Cause the whole thing is negative, and then that's the \n Remember the .  \n  He's a natural.  \n  But now here's the question. You guys kind of already answered this question.  Could you have found it?\n They give you, basically R is two X.\n Uh huh.\n And, since it converges, it has to be less than the absolute value of .\n You got it. Okay. \n  That makes sense. \n  Go back for a second.\n Yeah, you multiply both sides by a third. So it'd be one third times every single one of 'em. And the interval .\n  Um--\n  Oh. Maybe someone's . It means it's gonna get shifted, and then .\n  You were just scaling the . Because it's like, .\n I'd never, I never considered . Oh, okay.\n  Yeah. \n  It's not gonna change the domain of the--\n  Oh, no, no, I'm putting plus negative-- \n  The answer.\n  Yeah. So, the only thing I'm thinking is it might be easier for you to just . It might make sense somehow.\n Oh, how do you read ?\n Yeah, how do you--\n  No no no, no no no no no. It doesn't reduce the time it takes for it to--\n No man, right? \n Oh, okay yeah.\n  One third. Oh, I get it, I get it.\n  It only converges as you, . No matter what, well no matter what. \n  One over X. Three X, five X, two in, two over X.\n  I think it does. \n  Thank you.\n  You're welcome.\n  That's what I'm, yeah, that's what I'm saying.\n  One over X. Because what they want you to do now,  So, you'd say power series is gonna be written as a form of, say, geometric series. Because now you've got, what? What's the first term? \n  Yeah? Right. Okay, what's the ratio?\n Negative .\n And when you write that out, put  around it.  Let him once, show him.\n Okay.  \n  Is it saying three X? \n I would be, I would take the .\n  Are you sure you're working together?\n Yes. \n  And I'll turn it, one. We got one, minus X squared.\n One over one plus X squared.\n That's X to the fourth, right? Minus X to the sixth, plus X to the eighth.\n This is, if you are indexing this. This is your first term, this is your second term, this is your third term, right? Think about the first one, okay? We have left that, in order to get that a two X. Like the first R, okay, the first side of it. And say, it's the second term that  the first time. So it's probably gonna, probably gonna be it. Probably.\n Okay.\n  At least on these simple ones.\n Okay.\n  Okay, leave that for .\n Okay.\n  N minus one over one minus one, x minus one would be zero, which would be .\n  Originally we have negative one .\n  X minus one. \n  The right one, so it's either gonna be .\n  Now you're expanding by three instead of zero six.\n  So, it's like negative X squared switched. So the negative that goes over here, is negative X squared, too. So the negative is which Y .\n  I don't, uh!  I don't know what I'm doing! \n  All right look, hold on. Isn't it the same as the third one?\n  That means that the Y, like the same one, Y is the common one.\n  Right? \n To the one, so this would be X minus one. And negative .  Just put in one here, four, all right? What's the ratio here?  \n  One, you're multiplying the outside of two X. Another one you're doing it as the two X. That means you're moving the X to the inside. If you take a function and you just scale it by a multiple, if you take arcsine of x, any function you want, and you multiply it by scale, like one third, one fourth, . \n  Ah, but then there we said--\n  No! Oh my God, what arc, what are you, wait wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.\n There's gonna be another one I haven't, there, and one third after that is what we're doing here. Our R remains the same. It's the whole series multiplied by the factor of one third.\n  Okay yeah, I'm agreeing to that.\n  I'm pretty sure that's right.\n You multiply this out, it's gonna be one over three, plus three x minus one.\n Why are you multiplying it out? Just think of it as a scale. It's not anything to do, it's not gonna affect our domain outside the function. It's only gonna affect the range. And therefore you're not gonna have any remains 'cause the remains only matter if you didn't have but like one third of it, so we're not doing it like that. One third after it, we're doing like a stretched version. So it's not gonna affect the equation. \n  , so it's negative X.\n  What? No no no no no no. \n  That's the series for .\n  Uh, all right.\n  I'm just  negative X squared. Right? \n  No, no, no, I'm putting negative x squared. It's easier, 'cause then later on when you do plus--\n  No, no, no, no, no, I-- .\n  The sine's been switching. No, no.\n  Yeah, but you can represent that by saying--\n  Yeah, it's gonna be smaller.  Well, it'll be switching, but like would you represent, how would you represent X in the whole thing?\n  To the negative, see the n minus one is put, that's how I'm doing it. \n  Wait, how would you find the ?\n  If it's the absolute value of x minus one, it would be less than one.\n  Mrs. Dockin?\n  Yes. \n  Is this, is this, is this X?\n We're not sure where we are because of these coefficients that change. \n What is X over R?\n Take this series right here, which is that. So, then integrate it. We just though you integrate every term to get it.\n Now you're looking for a general expression.\n Right.\n You have a general expression. It didn't tell you to come up with. no, they didn't tell you to do that.\n Oh, okay okay. Okay, because, in fact, that's not a power series.\n  That's not a power series?\n It is, okay, but it's a different form of a power series.  So you don't have to write 'em like this because you would also need to have, what? You also have to have .\n  Right, yeah okay.\n Got it? Okay. \n  You flip it around.\n One, good, yeah good, what's R? The negative of, yeah you're the negative x plus one, but it needs to be in parentheses. So now you need your R, okay? Now, you're gonna do them when you get to--\n  It needs to be a form of K over R.\n Oh, I thought we just solve for R? You said the third nominated was R. \n  All right guys, she said 1/3 times one, whatever that is. How do you multiply these?\n Does it need to be on the . \n Yeah, so you do it again.\n Yeah, multiply the whole interval, yeah. Multiply the interval.\n  And this is not in the form of a series. \n That one third, does that impact the greatness of one? That's the question you want to answer. I'm not answering it for you right now, you need to figure it out.\n  So, when it's asking for, does the function of the ? \n This, it's like that.\n  You didn't divide it by seven.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 002 MATH AYA 002 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.217902], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Teacher"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW05", "TW09", "TW10", "TW13"]}, "001": {"text": " Okay, I can see two  in here...\n Can you read the article first, please?\n Yes.\n Loudly.\n The president of the republic should be an Egyptian born to Egyptian parents and enjoy salient political rights. His age must not be less than 40 Gregorian years.\n Mm-hmm.\n I agree with the president, um...\n Mm-hmm.\n He should be Egyptian born to Egyptian parents, because it will have, make him have well-rounded perspectives, and it may lead him to having interests to other countries, and so...\n It would make him have interest, or will not make him, prevent him?\n It would not prevent him to, um, from getting to a different country's interest than his country.\n Okay. Good job.\n I agree with Yessenia, because if both, if he's from parents that are Egyptians, he can have some connection with Egyptians, and he won't have pressure from other countries that want to change some of the rules they have. And, um, have, like, wars with different countries about their economy and things they have different.\n Mm-hmm.\n That's what I, that's what my opinion, yeah, that's why I agree with her.\n Good.\n I disagree with the part of the, where it says that they should be Egyptian parents.\n Mm-hmm.\n But I agree with Jesus and his concerns about the Egyptian parents. But my opinion is that they should have at least one parent Egyptian and the other another race.\n Mm-hmm.\n Because if one parent's Egyptian, like, the child, or the, becoming president, would have a something of concerns, and would know some parts of Egypt and its government, and if the other, and this other race would help him guarantee for the governments in the other places and countries, states.\n Okay. Good job.\n Which, the legislative process.\n Good job.\n I agree with Yessenia and Jesus, because if they're from Egypt and their parents are Egyptian, then they can have some cultural background, and they'll know more from people, and they'll have connections with the people.\n Good. Good. So now, what is the result now? Do you think you're going to change the part? I see, I've heard some different opinions here. Are you going with the change, or do you want to keep it as it is?\n I think we should keep it as it is, because, I mean, that's a good thing to have Egyptian parents and a background, like Hilda said, a background of culture.\n Mm-hmm.\n So I'll say yes, leave it. Just leave it the same.\n Okay.\n Just that part.\n Okay. Very good. So you will just leave that part as it is without change. Is there any other parts for this article?\n Yeah, there's a second part. His age must not be less than 40 Gregorian years.\n Mm-hmm.\n Um, I disagree, because, um, when you're young, you'll know more about technology and computers and everything.\n Mm-hmm.\n And that's how, um... the youth and younger children in Egypt, that's how they went and communicate.\n I agree with Yessenia a lot, because when a president is younger but not old, he can connect with the youth and other younger people. Because when Egypt was in the revolution, the president was 81 years old.\n Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\n Eighty-four. And behind the revolution was the young, and they were, like, younger. So he didn't really understand them really well, and they didn't understand him well, because he was a little older than them. So for me, I'll say 35, um... yeah, that's a good age for the president. They can connect with teenagers and people of younger...\n I just...\n Very good. I like the connection that you made, Jesus, between the age and the people who were behind the revolution. Good job.\n I disagree with Jessie and Jesus.\n Good. Yeah.\n Because I think that part of the constitution is okay, because 40, um, 40 years is, makes them have plenty of experience and  to doing his, their work. And, like, it makes them... like, for, like, what Jesus said about technology, they can learn about it, and they can show them and all. So basically, they, they'll pretty much know.\n Who do you mean by they?\n The becoming president.\n That the old, or the young?\n The old.\n The older one. He cannot understand or work with technology that much?\n Yeah. Because Jesus said that they, um, they won't know about technology much.\n Mm-hmm.\n But they, if they're 40, they would have plenty of experience.\n Mm-hmm.\n And they can learn about the technology and know how to communicate with the younger adults and teens, you know?\n Okay. Good, good.\n I agree with Emi, but I agree with Jesus and Yessenia, so...\n Mm-hm. That's okay.\n Um, because...\n Focus on what you want to do.\n Like, youth was, like, 70 or 80% of Egypt.\n Oh, good.\n But if he's older, he's going to have more responsibilities.\n Mm-hmm.\n And he can be more responsible.\n Mm-hm.\n So...\n I disagree with Hilda. Responsibility. Because when they're younger, they're more active and more responsible. Like, they can remember most things where they keep stuff. And when they're active, they can, like, travel through Egypt and see what's wrong with the country, and what's wrong with the economy, and they can make changes and talk to some people about their opinions and things they want to change the country. So I'll say the younger, but not too young. Like, 35 and up.\n Thank you.\n My opinion is that 40 is okay, because the young, the young people, like, at 35, because 35's not that young, but lower than that, can make a little bit of difficulties, because they make, they might make, like, a mistake. They might not know a thing, and they just put another thing.\n You mean they will not be mature enough?\n Yeah, mature.\n Sure. Good.\n Like, the 40s, the 40-year-old people, like, they, they pretty much know everything. They learn it, they were educated. The government laws, and...\n Mm-hmm.\n ...this and that.\n Mm-hmm.\n But I think that part is, 40 years is better.\n Good. So you would like to say, okay, just to open or, or, or break it down to so young like 30 or 20, or even teenager, right? Well, I like that, the two parts that you brought, Hilda, about 70%, that the majority of the population of Egypt are already youth. And your part that you said that this will make, Jesus, that that will make, help them to have good connection with the young people there. Good job. So what did you decide on? I see that you're going with certain direction.\n We should change it. The first part of the statement of Art. 75.\n Mm-hmm.\n Which is the constitution. We should keep that as it is. And the second part of the 40 years, we should change it. Well, we should leave it like that, as well.\n Very good. I like how you are compromising with them, Emi, and you are going with the change. So what part are you going to change?\n Um...\n It will be transforming to what?\n Thirty-five.\n Mm-hmm.\n Thirty-five years.\n Not less than 35.\n Not less.\n Good job. Excellent. Very good. After you take your notes, let's move to the next article.\n Article 77. The term of the presidency shall be Gregorian, six Gregorian years, starting from the date of the announcement of the results of the .\n Mm-hmm.\n The president of the republic may be re-elected for other successful years.\n Mm-hmm.\n I disagree with the six years. Um...\n Yes. Mm-hmm. Yes. Keep going.\n Because I think it's a little longer, and some advantages are that people could get tired of the same president, um, having them over again. And I think it should be lower, for four years, like in America. And some of the disadvantages are that people could like him, and he might be re-elected for another six more years. Um, people could elect him because he did some great things to the economy and things to the country. And that's what I think of for the first one. What do you all think about it?\n You think the first one should be as it is, or changed?\n Changed to four years.\n Changed to four years.\n Yeah.\n Okay.\n What do you think?\n I agree. I agree with Jesus, because an example of this is Hosni Mubarak. He, he, um, was following, supposedly, the terms of the constitution, which, which he made an excuse and took many chances in, um, having the presidency. So I, for, like, 30 years. So I, my opinion is to lower it down to four years, and if they're re-elected, which, they can use democracy like here in America.\n Mm-hmm.\n If they're re-elected, they will have at least 12 years. Basically.\n Okay.\n Do you disagree?\n Um, the statement, I agree, because it will give them more stability and more time to elect.\n Mm-hmm.\n I agree with Jesus and Emi.\n Why do you agree with them?\n Because six years is a lot of years, and if they don't like him, they'll have to wait a lot, a long time so that another president can come into power.\n Okay. So you think bringing it down to four years is better than having the president for one term for six years?\n Yes.\n Okay.\n The second one is the president of the republic may be elected for another successful years. The thing I dislike about this is that they don't really explain how, um, the terms. For example, the president of Egypt, um, used an excuse to be re-elected, because, um, he said that in the constitution, it said, it didn't say specifically how much, how many terms, um, they lead. So I'll, I'll change that, that, um, leave specifically a number of terms they need to be elected. Um...\n Very good point, Luis. I didn't... um, Jesus, I'm sorry. Very good point here. You brought really a very important point. And this is what will, this was, like, the concern of many people over there. The specification of, of what?\n Successful terms.\n Of the, how many terms, very good. Successive terms. Very good.\n Does anybody have an opinion or disagreement?\n Uh, I...\n I agree with...\n Okay. I agree with, um, you, because that's what Hosni Mubarak was really, he was making excuse to, like, stay, um, him how, like, it is, to keep him as a president and re-elect him over and over, to, um... and he was telling them that he was following the constitution, because their theory said there was, like, no number of .\n Yeah, so he...\n I agree also, because, like you said, the example of Hosni Mubarak was the serious, serious excuse. They, um, the people were basically mad at them that, um, certain term, because they didn't give a number of the terms, so, um, that's why Hosni Mubarak made that excuse and wanted to take over.\n Very good. When, the point of staying too many years in power or in office, that brings to me something that's going on in other two countries. You remember any of the other countries in the Middle East, and Africa, that has something going on there? Because of this specific part?\n Libya and Yemen.\n What's going on in Libya now?\n They're protesting against, um, Gaddafi?\n Very good, yes. Good job. I like how you remembered his name. Why? Why they are protesting against him?\n Because he'd been in power for, like, about 43 years.\n Good job. Mm-hmm. Okay, what else is going on in another country? Or what country is having something going on?\n Yemen.\n Yemen.\n Yemen.\n Very good. Okay. Well, this brings us to go back again a little further, something about different types of governments. Remember, Egypt was a republic, okay? When their, the president stayed there for so many years, that will not be a republic country. That will be what?\n A dictatorship.\n A dictatorship. Very good. That will be a dictatorship. So the, the, the type of government is, if government is not a, the republic, or maybe democracy, as they say or claim, but it will be... it will be?\n A dicta--\n A dictatorship. Very good. And the people in power, the people in the office, government office, will be what? Dictators. Okay? It's because they do what they want to do, and they don't listen to other people. Okay, and what is another name for dictatorship, or very close to it?\n", "filename": ["Copy of 001 ENLEAYA001.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.095917], "annotations": [["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW06", "TW08", "TW15", "TW24"]}, "006": {"text": " I'm not too sure if I like this screen print with the acrylic on top of it. I'm not too sure about that.\n It makes it less .\n It's different, in an awkward way. I don't know how to explain it. It doesn't have any depth to it. It has no dimension. Like, she's standing there, he has to take the paint and try to add dimension to it and then. . .\n It looks like she's laying down.\n Actually, yeah it does. I mean, he has to take the paint and try and add dimension to it, and then add the cool and warm colors to make it pop. And I'm just not feeling it. I like the Mick Jagger one, but I'm not feeling this Taylor Swift one. \n See, I like pop art. I just, I don't know.\n Did you notice that?\n What?\n I thought it was a green that goes in to, this. That's on them, it's more like a quiet, like she's sleeping softness. But I didn't notice it that it goes into purple, periwinkle, and this dark violet color that comes out of this red on the bottom half side. Did you see that? Then it goes in to two, and he breaks off the colors And it's like .\n All right, let's take a couple of minutes and try to just wrap up some of our questions. And then we'll talk about a whole group discussion, and see what we all have and what we want to write. \n In a sense, it would be a good picture for the stance that she's in. You know, the title of the album is called \"Fearless,\" and we decided that it is a powerful stance she does look kinda fearless. In the way she's standing. The way he did it, it just doesn't look like her.\n \n It's like the wind's coming back and it pushes her hair. . .\n Yeah, but you would think that she would want to be looking directly at the camera.\n But then her hair wouldn't have been like that.\n Yeah, but they just need some big ole fans, it's Hollywood. You can get some big ole fans to blow your hair back. You would wanna be looking at the camera if you want to be looking fearless. \n You have to think. . .\n It's more of country music. I mean, I could see if you were saying like, hip-hop, pop. And you get like all forceful, \"What's Up, I'm here.\"\n But they're saying, you know, she's a pop icon. If she's a country artist, then why are they putting her on pop billboards and pop charts?\n Because she's mainstreaming into the different areas, she's creating kind of a new version of country for the younger generations like you guys. You wouldn't compare her to Kenny Chesney. Those who want newer generation of country.\n Right.\n All right, let's just try and get to our last question and then we'll talk about whole group and get you back in here. Let's go ahead and start, you guys can chime in when you guys have an answer, if you want your input put in. So let's just talk about the describe section. What we really need to talk about is describing the scene in your own words. What kind of words would you use to describe this piece? Let's start with Mick Jagger.\n Bold.\n Bold.\n Proud.\n Proud.\n Electric.\n Electric. Okay, those are good ones. What about Taylor Swift?\n It's more feminine. More soft\n It's pale, it's delicate and .\n Delicate.\n Soft.\n You said soft.\n It's like he's almost scared when he's doing Taylor Swift, compared to Mick Jagger. Because Mick Jagger is all rough and boxes everywhere.\n I think he almost makes Taylor look almost intimidated. She's kind of pushing away--\n The position.\n . . .and you have all these colors around her. With the selection and. . .\n Innocence. Yeah, I think we talked about that with Taylor a little bit. You kind of have to look at the personality of each artist as well.\n Plus really you have to listen to her lyrics then it, like, paints a picture.\n She has an innocent expression.\n I'd say innocent, yeah. Okay.\n Fierce.\n You say fierce? Okay.\n It's like her personality, she just breaks it out with this bold pose.\n All right good. So those are some good words, key words to describe it. So, analyzing. Let's figure out and pinpoint specific elements and principles of design that we see in the piece that we want to discuss.\n Colors.\n Colors? Color's a big one. In both of them actually.\n Paint strips?\n The paint strips, it looks like it's a lot of paint. It kind of creates a lot of movement, with the way that it's flowing through the pieces. All right, so our big ones are color. . .\n He said in the video color is everything.\n And that's his main focus is color.\n The different colors make the value in the picture, the dark colors make the darker shades, and light colors.\n He uses more bold colors in Mick Jagger than he did in Taylor. And like the contrasting colors of Mick Jagger are more loud.\n I'd definitely say it's louder. Okay, good. Let's discuss the movement a little bit. So if you look at it, I see a lot of movement personally in the touch with the hair. I like how the hair is like that and I like her position from the side, because I think it adds interest. Like I was saying a second ago, if she was looking straight forward, I don't think the hair would have the same effect as it does from the side. And that's just my personal opinion, but I like how the hair is kind of flowing through and it's creating the movement through the piece. And then with the Mick Jagger one, the movement in this piece right here is really interesting to me. How he chose the green and the red to contrast each other. I think that's big bold move in this area. Good. Now what are our focal points?\n Faces.\n Faces? And what are the big things that factor in for that? Why is that? What did he do?\n The colors around her make her pop.\n The colors surrounding. If you look, the face is white right here, and then her skin tone is pale as well. So that kind of pops out against the bold colors. What do you guys think about the materials? The silk screen and the acrylic paint? You guys got to see a little bit of him working in the video, where he gets those huge rows of the acrylic paints from the jars, and just dipped in a couple different ones. And just started coloring. So what do you guys think about his process, and the materials he uses?\n He doesn't really choose what direction, he just kind of goes with the flow.\n It's very free, if you watch him.\n .\n Mindless. Mindless creativity. He does what comes to him, which is interesting. Any other comments about the actual process or materials?\n I think It would have been more amazing if he didn't use the silk screens.\n So you'd rather him just paint it than add the silk screen?\n I think it would be more like a wow factor.\n And some of his pieces are just paintings. More of the people though, like the Rollins he painted. . . And the ones he did for President Obama. President Reagan, some of the Statue of Liberty. And also some of the other people like Aerosmith, and the Beatles as well. And he's usually famous for painting his faces. And he would go into the color.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 006 ARTEAYA006.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.136116], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW03", "TW05", "TW06", "TW08", "TW16", "TW24"]}, "009": {"text": " All right.

Matthew Pelkey.\n Mouth shut.\n Our mouth shut. Our lips are...\n Closed.\n Closed. Collin.\n Don't lay on the carpet. Don't be silly.\n That's right. So tell me. Help her out, Jacob. Our feet what?\n Be quiet.\n Our feet need to be quiet. Maddie, can you help me out with one more? We've done eyes watching, lips closed, feet are quiet. What do we need to do? Who can help her out? Alice, I see your hand raised.\n Ears.\n Listening.\n Ears listening. And one more. Let me see if-\n Hands to yourself.\n Adam.\n Keep your hands to yourself.\n Hands are still. Okay, so let's do our checklist. We said eyes watching. Let me see those beautiful eyes. I don't see Layla's. I need you to turn your body. Very good. Next, ears listening. Does everyone have their ears listening? Next, lips are...\n Closed.\n Unless I call on you, just like I did with all of our helpers, hands are...\n Still.\n Still. So Catherine, I'll tie that shoe in just a minute. You put your hands still in your lap. Perfect. And our feet are...\n Quiet.\n Oh, I love it. Are we ready to view our video?\n Yes.\n Perfect. Okay. I want to be sure you can see before we begin, because we're going to turn out our lights. All right, what do we want to find out? I want you to watch for what type of weather you see. What are we watching for?\n What type of weather.\n Weather. And what tools are the children using to observe that weather? So the second thing we need to watch for? Tools. Listen and watch for the tools. And have we had an experience like that? So let me see those beautiful eyes. Let me see them. Face forward. Lights helper. Where's my lights helper?\n Claire.\n Claire, would you mind turning out our lights? Okay. Do we know what we're listening-\n Yeah.\n ...and watching for? Okay. Eyes forward. I'm going to be seeing who's doing their job. Ready.\n The wind is blowing my hair, but then it's very strong today. We decided to blow bubbles. They're blowing away. That's Oliver blowing bubbles, too. Oh, Amy's bubble just blew away. It was so windy, the wind is making the bubbles.\n The wind's pushing out the bubbles, and then the bubble comes out.\n We didn't even do anything. All we did is hold up the bubble wand.\n Whoa.\n You can't see the wind, but you can see what it's doing.\n That looks like fun.\n What are they doing?\n My dad gave us some old sheets to tear up so we could make some streamers.\n Is he having fun?\n That's Oliver, and the streamer just went in his face.\n What are they doing?\n Let's see what they're doing. Let's watch.\n I was pretending the streamers were the hair of this pig, because the little knot is really shaped like a head, and the rest of the stick is their body. And if they have branches growing on them, that's to me their hands and their legs, or something.\n All right. It was very short. Well, did you enjoy that?\n Yeah.\n I want to see that again.\n Good. Go turn on our lights.\n Again.\n Now. Oh, we might watch it again later. So let me see if you were listening and viewing our video. I'm going to check by answering these questions.

And what did they do?\n They ripped the paper.\n They ripped them, and they put them on the stick. Have we had a similar experience?\n Yeah.\n Yeah, for the bubbles.\n Yeah, let me see who's... let me see who I haven't heard from. Clara, what did we do?\n We blowed bubbles.\n We blew bubbles. Did we have to go like this?\n No.\n Did we have to do that?\n No.\n What happened when we put it in the bubble solution and put it up? What happened?\n The wind blew it.\n The bubbles blowed out.\n All right. So now we're going to do a think-\n  Pair share.\n I want you to turn to your partner that you talked to yesterday.\n Okay.\n I want you to share how you observed the wind. We had a lot of windy weather yesterday. Talk to your partner about where you observed the wind. Emily, she'll be right back. You be thinking. Jacob, what did you see yesterday?\n \n Wind. How did you see it?\n \n What did it blow?\n \n The trees? It blew the bubbles the other day. Collin, what did you see?\n \n Perfect. I like that. You used the tools we made in school. Marcus? Are you back? All right, we just got through watching our video, talking about our wind observations. Now I want you to tell me what effective speakers do. I'm going to call on some people I haven't heard from yet. Marshall, tell me one thing an effective speaker does.\n Speaks slowly.\n Speaks slowly. All right, let's see what else effective speakers do.\n They keep their eyes on the audience.\n Eyes on the audience, just like mine are on you right now. Bronwen, show that you're listening.

Clara, tell me something else.\n Be still.\n All right. Oh, you need to stand still. Should you sway back and forth when you're presenting your work?\n No.\n No. Okay.\n Have we covered it all?\n Yes.\n Let's see. Let's remind ourselves. Look at your-\n  Audience.\n Speak-\n  Slowly.\n Stand-\n  Still.\n Volume-\n  Up.\n Show your-\n  Work.\n Okay.

Okay, go ahead.\n I can see the wind blow a horse's..\n Huh? Horse's what?\n Tail.\n Okay. Did Holland look at the audience when she presented her work?\n Yes.\n What do you think?\n Good.\n Hold up those thumbs up signs. We want to give her good feedback. Put your thumbs up sign down. Thank you, Holland. My next speaker is Alice. Alice. Thank you for choosing a safe path. Come on. Good. All right. Let's watch our speaker. Remember.\n I can see the wind blow grass.\n All right. Did Alice speak slowly?\n Yes.\n Thumbs up sign. Awesome. Put your thumbs up sign down. My next speaker. Yes, Fran. What do you want?\n \n Wesley, please come up. Cathy, just look through your window. I know we're close today.\n I can see the wind blow the roofs.\n Did Wesley stand still?\n Yes.\n Yes. Good job. All right. Thumbs up sign if he, yeah, if he stood still. Good. Our next speaker, Sofia. Sofia, come up. Okay, let's start out like this. Loudly.\n I can see the wind blow .\n Did Sofia have her volume up?\n Yeah.\n She did a much better job. Let's give her those thumbs up signs. Good job. Oh, I don't see everyone's. Thank you, Adam. Good. Thumbs up sign down. Matthew Bashir.\n I can...\n Oh, hold on. Are your friends listening to you? Let me see if you're remembering, if your eyes are watching and your ears are listening. Christopher, we want to see you look at the speaker. Turn your body this way, please. Thank you.\n I can see the wind blow kites.\n Very good. Show your work. Oh, they've already got those thumbs up signs. Friends, do you believe that he showed his work? Is he showing everyone? Good. Why, thank you, Matthew.\n What does that say?\n Hmm?\n Why is the ?\n What is that? His kite is in the shape of a...\n Star.\n Star. Isn't that beautiful? I love those details. Catherine, your turn.\n I can...\n Oh, hold on one second. I'm sorry to interrupt. Eyes forward. Eyes forward. Good job.\n I can see the wind blow my star. I can see the wind blow leaves.\n She wrote two sentences. Show your work. Very good. Did Catherine look at her audience when she presented her work?\n Yes.\n Good. Thumbs up signs. Christopher, Romley, Emily, we want to see your eyes up here. Thank you. Aiden. Aiden. All right, Aiden, we're going to do a quick check. May I please have this? It's okay. Accidents do happen. I just didn't want you to get hurt.\n What get hurt?\n Because you're holding it... we want to be safe with our materials. Criss-cross. Very good.

Peter, you had a good definition, could you repeat that, remind us?\n I don't remember it exactly, but it was something along the lines of anything with waves that move, waves that are radiated, I mean.\n  Didn't you say it was waves that are spread?\n Yeah, waves that are spread by something, and they usually have energy with them. Like, the sun sends its radiation to the earth, in the form of light, heat, UVA, UVB rays.\n  Okay, so with that understanding, would you guys say that all radiation is harmful?\n  Not all.\n Yes. To a degree, all of radiation is harmful. But just, it depends on how harmful.\n But so then, what is like, when it's not harmful?\n It's very, very, very.\n Not, almost?\n It's almost negligible.\n  What types of waves that radiate, or what types of radiation do you associate with being not harmful?\n  Radio waves. \n  Any others, Jordan?\n Microwaves?\n  Visible light.\n Yeah, visible light isn't really that harmful.\n  What about microwaves, that's a good one. What do you guys think about microwaves?\n I thought they were dangerous, but somebody told me that they weren't.\n They're not really that harmful are they? I mean-- \n  You probably shouldn't stand in front of it.\n Saying they're not that harmful?\n They're not. I mean, I think probably like extended exposure to them would be bad, but I think that could be the same with a lot of things.\n  The door shuts when you use the microwave too.\n  What about then, where do they fall on the spectrum, what makes you think they're not dangerous? Or that they are?\n  Because they are longer than light waves.\n They've got longer wavelengths.\n  Which what does that mean?\n They have lower frequencies. They don't carry as much energy with them. Lower frequencies.\n  Let me consult my chart.\n  Okay, good idea. Or can anyone help her? What was your question Claire?\n Oh, I didn't have a question.\n  Oh, okay.\n What was the question? Why is she looking at her chart?\n Nope, same .\n We think they're not dangerous because they have a longer wavelength and a smaller frequency than light. Light is .\n  Okay good, so I think this is a good segue to the next question, which is, why are some electromagnetic waves considered dangerous to humans, while others aren't?\n Do you know what a segue is?\n  Okay. Which ones have more energy than others?\n Gamma rays and X-rays, and UVH rays?\n  Okay good, Peter did you have something you wanted to add?\n To what he just said?\n  Mm-hmm. Okay, good, and, can you repeat that, Sam?\n Some electromagnetic waves are more dangerous because they have much more energy.\n  Okay, good. So ultimately, what is that energy doing? Why is that harmful to us?\n Can stimulate cell growth .\n The more energy it has the more like, materials it can penetrate. Like visible light wouldn't really cut through you, but gamma rays could, like travel through skin. And X-rays can.\n  What did you guys learn about perhaps in biology? Cancer .\n Well that it's, when cells grow too fast, the abnormal growth of cells keep reproducing and...\n There's a mistake in the coding of the DNA, and then everything just goes haywire and, the cells, like what Caleb said, grow at abnormally fast rates, and they just take over that area and spread.\n Well yeah, they stop functioning as normal cells, and their sole function is to reproduce, and to continue growing and then they eat portions of other cells.\n  Okay, so what do electromagnetic waves have to do with this extra energy? This dangerous energy?\n Well wouldn't like, Cho said they would like stimulate the growth and, or is that not?\n Why do they stimulate growth?\n  Because they have energy.\n What does the energy do to stimulate it?\n  What were you going to say, Ronnie?\n Well, I just said that they trigger, they don't like stimulate, I mean cell growth to an extent is necessary . But they can trigger something dangerous, like with . I don't really have like the percent  or anything but...\n  What else might control cell growth?\n DNA?\n  Okay good, yeah.\n Lots of energy can. Can energy alter DNA? I feel like it can't.\n Well, isn't that what it's doing if it's triggering abnormal cell growth?\n I don't know.\n  Is anyone in here, have you taken, or are you taking  biology?\n I took it last year. I kind of remember what we talked about with cancer.\n  It's okay, and you guys have actually come to a good conclusion, that it does lie in the DNA, and that, you know, certain types of radiation can cause mutations in DNA that affect the cell cycle. So, when we think about cancer a lot of times, in light, or electromagnetic waves, a lot of times we think about skin cancer. And we talked a bit about that yesterday. We also probably notice skin variations among different people from different regions of the world. So, how does skin color variation, how do you think it relates to the amount of UV radiation that a particular population receives?\n  You mean based on their race?\n  Just based on their geologic background. Geographic background, not geologic.\n Well I mean, people with darker skin tend to not get sunburned as much as somebody with really, really pale skin.\n I don't think that's true, I think it's just that it doesn't show up as much, like you can definitely still get sun damage--\n No, of course you can still get sunburned, but I don't think it's like--\n  It's harder?\n I think so.\n  I think it's just less noticeable.\n Yeah, I think it's just less noticeable, I really don't think it has anything to do with-- \n  Okay, so you're getting the same amount, good, you're getting the same amount of radiation, sure.\n  Is sunburning caused by like the amount of light we absorb, our skin absorbs?\n It's actually, it's in their, Grace and Lana's video. About how .\n What did we do?\n On your presentation about sunburn. How sunburn works. I don't remember .\n  Okay, so ultimately I guess, I'll restate the question. So, how does skin color relate to the amount of UV radiation a certain population may receive? We see a lot of variation, so a lot of people often times say, \"Oh, why do people in, \"in countries that are near the equator, \"Why are they darker, wouldn't that make them hotter?\" Because we tend to think of dark colors as absorbing a lot of different wavelengths of light. Is that true, is that what's happening? It seems kind of...\n Wouldn't that make you sweat more then? Which would be good if it was hot.\n I guess sweat .\n  Sweat is just to release the heat on your body.\n No, but that's what I'm saying, like if you get hotter quicker, then you would start sweating earlier, which cools you down.\n  What is the pigment in skin that causes color variations?\n  Melanin.\n  Okay, good, alright. So, people who have darker skin, do they have more or less?\n They have more.\n It's in eyes, too, right? It's what causes eye color differences? Maybe I'm making that up, but...\n  What do you think the purpose of the melanin is? Is it to absorb, Grace offered one theory, what's another theory too there? There are several different reasons. What does it do to UV light? What's different about people that live say, in the equator regions, like the  and people who live up north?\n They don't get sunburned if they live there.  I mean...\n There's like nothing to .\n Yeah, exactly. People who live in northern climates are much more likely to get sunburned, because they're not exposed to that much sun, or their relatives weren't. And as they adapted they just passed on that trait of having fair skin. But, I don't know why. Do you know, Miss Roseborough?\n  Yeah, I have an understanding, yes. And when I think about it, I kind of think about the actual pigment itself, and what it's doing, and where it's located on the body. What it may be serving to do.\n  Doesn't it synthesize vitamin D for us?\n That would make sense.\n Yeah that's, vitamin D from sunlight, I guess that's why.\n  Okay, so people who have more melanin have, live in the sun, you know they have more exposure to the sun. Why do they need that extra melanin?\n  To protect them.\n  Okay yeah, so let's go with that, to protect them. From what?\n From the radiation like, I guess if you're out in the sun more, you need more protection, so like, it's kind of like a built-in sunblock.\n  What would it protect? So, it's on the surface, right?\n Protects the inner skin? It protects the outer layer, right?\n  Epidermis.\n  Yeah, I feel like Ewan brought up something like this yesterday when we were talking.\n Is that why they, you have lighter on your hands?\n Oh, I think that's the thing about like, gamma rays, for example, being more, like that was one of the  question, because they have more ability to penetrate through skin, and .\n  Okay, so really what's happening is the melanin actually absorbs the wavelengths of light that would normally penetrate the skin.\n How does it do that?\n  It just doesn't, the energy is just sort of dissipated as heat, and so...\n You get the heat but not the radiation?\n  Right, exactly, so it doesn't go further into your body.\n So, darker people get less sunburned than fairer people, because of that?\n Well, does it necessarily have to do with sunburn?\n And they're less likely to get skin cancer?\n  Yeah, I'd say they're less likely to get skin cancer.\n When you get tan, are you getting more melanin in your skin?\n  Yeah, what's happening when you get tan?\n So, shouldn't tanning make your skin stronger?\n Well--\n If it increases melanin?\n I don't think it's necessarily increasing it.\n  Because the tan goes away.\n Oh.\n So, it's like you have whatever your natural skin color is, then that is determined, how much.\n Okay.\n  Okay, so next misconception, that a lot of people have, or just something that I've always wondered about. I don't know if it's a misconception or not, but I'm thinking about colors that we associate with certain, just everyday things. So, when I go into the bathroom, when I go into the kitchen, I see red and that indicates the faucet that I turn for hot water, and blue for cold water. Why do you think those colors were chosen and is that always true?\n  Because fire is red.\n Water and ice is blue. It's not really blue, it's more clear.\n White and blue flames are much hotter than red flames.\n  Yeah, explain that.\n  I don't know, I guess back, a long time ago before they knew that--\n The hottest part of the fire is at the top, and if you think about a flame, usually you see a little blue or white part at the bottom, and then it's the red orange at the top.\n Which is where it would be the hottest.\n It's hottest at the top.\n But there's, at the top it would be starting to cool off as it gets away from--\n At the peak it's the hottest. But then the bunsen burner, the hottest part is like...\n Yeah, the hottest part of the flame is the top.\n You get a marshmallow, you put it at the bottom?\n No, sir!\n  What color is at the top, guys?\n  Red.\n  White.\n Or orange. \n Blue and white at the bottom.\n It's an experiment, Miss Rose, let's do experiments on fire.\n  That's a good idea, I think we should at this point.\n Do you have bunsen burners in here?\n  No, I don't have a gas source. So, let's just go back, I even broke it down, and I was thinking about well, where did this come from? I was thinking, what wavelengths of light are being absorbed by the color red, and what are being reflected by the color red? And so is the color red actually hotter? How could I relate that to temperature? How do you even relate a color to temperature? So, just the color red, what's it reflecting? What's it absorbing?\n What color does it reflect? It reflects red.\n And it absorbs green and blue. Or cyan.\n  Right, so, going back to the, what makes it that color, its natural frequency, what types of waves are causing it to change in temperature? What's happening as a result of different white light say, striking it, and its actual reflection and absorption of different waves of light? Would red or blue actually be hotter? As a pigment?\n Blue should be hotter, because it has more energy, it has the shorter wavelength and greater frequency.\n Yeah, Sam's right.\n  So, with a pigment? Think about a pigment first.\n What about it, just think about it?\n  Yeah, so certain wavelengths of light are being absorbed, and certain, wavelengths of light are being reflected. What does it mean when a pigment absorbs wavelengths of light? What happens to the energy that is being absorbed?\n It transfers to the medium?\n  Okay, good.\n I was going to say the pigment has the same frequency as those wavelengths, so...\n  Probably right.\n  Okay good, so it absorbs, so let's think about blue again. How could you apply that? What wavelengths of light does it absorb?\n  Shorter wavelengths than red.\n Well no, blue absorbs red and green, so this would be, longer wavelengths and lower frequencies.\n So, red would absorb the blue. Therefore it would absorb the higher frequency, had more energy, which means it would be hotter, right?\n  What do you guys think? Can you restate that?\n Sorry, because red absorbs blue, and blue has a higher frequency, the red would be absorbing the higher frequency, which means it would be getting more energy from the higher frequency. So, red would be the hottest.\n The man has a point. I agree with Peter.\n I agree with it, too.\n I agree with Peter.\n  Yeah, that's sort of the conclusion I came to, the only conclusion. Then I started thinking more, I was like, well how does this apply to stars? So, if I see a star that gives off a...\n", "filename": ["Copy of 1042 SCI AYA 1042edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.202129], "annotations": [["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Peter"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Jordan"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Claire"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Cho"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Caleb"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Sam"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Sam"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Cho"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Students"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Cho"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Claire"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Caleb"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Students"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Peter"], ["Voiceover"], ["Peter"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW08", "TW24TW08"]}, "1047": {"text": " Hello, guys. After all the hard work you've put in on doing your presentations, and your tri-board, and all the really cool stuff you've done, now we need to put it all together and see what you think about these energy sources that you've done all this research for. Okay? So, first off, doing a little poll. Which energy source do you like the best and think it would be the best one to use?\n Solar energy.\n Why?\n It looks pretty cool, and, I don't know, it seems like the most efficient way because the sun's always there and the sun won't run out--\n That's the word, whenever you're done using it--\n You can sell it.\n You can keep the energy from the sun from the morning and afternoon during the night.\n You can sell it.\n Okay, so he thinks solar. Who else?\n Okay.\n Go ahead.\n I like the wind.\n  Oh, so you can talk to him. Because you want to be able to talk to each other, right? I liked the wind one because it stored up the battery. And the battery, whenever it wasn't windy, and so it kind of was always there. It didn't matter about the wind.\n Yeah, you can answer the question.\n  I also think that wind's the best one because not only can you store it and have energy for whenever there is no wind, you can also make money off of that. So, maybe if you get it in enough homes, you won't even have to have a job. You can make money off that.\n  That's a very good point. That's a very good point, making money off of that energy source. Which other ones did we say could make money?\n Um, the solar. Solar can make money .\n Well, I like the wind. Because, it's like, the sun is going to burn up one day, but the wind is always going to be there. And the only bad thing about it is that the birds are going to die, but that's okay. \n  Okay, well, what are some pros and cons then? So, you just said birds would die if we use wind power, okay? Does that outweigh the benefit that you get from using wind power? \n I think birds dying isn't that bad, because, you know, we eat birds, so I don't think it would be that bad if birds do die. I mean, I don't think a lot of birds die because of the wind solar energy. Not as much as oil, or any of that other stuff.\n Yeah, or like we eat birds.\n The other one I like is the hydro one that James did, because-- \n  His was ridiculous. That was nice.\n  So, what part of it were you most impressed with? Like, not like the demonstration, but it was a great demonstration, but hydroelectric power in general, what part of that--\n  Like how if you have a pond or something, you can put it in there, and then it will power up your whole house.\n  Do we need moving water?\n Oh yeah, you need moving water to have that. You'd have to have a stream, but you could basically do it anywhere you have moving water. And if you really wanted to spend some money, there's also the pump storage plant from a high reservoir to a low reservoir.\n  So, that one actually sounds pretty good. So, somebody want to defend theirs, Rakif?\n I don't really like mine, because--\n  Which one did you do?\n  I did oil.\n  Natural Gas.\n  Oil and natural gas, okay. Why not?\n Because mine isn't as abundant as the wind or as the solar energy, so it's probably going to run out pretty soon. Like oil, natural gas, and coal do run out. They're not going to be as, here as much as the wind, or hydro or something like that.\n Well, there's a lot of dangers involved with using oil, right? Oil rigs, pipelines, lots of dangers involved, right?\n Oil prices can cause high gas prices.\n  That's true too. Remember in your presentation, you talk about some of the dangers. What were those dangers, and are those dangers any better or worse than some of the other dangers for the other energy sources?\n For oil?\n Yeah.\n The pipelines can burst, and they can kill marine life in the water if the oil gets out.\n They could cause another oil spill.\n Explosions.\n But coal, I know you're supposed to like stick up for your natural resource, but I kind of think coal can be good, but it's mostly bad, because a lot of people's lives are getting killed because of all the gasses, smells, and being down there for so long. And I think that's also very bad.\n And the land, it hurts the land and the environment.\n Coal is a very dirty resource if you think about it. All the coal dust, it can cause a lot of lung problems. So, the miners that go down there, they're risking their lives right?\n Yeah.\n Any of the other resources as dangerous as mining coal?\n No.\n  Nuclear energy.\n  What?\n Nuclear energy is the worst.\n  Okay, what about nuclear energy? How dangerous was that when you looked it up?\n It's a six out of ten chance.\n  Of what happening?\n It depends. It costs way too much, first of all, to build it.\n  It is very expensive. That's true.\n It's got a lot of risks, like if it gets into your water, or if you breathe in the radiation. \n  I imagine it could--\n  It smells bad. . \n  Okay, does collecting oil use more energy than it provides?\n  Good question!\n What do you mean by collecting oil?\n  Like, if you have to have the process of going underground and drilling the oil, does it use more energy than it provides?\n No, I don't think so. Because in my presentation, it said it produces like a widespread, like a very large amount of energy. And also that, your wave and tidal power powers our system, as you said in your presentation.  Oh, good point. Those two actually work together. When you talk about the wave and tidal power, that energy could be harnessed to run your offshore drilling. So, that's a very good thing as well.\n It's a benefit of drilling.\n Absolutely. Are there different energies that do benefit each other?\n Yes, the solar energy and wind. Because the wind energy is based off the sun, because of how the sun waves come onto the Earth and then it turns this sun mill, so it produces the turning of the mill, so the sun and solar energy and wind energy-- \n The solar energy and the wind, they actually work together, because I've seen some wind turbines that have solar energy panels on the top. One, then the other can go. That's okay.\n I think solar energy is a really good thing, because for a lot of power plants, like for times, the condition of natural resources like wind, even hydroelectric if there's a drought or something, or not enough water flow, you could always have the solar panels stuck on top of the plant, or anywhere.\n Right, because we've found that solar is pretty cost-feasible right?\n Yeah, it's not that expensive. And actually, you won't have to pay an electrical bill if you get that.\n If you were going to use solar panels to power a wind turbine or something, you're better off just using the solar panel.  It would just cost more money to have to get the solar panels and the wind turbine, or to have the solar panels power the turbine.\n It doesn't power it. It's just, like, another way to get energy at the same time that you're getting the wind. When there's no wind, there's not much of a wind--\n  That's what the battery's for. Hmm, interesting.\n I have a question for solar power, too. For solar power, how can I make aluminum more efficient in the future?\n Well, it doesn't use a lot of the gas, so it doesn't affect the environment. So, it doesn't affect your breathing. And you don't need solar panels, like you don't need to turn stuff on during the day, because the sun, through the windows, can give you light, and then can store up for the night.\n Okay.\n I have a question. What natural resource do you think will be the most used in the future? Like, 50 or so years from now? \n Wind. It was used like 3,000 years ago, so if it was used 3,000 years ago, I think it would be used 3,000 years in the future.\n That's not necessarily true, because it could get more worn out by the time 3000 years in the future comes.\n The problem with the wind thing is  it can be used in country, like rural areas, because in other areas, you can't put a wind turbine in a normal neighborhood. Because you can't, can you put one? \n You mean I could put one outside the school here? \n  Well, it would give energy to the school and the rest of the houses that are near the school.\n  Well, I'd put it on top of the school, because then there would be more wind higher up.\n Right, and we have to worry about spacing, right? Because we were saying wind power is built usually where? On wind farms, where you have a lot of flat land. Because if you build in a mountainous region, are you going to get a lot of the wind?   If it's high enough it'll  probably be enough.\n Then if you build your wind turbine high up on a mountain, what is the chance of that wind turbine maybe getting struck by lightning, or being damaged that way?\n  Yeah, that could be a real problem because of the wind and the way it could be struck down.\n Right, that's very possible. So, when you think about one  energy source, is there really one energy source to go with? Or do you have to take into consideration a lot of factors of where you live, what's available? Because, again, talking about building a hydroelectric plant we established you need running water. Is there running water everywhere around the United States?  No.\n No. And what's the problem if you flood an area, even if there is a running water, what happens if you flood the area?\n Well, they have to decide. Usually if it's going to be a major problem, they will actually dig a separate reservoir for the river to flood instead of it coming up on the banks of the river and destroying homes and things. That's mostly our United States rule. But, in China, they really don't care. So they flood three or four cities, multiple towns, fill up three gorges of water.\n Wow. That's just insane. Because once you disrupt water flow, you have a problem. So again, there are some pros and cons to these. Okay, we're going to take a second, and we're going to try to rank the resources in terms of which one you guys think is the best one to possibly use. So, if you had to pick one that you wanted to go with, whether there was running water, think you have those things beside you, don't limit yourself there, but turn to your neighbor for a minute, and discuss which one you think would be like 1 and 2. Because each one of you might have a different opinion. Give each other a little bit of a reason why, and we'll get back together in just a second. \n  Alright guys, another 30 seconds. Then we'll get back together.   Alright, three, two, one. Let's wrap up our conversations. Alright. How many people, by show of hands, went with one of the non-renewable resources, like coal, oil, or natural gas? Cool! So, everybody picked a renewable resource as the way to go. Alright, Ryan?\n I think it's either wind or solar power.\n  How many people agree?\n Oh, so wind or solar is the clear choice. Jonah, why?\n The thing is, I think solar would be first. Because solar energy, you can use almost anywhere, pretty much. But the wind, if you live here,  you can't get it as easily, because there's not as much wind. So, it would be a lot easier to have solar, because you can use solar anywhere, because the sun is shining pretty much everywhere.\n We think solar too, because the sun is always there, even if it is winter, or it's a little cloudy, the sun is still there.\n  Yeah, but what about at night time?\n  So, Maddy, what did we find out about solar?\n At night time, like a lot of people go to work during the day, so no one's at their house using their lights and stuff. So, there's a battery that stores all the energy and then you can come home at night and you can still power your house. \n You still get some light at night, bouncing off the moon.  Dustin, what do you think?\n I was thinking that solar energy would be great because I was comparing it to if you want to charge your phone, and you have it plugged in, and while it's plugged in it's fully charged and you can still use it, and it won't un-charge because it's still plugged into the wall. But, if the power goes out at your house, then it will stop charging, and you'll have that much battery left. So, it's kind of like if you're out in the day, and your house is charging while there's still sun. So, you're still getting energy, and at night time when the sun is gone, you'll have that energy saved in the battery of the solar thing.\n  Well, it's the same thing with wind power. You'd still have that battery there.\n Yeah. Wind power would be--\n Would solar power still work during a storm?\n It depends how severe the storm is.\n So, you mean this is, like, built to last.\n Yeah, if it gets struck by lightning, I don't think it would still work.\n  But, you know, when there are clouds outside during the day on a cloudy day, you know the solar radiation is still getting through the clouds, right?  So, that solar panel would still be getting energy from the sun on a cloudy day, just at night you would still have to use the battery that's been stored. Just like with wind power. There is wind power all day long, all night long, but sometimes it does die down at certain times, so there's a battery too, there as well. Exactly.\n I agree with solar power, but I agree that it would be great for being on your houses and things, but I don't see the purpose of a solar farm. It takes up a lot of land. Just the point to collect the sun, I think it would be better putting it on a house or combining it with another power plant, like wind power or something like that, because--\n  And cost-wise it would be probably expensive, because it was 900 for just one of those panels. And Miss Shonda said it would take about 12 just for one house.\n That's basically about 10,800.\n For one house.\n But we also think that solar panels blend in more than winter lines. Just imagine random winter lines in your front yard.\n Yeah, but we saw pictures, or a video, of a solar-powered house, and most people don't like solar panels because it looks unattractive on the top of your house. Same with the wind power, wind turbines would look unattractive. But you can still decorate them if you want. You can't really do that with the wind power, I mean solar power thing, because it's mostly black.\n  That's a good thought. So, going forward, thinking of an energy solution, because as you guys get older, energy is going to be something you have to worry about. We've seen the gas prices. The gasoline prices for regular cars go up. You've seen the ethanol being developed. Is it good to keep developing new technologies? How many of you guys, once you start driving, think if you could do it or your parents could do it for you, would drive a hybrid car?\n I would.  Okay, would you drive a hybrid car?\n Yeah, I would drive one, because it's more in miles per gallon, and with rechargeable cars, you can charge your car instead of using gas and spending more money.\n  That's good. Also the emissions from your gas.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 1047 SCI AYA 1047edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.0352493], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Rakif"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Rakif"], ["Student"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher", "Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Student"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW04", "TW08", "TW18"]}, "1046": {"text": " Okay, so for our first trial, we just wanted to see how long it would take for 25 milliliters of magnesium hydroxide to turn into acid by adding HCL, and it took 73.5 milliliters.\n And for our second trial, we had the same amount of milk of magnesia, but this time, we diluted it with 100 milliliters of water. And it took less HCL, hydrochloric acid than in the first trial that we did.\n And, the first time, we only added five drops of phenylthalene, and the second time we added ten drops just to see if it would make it different, and the ten drops definitely made it pinker, but we don't think it affected the results because phenylthalene is just the indicator, and not part of the reaction.\n You guys actually brought up a good point. How many groups added phenylthalene in large quantities?  How many think that you didn't add enough? Let's just ask that.  Or, how would you know if you added too much or not enough? Alright, go ahead, Will.\n Well, as long as it turns pink, you know that the indicator's working.\n  What if it's pinker?\n It wouldn't matter because it turns clear towards the end.\n  What do other people think? Alright, Vivian?\n I feel like if there's not enough indicator that when you add more and more HCL to the solution, it becomes, the pink color becomes so diluted that you can hardly tell when it turns clear and when it turns back to very pale pink. So, I don't think there's such a thing as adding too much indicator. Our group added about five drops, and that was enough.\n  Okay, what, Tad?\n Actually, adding too much indicator is bad for the experiment because that would distort the actual concentration of reactants. So, in an extreme case, if we added like 100 milliliters of indicator, that would definitely distort the concentration.\n  True, what do people think about that? Alright, Jimmy?\n The indicator doesn't participate in the overall reaction so it doesn't really make a difference.\n  What do people have to say to that? Alright, why don't you take Discuss, would adding too much indicator, would that affect your concentration? Like, in terms of volume, maybe you're adding to more volume of your reaction, would that affect the concentrations of your reactants?  Okay, thoughts? Alright, Jerry.\n I feel like if you added the indicator, it would dilute the solution because it would be somewhat like water, if you added, let's say, would change the concentration.\n  Okay, alright, Stephanie?\n I think it would, like, because if you started out with 25 milliliters of milk of magnesia, even if you add a lot of phenylthalene, it would still be 25 milliliters of milk of magnesia and that's what's reacting. So, I don't think it affects it.\n Alright, Mackenzie?\n Isn't pH determined by the concentration of hydroxide or hydrogen ions? So, if it's, it would be moles over liters, so if there were more liters, it would be a smaller concentration, right?\n Alright, Corey?\n It's mostly about the moles because if the moles of each of the acid and the base combine, they will neutralize. It doesn't really matter, the over liters, as long as the moles are equal.\n  Okay, Rick?\n Well, since phenylthalene is an indicator, it doesn't actually participate in the reaction, just like water, so adding it would just increase the volume which, as he said, which would dilute the solution. Adding a lot would have a profound affect, but adding a little bit wouldn't actually make a difference.\n  Okay, Richard?\n It would, because there's a lower concentration, it would take a lot longer for it to react, meaning that it greatly increases the risk of error. Because, when you're using a burette, it's continuously dripping so then, if you're swirling and it doesn't react as fast, then you have more that goes in before you actually realize it.\n So, those are all good thoughts that you guys came up with, and all reasonable. It does affect the concentration, and when you add a few drops, just like Vivian said, if you don't add enough, then it's still indicating, but in terms of the overall concentration, the concentration of the phenylthalene would be relatively small, and so that's why you see, like a very faint pink, but it's still indicating. Now, if you add more drops, of course you're going to have a darker pink, but the overall reaction volume would increase and so, if you add drops of phenylthalene, if you're adding like, five drops, compared to your overall reaction volume, it wouldn't be that big of a difference. So you would still have some source of error, but since you're only adding five drops as opposed to five million drops, five million drops could conceivably double your reaction volume and then your concentration on a greater scale would be affected. You know, it would make it so it's more diluted. Okay, does that make sense to everyone? Alright, those were all good comments. Anyone else have a comment? Alright, so let's go to table two.\n In last week's experiment, we were testing how much HCL it would take to neutralize 25 mL of milk of magnesia. First, we measured 25 mL of milk of magnesia using a graduated cylinder and add the milk of magnesia into the flask, and then we add three drop of phenylthalene as indicator to the flask. Then, we slowly used the burette to drop the HCL into the flask and it took us 55.5 mL of HCL to clear the solution.\n Every time we'd see that it's clear, it took the solution longer time. So, the first time, we stopped putting, we stopped adding HCL, but then it only took about one second to turn back to pink. But then, after the third or fourth stop that we made, it took longer than one second, so by the time it took, so like, towards the end, it didn't turn pink anymore.\n So, for the second trial, what we did, instead of using just 25 milliliters of milk of magnesia, we just used 15 milliliters, and diluted it with ten milliliters of water to see if there's a change in the amount of HCL we used, and it did, because it took a lot less, which was 35.5 milliliters of HCL as compared to the first trial where we used 55.5.\n So, we thought there might be a relation between the concentration of trial two versus trial one. It was roughly, 35.5 is roughly two thirds the amount it took for the m.o.m to come clear as over HCL, and we were kind of surprised by the results because we didn't expect it to keep going back to pink after it turned clear once.\n Do you think you did something wrong?\n Well, we kind of did, but then we remembered that this reaction was actually reversible, so then we tried it again and then we eventually made it all clear. \n Did anyone else, did any other groups think that, when the reaction was happening, that you had done something wrong? Or were surprised by the results? Alright, Ian?\n Oh, no, just saying yes.\n  Okay, anyone have a comment?\n We thought something was going wrong because it took a lot of HCL for the indicator to start working.\n  What do you mean start working?\n To start turning opaque, because it was pink for a long time. We had to add extra HCL to the burette.\n We actually thought that it wouldn't stop turning pink because we stopped it for about three times, stopped the burette from running, and every time it kept changing color. So, we thought that happened throughout the experiment.\n Did you think it was going to go on forever?\n Yep.\n Okay, any other groups? Alright, Andrew?\n We noticed that, yeah, what they said. It changed to clear, and then after we stopped stirring it it would go back to pink. We thought it was the reversible reaction rates, but then, like we were surprised at how big a difference it was, because it was really clear when we were stirring it, but once we stopped, became really pink.\n  Okay, alright, Will?\n There was also a transitional phase where it turned light, and we thought that was the phase it would turn into, rather than clear, so we actually stopped it there, but then we looked around and realized that people with a less concentration turned clear, so we started adding more.\n  Okay, alright, group three?\n First, we used 25 milliliters of milk of magnesia, and then we took 200 milliliters of water to dilute it and then we added five drops of phenylthalene. It took about 7 milliliters of one molar HCL to actually fully, huh? Yeah, it took 70 milliliters, and then it stayed clear from there.\n For the second trial, we want to see if we added less milk of magnesia, would it, would the time decrease? I mean the time to neutralize decrease. And so, we add 15 mL of magnesia and the same amount of H2O, and so we used up about\n So, I heard something about timing, because I heard the first couple groups timed some of the things. What did you guys time, and why did you choose to time that? Here, let's start here because you guys timed something. What did you time, and why did you choose to time that?\n Well, basically, I think we're just measuring the amount of HCL we used up, and see how many times we need to stop the burette for.\n Well, we observed that it kept changing from pink to clear but the more HCL we put, the faster it was, from the switch, so we kept adding HCL, and it turned all clear.\n It turned all clear, the faster--\n The previous times were milky white, and then towards the end, it becomes clear. Like, totally clear.\n Okay, did anyone observe something different, in terms of the amount of time that it took for it to turn back to pink? Okay, table six?\n As we added more HCL, the white color persisted longer and it took longer for it to turn back to pink.\n  Okay, so, yeah, Rick?\n I don't think time really matters in this experiment because the changing of the colors in the reaction depended more on the amount that was added, rather than the time you left it in there. So, if you add more, of course it's going to change quicker but it doesn't matter, like how long you have to wait for.\n So, you guys were saying that when you added the HCL, that it changed quicker to white, and then it took longer for it to turn back to pink. Okay, Gabriel?\n We timed it because we think that there might be a connection between the time it takes each time to turn back to pink and the concentration of the reactants because the longer it takes to turn back to pink might mean that there are less reactants and therefore, it will take a long time to get back to the reactions, right back to the products which turns it to pink.\n  Okay, alright, Corey?\n I was saying that it was faster turning back to pink.\n The reaction was actually, it was slower going back to pink. That's okay. Okay, let's go to table four.\n In our experiment, in our procedure, actually, we had two beakers of the magnesium hydroxide, and one beaker, we would heat, instead of diluting it, we would heat up one beaker to around 50 degrees Celsius, and we would perform the experiment with adding HCL using the burette, and in the other beaker, we would leave it in room temperature, which is around 25 degrees Celsius, and we would do the same procedure, adding the HCL with the burette.\n Our purpose for heating it was to see whether the reaction was an endothermic reaction or an exothermic reaction.\n What we found was that when we heated it, it actually, changing from pink to clear, it actually took less time than when we did it at room temperature, so we don't know if it accounts for the exothermic or endothermic, or maybe the molecules are just moving faster so it'll react faster.\n We also did not dilute the milk of magnesia like most of the groups did, so that may have skewed our answers a little as well. It took us a lot longer, and more HCL, to turn the solution clear again.\n  Comments? Does anyone think that, so this group didn't dilute. How many groups diluted and added distilled water? Okay, so all the other groups did.  Do you think that their data would be affected because they didn't dilute, and because you did? What are your thoughts? Alright, Nina?\n We diluted our second trial, and it didn't affect the amount of HCL needed.\n  Why do you think, well, from your observations, that's obvious, but does anyone know why? Or think why that might happen? Why would your data not be affected? Or think that maybe theirs was a fluke? And, your data should have been affected by diluting it with water? Alright, Joey?\n Is it because the HCL only reacts with the milk of magnesia? So, it doesn't affect how much water because it doesn't react with water?\n  Okay, what do you guys think? Alright, Katie?\n I think it will affect it because the concentration's higher and the milk of magnesia by itself is more dense so there's less surface area, I would say.\n  Okay, less surface area. Okay, that's a possibility. Alright, Gabriel?\n I think it wouldn't affect the amount of HCL that would be added, but it will just affect the time because with water, it will take longer for the reaction to take place because there's more volume, and without diluting it, their group just made it straight up so it would be faster for the reactants to go back to pink, and then at the end, it will just turn clear, either way.\n  Why do you think it would be faster if they didn't dilute it?\n Because there would be less volume, and the smaller the spaces, the molecules will react faster and have less room to move around.\n  Okay, reasonable, yep.\n So, our group kind of did both. We had a control, we redid the same experiment for number one, and then we measured how many milliliters of HCL it took, so if you change the concentration, it does affect the amount of HCL it takes to neutralize it.\n  Alright, Michael?\n We diluted it, and it took longer for us to, we added more HCL for it to neutralize, and I feel like if you dilute the milk of magnesia, there would be less molarity, and if it's not diluted, it would be a stronger weak base than if it was diluted. It would become weaker.\n You can't change the strength of an acid or a base because it's based on what, it's by definition. You can't make a strong base weak, but that's okay, Wintel? \n In our case we did two solutions, different concentration. The amount of HCL that's needed to neutralize the solution shouldn't be, should be the same, but in this case, the time delay causes the solution with low concentration to take more HCL because during the delay, the reaction, the HCL hasn't still reacted with milk of magnesia yet, and because of that delay, there's more HCL that's needed to compensate for that.\n Okay, so there's a little bit of stoichiometry going on, where the number of moles or the amount, the amount's still the same, regardless of whether, of milk of magnesia, regardless of whether or not you added distilled water or you didn't. So the amount's still the same.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 1046 SCI AYA 1046edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.110317], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["Instructor"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW08"]}, "590": {"text": "  Well frogs do sink, they do.

So, what do you think is different?\n It's like stuck to the ground and...\n The lily pad is stuck to the ground?\n Yeah, I think there's something inside. I think there's something in like dirt, you know, like that causes the lily pad to grow. But with something in the lily pad seed.\n  We were looking at this the other day.

But frogs jump really high. If they don't jump really the same, they probably just almost jump if the momma and daddy frogs turn into, get some eggs and the tadpole comes out.\n That tadpole right there, he was following it and then he stopped. What if they took the flashlight, they might move.\n  Yeah.\n Like this, watch. When you take it off... I did this in my momma's. When you take it off and you turn it this way he looks back at it, like this. That's what he does.\n  How come?\n Because when tadpoles like eat things that glow, then when you take it off, you put it back on.\n  How come, why?\n I know, they just don't.\n  But that's not fair.\n  What else did you notice ? We did the spots. What else did you notice? Jamal, look at it again.\n Frog.\n  What body parts do you see?\n  Gray, polka dots.\n You said the spots.\n  The feet.\n  The feet, what about it ?\n  Lines on it.\n  Some lines on it.

That's the lake and that's the pond and there I am  frogs.\n They need grass, they need flowers, they need little trees, they need...\n I was thinking Aleha, thinking about us living in houses. We live in houses because can't breathe water. This is my house  and like there's dirt under there. And there's dirt under there. Then under that runs the water, the blue water.\n Let's add something to it.\n So what made it work this time?\n  It stands upside down. The frog floats. It doesn't jump on any kind of one, it only jumps on the ones that are round. Because it needs something facing up to make the walls.\n  Because this is facing up, so you think maybe the lily pad faces up.\n Right, if it does this it needs like a shield so the water won't get in because if the water touches it, it will tear and it will sink.\n  Did you listen?\n Because they need something on it like rain.\n  So you're saying if water touches it, what happens if water gets on top of it?\n It'll sink because it'll tear the lily pad up and it'll sink, but with the flower on it, it does not sink.\n  So if it has the flower, you think the flower keeps it from sinking.\n Because it's stuck. It's stuck and it's so hard, it makes it so hard and rainy and it dries up.\n  So, when you dried the frog off did that make a difference?\n  Well, it doesn't make a difference. Frogs like to be wet.\n  Frogs are usually wet.\n  That frog is an African swimming frog because look at it's feet.\n  It does look like an African dwarf frog.\n It jumps on the water. It can run and hop on water.\n  Andrea, what did you notice about this?

It says the frog is pulling off its skin. I wonder why it's doing that.\n Because, so it can have different skin.\n Why would it make different skin?\n It might need different skin because of the way it lives. The way it lives, it has to take off its own skin, just like a snake takes off its whole skin. Snakes take off their skin.\n Be a new frog.\n The way they take off their skin is they shred it off. They don't have any arms. Snakes shed their skin off and they don't have no arms.\n Snakes shed their skin?\n  Yeah.\n Do you think frogs shed their skin too? What do you think Aleha? You found the picture, tell me what you're thinking. Let me hear Aleha.\n When it gets old they have to take it off.\n He has to take it off. Why do you think he needs to take his skin off?\n I was thinking...\n Just a moment, Daniel, let me hear Aleha, I can't hear.\n When it gets too rough on him, he can take if off.\n  Maybe if his skin feels rough. Hmm, I'm wondering about that. That's giving me something to wonder about.\n Ms. Robbie, there's a water beetle.\n Yes, but we're still looking at this about this frog coming off. She feels like maybe when his skin is rough he takes it off. What did the page say? It uses a word I'm not sure about, molt. It said frogs molt a few times every year.\n Because it's the way they live.\n  It's the way they live.\n But we don't live that way, the same way we do. We get bigger instead of shredding skin.\n You're right. We get-- What, what'd you say? Say that again.\n We get bigger.\n  We get bigger.\n And they shred.\n  And they shed their skin.\n That's opposite.\n Hmm, I'm going to write down that word molt. We're going to talk about that a little bit. We're going to try to explore that a little bit more. \n The frogs are underground and they hatch out of the eggs and turn into the tadpoles and they're going to grow up a little and they're going to lost their tail and they're going to turn into an adult frog and then they are underground when it's winter.\n  When it's winter they're undergound. Okay, what have you all found out about comparing?\n  The frogs protect their babies.\n Do the frogs protect their babies?\n No, they don't. What about your ?\n They wait until they hatch.\n  They wait till they hatch.\n Frogs have bigger eyes than us because they have those eyes like that on their heads and we don't.\n And we have eyes that are small.

Yes?\n So, for some organics I believe it is worth it and others I don't. Industrial organic I don't believe it's worth it, because for the lettuce in the book Omnivore's Dilemma, they said it takes about ten fossil fuel calories to make one calorie from lettuce, and I don't believe that's energy efficient at all. But other farms, other industries, or other organic farms like Polyface Farms, they use all natural energy, not a lot of fossil fuels go into it, and I think it's more efficient. So, organic like that I believe is better, but industrial organic I don't believe is better.\n That's a good point. I was wondering is somebody could expand on the difference between industrial organic and organic. Phil, if you want to pick someone.\n Eli.\n So, normal organic food, like what started the idea of organic food, was completely different from organic food that you buy at Whole Foods nowadays. Like, what the people originally thought the concept of organic food thought of was like the local, sustainable farm like Polyface Farms, where it's completely energy efficient and they use all natural resources like grass and just stuff like that to feed their cows and other animals. But industrial organic systems, it's pretty much the same as normal industrial food system, except they don't use antibiotics or pesticides to make their food. They still have animal rights... There's still animal cruelty and stuff inside the the factories, and stuff like that. Araceli.\n I agree with Eli, because when I read organic, I thought organic was good. But then basically it was the same thing. Like the chickens, they still got fed corn, but they had an open door, but they were so fat they couldn't go through. Like, why pay the extra money for something that's going to be exactly the same as the other thing?\n I think it is worth buying organic food. Because even though the animals are treated the same, and even though it still wastes a lot of fossil fuel, we save a lot of farmland from being put, like, pesticide and everything on it, so we could have chemical free land. And also we save our water system from being poisoned by the chemicals we use. So, it might cost a little bit more, but it's worth it. Matt.\n In response to, I guess, Eli, it's not exactly the same, there are definitely the perks to the industrial organic system with the lack of chemicals and hormones. But yes, I can definitely agree that it's a very similar thing, it doesn't solve all the problems with the industrial system.\n I don't agree with what was just said, that when you farm without pesticides it's better, because in Omnivore's Dilemma, even though they farm without pesticides, they crowd the ground so much that it destroys the land. So, it's not necessarily better, it just sounds better.\n I just like Simone's point, because I think that a lot of the problems are still there, and even though it might be a little bit better without the pesticides, I think it's still important to eat real organic food. I think that would be the best. Industrial organic is a step in the right direction, but I don't think it's close enough to where we should be with our food system.\n I agree with Molly that industrial organic foods, on the face, are both... They're worth paying for because they're the food that we should be eating, but in other ways they feed into other problems with pollution. If you want the right type of food, you have to create a food system that can sustain a country as large as the United States, but still has healthy animals. And animals that have evolved to eat, only being fed, that is at a cost low enough to feed everyone in the United States like we are fed now.\n I was going to also ask a couple personal questions, since I was talking to your mom about how does your eating habits change, do you think, now that you feel like you're more aware, or...?\n She says that she always bought grass fed beef, and I try to eat healthy, but in the case of fast food, of course, I go and eat fast food. But lately I've been badgering her, and asking her if she could get a grass fed steak. I've been waiting for that for a long time. The corn fed steak that my dad gives me smells bad and it looks bad, so...  Anyway. There's nobody asking.\n I don't think organic's really necessarily healthy for us, because humans are still trying to figure out what vitamins we still need, what essentials we still need. Like people are still discovering that plants have certain essentials that we never knew we needed. So, how can we tell organic's good for us if we don't know what organic is different from what we get from normal food?\n I thought Curt brought a good point up too, which is the best organic is just straight from the farm to the buyers, but it is a great point that Curt and Greg brings up which is that that way can't feed as much people as the industrial organic or just industrial food.\n I completely agree with that. It's implausible to try to make what they call beyond organic food at such a high amount, because it really consumes a lot of land and a lot of energy. We read in the Omnivore's Dilemma with the moving the chicken coops so much every day, that's a lot of land for very little meat, and honestly that would not be able to sustain the whole country. Lisa?\n So, I kind of agree with what you're saying, but it doesn't have to necessarily be a few big farms that are completely going organic. If there's little farms all over the United States, then meat can go to those people  around there. It might not happen all of a sudden, but little by little people are going to learn that organic is better. Whether it's more expensive or not, it's healthier for us knowing that the animals... When the animals are not fed on natural stuff, that in turn is bad for us. Ashley?\n I agree with what everyone said, and that the point that Paulina brought up about we're still trying to figure out what vitamins are what and what's good for us. Because I feel like it's more better to spend even just a few more cents, if organic food isn't that expensive, and go to certain places. A few more cents on the local, home grown organic food, because I used to buy meat from the... What's it called? The meat section.\n  The deli?\n Deli, yeah, there you go. And I used to buy meat there, and I thought it was all fine, you know, whatever, until I went to the doctor one day because I was getting really injured, and she was like, \"You're missing all these vitamins,\" and she gave me all these vitamins to take. And I didn't know that that was missing inside my food, and then I go to the organic section of the supermarket and it's not even, like, vitamins that were missing in the meat, it's vitamins that were missing in the drinks that can be found in organic food. For example, like the naked juice has these vitamins already included in there, just because it's, like, naturally grown and organic. So, I was willing to spend the extra dollar for my health. So, I feel like if people realize how important it is for your health, that scare will wake them up and they'll be able to spend the dollar.\n Okay, well, I agree. I think that it's worth the extra cost for organic, because, like, in the book it said when we buy organic food, we're voting with our forks, and we're voting for the type of food we want. And if we go organic, then the producers will think that most of us want organic, so they'll start growing more and selling more organic food, so that it might become cheaper in the long run.\n I personally don't really care.  Like, if it's cheaper, that's cool, because if it has pesticides on it you can just wash it off. And animal's rights are nice, but they're going to be killed anyway. It's like, they're all going to die anyway. They're going to die, so... Michael.\n I like it.  And yeah, I mean, even though organic's good, we still have a lot of cheap food that feeds a lot more people that have lower income. So, we might not be, like, the healthiest nation, but at least we give an opportunity to feed every single person in the United States. So, I kind of like that. They don't have to worry about paying high prices for food, even though it's bad for my health. And even if it is bad, I could just exercise.  So, I think it's a personal responsibility to watch what you eat. So, we should be open to that.\n Even with the industrialized food system, we're still not feeding everyone. If you go to like, the Appalachians and stuff like that, you still have kids that are starving every day because their parents don't make enough money to buy even the cheap food. So, I think that it's not that we need to focus less on the cost of everything, and just figure out a better way to produce food and grow it, and to make sure that it gets where it needs to go. I think we need to worry about cost later on, and try and focus on a way to do that in the short term, so that in the long term we can feed as many people as we need to. Lisa.\n I see how you brought up the Appalchians, but my question to you is is it more important to worry about issues here, where it effects us, or would you find it more important to focus, like, worldwide? Like, you could focus on problems that people have outside, but, like, wouldn't you  focus on start here, make sure that we have what we need first, and then branch out?\n I think that with that, like, with a lot of people who get stuff locally... So, if you're saying locally like, are you talking, like, Chicago?\n Don't you think it's better to start locally and then... Like we get better locally, and then we get better statewide, and then we'll go on until everybody has enough money to do this, or their food, everyone can buy their food.\n I think so, but you also have to take into consideration that even if we do something in Illinois, that doesn't guarantee that other states are going to adopt the same policies. And I think if we focus on doing something for United States, and worry less about the other countries, even though, politically, it might not be the right thing to do, worry less about the other countries at this time. But I think we need to take a step back and focus on just fixing as much as we can on a whole, and then going down into the smaller levels and seeing, okay, how can we make this better on a local level? Chris?\n I think that we can't really make it perfect, like the way Polyface Farms is, because of how the cities are laid out. Because the cities are too big to have farms in reasonable reach of the people there. So, I think what we have to do is have this industrial organic, which still is, I mean, a lot more worth it, because it keeps the biodiversity in the soil, and I read in the book they said something like that the size of the state of New Jersey was, like, a dead zone at the end of the Mississippi River and the Gulf from all the pesticides and fertilizers that flow down. And that's  problem that we should focus on.\n Well, I agree with Teresa that we should start only in the US, because we can't just make a generalization that other countries are using corn and are eating unhealthy just as we are. We only know that the US is eating unhealthy because, according to Omnivore's Dilemma, King Corn, and Food Incorporated, the problems are only occurring in the United States. So, if we want to solve this problem, we should start from the origins, because we started using corn massively, creating problems, and stuff, not because of other countries. Well, maybe because we imported corn from Mexico and they dominated out other corn types, so we started using corn. But we should start focusing on more of what's the problem over here, instead of other countries, because we have to solve our own problems first before we become worried about other problems, maybe. Yeah.\n I was going to say that it is worth it to spend the money in organic, because even if it's just a little bit of farms here and there, people seem to be willing to travel the extra mile just to get that healthy piece of food. Like in Polyface Farms, people came from hundreds of miles, I think, or 100 miles, just to get their healthy chickens or the healthy food. And with Jerry, I wanted to say that... Well, nevermind. \n Okay then. So, I remember Gabby said how we should be focusing on making as much food as possible for everyone in America, and that's the issue we should be working on. But that's really what the food industry does, like making the most food possible. They pretty much put everything else aside, besides mass production. They don't really care about animal rights, or worker safety, or anything like that. They just put as much work as they can into making more food, and like Gabby said, people in America still can't afford this food that's cheaper than it's ever been in the past. So, it just shows that, really, we can not go back to just normal farms, because there's no way just natural farms like Polyface could ever sustain a population as big as America. Like, we kind of dug ourselves into a hole. Yeah.\n Okay, so what do you think we should do then? If we've dug ourselves--  If we've dug ourselves into this hole, even though if we're going to be producing less food that's better quality, I agree that is better, because then you're taking the animal rights into consideration, the workers' rights and everything. But then either we have to figure out a way to change how people eat, and so people are eating a bigger variety of food, or somehow figure out a different way to be able to feed everyone. Because, at the end of the day, either we're going to have a lot of people who die because we change this, and we change it too fast, and we're not ready to adapt to it, or we can do it slowly and try and figure out ways so that everyone somehow survives. Eli.\n Okay, well, I think that we should really just follow the model of, like, France, or some other country in Europe or something. Because they have a way better... People in France are so much healthier than people in America, and they don't eat nearly as much food. They still aren't starving, most people in France aren't starving or anything. So, there are countries, it's just not left them.\n Okay, I don't know if this makes sense, but if they have, like 20,000 chickens in one pen, do they have to feed them corn? Like, what's wrong with mass production, but making it a little healthier? Why can't they just give them something else that's maybe not all corn, maybe half corn, or half corn to little corn? And then, metaphorically speaking, this totally reminds me of Hitler, and, like, how he took over all the people and made them work to death and everything, and that's like what they're doing with the animals. They're just working them to death, and they have no rights or happiness whatsoever. Deja?\n I think the answer to your question is that most people just want money, so they'll buy whatever's cheapest and pay low wages to people just so they can make a lot of money. I think that's the answer to your question about why don't they just choose another food instead of corn. I think it's because of money.\n But also consider, what about... What about the industrial organic? Doesn't that address this whole problem of how the chickens are fed? Even though they're raised in coops?\n  They're still fed corn. \n Molly.\n Okay, so I think that it's a really good idea that Matthew brought up a while ago, that the industrial issue, it can't really be solved by using beyond organic. I think we've moved on from that. We can't really go back to beyond organic, because we wouldn't be able to feed enough people. And then just to Adam's point, I don't think that we're not producing enough food. I think the problem is that the people don't have enough money for the food. So, I think that producing more food wouldn't really help.\n  I was going to say, everyone keeps talking about mass production and that view would feed everybody. But if you think, we actually waste a lot of food too. That's actually important. I think we saw a picture or something, all of it gets thrown out every day, or they have ads on it on TV. If we're so worried about feeding everyone, why don't we eat better ourselves, and stop buying so much food we don't actually eat?\n Well, either, whether you guys want to change it locally to outside or outside to inside, I like the idea that you guys think about spreading the idea. Whether it's taking France's ideas and taking it onto ourselves, or just ourselves spreading it out. Because  so obnoxious, they would go out to McDonald's, my family, and be like, \"Do you know what that eats?\" And then just start talking. We're like, \"Shut up, don't tell me what it eats. \"I'm going to eat it.\" And now my mom asks me, she's like, \"Is this good?\" And then I read it, I'm like, \"Yeah, \"it has this and this and this.\" And now she turns to me and, like, asks me should we buy this, should we not? So, I think I have changed a little bit at least, having been\n", "filename": ["Copy of 1049 SCI AYA 1049edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "positive", 0.0641387], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW08"]}, "070 ": {"text": " Okay Dylan what song will you be playing?\n Playing B A and G.

Maybe talk through what is the given, what's the constant rate of change, where you're looking for it, and how would that be seen, visually?\n So, the rate is increasing constantly at one foot per second.\n Per second. The ADT is two pi R, BR, the first.\n  Which one are you guys on? Number one, okay, good.\n In order for you to find for QR, may define the ADT. We need to find the ADT of different orbs.\n  What?\n  The ADT concentrating with them.\n  So, it's like, four for DR.\n Okay, so.\n What did you do with your sand? Show me what happened here.\n  Okay, air is gonna come into the clear hole, and then right into...\n You picked the sand problem, tell me about your sand problem.\n It's talking about sand quality to a, how to apply it at a rate to be permanent.\n Okay.\n And out of the following, the diameter of the base in it. Is...\n  It's going to make the shape of a cone when you pour it in one spot, that's the idea.\n  And the shape of the cone will be approximately three times however high the sand is being poured from.\n Okay, so, our cone has been smooshed, but you see how it's still kinda narrow, a little mountain in sort of the shape of a cone?\n Right.\n And what's the unknown, what are we looking for here?\n We're trying to find the rate of the height of the pile.\n  Oh, you can do it.\n We said that's possible.\n Okay, so, Kathy, you're able, would that be DVDT, DHDT, DRDT, all these DTs, we can kinda run together?\n  Just blow it up?\n Can we do AHDT?\n Sure, AHDT because you're looking for a rate of change for the height. Now, you're actually on the hardest problem. This is the trickiest problem, and you have correctly chosen the cards for these. But, here's what makes it tricky. I want you to read through this slowly, and let's figure out the unknown, and if they give us, what other rates they give us. Now, you actually just told me what the unknown is, right?\n DHDT?\n DHDT. Okay, what other variables do we have on this card besides DHDT and the rate of change?\n AR, ARDT.\n ARDT, and DVDT. Okay, now, you read it again while y'all are listening and see if you can pick out, maybe do DVDT or DRDT.\n What was that?\n For both.\n At a sand and gravel plant, sand is falling off the conveyor and onto a conical pile at a rate of\n Plus? What information did you just get? You can say it again if you need to.\n Sand is falling off a conveyor and onto the conical pile at a rate of 10 cubic feet per minute.\n Okay. Good, that's DVDT 'cause it's the amount the volume changes, and the label kinda gets screwy, too, right? Okay, so now, we're listening for DRDT. We hope we hear DRDT because we need that also, right?\n The diameter of the base of the cone is approximately three times the altitude. So... \n Okay, so it's giving us information about radius compared to altitude, but it doesn't seem to be giving us DRDT, right? Which means we don't have DRDT.\n  And the radius is two feet.\n And the radius is two feet.\n  So, what's the height again?\n It's the height of DT. So, we need to find how fast the radius is changing...\n So, this right here is the decision.\n Nice. The DVDT equals four pi R squared to the DRDT.\n  So, this is the hardest when you get to the math.\n  What we need to find is DRDT when the radius equals two feet.\n  Okay.\n  All right.\n  Okay. I guess the next one we can figure out right now...\n How many cubes we got?\n Three.\n Three, okay. All the edges of the cube are expanding at a rate of three centimeters per second. How fast is the volume changing if each edge is one centimeter?\n  We have you doing the edges of a cube, the radius of an aired balloon. \n So, the radius, one...\n 370\n 370?\n 370.\n So, D, DS over DT is three?\n Right.\n Plug that, we can just plug that in 'cause it's not a constant.\n Tell me a little bit about the problem you're on. Does it have three cubes in your problem? Like, why does it have three cubes in the box?\n We started with that, this other one.\n  Okay.\n And it shows after a second, it would be that big. And then after another second, it would be that big.\n Oh, good, okay, so, it's showing that it's the same cube, and it's getting bigger. It's like three stages in an environment. Very good, very good. Correct interpretation. Yes.\n And... It also shows the volume of the... \n Now, what does this question ask you for at the very end? What are you gonna be trying to find?\n How fast the volume changes when it enters from...\n Yes. I have a question for you, here's a think about it question. Cause you're finding DVDT when it is exactly one centimeter, right, that's what the question's asking? Do you think DVDT would be greater or smaller when it's past one centimeter? Do you think the rate of change of volume will be getting bigger faster, or will it slow down?\n Slow down.\n Slow down.\n Slow down.\n My challenge to you is after you do the math problem and you have your equation to work with, try two centimeters and see if you were right. Yeah, so, go above and beyond the question. Was your conjecture right, or were you like, oh, no, we were backwards? Kay?\n Okay.\n  The base is gonna be point oh eight with the ball, at a descending rate. And it is asking how fast the pouch is moving to the wall in the last part.\n  Oh, you look great.\n  D two? So, okay, let's pour the sand again. So, what, five? So, it's pouring at 10 cubic feet per minute.\n  Talking about the change in output. \n So, what's constant?\n Its cubic feet per minute.\n So, that's the...\n The sand being poured in it.\n So, that's the volume? I don't know. Okay. We have choices as to who can't...\n I have four. And zero to bring it down. Yeah, I'm just gonna bring it down.\n  Problem number what? Problem one?\n  Okay, next problem. Are we agreed?\n A ladder 25 feet long is leaning against the wall of a house. The base of the ladder is pulled away from the wall at a rate of two feet per second. How fast is the top moving down the wall when the base of the ladder is 24 feet from the wall?\n So, then...\n  You definitely got the demonstration item perfect, that's right, that's exactly what's happening.\n All right. Okay. You guys are gonna get this one. It's what's supposed to be a... Length.\n  And what made you pick that one?\n  It's the Pythagorean theorem.\n  And then why would you wanna use the Pythagorean theorem?\n  Because it's a three sided, it's equal to the right triangle.\n  Yeah, exactly, uh huh.\n  All right. \n Okay, now I've got a question for ya. Is there any part of that equation that will always give confirmation we want to, that you would actually be able to substitute a number in at the very beginning? Okay, good, good.\n All right.\n What would that mean about your derivative card? What would you know for sure? If you put 25 right there.\n  Get a constant rate of one foot per second.\n Anything special for this derivative card?\n DZ over DT equals...\n  Well, if the original, if your ladder is 25 right here, where would the 25 originally be put?\n  In the Z.\n  In the Z, okay. I that would say that X squared plus Y squared equals 25. Now, take the derivative of this with respect to time. Would it look exactly like this or a little bit different?\n  One, we're at a constant rate.\n Right. And so, when you do your math, you can go ahead and put that as zero, and then just work with those. Good. That's good.\n  So...\n  What's the...\n The balloon's increasing.\n Yeah.\n  Following the radius.\n It's the, what's the radius, it's four feet. The radius, yeah, you have to find what the radius is at four feet, and...\n  Find the radius when it's at four feet.\n  Which one are you on? P two?\n When the radius is four feet, at what rate is the total area of the disturbed water treatment area? So, you would define the area.\n  Wait, which, are you on... Okay, so you have three balloons.\n  Right.\n  And you could use those three balloons if they are different sizes to show what?\n  Okay.\n  Okay.\n  The rate of change. So, if you have one balloon and put one back into it, and then that's when you have...\n Okay, let's see what they look like. So, let's see if we can have different stages of our balloon here. You look like you must be at the last stage 'cause that looks pretty big. Okay, that must be the beginning. That looks like the beginning, too.  Can one of 'em get middle stage? I think you've got the baby balloon, though, I think that's the biggest that guy's getting.\n I didn't know they were different sizes.\n Yeah, they are actually different sizes. One more. Do it! And you let some out, maybe you got it. Oh, perfect, okay. Tell me about what's going on with this balloon. What's goin' on?\n Oh, increase...\n Four cubic feet, and they...\n  Oh, what are they?\n I think I'm thinking of the wrong one. Like, it's not...  Like, it's not measuring each breath, it's something...\n No, you are thinking right. This is, is this like what we had?\n Two days ago?\n Yeah, a couple days ago. Like, is, what was constant a couple days ago in our activity?\n Air is being continuous air pulled away by the rate of...\n Yes. So, like, the volume, the rate of change of volume is constant. Is that true on this or is that a different problem? Okay, and so, what is the unknown that you are trying to figure out?\n The change of the radius. How the radius is...\n And what do you predict will happen with the rate of change of radius with the larger the radius gets?\n It'll stretch out.\n That, I'm sorry?\n It'll slow down.\n Yeah, I think that's a good conjecture. That would be like what happened the other day when we looked at it, slowed down quite a bit the bigger the radius got. Sounds good. And it is because it was what?\n  The volume...\n  'Cause the volume...\n  Yeah. \n F four for that, that'll go on the left. F four and D six.\n  Have you gotten to the balloon part yet? Let's talk about the other one, okay? One. Okay, the other balloon problem was about surface area? Is that right? Have you done this one yet?\n Yes.\n Okay, how many, blow up the balloon and let's see what's happening in that balloon. Kevin, what was happening on this balloon?\n  It's the rate of the...\n  The puddle?\n B, a formula problem.\n Okay, so, how is Jesse gonna show us the surface area of DVDT? Okay, so let's demo that. Causing ripples. Thank you, nice demonstration.  What is constant on this problem?\n  The area and then... Yeah, the radius?\n", "filename": ["Copy of 261 MATH AYA 261edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.136982], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW09m", "TW13", "TW15", "TW24TW02"]}, "1366": {"text": " Our goal is to find the answers to your questions so we can fill this column, what I learned, in the KWL chart.

Thank you.\n Thank you very much young scientist. Great job! And let's look at the next experiment. Did seeds grow without soil? Here's day one. Again, scientists look at the smart board. Day 11, day 18, and day 32. Now, who did this experiment? We would like you, come on up Rachel. Bring up your experiment and tell us all about it.\n I did an experiment if seeds will grow without soil. And I put seeds, water in it, and I put it by the window. And I gave it sun. And they didn't grow.\n What did you not use?\n Soil.\n You did not use soil. And where are your seeds?\n By the window.\n They're in your cup right now.\n In my cup.\n Uh huh.\n Would you mind showing the class what you have there? Tilt it down. Boys and girls take a peek. This is what Rachel's seeds...\n I can't see.\n Okay. So now, what is your conclusion, Rachel?\n Seeds won't grow without soil.\n Very good. Thank you scientist. We have nothing to measure in Rachel's cup. And the last one. Oh, boys and girls this is a very interesting one. I really would like you to look up here. Look at the data first. Did seeds or plants grow without sunlight? A lot of your cups were by the window so that they received sunlight. But look at this one. Day one. Do you have anything?\n  No.\n No. Day 11.\n  No.\n Day 18, look at the number. Look at the numbers on the ruler. Day 24, I want you to look at your data. And day 32. Well, that's some interesting experiment. I know some of you did this one. Quite a number of children. If you did that experiment and you would like to come up and talk nicely and loudly. Juliana would you please come up with your plant and your ruler if you would like? Come on up. Okay, John you're going to show Juliana what a good listener you are, okay? Go ahead buddy.\n I planted seeds without sun. And I put them in the closet.\n Did you cover your seeds with soil?\n Yes.\n So your seeds have soil.\n Soil.\n You watered them?\n Watered them.\n Every week you watered them? And?\n And no sun.\n And you did not give them any sunlight because you put them in--\n The closet.\n In the closet and the closet has no?\n Sun.\n Has no sunlight. It has no windows. Right, John? Now Juliana, tell the class if you ever had any sprouts.\n I did have sprouts.\n And what do you think happened?\n They died.\n How tall were your sprouts at one point.\n One inch.\n One inch and why do you think they died?\n Because they had no sun.\n And do you think the sun is important for plants to grow? So what is your conclusion?\n No, seeds won't grow without sun.\n Very good. Good job scientist. You may go back. Now boys and girls, I'm going to ask you to think about your experiment. Think about what your question was. What you wanted to find out. And the steps you took to do your experiment. And you are going to turn to your partner and ask your partner what they wanted to find out. You may say, \"What was your question?\" Or, \"What do you want to find out?\" And here's a big question mark. And after your partner answers then you may ask, \"What did you do?\" \"What steps did you take?\" And at the end we will like you to ask your partner, \"What is your answer?\" How did you know that's the answer? They have to tell you their evidence, what they used to tell you the answer. Okay, now turn to your partner and talk to each other. Remember how we work as partners.  What did you find out?  What was your question?\n My question was... \n  Take turns.  Gabby, take turns  Boys and girls, let's take 30 more seconds. If you need to use your plants as your evidence feel free.  Okay, boys and girls turn around. Please put your hands on your lap so I can see your empty hands. Alright. Let's look at the answers again. Our whole experiment, and let's look at the questions. Will seeds grow without water? What do you think?\n  No.\n If you don't think seeds will grow without water shake your head. Great. Cameron will seeds grow without water?\n No.\n No, good. Okay, next question. Will seeds grow without sunlight?\n  No.\n Let me see you touch your ears if you don't think seeds will grow without sunlight. Okay, let's see. Will they Cameron?\n No.\n Touch your ears so I know you understand. Next one, will seeds grow without soil? Yes or no?  Yes. No.\n Will seeds grow without soil?\n  NO!\n No. Touch the ground, touch the rug. Okay, great. The last question, Katie, is will seeds grow with water, sun and soil?\n  Yes.\n Good. Then make some rain drops. Make the sun and form a cup to hold your soil.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 1366 GEN_EC_1366_Video_Recording_A_edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.0542413], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["Voiceover"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Class", "Class"], ["NaN"], ["Teacher"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["Class"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW02", "TW16", "TW17", "TW24TW17"]}, "1364": {"text": " So can you record two on that? \n It's harder to write two.\n Remember, here, you can use your number line if you need it to help you. Do you want me to turn it? So there's the two. Can you try to write it?\n  I did it. \n Awesome. That looks like a two. So was this awesome, all right, or super bad?\n  Super bad.\n Super bad. Why do you think it was super bad?\n  Because it's not heavy.\n Because it's not heavy.  Okay, Julia, what's our second problem?\n Ow.\n  The styrofoam ball.\n The styrofoam ball. Can you find the styrofoam ball?  Yes, that one. We can, first we're gonna make--  This one is bigger. How does it feel, though? Is it round?  It does? We're gonna be answering questions over here. Julia, can you let  make his prediction?  Which one did you pick?\n That one.\n You picked all right. Why did you pick all right?  Because it's little. How does it feel? Feel it. No, it's not heavy.  What do you think? Is there anything that you're wondering about that?  What's next?  What do you think?\n All right again?\n You think all right, too?  Mark them all right.  You think awesome? You think it's gonna go 15 or more? Okay, let's see.  Are you ready? Can you pick up the tape and do it again? Gonna get the tape. \n You're supposed to do it again.\n Because there's another space? Yep, we're gonna actually do it again after we do all of them one time. Okay.   Put it this way. Ivan's gonna put it in, is everyone ready? Oh wait, you have to keep it upside down so it can push. Okay? Can you try it over? Ivan, are you ready? Let's try one more time. I'm gonna put this cup right in front. One more time.    Well, feel it.  Is it heavy?  That's okay. I'm gonna be right back.  Has anything surprised you so far?  What happened?  The orange ball? So what kind of push was it?\n An awesome.\n  An awesome push. So did that surprise you? You didn't think it was gonna go so far?\n I though it was gonna go like .\n Is that where the tape went? So you guys can pick up the tape. Should we do the green ball?\n The green ball. Which ball so far...\n  A zero.\n A zero?  And it didn't move at all?\n Yes.\n Why do you think it didn't move?\n Because it's so tiny.\n It's so tiny. But does it weigh a lot?\n No.\n No, it didn't. Do you think that's why it didn't go far?\n And it's so tiny. And it doesn't have more mass.\n Ahh, I see. So, should we do this again?\n Yeah.\n The super bad is actually this one right here.\n Oh, it's so tiny.\n So feel it. How does it feel?  Let Luka feel it. How does it feel?  So Jacob, why don't you make your prediction? From all right to super bad. What do you think, Sofia? What did you put? Why did you put all right?  So right there. How far do you think it's gonna go?  What did you put, Sofia? Sofia picked... Luka, what do you think? Which one do you think? What's it gonna be? Awesome, all right, or super bad? Good pick, all right. So we're gonna do it down here on this one. All right. Are you ready? Make your prediction. And then we're gonna put it on the ground. What do you think? Awesome, all right, or super bad?  Who picked awesome? Sofia, right?  Do you guys have anything that you're--\n Remember when we were... \n I do remember when we were trying to . What did we find out? What is it?  What do you think for the second ball?   You think a rock is inside? Maybe.\n If they were rocks, then they would be so hard.\n That's true, is it really hard?\n A little.\n A little bit hard? What do you think is inside? Can we find out? We can open one of these, probably. Let's put it down first. Everybody write it. Jacob, are you the recorder? What are you? The counselor? Are you the starter? Okay guys, is everyone ready?  You know what? We're gonna do it one more time so that it knocks over the cup.  We can move the tape now.  Sofia, we need you to count. Move the cup over. How far did it go?\n One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.\n Will you count again with me? Ready?\n  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Jacob, this went 10. Can you write 10 down?\n No! \n For the super bad, it went 10. Yep.\n It's super awesome.\n So what do you think? Where did it go? Was it awesome, all right, or super bad?\n Awesome.\n All right.\n It was all right. Why was it all right?  And is 10 more or less than 15? Less than 15. So that's why it's all right. Okay guys, I'm gonna go to the next group. Now what you're gonna do is trial two. You're gonna do every ball one more time. Okay? Yep.  We're gonna do it one more time. Okay, I will be right back.    How's it going over here? Has anything surprised you?  What surprised you?  Which ball didn't push it very far?  Wait, how far did it actually push? So that means that the cup didn't move at all?  Why do you think the cup didn't move?  Because it's so light? Which one moved the farthest so far? Which ball?  The orange one? Is the orange ball really light?  How does the orange one feel?  Like it has more mass? Is there anything you guys are wondering about?  If they're bouncy? Let's put this ball back. Does that one bounce?  I wonder why not.  Okay, so what are we putting next on your sheet? What should you do?  Are you putting the rubber ball?  Yeah. Are you guys all putting that you think it's gonna be an awesome push?  Ready?  Put tape here. Alexandra, are you the taper?   \n It's on the wrong side.\n No, she got it, she did it. So move the cup over. Now Nicholas is gonna count.\n One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11. \n Can you help write in 13?  Yeah, this one right here has a one and a three. Can you try writing that?\n It's gonna have one more.\n  It's gonna have one more? So if the styrofoam ball went zero, and the orange ball went 13, which one is more?\n 13.\n How do you know that? You just know that?  When you count, does it come higher? Yes, it does? Okay, Ivan's ball is next. We need to do a trial shoot of which one?  Okay. \n You have a red...\n Yeah, mine.\n What do you guys think about this ball?\n It's awesome.\n It's awesome? Why is it awesome?\n It's awesome because it's red and it's the Cardinals' color.   \n Well, I would love for you to come. Should we see how far it goes? All right, let's check it.   It knocked the cup over. Let's try one more time.   It knocked it over again. We're gonna put the tape here.  Do you think that was farther than the rubber ball?  But when the ball goes farther.  Seven, eight, nine, 10, 11.  What?\n Can you find it on the number line? Where's 11? Uh huh, that's what it looks like. Is 11 more or less than 13?  Is it more than 13 or less? Which one?  Is what?\n More than.\n Is more than 11? If you look on the number line. So you're right, 13 is more.\n Yeah.\n Yeah. Okay, you guys can start putting the balls away.\n", "filename": ["Copy of 1364 GEN_EC_1364_Video_Recording_A_edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.140159], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Girl"], ["NaN"], ["Girl"], ["NaN"], ["Girl"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Julia"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Woman"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Girl"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Both"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Woman"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW02", "TW05", "TW09s"]}, "1362": {"text": " How do you know?

You don't think so? Why not?  Matthew, you blow.  Okay, all right, so remember that, okay? Now, Weslee, I want you to test it. You said you thought it would go different. See if you can make a difference. \n Yeah, why did it do something different? What's that that you're blowing out?\n Air.\n Air, and what is it?\n Gas.\n Gas, good. All right, you all can go ahead and finish measuring.  I saw Ella trying. Now, if you and Ella both try to blow on that do you think it's going to move? Why don't you think it's going to move?  You think it's too heavy? And you don't have enough breath.  Try it and see. See if you all both do it if you can get it to move.  You're going red in the face and it's going away.

Where do you think he should start counting?\n Right here.\n Okay, and why?\n The line.\n That's where the tape begins, right? Or you could even go like this and start it at the tape and then you use your pencil.\n So where does the pencil stop?\n Right here.\n Okay, so then count to there. I'll hold it for you, you count.\n 10.\n Ben, what do you think? Can you help him?\n Seven.\n So Ben thought that he got seven.\n Yeah, it's seven.\n Okay, so we're gonna stop where the thing begins, so we're gonna stop at the seven, okay? Here you go, good job.  Okay, I want you to stop what you're doing. I want you to quickly come to the carpet with your pencil and your clipboard. Come to your circle spot. I'm gonna count down from five, I want you to be on the carpet at zero. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. And zero. I love how you guys get to the carpet so nice and quietly. Thank you.

What did you notice about the tile, what did you notice about the wood, what did you notice about the cloth, and what did you notice about the carpet? Sophia.\n I noticed that the cloth and the carpet was harder.\n It was harder? And so what do you think happened?\n The puck slowed down.\n The puck slowed down, what made it slow down?\n The bumps on the towel.\n The bumps on the towel, and when we watched that video that talked about the bumps, do you remember what they called that? What is it that causes those bumps?\n  Nathaniel?\n It pushes back.\n It does, it pushes it back. What's that big word that we've been talking about?\n Friction.\n Friction, so do you think there was more friction on the towel?\n Not when I did it.\n Okay, so Monalisa, share what you noticed.\n When I pushed mine, it went all the way down.\n It went all the way down, so which one had more friction when you were testing it? Which one slowed down or did not go as far?\n  Which surface was slower, do you remember?\n The carpet.\n The carpet, so the carpet for you had the most friction? Okay, so does anyone else wanna talk about their surface? Kayley.\n The cloth, when I pushed the puck, it went kind of far, but not really far, because of all the bumps.\n Which surface had the least amount of friction? Daniel.\n Wood.\n The wood.

One, two, three, four.\n Do you want me to hold the balloon so it doesn't fall?\n Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.\n How many does it weigh?\n Okay, I'll start wearing this. I mean I'll start writing it.\n  No, I got it.\n  What are you doing there Abigail?\n Well, I'm weighing and it's not showing up yet.\n  What are you using that tool for?\n What tool? This tool?\n To see how cold it is.\n  So did you already weigh it?\n We have to hold it from the top.\n  Oh, so do you think it's going to weigh more now that you taped that to it? What's your prediction with that? Do you have a prediction?\n I have a prediction that it might be really cold.\n  And that's going to tell you that? But have you weighed yours yet?\n  No.\n And it's going to turn to ice.\n  So, but should you keep that thermometer on it while you weigh it or do you think it'll change how much it weighs?\n I think it will actually change how much it weighs.\n  Can you explain your thinking.\n Because, because the thermometer is heavy too and it would change how much...\n One pound.\n ...it was so we should probably get the thermometer.\n One pound.\n So we can, so we can, so we can weigh it and then we can put it back on.\n My hypothesis is it's going to be 20 degrees.\n My hypothesis is this is going to change it because it's only one pound.\n  Oh, so what are you going to do to test that?\n Weigh it.\n  Okay.\n Put it here, put it here.\n  Oh, are you guys discussing? What are you guys discussing?\n Where we are going to put our balloons.\n  So first talk to me about your balloon. Why did you choose this color?\n Because it was a light color and we think it might melt faster.\n We will think it will melt slower. We think it will melt slower.\n  Why?\n Because.\n Because it's a light color.\n The sun is attracted to the dark colors so that's why we picked pink.\n  So what are you doing right now?\n Doing a hypothesis.\n  Oh, can you explain what's your hypothesis, Teagan?\n It will be warm because we're going to put it next to the heater.\n That's what I was going to say too.\n  And so what's your hypothesis? How will that change the balloon?\n Because maybe you said we're going to put it in the freezer and then when we take it out we'll put it in the heater and we think it'll melt faster.\n  Okay.\n What about us?\n It's almost in the middle, take out one more.\n  Now I'm going to count.\n  What were you guys just doing down there?\n  She was thinking about the weight.\n  What does that mean?\n Like in the middle.\n  Okay, so how will you figure out how much it weighs?\n We need to take this out and we'll count them and then we'll write it on the paper.\n  32, 32.\n 12, 13, 14.\n  Brayden?

It's there, it's there.\n  What does that mean?\n So it means that they weigh the same thing.\n Okay.\n Now we have to count them.\n Let's let Will only do it.\n Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11,\n 64, 64.\n  Teagan, be working in your group.\n 23, 24, 25.\n I measured my balloon by using tiles, like tiles when I measured it. Tiles. What should we do now, Mrs. T? My balloon is filled with matter.\n  Why do you say that?\n Because everything is matter. Well, there's water inside the balloon so it's like solid and liquid.\n  Why is it solid and liquid? What were you saying? What were you saying? No, keep explaining your thinking.\n  I have a question.\n  One second.\n Water is a liquid and pushes on the weight.\n  Oh, so is that kind of tying in to your hypothesis?\n Light turns into water, solids and liquids.\n My hypothesis is, my hypothesis is if we like, if we... If we lose the like point it will not melt faster.\n  Why?\n It's a darker color.\n And when you think about it, dark colors will melt faster on their own.\n Is that cubes, the  has the cubes?\n  No, that's the weight. Pass it on. Have you all measured yours yet?\n  Yes.\n  How'd you measure it?\n With the tape thingy.\n  Would you mind showing me what you decide to do?\n My hypothesis is that it will melt faster because we're putting it by the sun.\n  Did you make a hypothesis by the length of it? No?\n Ours was six and a half inches.\n  How do you know?\n Because we measured it with the measuring tape.\n  Can you show me how you did it? Oh, there's an extra one Will.\n Did you say not to touch the balloon without the thermometer?\n  Now do we draw a picture of what it looks like right now?\n  These have bigger numbers you know.\n  So what are you thinking there Abigail?\n I'm thinking that not really.\n  But what were you saying there with the bigger numbers? I didn't understand. You held up the number line and you said those have bigger numbers.\n I mean like you can see them very well and you also can tell. 30.\n 30?\n 30, he should start now.\n  So how big is your balloon?\n We got to start at one.\n  Oh why did you change it Julia, from your first measurement?\n Because we accidentally started from the 30.\n  Oh.\n And now we have it upside down.\n  Okay, you got it? It was, it is, move your finger for me. It is...\n Now let's send this back here.\n Okay, I think we should do my idea for taking that thermometer off.\n Yeah.\n Yeah, I'll hold the thermometer.\n I'm trying to take it off.\n My hypothesis is it's going to be warm, but then not attracted to the light.\n Cold water is in there.\n Because sunlight can only make warmth.

Four X to the fourth. And is this term positive or negative?\n Positive.\n And what about this term?\n Positive. And what do we call this guy?  Rock on, okay good, good, good. Alright, easy one, you ready? Three X times X squared plus four X minus two. And this time we're multiplying, what kind of monomial is that?\n Linear.\n Linear, good. Times a quadratic what?\n Trinomial.\n Trinomial, awesome. Go ahead and distribute that and see what you get. When you think you have an answer do you wanna show it to the person next to you and see if you agree or disagree with each other? Alright, alrighty. So. Any exciting disagreements?\n No.\n Nothing.  No one differs from anyone else?\n No.\n Larry Thayer.\n He just forgot to write his  down.\n Okay, but now you're cool? So, everybody either feels like they got the same thing or they fixed what thought they had? Alright, that's boring. Okay, so what do get when you your first product done?\n Three X cubed.\n Alright, and then?\n 12 X squared.\n And then?\n Six X.\n And then?\n Nothing, it's simplified.\n It's done? Okay. So, we ended up with a cubic trinomial. Now, here's what I wanna show you. Somethin' a little different, because what's the, raise your hand if you can tell me the verb we did here.\n Cubic?\n We been talkin' the verb.\n Distributed?\n We distributed and we also what?\n Simplified.\n Which one's right? They're both, we simplified and we used distributing in order to simplify. Okay, so I'm gonna put a verb up here. And I'll even put distribute because that's specifically what we did. Now, here's what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna give you a different thing. I'm gonna give you this. I'm gonna give you four A cubed plus two A squared minus 10 A. And I'm gonna spice this up just a little bit, I'm sorry about that, change that 10 A to a 40 A. Alright.\n It's already simplified.\n It's already simplified, okay. So, I can't give you simplify for a verb. I'm gonna give you a different verb. Now, there's a better word than what I'm about to put up here. This isn't really a math word, we're gonna replace it with a better one very shortly. And here's a clue. Undistributed. How do you undistribute? Let's shove this expression that you said's already simplified, in a time machine. Imagine you got like a, have you guys ever seen like fast feed photography where there's a seed? And it's like they speed up the footage and you see the seed germinate and you see the little stem grow, and it's kind of all jerky and everything. Okay, can you imagine playing that backwards and you have a little sprout and it goes back in and it ends up as a little seed. Right? Imagine that this was on the page as a final answer and we put it in backwards to see how it might have started as a math problem.\n Do you use the ?\n You can do that?\n Do you use like the factor tree?\n Say that a little louder, Alec.\n Do you use the factor trees?\n Alec, that's interesting that you asked. Alec is asking about our warm-up problem today, which was a throw-back to when you guys were in elementary school and you talked about things called factor trees. And with factor trees we talk about how you can take a number and use a sledgehammer and kind of bust it up  into it's what?\n To it's factors.\n To its factors and we keep goin' until we can't do it anymore, right? Huh.\n The deal with that is you have to figure out what was originally inside and outside of the parentheses. You just gotta kinda ignore the A, I guess.\n Even ignoring the A like, I don't know if putting it in a facts tree you really put it into parentheses. 'Cause you don't really have a whole lot to work with there, to put it back into parentheses, I don't know. It's kinda going against every fiber of my being and--\n  Like why would you make a math problem out of a perfectly nice number?\n Yeah.\n Okay, that's interesting, we'll come back to that cuz that's a really good point. Why would you take like a 12 and turn it into a math problem, what good does that do? Yeah, what good is that? We'll come back to that, that's an excellent question. With big answers. Yes sir, what do you think?\n I forgot what I was gonna say.\n Ya sure? Lauren, what d'ya think?\n Isn't this kinda like checking it?\n Lauren just said something interesting. She said \"Isn't it kinda like checking it?\" So, when you check an equation for example, what do you do?\n Put it back in .\n So, when you solve an equation, it's kinda like tying a knot. And then when you put it in, put in the solution and you check it it's kinda like untying the knot to see if comes out the same way.\n But we don't have an equation to plug those into.\n You're right. Carolyn, what were you gonna say?\n Okay, so you know how yesterday, I know this is kind of off subject but I--\n That's okay.\n You know how yesterday like you showed us this problem on our worksheet and it was like three times the binomial or whatever? When you said we were gonna do those today?\n Can you be specific with the problem so I know what exactly.\n It was number 50 on--\n Oh, oh you mean the problems that look like this.\n Yeah. the ones that we said we've already done but we really haven't.\n Like this? And you guys wanted to make this, what did you wanna make this?  X squared, oh it feels so right, doesn't it? We'll come back to that in a second. That is sort of related to this. What were you gonna say Zach and then we'll take a closer look.\n I was just gonna say, couldn't there be different, like when you unsimplify that, couldn't there be different answers? Or is there only one correct answer?\n Can someone restate what he's sayin' here? Or what do you think he means by that? Sam, what do you think he means by that?\n I think he means that when like you unsimplify it it can be with the two parentheses or it can be with one parentheses and the term in front of it.\n So, you're sayin' maybe it's like this and there's something here. Or maybe, it's like this?\n Yeah.\n 'Cause this looks, I'll tell you, this looks an awful lot like the answer we got here. And this didn't start off with a number that was distributed necessarily like this one. It started off like this, didn't it?\n How do you figure out how to throw it backwards? 'Cause that's just like...\n You know what, let's start with the easier one. Which one of those is less complicated, the blue one or the orange one?\n The blue one.\n I'd agree, let's start with this way and then maybe we can go up to the orange. So if I wanted to, again this is not a math term, we're gonna use a better term in a little bit. If I were to quote undistribute, or use a vacuum cleaner to suck something out of all three of these terms, would you agree that it has to be the same thing that we suck out of each one? In other words, can I pull a four out of this and an eight out of this?\n yeah.\n Okay.  Any suggestions? Let's just focus on the coefficients, any suggestions on what I can pull out?\n A two.\n A two, okay. Anything else?\n Four?\n Can I pull a four, let's go door to door. Can he give me a four? Can he give me a four? Can she? So, if there was a four out there I would have to think what was in there to distribute a four two to make two. I'm gonna avoid fractions here.\n Yeah see, he's avoiding fractions.\n I could, I could technically pull out anything. But with the factor tree we did at the beginning of class, typically when you talk about, that's a good point. When we talk about factors we stick with whole numbers. Okay? Or maybe even integers, but we usually don't go into fractions. Sam, what're you thinkin'?\n To unsimplify it, couldn't you put in one of those boxes that we did yesterday for the terms? Like put it in the middle and then find what it is?\n Oh yeah.\n Why, you're talkin' when we were doing  this.  And then ask ourselves what would go here, that's a weird question mark. What would there and what would go there? That's interesting. Alec, what are you thinking?\n Couldn't you take out an A with that two? Like on the problem?\n Since it all has A's? If you can take out a, can you put out an A, like you took out the two? \n Can he give up an A?\n Yes.\n Can he give up an A?\n Yes.\n She give up an A?\n Yes.\n Well, let's try that, let's try that, that's interesting. So if I were to quote, and again, we're not gonna use this word much after the next. Would you, if you were to quote undistribute a two A from four A cubed, what would that look like? What would have to be here?\n It would have to be a two A squared.\n Well okay, let's keep goin' and then we'll check to see if this makes sense. I'll get your question in one second, Caroline. So then what would be next?  So, the two from the two would leave a ghost one. And then the A from the A squared would be a what, Oscar?\n I was thinkin' one A.\n One A, alright I'd like that. And then the two A from the negative 40 A would be a what?\n Negative 20.\n Negative 20 A?  So, now we're back to what Justin said. We've taken a perfectly nice, simplified polynomial and turned it into a math problem. Let's see if this is even right. What do you think we could do to check ourselves like Lauren suggested?\n Do the problem.\n What do you mean do the problem?\n Simplified.\n Okay, so let's simplify it real quick. What's two A times two A, and no peeking?\n Four A squared.\n What's two A times two A cubed, I mean squared? Four A cubed, good. And what's two A times A?\n That's two A squared.\n What kind? Positive two A squared. And two A times negative 20?\n Negative 40 A.\n Oh, it worked!\n Yeah. \n I have a question.\n Yes, ma'am.\n What exactly is the point of this?\n That's an excellent question. Shhhhhh, ready? Why on earth would you do such a horrible rotten thing?  Well, one day, shhhh. One day what if you had this beast?\n Holy Cow!\n Whoa!\n Do you guys know where to start? No, I don't know. But, check this out. Didn't you just say we could take this and turn it? That's the same thing we had, right? So, can I factor that and turn that into two A times two A squared plus A minus 20? Are you cool with that? Are you okay if I just leave the bottom? Two A squared plus A minus 20. Anybody have an idea what might happen now?  Did you guys know that you've been doin' that since the fourth grade?\n No.\n Yes, you have. Just with much less obnoxious numbers. What does 16/32, what does that, let me use another. What does that simplify to? Here's why, you guys probably already knew this. Let's leave the 16 alone, and isn't 32 two times 16?\n Yeah. Ohhh!\n That's the math. That's the math that justifies simplifying fractions like you've been doin' since you were like eight years old.\n That's cool.\n What other occasion, this is gonna be helpful. How do you undo plus or adding when you're solving equations?\n Subtraction.\n Subtraction, you call in the opposite, right? How do you undo multiplication?\n You divide.\n Divide, well here's what we're leading up to. How are you gonna undo the squared? Factoring busts up the squared for us. And it's gonna be a very important tool when we're solving, what kind of equations do you think we can call these?  Think about it. Look at the degree.\n Oh, quadratic.\n Quadratic equations.  Alright, let's take a look at another one. Let me have you undistribute one again. We need a better word for this. Did we call this unmulltiplying?\n No.\n What did we call the verb here, what was the verb on this?\n Division?\n", "filename": ["Copy of 806 MATH EA 806 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.158471], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["laughs"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["Inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["clapping"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW06m", "TW08m"]}, "804": {"text": " Anybody tell me how much cases usually run? \n At Radio Shack, they're 30 dollars.\n Okay, you know what? So we'll factor that in in a minute. But Alex, you had your hand raised. So I'd like to hear from you.\n I was just gonna say that the 199, tax is gonna come in anyway, so \n What if you got a deal about it that paid the tax and shipping? \n Okay, hold up. Cynthia.\n But even though... Even though if you use 12, you're only gonna have a couple dollars left over. With the economy these days, things are not cheap. So you can't buy something with five dollars. You're not gonna get a case for that cheap.\n That's probably right. \n I'm gonna hear two more of you, and then I have something I wanna drop into this conversation that several of you talked about, and I think is really important to point out. So I wanna hear what you two have to say, and then I'm gonna go back to something several of you kinda mentioned. Go ahead.\n It's better to have more money than less money because if you exactly calculate it to... then you'd still have zero dollars left, but it's better to have equal or more money.\n Okay, that's, you know I think you're right. That seems like it just makes sense, right? And one more, yeah.\n Actually, when I bought my phone, I got a case just for about five dollars on ebay.\n Ebay, so you got a used one?\n And it paid for shipping, so I didn't, yes I did.\n Okay well you know what? I wanna talk about that because that's actually what you guys just said is really important, and several of you others mentioned it. Maybe we don't want, maybe I don't want to have the exactly the price, maybe I want to have at least... And if I say I wanna have at least 200 dollars, is there a way to say at least with math symbols? To make that equation change so it says least. 'Cause right now, it says equal. Is there a way to do it so it says at least? Colin?\n If you, you need to get the iPhone and the case in the same shipping order, or else it's gonna cost more for shipping.\n Oh okay. So yeah, I need at least a certain amount.\n Yeah. So you're gonna .\n Wanna jump in on that, guys?\n You need to put the greater than or equal to sign.\n But what does that look like?\n The greater than sign with a line under it.\n Okay. And what's the word in English that we have for that symbol? Yeah, say it again, Alexis.\n That least.\n It is. So now, how much do I need to save to get at least 200 dollars, right? So it's okay if I have exactly or more than. So that kinda talks about what you guys are talking about. Maybe I need more money, if she wants more, more than just a phone. I'm sure she does, right?\n With the...  What about the  just come with the phone. Just that, or does it come with something else? Like a... Charger, battery, or even a case itself.\n So again you're saying I need at least 200 dollars, right? Depending on what comes with the phone.\n  like a Christmas special? Like half off or something? \n What you can... Also think is where you gonna buy it? And where is there's no tax and stuff? So, it depends on where you're gonna buy it. If you want no tax, that means like on Ebay or something, but...  It might be 50 percent off and stuff like that.\n Okay, interesting.\n I'm just saying, it depends where you're gonna buy your phone.\n Okay, no, I like that a lot.\n When I was doing my equation, I got 121. So you would still have a dollar left over. And you know how Cassidy said that she can get it on Ebay, that much. Most people, they... I understand that it's cheap, and most people want it like that, but I bought stuff off the line before, and some of the stuff does work good, and some of 'em you drop them and it breaks. So, it's not always good.\n Somethin' to pay attention to. All right, I'm gonna change the conversation a little bit because I think you guys are doing really really well. Let's go with what you guys said and say I need at least 200 dollars. If that's true, is there any way to find out, or to answer the original question, which Nick brought up. How much money do I need to save each day based on what we have so far? Where do I go from here?\n There is a way to solve it. You grab 200 dollars, and then you subtract 80 from it.\n Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there. I don't mean to interrupt. Katherine, you're watching this and I saw your paper, what do you think about what Najeem just said?\n Like \n Okay, and why is that?\n I don't know. That's how you solve it in equality.\n Okay, so can you repeat what you said?\n You subtract 80 from both sides.\n Okay. I'm gonna go ahead and do that right now. And what does that leave us with?\n 120.\n And you know what, I have a question. What does that 120 represent? I mean, if 200 is how much the phone costs, what's 120 about? I'm not sure.\n How much you need to raise, until then.\n Okay, okay. And Nayanna? Can you comment on what you think might be the next step?\n Divide 12 from 120.\n Again.\n Divide 12 from 120.\n Okay. And, somebody else, jump in.\n The answer was . The answer would be 10 because 12 and 120 equals 10.\n Okay, and Katie you were ready to say something. What would you say?\n I was about to say .\n Equals 10. X equals 10 and-- \n X equals at least 10.\n Oh, it was so you're not liking what I wrote over here, Alexis.\n At least 'cause you have to keep the  all the way down.\n Okay, Katherine, what do you think?\n I agree with Alexis because... it can't just like change, because...\n When you say it can't change, what do you mean?\n the side.\n Oh  Okay, that's good . I didn't know what it was I'm just asking.\n And then you have to put what X means. \n Oh, Oh. Oh, so what is the label? What are the units we're talkin' about?  Ah.\n  the blue tooth. If you wanna have a little extra money, you could have more, and plus, if you get a little extra money one day, but you have the same another, and you get a little less the next day, you could raise up for another day.\n Oh, like if I'm going to collect cans and I don't collect as many cans one day, but I collect extra the next day.\n Yeah, like that.\n Nayanna, you had your hand raised.\n When you have to add 40 to 200, for the Bluetooth.\n Ah, that's an interesting idea. So maybe we, so tell me what to write. Instead of this, how would you change this to incorporate what you just said?\n 80 plus X equals 240.\n Okay, are you pleased, are you okay with that?\n I disagree.\n Cynthia.\n I disagree with your answer on that one. I don't agree that it's 10 because if like they were saying earlier if you wanted some extra money, you would... You should... You should do 11 for a day because if you do you'll get 132, and then you'll have extra money.\n Okay. \n But that's the problem .\n What do you mean when you say it's not asking?\n Well, it's not asking for extra money, or anything, it's just asking how many... How much money you need per day. \n Anthony, I noticed you've got some stuff written down. What do you think about... I wanna go back to what Nayanna said. She says she's gonna change the equation here, and she put 240 up there, why? Why did she do that, and do you agree with that?\n Yeah, 'cause then you would have a little extra money left.\n A little bit.\n You would have a little bit of extra money left.\n Okay.\n  like the Bluetooth in the case, maybe?\n Okay.\n Isn't this another problem? Another problem  not a part of this one yet?\n Yeah, 'cause they're not asking how much extra money do you need. This problem, this question's not asking how much extra do you need for a Bluetooth, also.\n Okay.\n How much are the phone and Bluetooth, it's just asking for the phone.\n Okay. \n I think because... The question wasn't asking to bring extra money into it. We just brought the extra money to round the, make the equation easier and round the and extra money is okay, but we shouldn't change the equation. 'Cause it's not asking you to.\n Okay.\n This question isn't saying anything about case or a Bluetooth yet, it's a yes question. And this question talks about Bluetooth.\n Okay, so what I kinda like is you guys were doin' this problem, and a couple of ya jumped ahead to this problem, which is no problem at all. Let's jump ahead just for a minute and assume that I did want to get the Bluetooth. Would this be the equation to represent? And before I answer this question, what I would like to do, I'm gonna call on Olivia, and then I'm gonna have everybody switch so the pilots go back to the co-pilots, and the pilots come up, but not yet. Let's hear what Olivia has to say.\n Would it be  equals 12 X, if you wanted to get it before Christmas? Or would it be after?\n One more time, I could barely hear ya.\n Would we still get that before Christmas, or would it be after?\n Before, before.\n So would it be 12?\n Comments on that?\n I agree with that. \n Thumbs up if you think 12, thumbs down if you think no, we don't need 12 on this one. Okay, Adrian, you have something?\n We need to know how much money you earned each day.\n Well that's... What do you guys think about that question?\n Well that's what we're finding out right now.\n I know, but how much you earn. That's how much he has to save.\n Pilots, switch with somebody in the back.  All right, here we go. So now, I have a question for you. Can everybody turn around for just a minute please? Thank you. Question for you. If I wanted to graph our first solution on a number line, what might that graph look like? So will you guys agree that okay, we need to earn a minimum amount. And at least 10 dollars a day, but if I wanted to graph that, put that on a number line represent that graphically, what would that look like?\n It would be like a... It would be . But the circle... \n What kind of circle? I didn't hear you.\n Shaded.\n So you want to put this up here?\n Yeah. \n Amarra, I'd like to hear your opinion on that.\n I don't, I never understood the shaded thing. I don't know why it's shaded.\n It's shaded because it's not, I think if it's not shaded it means greater than, I mean greater or less than. But when it's shaded I think . It means equal to or less than or... With.\n Okay, Tara, do you wanna contribute to that \n Well, whenever it says greater than, or equal to, the dotted means it could be 10 because it could be equal to, or greater than, which is over 10. But greater than or less than can't be that number so it has to be open circle. And than greater than or equal to.\n Anybody have an example of a problem or words that we would use to put an open circle, unshaded circle? In real life, what might we say for something to represent an unshaded circle?\n Go ahead, Al.\n Fewer than 14 students have mechanical pencils.\n A little louder.\n I got fewer than 14 students have mechanical pencils.\n So in that problem, could 14 students have mechanical pencils, if you have fewer than 14?\n No.\n So that would be unshaded. 'Cause 14 doesn't count. So in this question, Amarra, the least number of money I should save per day is how much?\n I think 10 is a good answer. because it does go into the number.\n And so would be shaded or unshaded?\n Shaded.\n Oh, is that the only number amount of money I should save each day? Is that it? Are their other possibilities out?\n Yeah, you could do--\n", "filename": ["Copy of 804 MATH EA 804 edited.srt.txt"], "nlu": ["en", "negative", -0.157632], "annotations": [["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible", "inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["laughs", "laughs"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible", "inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["inaudible"], ["inaudible"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"], ["NaN"]], "tags": ["TW01", "TW08m", "TW11", "TW23", "TW24TW07"]}}
