 Well, we all thought that a diamond might be a pure substance.
 [Teacher] Why?
 Well, I think a diamond can only be cut by itself, and can only be cut with a different diamond.
 [Teacher] OK.
 So that's really dense, so we thought that if anything was added to it, something else would be able to cut it. And that would be something else that was less dense.
 So, interesting. What is, um ... You're talking about density. What is density?
 It's a characteristic property.
 A characteristic property. So this is good. You definitely should be starting to lean towards what you know about characteristic properties of matter. Okay? That is key to helping you understand the difference between pure and mixture. Who can tell me what a characteristic property of matter is? Hannah?
 A property that stays the same regardless of the amount of the substance.
 Yeah, a property that stays the same for a substance regardless of the amount. So what I'm hearing you say, is that you think the ability to cut into a diamond has to do with its density. And you're saying that because you can only cut a diamond with a diamond, it must mean that the densities are the same. And so, since the density is the same for the whole diamond, that means it's one substance.
