 [Teacher] So just leave your clicker on your table guys. I mean you can put one in front of you, just don't turn it on yet, they're not activated. Please don't play with them because then the batteries can stay charged through the day. Thank you for the help. Excellent, thanks. All right guys, so let's get started with our discussion here. Set the clicker down please don't play with it, just leave it on the table, thank you. I asked you today to get our thinking going to answer this question. Danny DeVito is between 4'9" and 5'1" tall. So, i'm 5'10" so Danny DeVito is either between this tall or about this tall. We're not sure on his height. His wife, Rhea Perlman is 5'0 tall. How tall do you think their sons and daughters will be and why? All right, so please raise your hand to share your answer, and I'm going to ask you why you think like you do. So, I'm going to start back there with Alex. So, turn this way so that I can hear you,  okay?
 [Alex] Okay. I think their kids would be around 5' because their mom is 5' tall and their dad his middle height is 5'?
 [Teacher] Okay, so you're looking at the middle estimated height of Danny DeVito and his wife's height is 5', so you think together then all their children will be 5', boys and girls?
 [Alex] Mm-hm.
 Okay. Great, thank you. What else do you think? J.R.?
 I said 5' too. I said 5' as well because that's about how tall they are, so their kid would be around that.
 [Teacher] Okay, so you're looking at kind of his average height and her height, so you think the kids will be around that? Okay, anything different or you want to explain it further? Michael?
 [Michael] I just said that you get your height from your parents, so whatever the parents were right around 5' the kids will be about 5'.
 [Teacher] Okay, you get your height from your parents. So, since the parents are about 5' the kids will be 5'. Boys and girls?
 [Michael] Yeah.
 Okay, great. What do you think?
 [Student] Well, I think  the daughter could be 4'9" and the sons would be around 5'2", because both of the parents are shorter, and so they could be a little bit taller or even a little bit shorter than one of their parents?
 Okay, so even though the parents are shorter they could be taller or shorter than the parents, and you said that the daughters could be about 4'9" and the sons might be about 5'2"?
 Yes.
 Is there a reason why you think the boys would end up being taller than the girls?
 It's just kind of a normal thing. Normally boys are taller than girls.
 Okay, so a normal thing, boys are usually taller than girls. Okay, great. Any other ideas on the height of their children? Adam, what do you think? Well, what do you think about...
 I think that they'll be around, I think boys and girls, will both be around 5' because it's right inbetween the parents.
 [Teacher] Okay, good. What about me and my family? I'm 5'10". So, I'm tall. What do you think about my family members? How tall do you think they are? I'm 5'10", how tall do you think my mom is? How tall do you think my dad is? What's your estimation? What do you think? Raise your hands everybody, let's participate. Mackenzie what do you think?
 I think your dad would be around 6'2" and I think your mom would be around 5'11" or 5'9"?
 [Teacher] Okay, so my mom is between 5'9" and 5'11", so close to my height, and my dad would be taller, about 6'2". Brian, what do you think?
 [Brian] I said that I think your dad would be taller than you, but then your mom would be around the same height.
 [Teacher] So, my mom is about the same height and my dad is taller?
 [Brian] Yeah.
 Anybody think anything. . .  Pardon me?
 [Brian] Or like around 6'.
 [Teacher] My dad would be around 6'?
 [Brian] Yeah.
 [Teacher] What if I tell you my little brother...  my little baby brother, is 6'4"? And he is. This is true, he is 6'4". So, he's a tall guy. Does that change your ideas about the heights of my parents? You guys are nodding "yes." What do you think now? Travis?
 [Travis] Maybe your dad is like 6'4" and your mom is like 5'8" or 5'9" or something?
 [Teacher] Okay, so Mom is about here, Dad is taller or 6'4" like my little brother? Michael, what do you think?
 Both of them are about 6'.
 Both of them are about 6'. Okay, great, what do you think?
 Well, I know that a lot of people get their traits from their dad, from dads. So, that your dad is taller around 6'5" and then your mom is shorter, like 5'8".
 So, you see my height, and my mom is about 5'8" and my dad is 6'5",  so for my brother and I, you're figuring about our traits? What do you mean?
 That you get your traits from your dad.
 So, my dad's genes are coming through. Why do you think that? Why do you think I have only traits from my dad.
 Because I know a lot of people who get their traits from their dad and more than their mom.
 So, more traits from dad than from mom? Do you think that's pretty much general?
 [Student] Yeah. Okay, great. Do you guys have anything to comment on that? What do you think?
 I think your dad's probably like 6'2", because my brothers are both taller than my dad already and they're still in high school?
 [Teacher] Oh, interesting. Well, I'll tell you my mom was 5'11" at her tallest. Now she's shrinking, she's like 5'9". You know how that happens as you get older and my dad, he's only 6' tall. So, my little brother is the tallest in the family and my other brother, he's 6'1". So, height does come from both sides, but my dad's not as tall you guy's might've thought. Let's talk about Danny DeVito again. Here he is, our favorite actor, right? Notice his lack of hair, he's bald. The question on here says "Danny DeVito is bald. What do you think his son's hair or lack of will look like when he's older, and why?" His son, Danny DeVitto has a son. What do you think about his hair? Nice and loud so I can hear you. Matthew.
 It said that their son would have bald hair on the top, but some on the sides?
 [Teacher] Some will be bald on the top, but he'll have some hair around the sides. Why do you think that?
 Because usually if somebody's dad's bald they're not always bald.
 [Teacher] If somebody's dad is bald they are not always bald?
 [Student] I've seen that.
 You've seen that? That's a good observation, Matt. What do you think?
 [Student] Well, the mom has a lot of hair and the dad is bald, so I thought,  he will still have a lot more hair than his dad. He wouldn't be completely bald, but bald on top.
 Okay, so mom has a lot of hair, dad's bald. So, you think the son will have hair, but just bald on top?
 Yeah.
 So, when you see the traits being passed down, how do you see it?
 I'm not really sure what you mean by that question.
 You're kind of saying that he'll have this trait, but he'll also have this trait. So, how do you see that happening? Did he get all of his traits from one or all his traits from another, the son, or do you think . . .
 I think they were combined.
 They were combined. The traits are combined. Good, Sean?
 I thought he would have like a blackish-brown hair, because that's what the mom's hair color is.
 [Teacher] Okay?
 He probably wouldn't be bald, but he'd have a receding hairline.
 [Teacher] Okay, so he would have a receding hairline, and for those of us that don't know what that means, that means when a person starts to lose their hair, and it kind of inches back and they're losing their hair. That's what a receding hairline is. So, the hair falls out as it moves back. Are you ready to see what Danny Devito's kids look like? Here they are for our predictions. We have his son in the middle standing taller than everyone else in the family. He's about 5'5". So, he's taller than both mom and dad. This is Danny Devito's wife, Danny Devito and his son. Here's his daughters. This daughter is about the height of the mom, but she has big shoes on. The other daughter is taller. But notice their hair, what do you notice about their hair? Ryan, tell me what you notice about all three kids.
 Well, they all have hair, they're not bald.
 [Teacher] They all have hair, they're not bald. How would you describe their hair?
 Curly?
 [Teacher] Curly hair. What color?
 Black.
 [Teacher] Black or dark brown, yes very good. All right, so we see that. Now, when we think about these bunnies, another question I asked you is this, look at the picture. If they had ten offspring, what do you think the coats for each bunny would look like? The fur in what respect, that was the question. Nathan, what do you think?
 [Nathan] 25% would be white, 25% would be black, the remainder would be gray with a little white? So, part of them will be black and part of them will be white...(inaudible) So, half of them will be gray... (inaudible)?
 [Teacher] Okay, so here's what we have. I'm going to use abbreviations. and 50% will be gray. Nathan says that because one parent is white, one's black they'll combine to form a gray color, just like mixing paint in art class. Any other predictions? What else are you thinking? Let's hear from somebody new. What else do you think? Omar.
 [Omar] I think 40% of the bunnies are going to be black, are going to be half black and half white, like a black bunny with white dots, or a white bunny with black dots.
 [Teacher] All right. So, you're saying 40% black, 40% white, You will see both colors. We'll see black and we'll see white. Why did you choose 40%, 40% and 20%?
 [Omar] Because I think that it's rare for bunnies to have dots . . . It might be rare for them to have dots.
 [Teacher] Okay, so you see that a solid colored bunny more likely, the probability is higher for a solid color. So, that's why you chose 20%? Great, great thinking. Great explanation. Sean, what do you think?
 I had 20% white, and the rest are gray. I would have said 25%, but you can't have two and a half babies being white.
 Okay. All right, so you would've said 25%. So, you were thinking similarly.
 [Sean] Yeah.
 Why do you say 20%, 20% and 60%?
 Because most of them would be a mixture of the two, but a few of them would have to have more of one of the parent rabbit's traits.
 [Teacher] Okay, so because they have offspring, the majority will be a mixture of both of their traits? So, mom and dad will blend together to create gray, but some of them will look just like the father, some will look just like the mother, so some will be black, some will be white. Great. One more idea.  Kasey what do you think?
 [Kasey] I know in health  that everyone has a dominant feature. I think white is, so that the majority, so like 40% would be white, and 20% would be black, and then the rest would be gray.
 40% white, 20% black and 20% gray. And you said, because in health you were learning about dominant features and you believe...
 [Kasey] That's only 80%. Oh, what did you say for the last one?
 I said the rest.
 Wow, well thanks for paying attention Good check there guys.
 [Kasey] It would be 40%.
 ...60%, we need 40... Did you say 40?
 [Kasey] I said the rest.
 I was just making up too many different numbers. Well, I'm so happy that you guys are paying attention. I'm going to tell your math teacher, good job. Okay, 40% white, but here's what Kasey said that was really good.  She said that 40% will be white, because white is dominant. You used that word. You talked about that in health a little bit. So, let's talk about dominant and what that means. What does it mean? What do you think dominant means? And be nice and loud for us. John.
 Most of?
 [Teacher] Most of. Good. What do you think Sam?
 Main?
 [Teacher] Main... Sean?
 The majority?
 [Teacher] The majority...Alex?
 Beat out all others?
 [Teacher] Beat out all others. Nice.  What do you think, Sean?
 [Sean] Strongest?
 [Teacher] Okay. Let me show you a little example here. So, where do we get our traits, first of all? Where do we get traits?
 [Students] From parents.
 From where?
 [Students] Parents.
 Your parents. Okay, it's passed down. Traits are passed down and some come from each parent, right? Dominant, recessive, some come from both mom and dad. If you received a dominant trait . . . See I labeled this cup dominant and colored it pink and you received a recessive trait. So, half and half, mom and dad. They come together, which trait do you see? The dominant one or the recessive one?
 [Students] The dominant one.
 The dominant one. What if I put it this way. Which trait do you see? The dominant one. What if I put two recessive traits together?
 [Students] The recessive.
 The recessive, okay. Either way I pair them, mom or dad, dad or mom. If I have two dominant traits that go together, what do I see?
 [Students] Dominant.
 Dominant, okay. So, if the dominant trait is present, then... finish the sentence. If the dominant trait is present in your genes, then what?
 [Kasey] It will show.
 It will show, Kasey says. That's right, if the dominant trait is present it will show. Are you guys remembering this from yesterdays little intro? Okay, let's check this then real quick. Yesterday you filled out this concept map. Let's make sure that your answers are correct. Jsut take a look. So, read this with me.
 [All] "Genetics is the study of heredity, the passing of traits from parent to offspring" and if the offspring has the same alleles, we call that?
 [Students] Purebred.
 And if they have different alleles?
 [Students] Hybrid.
 What that means, allele, that word say that, allele.
 [ Students] Allele.
 It's the fun word to say during our genetics unit. That's the form of the gene, so is it a dominant or is it a recessive. Okay, so let's go back here. Genetics is the study of . . .
 [Students] Heredity.
 The passing of...
 [Students] Traits.
 I don't hear everybody. Controlled by...
 [Students] Genes.
 Made of...
 [Students] Alleles.
 Say it again. Alleles.
 [Students] Alleles.
 So genes made of...
 [Students] Alleles.
 Shows when present. We call that...
 [Students] Dominant.
 And can be masked...
 [Students] Recessive.
 Recessive, all right, very good. Any questions on the concept map? Any corrections if you need to make them, please do so. All right! Well, let's get going with our lab. Are you guys ready? Okay, please take out your lab paper? We're going to go back to some of those reflection questions later on. Notice the top of the paper. It says "Problem". This is what we're trying to solve. This is the point of our scientific investigation. "Are traits controlled by dominant alleles more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles." I'd like you, on the lines, to create your own hypothesis, or your prediction for this. "Are traits controlled by dominant alleles more common" that's the question "are they more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles?" So, write down what you think, write down your prediction. If you can write it in the if-then format of how we do hypotheses, that's preferred, but if that confuses you at this point, just write what you think is going to happen. Are dominant alleles more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles. Whatever you think, it's your thinking. We will talk about our hypotheses in just a moment. So, once you've written down your hypothesis, reread it and make sure that it answers the question. Then we're going to get to work using our clickers, which i'll explain in just a moment. I'd like to hear you share some hypotheses before we begin. The question again, "Are traits controlled by dominant alleles more common than traits controlled by recessive alleles?" Please share your prediction, your hypothesis. Ronnie.
 I said yes, because dominant alleles, it shows over recessive alleles?
 So, you believe dominant will be more common because they show over recessive alleles. Okay, great. Girls, one of you share your hypothesis for me. Who would like to share? Everyones looking at you Kate. What do you have on your paper?
 [Kate] I said that I thought the dominant alleles were more common?
 You believe the dominant alleles will be more common. Okay, great, thank you.  Another one. Alex?
 [Alex] I agreed with it. I said that I believe that dominant traits were more common than recessive, because there's more combinations to get dominant one's over recessive.
 You believe dominant traits are more common than the recessive, because there's more combinations...
 [Alex] To get that?
 To get to that. To get the dominant traits to show. Good. One more. Matthew?
 I said that the dominant traits are less common, because in the picture with Danny DeVito? His son and daughters didn't look much like him?
 Okay, so you believe that the dominant traits are less common, because in the example of Danny DeVito, his kids didn't look much like him.
 [Alex] Yeah, and how your younger brother is 6'4"...
 And how my younger brother is 6'4", but he's taller than the rest of my family. Okay, so you're making connections to our earlier conversation, good. We're going to revisit our hypotheses after we do this lab.
