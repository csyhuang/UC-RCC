 [Teacher] Today we're gonna work on soccer special olympic skills, alright? We've done this a couple of times before. Inside we did it on the gym floor and the ball moved real fast. It'll be a lot easier out here today on the grass, ok? You guys are gonna be awesome, we'll have a good time. First thing we're gonna do is dribbling. When you dribble, I want you to use the inside of your foot, right here. Inside of your feet, keep the ball real close to your feet and dribble. When I say go, you're gonna start right here at the start line. And you'll dribble, stay in between these yellow cones, all the way down to the finish line where this other orange marker is, alright? Once you get here, put your foot on top of the ball and stop the ball. And that's when I'll stop the clock, alright? That'll be it, you just go from the start to finish then stop right down there. First time you do it, you may have to walk and go slow. Then we'll do it again, and you can probably get a little bit faster the second time. Alright, Taylor you wanna go first?
 [Taylor] Yeah.
 [Teacher] Show us how it's done? Alright, let's go. Wait till I say go, and then you'll be ready to roll, alright? On your mark, get set, go! Doin' good, keepin that ball close. Staying between the cones. Good soft touches. And stop it. Awesome, good job.
 [Taylor] Yeah.
 [Teacher] And next time you dribble a little bit faster and you'd do even better.
 [Taylor] Yeah!
 [Teacher] Alright, good job. Colin, you wanna go second? Yeah, come on. We'll start right here by the start line, right behind the start line. You know what you're gonna do? When I say go, what are you gonna do?
 [Colin] Um.
 [Teacher] Whatcha gonna do when I say go?
 [Colin] I'll just, start.
 [Teacher] Yeah you're gonna dribble to that finish line, right? When you get there, stop it with your foot. Stop the ball with your foot, ok? You ready? On your mark, get set, go! Good, Colin. Keep on dribbling it. Inside the feet. Good job. Almost there. Almost there. Get across the line and stop it. Good job. Good job, Colin. Faith, you ready? Yeah, let's do that.

Is Jessie going first? Alright. Alright, last one. Last event. You guys remember this one, right? Run and kick, you're gonna start. (laughing) Start right here in the middle, alright? Arrows going to number one first. When I say go, I start the clock. Fast as you can run up to this ball. Just pass it through those two cones. Then we're gonna go this way following the arrows to number two. Same thing, pass it through those cones. Number three, pass it through these cones. Then to number four, pass it through those cones. And as soon as you kick that ball, the clock stops. Alright? Remember, you don't have to hit it real hard on these. Just kick it easy, nice and soft and aim it between those cones. Jessie, you're the first one up. You ready? Start on that arrow in the middle and I'll say go. On your mark, get set, go. Boom, alright. Go faster if you can. I know you can go faster than that. There you go. There you go. Alright. You wanna get that one right there, Jessie? Taylor, can you get that ball? Colin, you get that ball right there? We're gonna set 'em up and go again.
