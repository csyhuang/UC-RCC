 [Voiceover] What?
 It's a dark color.
 [Voiceover] So what does that mean?
 We think the sun might hit it or light might hit it faster so it might melt faster.
 [Voiceover] Keegan, how are you going to figure out how much it weighs?
 Maybe, it will melt faster because the water.
 [Voiceover] What about that, explain your thinking.
 Because...
 You've stolen her even. Now we got to count it. One, two.
 No, now you're taking them all.
 Three, we got to count, four, five, six.
 Here.
 Seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12
 [Voiceover] Freeze for just one second. Let's switch and have the boys keep on. You stopped at 20. Boys, finish counting. They stopped at 20, finish counting.
 21, 22, 23, 24.
 But they're not counting, they're just putting it in. It's not working.
 They're just putting it in in the same time.
 [Voiceover] So freeze gentlemen. So how do you think you could fix that?
 Put it back in.
 [Voiceover] You might want to try to remeasure. Definitely want to.
 [Voiceover] Miss T look.
 [Voiceover] Guys, we need to take a bunch of it out because it's not really getting weighed.
 You might need to use something heavier.
 [Voiceover] Oh, remember, you're not supposed to touch that nob on the back. That's not how you, how would you figure out how to weigh it?
 What happened?
 [Voiceover] What's going on Daniel? Tell me what the problem is.
 It has too much, oh sorry. It has too much water in it.
 Yeah.
 [Voiceover] Well, can we change that scientists?
 No.
 [Voiceover] What can we change?
 We can take out a lot.
 It's too heavy. It was reaching on that side.
 Six halves.
 This is heavier.
 [Voiceover] Wait, say that again Brayden. What did I just hear you say?
 I said it's heavier.
 This is heavier than the blocks, so we put more in.
 [Voiceover] Oh.
 Yeah, we're going to put more in.
 Oh way too much, way too much.
 Whoa, look.
 Uh-uh.
 Ms. Teacher, Ms. T, I think it's six and a half.
 [Voiceover] What is six and a half?
 The measure.
 [Voiceover] Oh, is that your predication, that's your what?
 That's my hypothesis.
 [Voiceover] Oh, how are you going to find out if it's true?
 What do we do?
 [Voiceover] Can you maybe explain to Teagan what she needs to do?
 Just balance it. They're like working on it.
 There we go, got it.
 Got it.
 [Voiceover] Daniel, what were you saying?
 We were going to like...
 We just figured out how much blocks it weighs.
 Hang on, it'll get there.
 [Voiceover] So what did you discover?
 We discovered we had, we discovered we had to take...
 We had to take one, two, three, four of the blocks out.
 Five.
 Five of the blocks out to make it weigh.
 [Voiceover] So how much does it weigh?
 So let me count the blocks. One, two, three, four.
 Do you want me to hold the balloon so it doesn't fall?
 Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
 How many does it weigh?
 Okay, I'll start wearing this. I mean I'll start writing it.
 [Voiceover] No, I got it.
 [Voiceover] What are you doing there Abigail?
 Well, I'm weighing and it's not showing up yet.
 [Voiceover] What are you using that tool for?
 What tool? This tool?
 To see how cold it is.
 [Voiceover] So did you already weigh it?
 We have to hold it from the top.
 [Voiceover] Oh, so do you think it's going to weigh more now that you taped that to it? What's your prediction with that? Do you have a prediction?
 I have a prediction that it might be really cold.
 [Voiceover] And that's going to tell you that? But have you weighed yours yet?
 [Voiceover] No.
 And it's going to turn to ice.
 [Voiceover] So, but should you keep that thermometer on it while you weigh it or do you think it'll change how much it weighs?
 I think it will actually change how much it weighs.
 [Voiceover] Can you explain your thinking.
 Because, because the thermometer is heavy too and it would change how much...
 One pound.
 ...it was so we should probably get the thermometer.
 One pound.
 So we can, so we can, so we can weigh it and then we can put it back on.
 My hypothesis is it's going to be 20 degrees.
 My hypothesis is this is going to change it because it's only one pound.
 [Voiceover] Oh, so what are you going to do to test that?
 Weigh it.
 [Voiceover] Okay.
 Put it here, put it here.
 [Voiceover] Oh, are you guys discussing? What are you guys discussing?
 Where we are going to put our balloons.
 [Voiceover] So first talk to me about your balloon. Why did you choose this color?
 Because it was a light color and we think it might melt faster.
 We will think it will melt slower. We think it will melt slower.
 [Voiceover] Why?
 Because.
 Because it's a light color.
 The sun is attracted to the dark colors so that's why we picked pink.
 [Voiceover] So what are you doing right now?
 Doing a hypothesis.
 [Voiceover] Oh, can you explain what's your hypothesis, Teagan?
 It will be warm because we're going to put it next to the heater.
 That's what I was going to say too.
 [Voiceover] And so what's your hypothesis? How will that change the balloon?
 Because maybe you said we're going to put it in the freezer and then when we take it out we'll put it in the heater and we think it'll melt faster.
 [Voiceover] Okay.
 What about us?
 It's almost in the middle, take out one more.
 [Voiceover] Now I'm going to count.
 [Voiceover] What were you guys just doing down there?
 [Voiceover] She was thinking about the weight.
 [Voiceover] What does that mean?
 Like in the middle.
 [Voiceover] Okay, so how will you figure out how much it weighs?
 We need to take this out and we'll count them and then we'll write it on the paper.
 [Voiceover] 32, 32.
 12, 13, 14.
 [Voiceover] Brayden? Brayden?
 Hi.
 [Voiceover] Hayden?
 [Voiceover] Is there any group that's measuring the length of their's?
 28, 29, 30, 31, 32,
 Almost there. 43, 44, 45, 46, 47. It's there, it's there.
 [Voiceover] What does that mean?
 So it means that they weigh the same thing.
 Okay.
 Now we have to count them.
 Let's let Will only do it.
 Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11,
 64, 64.
 [Voiceover] Teagan, be working in your group.
 23, 24, 25.
 I measured my balloon by using tiles, like tiles when I measured it. Tiles. What should we do now, Mrs. T? My balloon is filled with matter.
 [Voiceover] Why do you say that?
 Because everything is matter. Well, there's water inside the balloon so it's like solid and liquid.
 [Voiceover] Why is it solid and liquid? What were you saying? What were you saying? No, keep explaining your thinking.
 [Voiceover] I have a question.
 [Voiceover] One second.
 Water is a liquid and pushes on the weight.
 [Voiceover] Oh, so is that kind of tying in to your hypothesis?
 Light turns into water, solids and liquids.
 My hypothesis is, my hypothesis is if we like, if we... If we lose the like point it will not melt faster.
 [Voiceover] Why?
 It's a darker color.
 And when you think about it, dark colors will melt faster on their own.
 Is that cubes, the (mumbles) has the cubes?
 [Voiceover] No, that's the weight. Pass it on. Have you all measured yours yet?
 [Voiceover] Yes.
 [Voiceover] How'd you measure it?
 With the tape thingy.
 [Voiceover] Would you mind showing me what you decide to do?
 My hypothesis is that it will melt faster because we're putting it by the sun.
 [Voiceover] Did you make a hypothesis by the length of it? No?
 Ours was six and a half inches.
 [Voiceover] How do you know?
 Because we measured it with the measuring tape.
 [Voiceover] Can you show me how you did it? Oh, there's an extra one Will.
 Did you say not to touch the balloon without the thermometer?
 [Voiceover] Now do we draw a picture of what it looks like right now?
 [Voiceover] These have bigger numbers you know.
 [Voiceover] So what are you thinking there Abigail?
 I'm thinking that not really.
 [Voiceover] But what were you saying there with the bigger numbers? I didn't understand. You held up the number line and you said those have bigger numbers.
 I mean like you can see them very well and you also can tell. 30.
 30?
 30, he should start now.
 [Voiceover] So how big is your balloon?
 We got to start at one.
 [Voiceover] Oh why did you change it Julia, from your first measurement?
 Because we accidentally started from the 30.
 [Voiceover] Oh.
 And now we have it upside down.
 [Voiceover] Okay, you got it? It was, it is, move your finger for me. It is...
 Now let's send this back here.
 Okay, I think we should do my idea for taking that thermometer off.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, I'll hold the thermometer.
 I'm trying to take it off.
 My hypothesis is it's going to be warm, but then not attracted to the light.
 Cold water is in there.
 Because sunlight can only make warmth. Right?
