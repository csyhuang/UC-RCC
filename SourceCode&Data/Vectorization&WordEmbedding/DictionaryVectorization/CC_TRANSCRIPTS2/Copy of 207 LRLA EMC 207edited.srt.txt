 Welcome to Mrs. Dunford's first grade classroom. Here you see a Word-Work center, where students are working to build words. All around the room, student work is proudly displayed along with anchor charts to anchor student learning. At Computer Center, students are working on differentiated computer programs based on needs. At Listening Center, students listen to stories to build their fluency. Above them is our Word Wall, which displays our sight words. Our Center Chart. The students are working on the Smart Board to integrate technology into reading. Here we have students at Read To Someone, where they are enjoying reading books to each other. Around the back of our room, books are separated into book bins for genres and they have their book boxes. At Read To Self area, students read independently and enjoy reading in our tent. In the back, we have our marble jar for compliments and our How Was Your Day board, along with our Helper Chart. And last we have My Table, where I work with small groups based on needs. Thank you for joining our classroom.

 [Mrs. Dunford] You've got to finish it, Dylan. You're doing a great job.
 [Blonde Woman] There you go, her work. (background chatter)
 Why is this a biography?
 [Little Boy] Because it tells by a... girl and she's writing books. And she was reading books and writing.
 You're right, it's a biography. A biography is a story about a real person and that's exactly what she was. Can you read me one of these?
 "When Amy was little, she liked to read."
 [Mrs. Dunford] Good. And why does that belong in Childhood?
 Because she was doing it as a child.
 [Mrs. Dunford] She was doing it when she was little. You're right. You're exactly right. Now, who's going to fill in the ideas? Who knows where did she get her ideas from? Do you know where she got her ideas from?
 [Little Girl] From the books.
 From the books. Well, actually, where did she get the ideas for the books? Can you read this part for me?
 "Amy liked [Inaudible] about a lot of books. Things people say help Amy."
 What helps Amy?
 "Things people say."
 Things people say. So where does she get her ideas from?
 People.
 People and the things that they tell her, right? Things that they say. Can you write that in the Ideas part?
 Yes.
 Good job. The things that people say are what help her and give her ideas. Houston, can you help her direct that? That would be great. You guys are doing a fantastic job. (background chatter)
 [Houston] Oh, you wrote the wrong stuff. You're writing on the wrong side. You're writing on the wrong side. (background chatter)
 She's writing that whole section. Why? Can someone tell me why she's writing that in Childhood? Clint, do you know? Why is she writing that in Childhood? Why is she writing that Joseph did things with his Grandpa in Childhood?
 [Clint] Because he used to watch him play guitar and go in the woods with him and talk nice--
 Did he do that when he was an adult or when he was a child?
 Child.
 Right, so is that why it would go in Childhood?
 Yes.
 Jeffrey, can you tell me what is this story about?
 [Jeffrey] It tells real stuff.
 [Mrs. Dunford] It tells real stuff about what?
 Joseph Burcheck.
 Joseph Burcheck, yep. That's what it does. It tells real things about him. You guys are doing great. Keep up the good work.
