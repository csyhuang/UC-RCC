 ...confusing for people to understand, but we're looking at density today. We're looking at how much stuff is packed in a certain area. So, if you flip over to the back of your paper, you've got that little box at the top. And it tells you one of the reasons some of the objects float while the other objects sank is because of their density. If you could write down the definition of density in your box, I would appreciate that. The amount of matter, when I say stuff, like when we were learning about solids, liquids and gases at the beginning of the year, stuff is matter. So the amount of matter that's in a certain area is an object's density. It's not its mass, it's its density. So the marble is more dense than the Styrofoam ball. Okay? So now that we know the word 'density,' we're going to start using the word 'density' for the next part. (Classroom chatter) The amount of stuff packed in a certain area, or the amount of matter. The marble had more matter in that small area than the Styrofoam ball. The Styrofoam ball is spread out and have all those air holes, making that matter more spread out, less dense. Krayla? (Student asking question) Yes, right now. Okay? All right. So that was simple.
