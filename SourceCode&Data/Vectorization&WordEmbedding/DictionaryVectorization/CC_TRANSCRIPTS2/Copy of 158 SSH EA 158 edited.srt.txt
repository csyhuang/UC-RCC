 [Boy in gray] I think we need the policeman, because he's the only one with a weapon. He's the only one with a weapon though.
 [Student in red] What if he goes crazy? He's the only one with a gun.
 [Boy in gray] Exactly, that's a good thing, though.
 [Teacher] Wait a sec, why is that a good thing?
 [Girl in floral] Are you saying he'd shoot us?
 [Boy in gray] I didn't say it's a good thing if someone could shoot us.
 [Teacher] No, I didn't say that. You said it's a good thing. Explain why you think it's a good thing.
 [Boy in gray] It's a good thing  because we could stock the food, Drake.
 [Teacher] OK, so he said two things.
 [Student in floral] But he might  shoot us because we might be starving and he might start to shoot us. (Heavy Background Chatter)
 [Boy in orange] We could take him,  he wouldn't shoot us.
 [Teacher] Where you at, Riley, it looks like you're sweating.
 [Riley] I'm trying to think between you two.
 [Teacher] So you write down what you said you'd do, and you worry about everybody here. Who do you think is the most important? Eileen says the policeman, does everybody agree with that or not?
 [Girl in gray] Yeah.
 [Boy in orange] Why?
 [Teacher] (Listens to Eileen) Because  if someone gets hurt--(Background Chatter) He can respond to medical stuff? yeah, they're First Responders. It's a good idea. Anybody else? Can you write down reasons why you should keep somebody? Would anybody that you know that works here already? That's good, he's too old, his life would be long. So, the old sir will be able to be productive to society. Think about that. Anything else about the male professor that you maybe thought about?
 [Background Chatter] [Teacher] --in support of communism. Do you want that in your society or not?
 [Girl in gray] No.
 [Teacher] Why not?
 [Girl in gray] Because-- (Background Chatter)
 [Teacher] Okay, so freedoms  are important to you.
 [Loudspeaker] Mr. Malls?
 [Teacher] Yes, ma'am?
 [Loudspeaker] Send Kyle to the office for a minute, please?
 [Teacher] He's in Miss Crane's room, right now.
 [Loudspeaker] What core are y'all in? Because I told Mr. Wayward where he was supposed to be, and he said he was with you.
 [Teacher] Uh, he, we're actually in 2nd, he's with Miss Crane.
 [Loudspeaker] All right, thank you.
 [Teacher] OK, you can resume. Folks, we're about, I don't know,
 [Girl in gray] Hey, why should we keep the male professor?
 [Teacher] What's the issue you have?
 (Heavy Background Chatter)
 [Teacher] OK, now this is just a question, guys, If someone's not fit, does that mean they have no potential to be helpful to society?
 [Girlin yellow] Nah, they could be really smart.
 [Teacher] OK, they could be really smart. (Background Chatter)
 [Boy in gray] But she's nine--
 [Teacher] She's nine? (Background Chatter) 
 [Teacher] She's nine, so,  are you looking for right now or are you looking for the long run?
 [Boy in crimson] We're talking  about the long run.
 [Teacher] The long run, so you got time. So just consider all aspects, just because maybe just because she has... does she have anything to offer? Let the group decide, it sounds like some people are really for and some maybe are against it. (Background Chatter)
 [Student in crimson] If you want a male farmer, say aye.
 [Male Students] Aye.
 [Boy in crimson] If you want the male professional, say aye.
 [Only boy in crimson] Aye. (Laughter)
 [Boy in crimson] If you want the female  scientist, say aye.
 [Boy in Green, Girl in floral] Aye. [Boy in crimson] If you want the  male preacher, say aye. [Girl in floral, Boy in gray] Aye.
 [Boy in crimson] Definitely female nurse.
 [Gir in yellow] We already have a nurse.
 [Boy in green] We already have a nurse!
 [Boy in crimson] Who cares?
 [Student in gray] I do.
 [Boy in crimson] In case he dies-- (Background Chatter)
 [Girl in yellow] But the female med student's only in second year, she hasn't even been to the hospital.
 [Boy in crimson] It might go for four years.
 [Girl in yellow] Exactly.
 [Boy in crimson] We got the scientist and the nurse to help her.
 [Boy in green] Plus she'd be off breeding.
 [Girl in yellow] Excuse me?
 [Boy in green] No offence. (Background Chatter)
 [Girl in floral] You know we only got like thirty minutes.
 [Girl in yellow] We only have fifteen, so...
 [Teacher] Hey, we're about 5 or 10 more minutes, and then I'm gonna stop you in groups and you'll listen. If you have not managed to already make your decisions, here's the key point, here's the key point... Still got a group talking, you need to listen. About five or ten more minutes, you need to come down to your five, you need to have the reasons why you chose the five, and we're gonna share those, and reasons why you did not choose the five you didn't choose. Keep in mind, Edna, keep in mind that five are going with you to start this new civilization that's gonna hopefully flourish, and I hope you're all taking people with, uh, that you know will make it. But there's also, you gotta keep in mind, there's five people you're leaving behind, that most likely is not gonna make it. But you, you're concentrating on who you need to start this new productive society, OK? OK, start closing up in the next five or ten minutes, about who you're choosing, who you're not choosing. Those radiation levels are getting high, very high. Over here especially.
 [Girl in floral] I know, really!
 [Boy in crimson] I kinda changed  my mind about that. Because she's cute. (Background Chatter)
 [Boy in crimson] You can't change times and down.
 [Girl in floral] I'm agreeing with that.
 [Boy in crimson] Say aye again,  if you want-- (Background Chatter).
 [Most students] Aye.
 [Boy in crimson] Finally...
 [Boy in white] They wanna take  cripple girl and I'm saying...
 [Student] He's still overruled.
 [Teacher] I posed this question  just a minute ago. So, this is, so we can look at mass... So we can look at it two ways, one you're looking at: "She can't do anything, she's gonna be hard to keep, because someone will have to do it, second way of looking at it, she... And she doesn't have her doctor. Uh, is that true? Once she had a doctor. (Background Chatter)
 [Teacher] OK, and then what else? (Background Chatter)
 [Teacher] Have you ever heard anything about...
 [Students] Yup. (Background Chatter)
 [Teacher] So what if this person could be maybe a scientist or a...
 [Boy in white] It didn't say that.
 [Teacher] But again you're not saying that she is... (Background Chatter)
 [Teacher] ...you can combine that. OK, continue on. You need to start choosing, maybe 3 or 4 of your 5. And why you're gonna take or why you're not gonna take 'em. (Heavy Background Chatter)
 [Girl in floral] OK, male professor, too old. (Students disagreeing or agreeing at once)
 [Girl in floral] He's too old!
 (Background Chatter)
 [Teacher] Five minutes! I'm giving you five minutes! Start making decisions. (Background Chatter)
 [Boy in white] But why do we need a  policeman if we got a lot of money? (Background Chatter)
 [Teacher] Hey, I wanna share some of the tips that some of you were talking about... And one person said, "well, she has the potential to become "any of these things here, she has "the potential to be any of those," so it might something to consider. (Background Chatter)
 [Student in white] We need extra little kids, and she won't help us with no extra little kids. (Heavy Background Chatter)
 [Teacher] Somebody's ready to go, just about, so you need to make sure you get your five choices. (Heavy Background Chatter)
