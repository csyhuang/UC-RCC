 [Teacher] Start using the principles of design, okay? So you look at the packet for the principles of design. With the principles of design, you gonna be telling me what you see in the work of art. So instead of shapes, you may be telling me, what's something you see in your work of art. You've got "Gold Is Where You Find It." What's one thing you see in the work of art?
 [Studen] Gold.
 [Teacher] You see gold, what else do you see?
 [Student] The miner.
 [Teacher] Miner, and what is the miner doing?
 [Student] Drilling.
 [Teacher] Drilling, okay, so those would be all stuff that you see in the work of art. So go ahead and start on the second part with analysis, if you're ready to start on that. (Background Chatter)
 [Teacher] Alright, are we doin' alright here?
 [Student] Yeah, we don't get how was the work created.
 [Teacher] Okay, you may have actually answered that when you were up here. If you look at the packet right here, and the title of the work of art is "The Sky Pond." read the rest for me? Who it was who created it?
 [Student] Kauvar--
 [Teacher] Kauvar--yeah, close enough.
 [Student] Smith--
 [Teacher] Smith.
[Student] --Born: Cape--Ugh, this is hard.
 [Teacher] If you can't pronounce it, just do the best you can.
 [Student] Giradeau, Missouri-- Missouri, 1893. Died: Denver, Colorado, 1977. Oil on canvas.
 [Teacher] Uh! What did you say?
 [Student] Oil on canvas.
 [Teacher] Is how it was created and it was about, this size right here, okay? So that tells you how the work of art was created. Later on, you're gonna look at why the work of art was created, and what purpose it served. (Background Chatter)
 [Teacher] Yes?
 [Student A] What do I say, how--
 [Student B] I know what we do! It says, if they draw it in three-dimensional--
 [Teacher] Okay.
 [Student B] And they take some kind of colored pencil, or painting, and then sketch it like you do, and then they go from dark to light.
 [Teacher] Yeah.
 [Student B] And, then they make the texture from, the sun is over here, and there's a little bit of shade because, this would be covering all this. There would be a shade right here. So it's over here, it would be lighting everything on this side of the tree,
 [Teacher] Yeah.
 [Student B] and this side of the house, roof, and that side of the house.
 [Teacher] And you've got, are these shapes back here? Or are those somethin' else?
 [Student B] These are shapes.
 [Teacher] Okay, are shapes flat or three-dimensional?
 [Student B] Three-dimensional.
 [Teacher] Shape forms are three-dimensional, alright?
 [Student A] Oh yeah.
 [Student B] Yeah.
 [Student A] So those are forms?
 [Teacher] So those are forms, yeah. But you were right about everything, You were right about the sun, you were right about the texture, the shading, everything, that's really good. So you can tell a little about this on how you think the work was made, and also relate it to playing with your pen on your finger, and also oil on canvas. Continue working, please. (Background Chatter) Alright, so y'all are on analysis now? And what work of art do y'all have? Y'all have got "Subway." Alright, so what are y'all lookin' at in the Subway for analysis so far?
 [Student] It's something, asymmetrical balance.
 [Teacher] It's asymmetrical balance?
 [Student] Yeah.
 [Teacher] There are three types. You've got symmetrical balance, when everything is exactly the same, you've got asymmetrical balance when it's weighted the same. So there's the same amount of weight visually. It's not exactly the same. And then you've got radial symmetry, which is a project we did a little bit earlier. Okay? Good. (Background Chatter)
 [Girl] So, is it saying that shapes, especially right here, these shapes are more rounded versus straight and flat. 'Cause these are more 3-D than these. These kind of have shadows and are free. So, we were saying how that makes the consistence more complex than the simpleness of the, outside factors, I guess?
 [Teacher] Yes, mm-hmm. Good! Keep going. Alright.
 [Girl with Pink Shirt] Would this be water?
 [Teacher] That is possibly water right there. Yes it is. And what part are y'all on? Y'all are on the analysis right now? Okay. And y'all are lookin' at the "Valley Farms" by Rose Dickinson? Okay, cool. So what do y'all have so far for analysis?
 [Girl in Grey T-Shirt] Colors from the scene go together, it can show--
 [Teacher] Could you speak a little louder? Sorry.
 [Girl in Grey T-Shirt] Colors from the scene go together. It can show, a straight web is going along the farm with the bridge in there. A small fire is going on, with smoke coming from the flames. Smoke is coming from the mountains.
 [Teacher] Sounds good, keep going. Alright, let's check in over here. How are y'all doin'?
 [Student] Good.
 [Teacher] Okay, wow, y'all have got a lot for an analysis. (Chuckles) Alright, what else do you have? So y'all are about ready to start on analysis?
 [Student] Yes, sir.
 [Teacher] Okay, so let's look here. Now tell me how all the answers from the description you just made, are related to each other, i.e., how the effects were organized, complement one another, or create harmony or distress. This step can often be the most confusing, because it is very similar to the first, and can easily overlap. A good suggestion is think about all the principles of art: movement, rhythm, variety, portion, emphasis, and balance, and contrast work together, okay? So think about how they work together to create this work of art, and tell me everything you see in the work of art, but not by shape and colors. Alright.
 [Boy in Beige] The shapes and colors of the background create a texture that will--
 [Boy with Jacket] What?
 [Boy in Beige] A texture--
 [Boy with Jacket] What?
 [Boy in Beige] The-- (sighs) The shapes and colors of the background, create a texture that will--
 [Blonde Boy] Like he is actually drilling near a cave.
 [Boy in Beige] Creative.
 [Teacher] Now, would you say, these warm colors or cool colors?
 [Boy in Beige] Warm
 [Blonde Boy] Warm, way warm.
 [Teacher] Warm? Now why would you say they're warm colors?
 [Boy in Beige] 'Cause they're darker.
 [Teacher] They're darker? Okay.
 [Boy wearing Jacket] It shows that the colors of the background...(Background Chatter)
 [Boy in Beige] Yeah.
 [Teacher] Now something else. Does it look like he blends into the background?
 [Boy in Beige] No.
 [Teacher] He doesn't?
 [Blonde Boy] Yeah, uh-huh.
 [Teacher] Okay, so think about that too. If he stood out, he would look like he maybe didn't belong, but it kind of looks like he belongs there. I like what you said, keep working. I'll be back in a minute to check on you. Alright, Guys. Turn around. Alright, what are y'all workin' on now? Analysis?
[Student] Analysis.
 [Teacher] What do y'all have for analysis so far, Patrick?
 [Patrick] I didn't get that. I got one for variety and balances.
 [Teacher] Okay, so something is different from this picture. Can you just read to me what you have so far, please?
 [Patrick] Something's different from this top picture, because the floor is green beneath the room, because it's different, because I thought, I thought the floor's just one color, so that's why it's different.
 [Teacher] Okay, that's good, and it's also different from up here. You could say that there's a contrast. Let's look for the definition of contrast in here. Do you all know what the definition of contrast is, or what contrast is?
 [Boy in Red] Two things are very different from--
 [Boy in Black] I was on balance, I'm on balance now.
 [Teacher] Okay, so contrast is what? One more time, I'm sorry.
 [Boy in Red] Two things that are very different, and have a large contrast.
 [Teacher] Okay, so would you say cool colors and warm colors have a strong contrast?
 [Boy in the Corner] Yeah, because they're bright colors and they give out perspective.
 [Boy in Black] What about the two Cs?
 [Teacher] Okay, two C's, so? Keep going. Alright, what part are y'all on now? Analysis? And y'all have got "The Subway", okay? So, can you read to me what you have, or tell me something that you haven't added, but you were about to?
 [Blonde Boy] Jaymen's adding that.
 [Teacher] Okay.
 [Jaymen] I wanna add, it has radial balance, because you can kinda see where the center print is, and then you can kind of see all these people, all these stuff.
 [Teacher] Okay, now I have a question. Have y'all seen that there's a commercial on a few months ago?
 [Blonde Boy] It's a radio commercial!
 [Jaymen] Yeah!
 [Teacher] The TV, where she's sitting in the train, and she's watching the TV, someone's reading the newspaper and she's watching the TV? And she steps out, and it looks like they may have gotten the idea, from that ad, from this work of art, 'cause there's lots of people on the train car, they're reading newspapers and she steps into the future, by actually reading her's on a Samsung Galaxy or something like that. So that'd be a good connection to popular culture, okay?
 [Blonde Girl] Hello, I was just (Background Chatter)
 [Teacher] Which one we were talkin' about earlier? Okay, sounds good. What's up? Okay. Alright, what ya on? Okay, what added, or what  have y'all gotten to since I was last over here?
 [Girl in gray] We see the ocean behind the mountains, green grass is covering the farmland, and the lines on the mountains are curved, not pointed. The mountains are curved.
 [Teacher] Okay.
 [Girl in gray] The houses are spread apart, the sky is a light green-blue.
 [Teacher] Sounds good, and it sounds like y'all are just about finished with analysis, so are y'all gonna be moving on to interpretation next? Okay.
 [Girl in gray] Yeah.
 [Teacher] Active listening, right hand. Active listening, left hand. Ladies and gentlemen, a lot of people are having really great and meaningful discussions in the groups, but please remember that we are all doing different works of art, studying them, and we're also discussing them together. So that everybody's able to work without yelling across, can we take it down just a notch, a little bit, please? Keep it a little bit lower? I'm not telling you to whisper, and I'm not telling you to stop what you're doing, 'cause your doing a great job. Just let us take it down a notch, please. Keep working, please. Alright, how are y'all doin' over here?
 [Student] We're doing really good.
 [Teacher] Okay, what can you tell me about your analysis on this work of art?
 [Student] It said that for the first question, well, the first thing, we said the artist Douglass Crockwell is using repetit-- well, is  repeating shapes and colors to create a visual image of the painting. And right now, we're writing, how classes are organized.
 [Girl in Plaid] And how it's saying what we introduced for description.
 [Teacher] Okay, now, with "Paper Workers", Now let's look at the workers. The workers, do they look like they stand out from the industry and from the industrial aspects of this work of art?
 [Girl in Green] No.
 [Teacher] They kind of look like they blend in. So could they actually be considered to be parts of the machinery?
 [Girl in Green] Mhmm.
 [Teacher] Okay, so that's something you may wanna think about when you're working on analysis, or when you switch over to interpretation in just a little bit. Can you go touch the keyboard to bring the Smart Board back on, please? Alright, what are y'all workin' on now?
 [Boy in jacket] I don't know.
 [Teacher] You don't know, okay. You don't know what principles you've covered, or you don't know what aspect of the painting you're working on right now?
 [Boy in beige] We're working on analysts, and so far we've covered how the miner and the vat ground relate to each other. We covered what colors they have and how they can relate. We're about to work on shapes. Shapes are in there.
 [Teacher] So let's think about texture, some.
 [Boy with beige] Yeah, we are.
 [Teacher] Look at the definitions, okay. And let's look at... I wouldn't look at space or balance, variety, and you may wanna look at the definitions of proportion, okay?
 [Blonde Girl] Okay, we are completely, totally, and absolutely, confused of analysis.
 [Girl in Black] I'm not! You're just--
 [Teacher] Analysis, okay.
 [Girl in Black] I'm not!
 [Blonde Girl] I'm completely finished.
 [Girl in Black] She's going all haywire.
 [Teacher] Okay, what's wrong with analysis here?
 [Blonde Girl] I don't know.
 [Girl in Black] Nothing!
 [Girl in Black] Nothing's wrong with the analysis.
 [Teacher] Nothing's wrong with analysis?
 [Girl in Black] She's going haywire.
 [Blonde Girl] I do not understand what art is.
 [Teacher] Active listening, right hand please. Active listening, left hand. Table four, please. Ladies and gentlemen, when we stopped a moment ago, because we had gotten too loud, let's take it down to a whisper now. That way everybody can hear themselves without getting too loud. So right now, let's take it to a whisper, for our discussions, please. Alright, with analysis what you're doing is you're looking at the principles of design. Don't worry about balance. Let's flip to the beginning. Now, let's look at texture. Do you have a texture in here?
 [Girl in black] Yeah.
 [Teacher] And what kind of texture do you have?
 [Girl in black] Well it's really bumpy, but some of it is smoother, like a snow.
 [Teacher] Okay, so that's what you could talk about in the analysis. Also in the analysis, with balance: is it asymmetrical, symmetrical, or radial? Now, symmetrical is when things are the same on both sides. Radial is when it's radiating out from a point, like a rim or a pizza. Is it either one of those? So, I'd look a little bit at asymmetrical balance, and then variety. I look at the definition, and then determine what variety you see in here, and after that, go ahead and move over to interpretation, okay? That way, if you're being frustrated, you don't have to get bogged down and worry about it, you can move to the next step. You might find that easier, okay? Keep going, thanks. Alright, so y'all are on interpretation now?
 [Student] Yep.
 [Teacher] Okay, what are y'all about to do for interpretation? Can someone read me the interpretation part?
 [Student] Basically, how does the painting make you feel? What does it make you think of? Don't say you think a painting sucks, artwork sucks. That said, that goes in the next step. What do you think, What do you think the artist is trying to communicate to you as a viewer?
 [Teacher] Okay, so let's bring the painting back over here so you can see it while you're working on the questions, and think about telling me a story, or what's going on. Now, does this look like you're in a cafeteria?
 [Students] No.
 [Teacher] Does it look like you're in a school?
 [Girl] Oh yeah.
 [Boy] No.
 [Boy] It looks like a barber shop.
 [Teacher] Okay, and what does it look like is going on in the barber shop?
 [Boy] He's shaving, cutting someone's hair.
 [Teacher] Now what about over here?
 [Boy] These guys are probably waiting for their turn.
 [Teacher] Okay, that's what you need to tell me in interpretation. What all is going on, or everything the artist had within the work of art that tells a story. We're talking about the story that's created in the work of art. Alright, what part are y'all on, interpretation?
 [Blonde Girl] Yeah.
 [Teacher] Okay, so...
 [Blonde Girl] It kind of makes me feel like...
 [Blonde Boy] It makes me feel sad.
 [Blonde Girl] It was, when I think of it before, and it really doesn't make me feel sad. I'm not really sure how it makes me feel, but I kind of think that maybe he was trying to say, it went from-- 'cause this is kind of simple.
 [Teacher] Okay.
 [Blonde Girl] And I keep going back to the simple and complex for some reason. But, I think he was trying to say that maybe things were simpler, and it kind of got more modern.
 [Teacher] I like that, I like that. And also, one thing that this makes me think of, is earlier this year, we studied the artist Jacob Lawrence, and one of his was a work of art of a guy on a train, controlling that with only industry in the background. With the big cog or wheel here, it kind of looks like a train over here, with industry in the background. But I like what you're saying about the calmer times, and the more difficult times, and I think that would be a great thing to have in your interpretation.
 [Blonde Boy] It doesn't look like a train, though.
 [Teacher] Yeah. (Chuckles) Alright, how are y'all doing? Y'all doin' alright? Hey, what part are y'all workin' on now? Y'all got "Valley Farm?"
 [Girl in Pink] Yeah.
 [Girl in Grey] Yeah.
 [Girl in Pink] Interpretation.
 [Teacher] Okay, what do y'all have so far for interpretation?
 [Girl in Pink] This painting makes us feel bright, but kind of boring. The smoke from the mountains make us wonder who is making it. We also wonder, "Why is there a fire with nobody there?"
 [Teacher] Okay, sounds good. Ah, can you put your stool back up on two legs? One more time? Thanks. Alright, what are y'all on right now? Analysis, and y'all have moved on to interpretation?
 [Student] Mhmm.
 [Teacher] Sounds good. Active listening, right hand. Active listening, left hand. Right in here, we have about seven minutes left. This should give enough time for most everybody to finish their interpretation, and start on their judgment today. After you get finished with your interpretation, one thing I would like you to focus on, is why you think the work of art was created. Think about the time period, in which it was created, and why the artists were creating works of art. Think about your work of art particularly, and you'll be able to have a space on your paper to answer that, so continue working on what you're working on. We have about seven minutes. Next time you come in, what we're gonna be doing is we're gonna be working on presenting. So, those groups that have enjoyed this, will be able to look at the Smithsonian packet, find their information, add that to what they've been doing today, and then present on their findings regarding what they thought about the work of art along with what the historians thought about--
