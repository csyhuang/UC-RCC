 [Teacher] Good, right? So I was telling you that these are the piece of bread and these were a piece of bread and I could have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on white bread, or I can have a peanut butter and jelly on wheat bread. We're going to keep the white bread for right now. Pop push. Then this made me laugh. Think about this as the heel of the bread.
 [Student 1] I don't get it. (Teacher laughing)
 [Teacher] I'm glad to know that you're like "I don't get it." There's a piece of bread and there's a heel of the bread--
 [Students] Oh! (Teacher laughing)
 [Student 2] The butt of the bread?
 Yeah! Oh, that's why! Because you call it the "butt of the bread". Oh! But it's the heel of the bread. Ok so not so funny. (Students laughing)
 [Teacher] So we have pop push, step as our ingredient and then as our butt of the bread, good flap step dig, right? So today we're going to do pop push, step, good flap, step dig as a review on the right and on the left. And then we're going to do pop push, flap, we're going to add another ingredient, flap step dig. Okay? Flap step dig. Now remember--this-- is important, why?
 [Students] It's the ingredient.
 [Teeacher] barely comes up, think about it.
 [Student 3] Good flap because when you step flap means that it's two sounds to (mumbles).
 [Teacher] Boo ya! Remember it's two sounds and that's why you say "Good flap" and to get it up, she said, real high. Alright, everybody up, (claps her hands) spread out. Pop push. Pop push again is spank, kick. It's exactly what we did as warm up the one across the board. Put your right heel out. I need a good pop push. Ready and (shoes tapping). I need a good step. (shoes tapping) As we step, what do we do? What happens to the body?
 [Students] We swing right.
 [Teacher] We sure did, pick up that foot. Good flap, (shoes tapping) step dig. (shoes tapping) Alright, do it one more time. Let's do an echo. Let me do it. I'll do pop push, step, you do
 [Students] Pop push, step.

 [Teacher] Right, right. And I go. (Teacher's shoes tapping) (Students' shoes tapping) Okay, I go. (Teacher's shoes tapping) (Students' shoes tapping)
[Teacher] Better. (teacher' shoes tapping and then the students')
 [Teacher] Ok by now our muscle memory is either going "I got it! I've worked it out" or "I don't got it" and we need to correct it before it becomes muscle memory. So here's what I want you to do. Say "Pop push step".
 [Students] Pop push step.

 [Student] Not really.
 [Teacher] Yeah you do. (laughs)
 [Student] No.
 [Teacher] Sure you do. Ok well I got it wrong. You don't body roll but you will. You rock, you rock, knee right. (Background Chatter) No? (Giggles) Come on, right hand. Flap, step, dig.

Six, ready, and pop push step. Good flap step dig. Almost, left foot. Pop push step Left foot, good flap step dig. Okay, let me tell you why. You're doing a shuffle. We do pop push, step, lift your foot up, good flap step dig, on left foot. Pop push step. Good flap, step dig. These were all two things. Okay, body roll. Do a body roll. Now you can't do a body roll back here. (Laughs) Hold my hand. Here we go. Pop push. Step. Shift it over. Good, flap step dig, right here. Good flap step dig. Did you get all this? Again the right foot. Flex your toes. Good flap step dig. Good flap step dig. (Background Chatter) bring it in. Oh, no you gotta body roll! Bring it in. Good flap step dig. That's better. And since the problem is your weight distribution it's back here and it's hard to do it like this. So you gotta do like this. Yeah? Okay. Alright, let me see the middle group. Middle group! Right foot out. Ready, oh sorry, I got all excited. You were ready. Six, ready, and pop push step. Yes, okay. Let's go pop push step, hold for a second, good flap step dig. Ready? Right foot.

Pop push step, pick up that foot, good flap step dig. Good flap step dig. Left foot, good flap, come on baby.

 [Teacher] Let me see the next move.
 [Teacher] In the shower? (Students laughing) Be careful you might slip. That's a hazard, always safety first. Yes? Okay, Andra?
 [Andra] In Walmart.
 [Teacher] In Walmart, really?
 [Student] Love it!
 [Teacher] Okay.
 [Student] I do mines in Kroger. (Laughing)
 [Teacher] Do you find--okay.
 [Student 4] I do mines in the kitchen.
 You do yours in the kitchen. Does your mom yell at you? [Student] No.
[Teacher] Be careful.
 [Jasline] Like when you sit down on the desk in class and you just sit there, all year.
 [Teacher] Okay so Jasline, do your teachers get on to you when you practice in class?
 [Jasline] No cause I'm quiet.
 [Teacher] Because you're quiet. (Students Laughing)
 [Teacher] Well number one, I'm super proud of you for practicing everywhere. And do you find that you do it all the time? In the store, in the school. So it's not just something that you're going to do in class. You see this? And what you're going to find is odd a lot of former students come back and they go: "Oh, well I continue to do this "and I'm not even taking tapping. "I wish I could go find and tap more." Okay when that's gonna happen, because it is going to happen to you, it's like a bug, it's like a virus, you just get all excited and all that. Go to Youtube for me, and on Youtube, there are lots of how-to videos. Do you know you could look up how to do this time-step on the Youtube video? Now is it going to be your standard buck and wing arc, buck times step?
 [Students] No.
 [Teacher] No, it may not be because remember the sandwiches it may be a different kind of sandwich, a different kind of time-step. So, if you're ever curious and you want to continue this through like, because you're gonna. Do you have to have tap shoes by the way?
 [Students] No.
 [Teacher] No. What do you have to have?
 [Students] Hard floor.
 [Teacher] Tammy, sit up for me. You what?
 [Student] A shoe with a hard bottom.
 [Teacher] Yeah. Look, I'm in heels right? That's all you have to do. Now one of the things that I wanted to point out to you as we're about to evaluate yourselves and evaluate your peers, I want you to look at weight distribution. Say "weight distribution".
 [Students] Weight distribution.
 [Teacher] What is weight distribution?
 [Jasline] Can I use an example?
 [Teacher] Yes.
 [Jasline] Like when we're doing the good flap ball change, you have to move your body up for the good flap and you move it back down for the step-beat.
 [Teacher] Okay, so great, Jasline said that you have to move your body forward on the good flap and then back, and sit it back down, for the step dig. Anybody had something to add?
 [Student] Shift your weight.
 [Teacher] Yes, you're right you shift your weight which way?
 [Student] Opposite of which way you switch your knee.
 [Teacher] Oh, opposite of which way of whatever foot I'm using because if I have this foot up I've got... (show tapping) right? Does my body have to turn?
 [Students] No.
 [Teacher] No, but it kind of does, don't it? Got some hip action going on right here. (Students laughing) Alright anybody else see any weight distribution? (shoes tapping)
 [Student] We can do the sink, you're kind of down a little bit.
 [Teacher] Okay, I was going to say, I was trying to get to you. The weight distribution doesn't necessarily have to go right to left, right? Or front to back. It can go, up and down. What is the reason we want out weight distribution kind of lowered?
 [Student] So we can move.
 [Teacher] Move.
 [Student] To have (Background Chatter)
 [Teacher] to have a better base for what?
 [Students] (Background Chatter)
 [Teacher] Okay so we can keep the rhythm. Because if the rate of speed, speeds up then our rhythm has to stay with it, right? Tell me how different, how important is weight distribution as opposed to females and males? Anybody know the difference? We covered this one. Where's the woman's center of gravity?
 [Student] In her glut. (Students laughing)
 [Teacher] You are absolutely correct. In her glut, right through here and that's where women tend to put on weight right gravity centers, her center of gravity around her belly, the baby belly and around...
 [Studnet 10] Idk.
 [Teacher] Oh Idk, alright you don't know? So where is the men's center of gravity? Where do they tend to...
 [Students] Torso.
 [Teacher] Torso. Right, their diaphragm and that's where we get that spare tire from. A man's center of gravity, and this is what it means, are we here? There we are. Here's what it means. As the woman's center of gravity if your body can be forward and your bottom is still back and you're fine and dandy. A man, if this is him, he's going forward. He's going to fall. He's not going to be able to keep his weight. So it makes a difference in your body posture and your weight distribution. Yes? Let's look really quickly... Oh, how many of you have taught your significant adult? You taught a significant adult and you taught the time-step. What did you see, anybody?
 [Student] Sometimes your parents got the rhythm (Background Chatter) has lost. If your parents are a little older than most average parents, let's say like 40s to 50s.
 [Teacher] Good, good.
 [Jasline] Their rhythm has kind lost it. It takes a longer time to teach them. They have to be concentrated because they're like "Uh uh do that again, do that again!".
 [Teacher] Okay, Jasline, that is awesome I'm going to put you on hold for a minute because I have heard from you several times. Let me hear from somebody new. Come on, Audrey.
 [Audrey] I found that I really got my skills from my mom. My fast-learning skills.
 [Teacher] You got your fast learning skills from your mom, awesome!
 [Audrey] She learned real fast.
 [Teacher] She picked it up good. Alright who else?
 [Student] Instead of teaching a significant adult I taught my whole family to tap.
 [Teacher] You taught your whole family? Rock on!
 [Student] I found out that my youngest brother learned faster than even my mother.
 [Teacher] So why do you think your youngest brother learned faster than your mom?
 [Student 12] I think she slowed down over the years.
 [Teacher] Over the years, okay. Okay let me hear from somebody up here because I haven't heard anything from up here.
 [Student] While I was teaching my mama, my daddy got excited and he wanted to,  so I taught both of them and they decided upon themselves who was going to learn it the quickest and--
 [Teacher] Right, competition--
 [Student] And my mama, she actually learned it faster but although it took my daddy more time, once he got it, he could do it over and over again. He actually got pretty good, like speed-wise.
 [Teacher] See? Tap is for all ages guys. It'll keep you in good health, it's something fun, it'll keep you active. You don't have to learn a certain... you know we learned a step and I hate to teach a step but that's the beautiful thing about tapping, it's you can come up with all kinds of stuff. And you know-- Hey, look here,  I want you to hear. How many of you like step, step dancing? Oh, all around the room. Oh, we love the step dancing right? Step and tap are similar, do you see the correlations? You're making rhythms, there are prescribed movements. So we need to really think about the ways that they intersect and it may become the next big thing. You just never know. You might have tap groups all around. Let's go ahead and do some peer evaluation real quick. I want you to watch the screen. Now what I want you to watch--
