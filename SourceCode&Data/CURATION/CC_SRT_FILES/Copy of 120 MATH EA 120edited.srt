1
00:00:00,055 --> 00:00:12,421
(background chatter)

2
00:00:12,421 --> 00:00:13,083
- [Teacher] Okay, so,

3
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:14,428
write your conjectures down.

4
00:00:14,428 --> 00:00:17,212
Denominators are repeating.

5
00:00:17,212 --> 00:00:22,279
Actually, let's put
this one on number four.

6
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:23,621
Put it on number four.

7
00:00:23,621 --> 00:00:28,802
(background chatter)

8
00:00:28,802 --> 00:00:31,109
- We got any even number

9
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:32,691
that had any odd number.

10
00:00:32,691 --> 00:00:37,162
(background chatter)

11
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:39,404
- [Teacher] Okay, so if it's an odd number

12
00:00:39,404 --> 00:00:41,715
in the denominator, it's repeating.

13
00:00:41,715 --> 00:00:44,445
If it's got an even
number in the denominator?

14
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:46,961
(background chatter)

15
00:00:46,961 --> 00:00:48,733
Oh, okay, so you want to add to it

16
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:50,258
not just say it's even.

17
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,522
If it's odd over even --

18
00:00:52,522 --> 00:00:53,902
- It's terminating,

19
00:00:53,902 --> 00:00:55,052
- [Teacher] It's terminating.

20
00:00:55,052 --> 00:00:57,668
and what if it's even over even?

21
00:00:57,668 --> 00:01:00,624
- Even over even?

22
00:01:00,624 --> 00:01:02,026
Two over six.

23
00:01:02,026 --> 00:01:03,575
It would one be one over three

24
00:01:03,575 --> 00:01:05,313
You'd have to simplify it.

25
00:01:05,313 --> 00:01:07,301
- [Teacher] Okay, you'd
have to simplify it,

26
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:09,989
and so what would happen
when you simplified

27
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:11,718
2/6 to 1/3?

28
00:01:11,718 --> 00:01:13,039
- It would be repeating.

29
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:13,961
- [Teacher] It would be repeating,

30
00:01:13,961 --> 00:01:15,328
so maybe you're on to something.

31
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:16,662
Might want to record that.

32
00:01:16,662 --> 00:01:17,927
Let's check.

33
00:01:17,927 --> 00:01:18,807
That's good.

34
00:01:18,807 --> 00:01:21,821
I haven't heard that one before, guys.

35
00:01:21,821 --> 00:01:25,081
All right, let me here
some of your conjectures.

36
00:01:25,081 --> 00:01:27,583
This group, we're going
with their conjecture.

37
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:29,061
What's your conjecture guys?

38
00:01:29,061 --> 00:01:33,169
- [Group] That all odd
denominator fractions will repeat.

39
00:01:33,169 --> 00:01:35,500
- All right, here's the conjecture.

40
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,150
All odd numbers in the denominator

41
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,362
will be repeating decimals.

42
00:01:42,362 --> 00:01:43,950
Anybody want to add to it?

43
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,094
Take away from it?

44
00:01:45,094 --> 00:01:46,536
Change it?

45
00:01:46,536 --> 00:01:48,434
All right, what we got here, over here?

46
00:01:48,434 --> 00:01:50,054
- That's false because point two five

47
00:01:50,054 --> 00:01:51,297
goes into 100

48
00:01:51,297 --> 00:01:52,776
4 times.
- [Teacher] Okay, hold on.

49
00:01:52,776 --> 00:01:53,661
- [Teacher] I'm confused.

50
00:01:53,661 --> 00:01:54,846
Point two five.

51
00:01:54,846 --> 00:01:57,091
What is point two five
represented as a fraction?

52
00:01:57,091 --> 00:01:58,680
- [Students] 1/4.

53
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,549
- 1/4,

54
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,606
and they said all odd
numbers are repeating.

55
00:02:03,606 --> 00:02:05,828
(background chatter)

56
00:02:05,828 --> 00:02:07,868
So far it works.

57
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:09,217
- [Student in Camo] Well then 1/5.

58
00:02:09,217 --> 00:02:10,679
- All right, let's try 1/5.

59
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:11,498
Well hold on then.

60
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:12,506
Let's get all the conjectures

61
00:02:12,506 --> 00:02:13,597
before we start trying them out.

62
00:02:13,597 --> 00:02:15,431
I do love the action

63
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:16,715
that you want to make up

64
00:02:16,715 --> 00:02:18,172
your own fractions and try it

65
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:20,449
'cause I don't think it's safe just to

66
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:21,974
take it at a glance.

67
00:02:21,974 --> 00:02:23,315
All right, Dylan, what did y'all's group.

68
00:02:23,315 --> 00:02:24,890
George, share for your group.

69
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,099
What did y'all say?

70
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:31,387
(background chatter)

71
00:02:31,387 --> 00:02:32,497
Listen guys.

72
00:02:32,497 --> 00:02:33,597
- We had two.

73
00:02:33,597 --> 00:02:36,445
- [Teacher] You had two, okay.

74
00:02:36,445 --> 00:02:42,925
- Even over odd equals terminating.

75
00:02:42,925 --> 00:02:45,956
- [Teacher] Even over
odd is terminating, okay.

76
00:02:45,956 --> 00:02:49,174
- [George] And even
over even is repeating.

77
00:02:49,174 --> 00:02:53,956
- [Teacher] Even over even is repeating.

78
00:02:53,956 --> 00:02:55,589
- He meant two by that.

79
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:58,668
- Okay, so basically,

80
00:02:58,668 --> 00:03:01,696
and then I would assume that
odd over odd would go here?

81
00:03:01,696 --> 00:03:04,421
Okay, my only question is I see

82
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:06,446
even over odd, odd over odd,

83
00:03:06,446 --> 00:03:08,729
even over even, what's the other option?

84
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:10,268
- [Students] Odd over even.

85
00:03:10,268 --> 00:03:12,656
- Odd over even, where do
you think that would go?

86
00:03:12,656 --> 00:03:14,262
Do you think it would go terminating?

87
00:03:14,262 --> 00:03:14,822
-Yes.

88
00:03:14,822 --> 00:03:16,955
- Well, let's pick something really quick.

89
00:03:16,955 --> 00:03:19,587
3/4.

90
00:03:19,587 --> 00:03:21,278
That's odd over even.

91
00:03:21,278 --> 00:03:22,469
That would be terminating.

92
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:25,691
Okay, so opposites, even
and odd, odd and even,

93
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:27,507
you're thinking opposites --

94
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:28,840
- Attract?

95
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,908
- There you go.

96
00:03:29,908 --> 00:03:32,377
Opposites attract to be terminating,

97
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:34,824
and when they're the same

98
00:03:34,824 --> 00:03:36,041
even and even and odd and odd.

99
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:36,878
(background chatter)

100
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:38,586
- They repel.

101
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:40,589
- Okay, and they repeat.

102
00:03:40,589 --> 00:03:41,399
Pretty good.

103
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:43,069
Here's what I want you to do now.

104
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:45,909
Based on what you just told me,

105
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:47,411
look at number six.

106
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:49,132
I've given you fractions.

107
00:03:49,132 --> 00:03:51,803
I want you, let's look at them as a group.

108
00:03:51,803 --> 00:03:54,195
I want to come to a consensus as a class.

109
00:03:54,195 --> 00:03:56,516
Do we all agree with this groups thinking?

110
00:03:56,516 --> 00:03:58,476
(various agreement and
disagreement from class)

111
00:03:58,476 --> 00:03:59,285
- We didn't get to share ours

112
00:03:59,285 --> 00:04:03,106
because 8/9 repeat.

113
00:04:03,106 --> 00:04:06,675
- Okay, 8/9 is even over odd,

114
00:04:06,675 --> 00:04:08,696
and that repeats,

115
00:04:08,696 --> 00:04:10,862
so maybe we want to cancel this one out,

116
00:04:10,862 --> 00:04:13,320
and it's just odd over even?

117
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,323
(background chatter)

118
00:04:14,323 --> 00:04:18,048
- There might be something else.

119
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:20,426
It might be that that

120
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,936
doesn't go, necessarily,

121
00:04:23,936 --> 00:04:27,034
doing anything like

122
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:29,750
the rules for divisibility

123
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,328
like seven and eight,

124
00:04:32,328 --> 00:04:33,594
they don't have a rule

125
00:04:33,594 --> 00:04:34,851
because it just doesn't work,

126
00:04:34,851 --> 00:04:35,742
but it's right.

127
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:38,174
It might be that that doesn't work.

128
00:04:38,174 --> 00:04:40,627
- Maybe if it's even a law,

129
00:04:40,627 --> 00:04:44,562
you just gotta work it out.

130
00:04:44,562 --> 00:04:46,668
- So do we want to make our rule this?

131
00:04:46,668 --> 00:04:48,714
If it's odd over eating.

132
00:04:48,714 --> 00:04:49,809
Eating?

133
00:04:49,809 --> 00:04:51,236
Is it time for lunch?

134
00:04:51,236 --> 00:04:54,754
If it's odd over even, it's terminating,

135
00:04:54,754 --> 00:04:56,315
everything else is repeating?

136
00:04:56,315 --> 00:04:59,010
(disagreement from students)

137
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,071
- We should test it out before.

138
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:01,256
- 3/4 is terminating,

139
00:05:01,256 --> 00:05:02,955
but 7/8 isn't terminating

140
00:05:02,955 --> 00:05:05,046
'cause eight...

141
00:05:05,046 --> 00:05:06,791
- [Teacher] 7/8?

142
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:11,404
Try it on your paper real quick.

143
00:05:11,404 --> 00:05:15,538
7/8.

144
00:05:15,538 --> 00:05:17,931
- [Students] It terminates.

145
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:19,382
- [Teacher] So do we want to use this?

146
00:05:19,382 --> 00:05:21,630
(agreement and disagreement from students)

147
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,549
No and yes, okay, let's --

148
00:05:22,549 --> 00:05:23,999
- Let's do more though.

149
00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:26,893
- [Teacher] Let's do a
democracy here, okay?

150
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,924
If you're liking the, well hold on.

151
00:05:28,924 --> 00:05:30,122
Who says no?

152
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:32,211
Who doesn't want to use this?

153
00:05:32,211 --> 00:05:34,955
Why?

154
00:05:34,955 --> 00:05:39,718
- Those rules may not work all
the time for every fraction.

155
00:05:39,718 --> 00:05:41,519
- [Teacher] Okay, so do you have

156
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:44,902
a better rule or conjecture?

157
00:05:44,902 --> 00:05:46,458
(background chatter)

158
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,398
So far is it working?

159
00:05:48,398 --> 00:05:51,339
(agreement from class)

160
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:53,014
Based on what we know

161
00:05:53,014 --> 00:05:55,278
and the numbers we've generated so far,

162
00:05:55,278 --> 00:05:58,848
let's use that rule to categorize

163
00:05:58,848 --> 00:06:00,460
the following fractions,

164
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,952
and I think we could do this as a group.

165
00:06:03,952 --> 00:06:07,175
So here I've got, our rule
we said we wanted to try

166
00:06:07,175 --> 00:06:08,901
was odd over even.

167
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:11,479
Everything else is going in repeating.

168
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:13,336
Odd over even.

169
00:06:13,336 --> 00:06:14,975
We've already done these,

170
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,750
so here's our new fractions, okay?

171
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,241
What is this fraction here?

172
00:06:19,241 --> 00:06:20,895
- [Class] 11/24

173
00:06:20,895 --> 00:06:21,934
- It's odd over even,

174
00:06:21,934 --> 00:06:23,143
so where do we want to put it?

175
00:06:23,143 --> 00:06:24,541
- [Class] Terminating.

176
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,389
- Terminating.

177
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:27,728
15/14.

178
00:06:27,728 --> 00:06:29,389
- [Class] Terminating

179
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,863
- Odd over even, would
make it terminating.

180
00:06:31,863 --> 00:06:33,605
Six what?

181
00:06:33,605 --> 00:06:34,586
- [Class] Sevenths.

182
00:06:34,586 --> 00:06:35,470
- 6/7?

183
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,204
- [Class] Repeating.

184
00:06:37,204 --> 00:06:39,361
- Even over odd terminates.

185
00:06:39,361 --> 00:06:40,827
(background chatter)

186
00:06:40,827 --> 00:06:41,851
- But that didn't work.

187
00:06:41,851 --> 00:06:42,626
That didn't work.

188
00:06:42,626 --> 00:06:47,140
- We tried it, and we saw
that it didn't work, remember?

189
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,227
Yeah, odd over even is the
only one we're going with,

190
00:06:49,227 --> 00:06:51,923
so I've got an odd over even.

191
00:06:51,923 --> 00:06:53,669
I got odd over odd.

192
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:55,244
- Repeating.

193
00:06:55,244 --> 00:06:57,789
- And I've got an odd over even.

194
00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:00,477
- [Students] Terminating.

195
00:07:00,477 --> 00:07:03,207
- Okay, so here's what I want you to do.

196
00:07:03,207 --> 00:07:04,187
Check it.

197
00:07:04,187 --> 00:07:06,029
Use your calculators as a group, check it.

198
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:09,333
Circle, go ahead and write 'em down.

199
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,468
Categorize them just
like I did on the board.

200
00:07:12,468 --> 00:07:15,595
Write 'em in your chart and
circle any that don't belong.

201
00:07:15,595 --> 00:07:23,086
(background chatter)

202
00:07:23,086 --> 00:07:24,317
- [Teacher] Use your calculator.

203
00:07:24,317 --> 00:07:25,628
(background chatter)

204
00:07:25,628 --> 00:07:27,076
- It doesn't work.

205
00:07:27,076 --> 00:07:28,132
Odd over even.

206
00:07:28,132 --> 00:07:28,829
- [Teacher] It doesn't work?

207
00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:29,835
Oh, no!

208
00:07:29,835 --> 00:07:31,363
Which one doesn't work?

209
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:34,016
(background chatter)

210
00:07:34,016 --> 00:07:35,478
- Seven over six doesn't work.

211
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:38,023
- All right, let's do this then.

212
00:07:38,023 --> 00:07:40,655
The 6/7, were we correct there?

213
00:07:40,655 --> 00:07:43,808
(agreement and disagreement from students)

214
00:07:43,808 --> 00:07:44,980
All right, this one's right.

215
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,997
17 over 125.

216
00:07:46,997 --> 00:07:47,752
- No.

217
00:07:47,752 --> 00:07:50,355
- This one was repeating or terminating?

218
00:07:50,355 --> 00:07:51,405
- [Students] Terminating.

219
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:54,892
- All right, so this one,
we need to move over here.

220
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:56,586
All right, 5/13?

221
00:07:56,586 --> 00:07:57,690
- I haven't checked --

222
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:58,803
- Haven't check that one.

223
00:07:58,803 --> 00:08:02,211
- Five divided by 13.

224
00:08:02,211 --> 00:08:02,949
- We don't know.

225
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,049
Too many decimals.

226
00:08:04,049 --> 00:08:05,195
- [Teacher] Okay, if it's too many,

227
00:08:05,195 --> 00:08:06,235
what do you think it's going to be?

228
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,256
- [Students] Repeating.

229
00:08:07,256 --> 00:08:08,100
- Probably going to be repeating,

230
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,019
so that one looks good.

231
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:11,103
Let's do this.
(background chatter)

232
00:08:11,103 --> 00:08:14,489
Hold on, I want you guys to try 11/24.

233
00:08:14,489 --> 00:08:16,610
I want you to do 15/14.

234
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:19,180
I want you to check 199 over 200,

235
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,924
and I want you all to check nine over 80.

236
00:08:21,924 --> 00:08:25,039
(background chatter)

237
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,035
- These
rules already tested out.

238
00:08:28,035 --> 00:08:28,969
- That's terminating.

239
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:35,096
(background chatter)

240
00:08:35,096 --> 00:08:37,385
- The rules weren't tested
enough to be proven.

241
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:38,953
- [Boy in Camo] I think my rule is solid

242
00:08:38,953 --> 00:08:41,399
even though it's kind of condensed.

243
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:46,399
(background chatter)

244
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:50,227
- [Teacher] Five, four, three, two, one.

245
00:08:50,227 --> 00:08:50,939
Thank you.

246
00:08:50,939 --> 00:08:53,258
All right, 11/24?

247
00:08:53,258 --> 00:08:54,615
It stays?

248
00:08:54,615 --> 00:08:55,700
All right, it repeats,

249
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,883
so it goes over here.

250
00:08:56,883 --> 00:08:58,608
All right, 15/14.

251
00:08:58,608 --> 00:08:59,936
- [Students] Repeating.

252
00:08:59,936 --> 00:09:02,268
- [Teacher] All right,
let me change this though.

253
00:09:02,268 --> 00:09:07,276
Let's change this one to 15/24.

254
00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:07,943
Check that one.

255
00:09:07,943 --> 00:09:09,096
15/24.

256
00:09:09,096 --> 00:09:10,034
And while they're checking --

257
00:09:10,034 --> 00:09:10,834
- Point 625.

258
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:11,764
- [Teacher] Point 625,

259
00:09:11,764 --> 00:09:16,196
so it's actually going to terminate, okay?

260
00:09:16,196 --> 00:09:18,028
199 over 200?

261
00:09:18,028 --> 00:09:19,530
Repeating or terminating?

262
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,394
- Terminating.

263
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:21,311
- [Teacher] It terminated?

264
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,293
And nine over 80?

265
00:09:22,293 --> 00:09:23,380
- [Group] Terminating.

266
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,734
- [Teacher] Terminating, okay,

267
00:09:24,734 --> 00:09:27,443
so it didn't work.

268
00:09:27,443 --> 00:09:29,389
- So odd over even doesn't work?

269
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:30,558
- Right, it didn't work,

270
00:09:30,558 --> 00:09:32,068
so let's think about it then.

271
00:09:32,068 --> 00:09:33,661
We got a --

272
00:09:33,661 --> 00:09:36,589
- Do you know a rule?

273
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:37,880
- I don't know,

274
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,709
so I'm kind of doing this with you.

275
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:41,189
Let's look at this.

276
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:42,388
What is important?

277
00:09:42,388 --> 00:09:44,650
Do you think the numerator is important?

278
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,531
Well, if the numerator's what's important?

279
00:09:47,531 --> 00:09:51,533
- I think they're evenly important.

280
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:52,617
- They're evenly important?

281
00:09:52,617 --> 00:09:54,938
- Without one,

282
00:09:54,938 --> 00:09:56,907
the other wouldn't be the same fraction.

283
00:09:56,907 --> 00:09:57,686
- Do you agree?

284
00:09:57,686 --> 00:09:58,615
He said, "Without one,

285
00:09:58,615 --> 00:10:00,776
"the other wouldn't be the same fraction."

286
00:10:00,776 --> 00:10:01,534
What do you mean by that?

287
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,655
- You said,
"Which one's important?"

288
00:10:04,655 --> 00:10:08,441
If you say the numerator's important,

289
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,890
then if you change the denominator

290
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:12,864
it might not work,

291
00:10:12,864 --> 00:10:16,486
so they're not the same fraction

292
00:10:16,486 --> 00:10:17,441
without one another.

293
00:10:17,441 --> 00:10:19,325
- Okay.

294
00:10:19,325 --> 00:10:20,671
- If the numerator is one less

295
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:21,734
than the denominator,

296
00:10:21,734 --> 00:10:24,180
then it will be repeating.

297
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:29,687
- If the numerator is one
less than the denominator?

298
00:10:29,687 --> 00:10:30,388
What about 5/13?

299
00:10:30,388 --> 00:10:33,294
- That's just one rule,
there's multiple --

300
00:10:33,294 --> 00:10:34,642
- Right, well, I want to come up

301
00:10:34,642 --> 00:10:37,241
with just one rule that
works for them all.

302
00:10:37,241 --> 00:10:38,988
So let's look at this.

303
00:10:38,988 --> 00:10:41,986
If the numerator is what's important,

304
00:10:41,986 --> 00:10:44,132
can we not look at these
two fractions here?

305
00:10:44,132 --> 00:10:46,135
What do they both have in common?

306
00:10:46,135 --> 00:10:49,455
They both have a common denominator,

307
00:10:49,455 --> 00:10:52,762
and they have different numerators,

308
00:10:52,762 --> 00:10:57,314
and it's actually put 'em
in two, separate categories,

309
00:10:57,314 --> 00:10:59,983
but they're both odd.
- Prime number.

310
00:10:59,983 --> 00:11:02,414
- [Teacher] Oh, you're seeing
something about prime number?

311
00:11:02,414 --> 00:11:04,601
(background chatter)

312
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:05,597
- If it's prime over even

313
00:11:05,597 --> 00:11:09,509
it'll be repeating,

314
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:13,177
but a prime over an even would be...

315
00:11:13,177 --> 00:11:14,874
- Okay, so we're gonna do

316
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:18,924
prime over even is which one?

317
00:11:18,924 --> 00:11:20,797
- Repeating.

318
00:11:20,797 --> 00:11:24,139
- Prime over even is repeating.

319
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:28,309
- Okay, because even number
has what factor in it?

320
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:29,336
Automatically?

321
00:11:29,336 --> 00:11:29,929
- Two.

322
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:32,331
- A two, and will a prime number

323
00:11:32,331 --> 00:11:33,422
have two as a factor?

324
00:11:33,422 --> 00:11:34,914
(background chatter)

325
00:11:34,914 --> 00:11:36,520
A prime number will have two as a factor?

326
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,811
What are the factors of prime numbers?

327
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:40,903
- [Students] One and itself.

328
00:11:40,903 --> 00:11:43,868
- The only problem with that

329
00:11:43,868 --> 00:11:45,588
is the number what?

330
00:11:45,588 --> 00:11:46,411
- [Students] Two.

331
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:49,955
- Two, okay, so I think
you're on to something.

332
00:11:49,955 --> 00:11:52,029
- If it's prime over even,
then it'll be repeating.

333
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:54,636
- [Teacher] Prime over
even, then it's repeating?

334
00:11:54,636 --> 00:11:56,348
- I found a problem with that.

335
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:57,668
- Here's what I want you to do.

336
00:11:57,668 --> 00:12:02,128
- I did 11

337
00:12:02,128 --> 00:12:04,142
over eight.

338
00:12:04,142 --> 00:12:08,651
- [Teacher] 11 over eight.

339
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:09,855
- It's prime over even.

340
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,236
- Okay, it is a mix number.

341
00:12:12,236 --> 00:12:13,555
It's not a mixed number, I'm sorry.

342
00:12:13,555 --> 00:12:14,468
It's a?

343
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:16,255
- [Students] Improper fraction.

344
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,242
- What would it need to be a mixed number?

345
00:12:18,242 --> 00:12:20,370
(background chatter)

346
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,471
- A whole number.

347
00:12:21,471 --> 00:12:22,514
- [Teacher] And a fractional part.

348
00:12:22,514 --> 00:12:23,155
Good job.

349
00:12:23,155 --> 00:12:24,889
All right, so here's my question then.

350
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:26,357
Here's what I want you to do.

351
00:12:26,357 --> 00:12:27,728
Look up here,

352
00:12:27,728 --> 00:12:29,688
and I think with fractions

353
00:12:29,688 --> 00:12:31,214
we always seem to stress

354
00:12:31,214 --> 00:12:33,697
when we're doing equivalent fractions.

355
00:12:33,697 --> 00:12:36,637
To put a fraction in its what?

356
00:12:36,637 --> 00:12:37,481
- Simplest form.

357
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:40,208
- Simplest form.

358
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,429
Anytime there's a prime number

359
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:43,785
it's already going to be in
its simplest form, right?

360
00:12:43,785 --> 00:12:45,220
'Cause you can't reduce it anymore,

361
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,187
so these are already in
their simplest forms.

362
00:12:49,187 --> 00:12:50,901
What about 15/24?

363
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:53,134
Is there a factor that
they both have in common?

364
00:12:53,134 --> 00:12:53,966
- Three.

365
00:12:53,966 --> 00:12:55,301
- Three, okay,

366
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:58,807
so if I factor out three out of fifteen?

367
00:12:58,807 --> 00:13:00,113
- [Students] Five.

368
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,630
- I got a five.

369
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,252
- [Students] Eight.

370
00:13:03,252 --> 00:13:04,201
- So that's an equivalent fraction,

371
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,519
so I'm going to get rid of that.

372
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:11,588
Odd over even.

373
00:13:11,588 --> 00:13:14,742
So maybe we could say

374
00:13:14,742 --> 00:13:18,168
in a fraction's, what?

375
00:13:18,168 --> 00:13:18,948
- Simplest form.

376
00:13:18,948 --> 00:13:20,533
- [Teacher] Simplest form.

377
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:26,206
In a fraction's simplest form

378
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:30,714
if it's odd

379
00:13:30,714 --> 00:13:34,366
over even,

380
00:13:34,366 --> 00:13:36,119
then it, what?

381
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:36,895
- Terminates.

382
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:42,133
- [Teacher] Terminates.

383
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:43,558
- So are we doing a rule

384
00:13:43,558 --> 00:13:45,574
that applies to every number?

385
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,745
- [Teacher] Every single number.

386
00:13:47,745 --> 00:13:49,834
So if we were to make a conjecture,

387
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:51,987
do we just base it off of six numbers?

388
00:13:51,987 --> 00:13:52,818
- [Students] No.

389
00:13:52,818 --> 00:13:55,267
- [Teacher] What I want you to do is

390
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:58,033
I want you as a group

391
00:13:58,033 --> 00:14:01,727
to come up with your own example

392
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,348
that can either prove this

393
00:14:03,348 --> 00:14:05,749
or disprove this conjecture.

394
00:14:05,749 --> 00:14:07,680
The conjecture is that a fraction

395
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,820
in its simplest form,

396
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,740
if it's odd over even,

397
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,182
will terminate.

398
00:14:13,182 --> 00:14:15,265
I want every group to make up their own,

399
00:14:15,265 --> 00:14:20,727
as a group make up your own example.

400
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,433
- Let's do 7/6.

401
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:32,283
(background chatter)

402
00:14:32,283 --> 00:14:33,902
- [Teacher] You make up your own, Buck.

403
00:14:33,902 --> 00:14:34,631
You make up your own.

404
00:14:34,631 --> 00:14:35,916
You got notebook paper if you want it.

405
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,054
- I made it up, so can we do it again?

406
00:14:37,054 --> 00:14:39,800
- [Teacher] No, I want a
new one they haven't seen.

407
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,901
(background chatter)

408
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:44,926
- So 5/6?

409
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,316
- [Teacher] 5/6, okay.

410
00:14:46,316 --> 00:14:47,732
Try 5/6.

411
00:14:47,732 --> 00:14:49,166
Is it in simplest form?

412
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,063
- Yes

413
00:14:50,063 --> 00:14:51,404
- [Teacher] Okay.

414
00:14:51,404 --> 00:14:53,839
(background chatter)

415
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,998
And, so, it actually repeats.

416
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,413
- It disproves the theory.

417
00:14:59,413 --> 00:15:01,286
- [Teacher] So it
disproves it, doesn't it?
