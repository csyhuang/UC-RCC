1
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:11,792
- [Group] Three, four, five, six!

2
00:00:11,792 --> 00:00:14,312
- We have six friends at the table!

3
00:00:14,312 --> 00:00:19,312
And let's see, I have one,

4
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:22,992
uh, leave it there please, Eulet.

5
00:00:22,992 --> 00:00:24,761
- Christmas!

6
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:26,431
- Two...

7
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:27,811
- Christmas!

8
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:30,832
- Uh, it's a little bit like
Christmas, you're right.

9
00:00:30,832 --> 00:00:32,462
Three!

10
00:00:32,462 --> 00:00:37,462
Oh, I have three strings to put beads on,

11
00:00:38,611 --> 00:00:40,951
but I have six friends.

12
00:00:40,951 --> 00:00:44,631
(overlapping chatter)

13
00:00:44,631 --> 00:00:46,666
But I, you know, I don't.

14
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:51,167
I have some beads, but I
don't have any more strings.

15
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:52,707
What could we do?

16
00:00:52,707 --> 00:00:53,711
- Your colors...

17
00:00:53,711 --> 00:01:01,831
- I think, I think, I think
we could have (inaudible)

18
00:01:01,831 --> 00:01:04,730
- You think what, what
do you think we could do?

19
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,791
- I don't know.

20
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:09,912
- Okay. Alright, does
anybody have an idea?

21
00:01:09,912 --> 00:01:11,632
We have a problem!

22
00:01:11,632 --> 00:01:15,551
We have more friends than we have strings.

23
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:17,111
- I want to have that one.

24
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:19,831
- Okay, well we're talking
about what we're going to do.

25
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:22,231
Alex, do you know what we could do?

26
00:01:22,231 --> 00:01:23,591
- I don't know.

27
00:01:23,591 --> 00:01:25,031
- You don't know?

28
00:01:25,031 --> 00:01:27,111
Surafel, wait just a minute,

29
00:01:27,111 --> 00:01:30,391
'cause I want everybody
to help string beads.

30
00:01:31,901 --> 00:01:36,703
- Me and me and me and me

31
00:01:38,023 --> 00:01:41,172
are gonna share.

32
00:01:41,172 --> 00:01:42,591
- Oh! What did you say?!

33
00:01:42,591 --> 00:01:43,751
- We're going to share!

34
00:01:43,751 --> 00:01:44,631
- You're gonna share?!

35
00:01:44,631 --> 00:01:48,311
Give me a high five for
that great solution!

36
00:01:48,311 --> 00:01:51,871
Did you hear, she said
she's going to share.

37
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:53,231
Who are you gonna share with?

38
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:55,152
- I share a toy!

39
00:01:55,152 --> 00:01:58,900
- I'm going to share,
I'm going to share with,

40
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,940
I'm going to share with...

41
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,512
- Did you forget his name?

42
00:02:02,512 --> 00:02:03,512
- Um, Eulet.

43
00:02:03,512 --> 00:02:06,273
- With Ulet! You're gonna share with Eulet!

44
00:02:06,273 --> 00:02:07,791
That's a great idea!

45
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:08,911
Are you going to share?

46
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:11,405
- Not a toy

47
00:02:11,405 --> 00:02:14,391
- What about you, what could you do?

48
00:02:14,391 --> 00:02:15,751
Could you share?

49
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:16,428
- Yes.

50
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:17,711
- And take some turns?

51
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:18,308
- Yes.

52
00:02:18,308 --> 00:02:20,351
- Who can you take turns with?

53
00:02:20,961 --> 00:02:22,691
And what's her name?

54
00:02:22,691 --> 00:02:23,031
- Brianna.

55
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:26,871
- Brianna. Ask her, Brianna,
will you string beads with me?

56
00:02:26,871 --> 00:02:28,991
- Will you string beads with me?

57
00:02:28,991 --> 00:02:30,431
- Look, can you play?

58
00:02:30,431 --> 00:02:31,912
- Yes.

59
00:02:31,912 --> 00:02:33,711
- Yeah? Yeah, you can?

60
00:02:33,711 --> 00:02:37,271
Good, you can take turns
and share and string beads.

61
00:02:37,271 --> 00:02:38,791
Surafel!

62
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,631
- Huh?

63
00:02:39,631 --> 00:02:42,071
- Can you you take turns with someone?

64
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:44,352
- Umm...

65
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,906
- Oh! Look at that!

66
00:02:45,906 --> 00:02:48,272
Yeah! This is Alex!

67
00:02:48,272 --> 00:02:51,031
You're going to take
turns with Alex alright?

68
00:02:51,031 --> 00:02:53,191
Well what do we need now?

69
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:55,351
- We need some more beads!

70
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:56,913
- We need some more beads.

71
00:02:56,913 --> 00:03:01,002
Alright, well I have
some beads, let's see...

72
00:03:04,407 --> 00:03:05,231
I have some beads.

73
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:07,311
Oh boy, I've got some great colors!

74
00:03:07,311 --> 00:03:11,352
Let me show you what we're gonna do, okay?

75
00:03:11,352 --> 00:03:13,952
Let's see, whoops, whoops!

76
00:03:13,952 --> 00:03:15,226
Hold on a minute.

77
00:03:15,226 --> 00:03:17,832
Okay, Lily is gonna have yellow and

78
00:03:17,832 --> 00:03:19,673
Eulet is gonna have...

79
00:03:19,673 --> 00:03:20,592
- Blue!

80
00:03:20,592 --> 00:03:23,392
- Purple, okay, who's gonna go first?

81
00:03:23,392 --> 00:03:23,990
- Me.

82
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,312
- Alright, Eulet.

83
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,231
- And I'll go next!

84
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:27,706
- And you'll go next.

85
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:30,311
Let's see what happens with the colors

86
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:31,471
when you take turns.

87
00:03:31,471 --> 00:03:34,306
(overlapping chatter)

88
00:03:34,306 --> 00:03:35,545
Alright, let's see. Eulet is...

89
00:03:35,545 --> 00:03:38,462
Surafel sit down, watch.

90
00:03:38,462 --> 00:03:41,812
Whoops! Here, pull it this way.

91
00:03:43,272 --> 00:03:46,871
Alright, Eulet put his
on, now who's turn is it?

92
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:47,592
- My turn!

93
00:03:47,592 --> 00:03:48,282
- My turn!

94
00:03:48,972 --> 00:03:49,791
- Who's turn is it?

95
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:50,671
- Me.

96
00:03:50,671 --> 00:03:53,951
- This is Lily's, Lily's turn!

97
00:03:54,711 --> 00:03:57,226
Okay, so look, Lily's having a turn.

98
00:03:57,226 --> 00:03:58,187
Alex, watch.

99
00:03:59,227 --> 00:04:00,551
- Alex! You...

100
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:01,951
- Okay, but we're not gonna stack.

101
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:05,711
Alright, Lily put hers
on, now what do we do?

102
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:07,711
- Eulet.

103
00:04:07,711 --> 00:04:09,471
- Back to Eulet, that's right!

104
00:04:09,471 --> 00:04:11,350
Eulet, you can say, now it's my turn!

105
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,512
- Now it's my turn.

106
00:04:13,342 --> 00:04:15,272
- Can you put one on?

107
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:19,032
Surafel, are you watching?

108
00:04:19,032 --> 00:04:21,792
They're putting beads on their string!

109
00:04:21,792 --> 00:04:23,866
- That's nice to share!

110
00:04:23,866 --> 00:04:27,787
- It is! It's nice to
share and to take turns.

111
00:04:27,787 --> 00:04:29,631
- Just like I share toys!

112
00:04:29,631 --> 00:04:31,230
- You share toys?

113
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,030
- And we share animals!

114
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,552
(overlapping chatter)

115
00:04:35,552 --> 00:04:37,551
- Tell her it's your turn.

116
00:04:37,551 --> 00:04:38,311
- My turn.

117
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:41,471
- I share toys with my sister.

118
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:43,111
- Oh that's nice!

119
00:04:43,111 --> 00:04:44,951
- And I share animals with my sister!

120
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,950
- And you share animals?

121
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:50,282
Alright Lily, may I show your friends what

122
00:04:50,282 --> 00:04:51,911
you and Eulet did?

123
00:04:51,911 --> 00:04:54,551
Look! Look at their colors!

124
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:59,111
When you take turns,
look, you make a pattern!

125
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:02,311
You go purple, yellow, purple, yellow!

126
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:06,908
Because you're taking turns,
the colors change each time.

127
00:05:06,908 --> 00:05:08,751
That's called a pattern.

128
00:05:08,751 --> 00:05:09,546
- Yeah!

129
00:05:09,546 --> 00:05:12,711
- Alright, so, it's the purple turn now.

130
00:05:12,711 --> 00:05:15,031
Eulet, that means it's your turn.

131
00:05:15,031 --> 00:05:17,111
Nice working together!

132
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:21,471
I'm going to give Brianna blue,

133
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:23,352
and Natalie red.

134
00:05:23,352 --> 00:05:25,592
Okay? Here you go.

135
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:27,661
Let's see if you guys can take turns.

136
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,051
Oh, and look!

137
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:32,831
Alex gets blue and Surafel,
what color do you get?

138
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:33,832
- Blue.

139
00:05:33,832 --> 00:05:35,311
- Orange.

140
00:05:35,311 --> 00:05:35,907
- Oh.

141
00:05:35,907 --> 00:05:37,906
- Orange, let's see, here.

142
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:44,267
Alright, remember, uh oh!

143
00:05:44,267 --> 00:05:45,546
- Lily's turn.

144
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:50,471
- Look Brianna, look
Brianna, this was your turn.

145
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:54,911
Now tell Natalie, say Natalie, your turn!

146
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:58,393
Surafel, did you get one on?

147
00:05:58,393 --> 00:06:00,111
You did! So now who's turn?

148
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:01,671
- Umm...

149
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:02,952
Remember, we're taking turns.

150
00:06:02,952 --> 00:06:05,750
Say, Alex! Give him this part.

151
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,546
Say, put yours on!

152
00:06:08,546 --> 00:06:11,751
Alright! Here, we're gonna leave this on.

153
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:13,991
Wait for Alex!

154
00:06:13,991 --> 00:06:16,271
Oh good! Now it's your turn, Brianna.

155
00:06:16,271 --> 00:06:18,071
You have to talk to your friend and

156
00:06:18,071 --> 00:06:21,441
tell them when it's their turn.

157
00:06:23,232 --> 00:06:26,973
Nice job Eulet and Natalie.

158
00:06:27,313 --> 00:06:29,752
Brianna, whoops! You're
pulling it the wrong way.

159
00:06:29,752 --> 00:06:32,306
Pull it this way so it goes on.

160
00:06:32,306 --> 00:06:33,591
Okay, now who's turn?

161
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:34,551
- My turn!

162
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:36,202
- Who's turn?

163
00:06:37,202 --> 00:06:38,107
- My turn!

164
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:40,999
- Brianna, look, Natalie
said it's her turn.

165
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:43,191
Give it to Natalie.

166
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:47,707
Tell her your turn, and
then your turn is next.

167
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,392
How are we doin' guys?

168
00:06:49,392 --> 00:06:51,311
Uh oh, did they come off?

169
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:54,191
Let me see, let's see.

170
00:06:54,191 --> 00:06:55,711
Oh, uh oh.

171
00:06:55,711 --> 00:06:58,712
Here, let me come around
and see if I can help you.

172
00:06:58,712 --> 00:07:02,111
Eulet and Lily, you're working so nicely.

173
00:07:02,111 --> 00:07:04,226
Is it your turn again?

174
00:07:04,226 --> 00:07:07,666
Alright. Natalie, tell
Brianna when it's her turn.

175
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,511
(overlapping chatter)

176
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:12,071
Alright boys, let's see.

177
00:07:12,071 --> 00:07:14,712
Let's get you going again, alright?

178
00:07:14,712 --> 00:07:16,751
Here, let's put these down.

179
00:07:16,751 --> 00:07:21,305
Okay, Alex has blue
and Surafel has orange.

180
00:07:21,305 --> 00:07:23,941
Surafel, can you put yours on?

181
00:07:23,941 --> 00:07:25,800
Okay.

182
00:07:28,691 --> 00:07:32,831
Beautiful, okay, now,
who's turn is it now?

183
00:07:32,831 --> 00:07:33,981
- Now it's my turn.

184
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:35,113
- Who's turn?

185
00:07:37,263 --> 00:07:38,955
Do you remember me saying? It's Alex.

186
00:07:38,955 --> 00:07:39,844
- Alex!

187
00:07:39,844 --> 00:07:43,072
- Alex! Okay. Give it to Alex.

188
00:07:43,072 --> 00:07:45,396
Here, Alex, you're going to hold this part

189
00:07:45,396 --> 00:07:47,320
and you put your bead on.

190
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,081
Whoops! What's here?

191
00:07:49,081 --> 00:07:51,154
Oh, it's a little bit tangled.

192
00:07:51,154 --> 00:07:53,661
Let me see if I can untangle it.

193
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:57,316
Okay, that's right,
now we need a red bead.

194
00:07:57,316 --> 00:07:59,484
Surafel, can you sit down now?

195
00:07:59,484 --> 00:08:01,082
It looked like you almost fell.

196
00:08:01,082 --> 00:08:04,193
Alright, Alex, yours is on. Look!

197
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:06,924
We have orange and blue.

198
00:08:06,924 --> 00:08:08,441
So now what do you do?

199
00:08:08,441 --> 00:08:09,183
- My turn!

200
00:08:09,183 --> 00:08:12,325
- Oh is that right? Surafel's turn!

201
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,318
Oh you guys are great.

202
00:08:14,318 --> 00:08:16,713
- Seven! I have seven beads!

203
00:08:16,713 --> 00:08:18,392
- [Teacher] You have seven beads?

204
00:08:18,392 --> 00:08:20,559
- I'll count how many beads I have.

205
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:23,993
One, two, three, four, five...

206
00:08:23,993 --> 00:08:25,303
- Very good.

207
00:08:25,303 --> 00:08:26,286
- Six, seven!

208
00:08:26,286 --> 00:08:28,442
- Oh good! You have seven too!

209
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:30,840
You have the same number.

210
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,834
Okay, now what are we gonna do?

211
00:08:33,834 --> 00:08:35,115
- It was my turn!

212
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,112
- Okay, who's turn is it?

213
00:08:37,112 --> 00:08:37,878
- Alex!

214
00:08:37,878 --> 00:08:41,042
- Okay good, take this,
give it to Alex and

215
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:44,165
tell him, it's, give him this part,

216
00:08:44,165 --> 00:08:46,523
and say Alex, it's your turn now.

217
00:08:46,523 --> 00:08:47,676
- His turn.

218
00:08:47,676 --> 00:08:48,495
- Oh, very nice.

219
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:50,046
- Now we can count!

220
00:08:50,046 --> 00:08:52,789
One, two, one, two,
three, four, five, six!

221
00:08:54,788 --> 00:08:57,321
Uh oh, the watch has to (inaudible)

222
00:08:58,887 --> 00:09:02,743
- Uh oh, yours is, Brianna,

223
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,877
Okay, now what happens, Brianna?

224
00:09:06,877 --> 00:09:08,640
- Three, four, five!

225
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,280
- Okay, hold on. Brianna.

226
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,228
- Six, seven, eight!

227
00:09:12,228 --> 00:09:16,802
- Okay, take it, no, wait
a minute, you had a turn.

228
00:09:16,802 --> 00:09:19,826
Can you give it now to
Natalie? Give it to Natalie.

229
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,122
- Six! I've got six!

230
00:09:21,122 --> 00:09:24,426
- Look, give this to Natalie and tell her,

231
00:09:24,426 --> 00:09:27,002
it's your turn now Natalie.

232
00:09:28,196 --> 00:09:32,721
Wow, we are doing some nice work!

233
00:09:33,455 --> 00:09:36,110
Did you give it back
to Surafel for his turn?

234
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,676
Alex, yay!

235
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:42,920
Alright, there's an orange one.

236
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,039
Surafel, what are you going to do now?

237
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:47,191
- This is (inaudible) of it all.

238
00:09:47,191 --> 00:09:49,124
- What do you do now?

239
00:09:49,124 --> 00:09:49,592
- [Surafel] Alex!

240
00:09:49,592 --> 00:09:50,689
- Pretty, yay!

241
00:09:50,689 --> 00:09:52,030
- [Teacher] Tell him, Alex your turn!

242
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,951
(Background Chatter)

243
00:09:53,951 --> 00:09:56,676
Uh oh! Did we have a bead get away?

244
00:09:56,676 --> 00:09:58,156
(shushes)

245
00:10:01,096 --> 00:10:03,031
Uh oh! Uh oh!

246
00:10:03,031 --> 00:10:04,560
(laughs)

247
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,358
This bead doesn't want
to go on the string!

248
00:10:07,358 --> 00:10:09,476
- It's five, I have five!

249
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,800
- I like the way you're taking turns.

250
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,482
Okay, you are almost finished!

251
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:18,015
Eulet, you're working
so nicely with friends.

252
00:10:18,015 --> 00:10:20,107
- And the red has...

253
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:22,752
- Okay.

254
00:10:22,752 --> 00:10:25,204
- One, two, three, four, five, six...

255
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:25,797
- Uh oh!

256
00:10:25,797 --> 00:10:27,760
- seven, eight, nine, ten...

257
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,193
That's okay, how did that happen?

258
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:32,186
We've got two blue ones on there.

259
00:10:32,186 --> 00:10:34,601
Whoops! That's okay.

260
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:37,559
Now Surafel is having his turn.

261
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:39,157
- Look what I'm making.

262
00:10:39,157 --> 00:10:41,961
- Oh, one, two, three, four,

263
00:10:41,961 --> 00:10:45,107
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

264
00:10:45,107 --> 00:10:45,953
- Are you finished?

265
00:10:45,953 --> 00:10:47,197
- Yes.

266
00:10:47,197 --> 00:10:48,897
- Okay, show me, what
are you going to do now?

267
00:10:53,357 --> 00:10:54,893
- Four, five, six...

268
00:10:54,893 --> 00:10:58,118
- Oh you did some counting, good.

269
00:10:58,118 --> 00:10:59,319
- [Surafel] I did.

270
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:01,243
Okay, and you have finished your turn,

271
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,642
so what do you do now?

272
00:11:02,642 --> 00:11:04,205
- You only have two left! One, two!

273
00:11:04,905 --> 00:11:06,391
- Is it your turn?

274
00:11:07,731 --> 00:11:08,919
- Nah.

275
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:11,922
- Okay, so what do you say?

276
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:13,783
You say, Alex!

277
00:11:13,783 --> 00:11:14,605
- Alex!

278
00:11:15,645 --> 00:11:17,361
- Your turn!

279
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:22,271
Okay friends, we're almost done.

280
00:11:23,356 --> 00:11:26,149
Let me see, uh oh, we need a red one!

281
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:26,842
You know what?

282
00:11:26,842 --> 00:11:28,382
I'm going to make it so that you have

283
00:11:28,382 --> 00:11:31,389
the same number as your friend. Okay?

284
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:34,682
Your turn! Let's see...

285
00:11:34,682 --> 00:11:35,402
- My turn!

286
00:11:35,402 --> 00:11:40,402
- Here we go, and you have
the same number. Okay!

287
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:44,930
(children counting and shouting)

288
00:11:47,925 --> 00:11:51,631
- Eulet, can you talk to your partner?

289
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:52,454
- Your turn!

290
00:11:52,454 --> 00:11:53,476
- What are you going to say?

291
00:11:53,476 --> 00:11:55,103
Oh, okay, she said it's your turn.

292
00:11:55,103 --> 00:11:56,321
Can you say, thank you?

00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:57,585
- Thank you.

294
00:11:57,585 --> 00:12:00,701
- Okay and we are almost finished.

295
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:05,163
Uh oh, we're doing some
different turn taking here,

296
00:12:05,163 --> 00:12:06,588
but that's okay!

297
00:12:06,588 --> 00:12:09,844
Alright, okay, so now who's turn is it?

298
00:12:09,844 --> 00:12:10,718
- Alex!

299
00:12:10,718 --> 00:12:13,591

303
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,433
- Okay, we're not counting
so much right now,

304
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:23,613
we're taking turns.

305
00:12:23,613 --> 00:12:24,240

00:12:28,902 --> 00:12:30,435
- It's Lily's turn, I'm next.

310
00:12:30,435 --> 00:12:34,398
- That's right, tell her,

311
00:12:34,398 --> 00:12:37,421
(gasps) Look!

312
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:39,823
What happened?

313
00:12:39,823 --> 00:12:41,311
Did you finish?

314
00:12:41,311 --> 00:12:41,867
- Yeah!

315
00:12:41,867 --> 00:12:43,553
- Did you string all your beads?

316
00:12:43,553 --> 00:12:44,302
- Yeah!

317
00:12:44,302 --> 00:12:47,797
- You did! All of your
beads are on your string.

318
00:12:47,797 --> 00:12:50,870
Let's look! Oh, and you too!

319
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,788
Nice Job!

Beautiful. Okay, I'm
gonna lay it right here.

324
00:13:07,545 --> 00:13:10,437
Let's look at yours, because you finished

325
00:13:10,437 --> 00:13:13,429
and you used all of your beads.

326
00:13:13,429 --> 00:13:16,392
Oh look, you used different colors.

327
00:13:16,392 --> 00:13:19,232
You did blue, can you say it with me?

00:13:30,719 --> 00:13:35,719
(Continues in Spanish) Azul, rojo, azul, rojo, azul. 

332
00:13:37,556 --> 00:13:41,000
You guys did a great job of taking turns!

333
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,244
- We finished! We finished!

334
00:13:44,144 --> 00:13:45,191
- You finished!

335
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:50,191
Look, you used all of your
beads, your trays are empty.

336
00:13:50,241 --> 00:13:53,761
Let's hold it up and look at the colors,

337
00:13:53,761 --> 00:13:55,472
and the pattern you made.

338
00:13:55,472 --> 00:13:56,996
Can you tell me the pattern?

339
00:13:57,396 --> 00:14:00,409
- [Group] Purple, yellow...

340
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:05,409
purple, yellow, purple, yellow,

341
00:14:06,007 --> 00:14:10,028
purple, yellow,

342
00:14:10,028 --> 00:14:15,028
purple, yellow, purple, yellow,

343
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,140
purple, yellow, purple,

344
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:25,030
yellow, purple, yellow,

345
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:30,030
purple, yellow, purple, yellow!

346
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:35,880
- Yay! And we know that
you took turns because

347
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,843
the colors changed every time.

348
00:14:38,843 --> 00:14:40,227
- It's clean up time!

349
00:14:40,227 --> 00:14:42,385
- You guys did a great job!

350
00:14:42,385 --> 00:14:45,551
And you're right, it is, we are finished.

351
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:50,551
We learned how to take
turns with a partner,

352
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,960
and we put beads on a string and

353
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,437
made a color pattern
because we took turns.

354
00:14:57,437 --> 00:14:59,691
Yes! It was all good and I think

355
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:00,435
(bell rings)

356
00:15:00,435 --> 00:15:03,317
you all get to ring the good job bell!

357
00:15:03,317 --> 00:15:05,502
Good job taking turns, Eulet.

358
00:15:05,882 --> 00:15:07,882
Good job taking...
