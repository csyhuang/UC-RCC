1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:05,116
- So, does percent always have to be 100?

2
00:00:05,516 --> 00:00:06,819
- No.

3
00:00:06,819 --> 00:00:09,322
- Because I see, none of the percents

4
00:00:09,322 --> 00:00:10,826
up here are 100.

5
00:00:10,826 --> 00:00:13,631
- They're all lower than 100%.

6
00:00:13,631 --> 00:00:16,244
- So you think a percent
can either be 100 or less.

7
00:00:16,244 --> 00:00:16,883
- Yes.

8
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:17,648
- Okay, okay.

9
00:00:17,648 --> 00:00:18,827
So that means you think this can be

10
00:00:18,827 --> 00:00:20,194
called an improper.

11
00:00:20,194 --> 00:00:22,296
Okay. Ian.

12
00:00:22,296 --> 00:00:27,296
- Three-fourths and the
decimal 0.75 are the same.

13
00:00:28,686 --> 00:00:31,273
- What do you mean by the same?

14
00:00:31,273 --> 00:00:32,457
One's a decimal, one's a fraction.

15
00:00:32,457 --> 00:00:34,094
- Well, I mean like they're equivalent.

16
00:00:34,094 --> 00:00:36,393
- Ah. Equivalent.

17
00:00:36,393 --> 00:00:39,120
So, does that go back to what Alana said?

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,036
Alana, which ones did you have there?

19
00:00:41,036 --> 00:00:43,573
- One-half and .5.

20
00:00:45,273 --> 00:00:46,577
- So you're saying the
same kind of relationship

21
00:00:46,577 --> 00:00:48,515
is one and the same with 
one-half and 5/10?

22
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:48,992
- Yeah.

23
00:00:48,992 --> 00:00:50,163
- Okay. Alana, no?

24
00:00:50,163 --> 00:00:55,039
- Well, I did one-fourth,
three-fourths, 0.75 and 0.25

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,745
because they're all part of quarters.

26
00:00:56,745 --> 00:00:59,945
- Ah, you did one-fourth,
what was the other one?

27
00:00:59,945 --> 00:01:03,846
- One... Wait, one-fourth, 
three-fourths.

28
00:01:03,846 --> 00:01:05,483
- All right.

29
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:09,928
- 0.75 and 0.25, because
they're all part of quarters.

30
00:01:09,928 --> 00:01:11,988
Ah.

31
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:16,531
- Okay, quarters. I can think of, 
money. Quarters. Or...

32
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:18,772
- Yeah, 25 cents, 75 cents.

33
00:01:18,772 --> 00:01:21,895
- Yeah, 25 cents is one quarter.

34
00:01:21,895 --> 00:01:23,357
- 75 cents is three quarters.

35
00:01:23,357 --> 00:01:25,493
Three-quarters, one-quarter.

36
00:01:25,493 --> 00:01:27,757
- Excellent. Good, good. Ian?

37
00:01:27,757 --> 00:01:29,255
- Everything can be made a percent

38
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,062
or a fraction or a decimal.

39
00:01:31,062 --> 00:01:32,952
- Oooh. So you found a way

40
00:01:32,952 --> 00:01:35,990
to connect every single one of them.

41
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,217
So everything can be made
into... Say it again?

42
00:01:39,217 --> 00:01:41,690
- A percent, fraction or decimal.

43
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,571
- Interesting.

44
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:45,416
So you're saying that I can take

45
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:50,416
this percent and write
it as a, just a percent?

46
00:01:51,713 --> 00:01:53,136
Or as a... What else?

47
00:01:53,136 --> 00:01:55,398
- Fraction and decimal.

48
00:01:55,398 --> 00:01:57,162
- So, okay, he's connecting all. He thinks

49
00:01:57,162 --> 00:01:59,661
all three of them can become equivalent.

50
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,795
From the views before. 
Excellent, Ian.

51
00:02:01,795 --> 00:02:05,558
- Six-fourth, one-fourth and three-fourth, 
they all have a denominator of four.

52
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:08,262
- Ah, yeah.

53
00:02:10,702 --> 00:02:12,338
What does that mean that they all have

54
00:02:12,338 --> 00:02:14,581
a denominator of four?

55
00:02:16,518 --> 00:02:21,518
- Well, they're all like, sets of fourths.

56
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:25,114
- What does a denominator
represent in a fraction?

57
00:02:25,114 --> 00:02:27,611
- The, um...bottom number?

58
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:29,004
- When we write it as the bottom number,

59
00:02:29,004 --> 00:02:30,431
when we're literally writing it,

60
00:02:30,431 --> 00:02:33,404
what does it actually represent?

61
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:34,912
What's that for?

62
00:02:34,912 --> 00:02:36,872
- How many equal parts it's split into.

63
00:02:36,872 --> 00:02:40,145
- Ah, the number of equal
parts it's split into.

64
00:02:40,145 --> 00:02:41,469
So let me go back to Ian.

65
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:43,620
Ian is saying that
everything can be written

66
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,974
as also, as a fraction,
a decimal, and a percent.

67
00:02:45,974 --> 00:02:48,934 
So can everything be in four parts?

68
00:02:48,934 --> 00:02:52,753
What if it's in five parts?

69
00:02:52,753 --> 00:02:54,895
Does that matter?

70
00:02:54,895 --> 00:02:56,930
- I can do the five parts as a percent

71
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,625
or I can do four parts as a percent?

72
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,331
- Yeah.

73
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:03,051
- What about what Alan said?

74
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:06,171
Percent, is it up to a hundred
and that's it?

75
00:03:06,171 --> 00:03:09,526
- No, depends on the range
that you set it.

76
00:03:11,846 --> 00:03:13,548
- So can you give me an example

77
00:03:13,548 --> 00:03:17,685
of when something would be more than 100%?

78
00:03:18,505 --> 00:03:19,690
- Well, like, when something
you did in Earth Science

79
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,991
we did to see if our
grow-dino grew over 600%.

80
00:03:23,991 --> 00:03:25,337
- Good connection. Okay.

81
00:03:25,337 --> 00:03:26,219
So what did that mean

82
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:29,295
if it grew over 600%?

83
00:03:29,295 --> 00:03:33,694
- It, like, grew bigger than, times...

84
00:03:33,694 --> 00:03:35,459
- Over six hundred times its size?

85
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:40,036
- Yeah, 600 times its size. Okay.

86
00:03:40,036 --> 00:03:44,752
So is it possible, so is
that an improper percent?

87
00:03:44,752 --> 00:03:46,822
No, but we sort of get stuck into thinking

88
00:03:46,822 --> 00:03:50,934
that percent is 100%, 
meybe we can't go over 100%.

89
00:03:50,934 --> 00:03:54,051
What happened here?

90
00:03:54,051 --> 00:03:57,905
You tell me about that percent.

91
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,669
(Inaudible)

92
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:03,622
- It's less than one percent.
Is that possible?

93
00:04:03,622 --> 00:04:05,443
Can you think of a
real-life example

94
00:04:05,443 --> 00:04:09,109
when you'd have less than one percent?

95
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:12,002
(Classroom chatter)

96
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,951
600% when we're talking
about growing something

97
00:04:13,951 --> 00:04:15,345
expanding over and over,

98
00:04:15,345 --> 00:04:18,840
to 600 times its size.

99
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,310
Can you give a real-life example of

100
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,806
when I would have 0%?

101
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:24,863
- When you fail a test.

102
00:04:24,863 --> 00:04:28,810
- Oh. Well, I could fail a test with 64%.

103
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,003
What does it mean if
I fail a test with 0%?

104
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:37,686
Other than I'm in big trouble at home.

105
00:04:37,686 --> 00:04:38,428
What does it mean?

106
00:04:38,428 --> 00:04:40,646
What would that mean if
you failed it with 0%?

107
00:04:40,646 --> 00:04:42,782
What would that mean about
what you did on the test?

108
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,059
- You didn't get anything right.

109
00:04:44,059 --> 00:04:47,205
- Yeah, you got zero right, 
nothing right.

110
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:49,260
Didn't get a single question right.

111
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,445
Can it be less than zero?

112
00:04:52,445 --> 00:04:54,221
Is this less than zero?

113
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:55,588
- Yeah.

114
00:04:55,588 --> 00:04:57,122
- No.

115
00:04:57,122 --> 00:04:59,642
- It's less than one.

116
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:03,048
- So where is zero here?

117
00:05:03,048 --> 00:05:06,501
(Classroom chatter)

118
00:05:09,331 --> 00:05:11,406
- Tenths is that zeros?

119
00:05:11,406 --> 00:05:12,230
- No.

120
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,553
- Where's zeros?

121
00:05:13,553 --> 00:05:15,191
- Between.

122
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:16,108
- Where would they go?

123
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:18,394
Would they go in the
ones place, tens place...

124
00:05:18,394 --> 00:05:20,264
- Ones.

125
00:05:20,264 --> 00:05:23,906
- In the ones place. We have zero ones.

126
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:28,906
So is this less than zero?

127
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,804
- Yes.

128
00:05:31,804 --> 00:05:32,582
- No.

129
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,789
- No.

130
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:36,610
- No, because it's 0.1

131
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,944
(Classroom chatter)

132
00:05:37,944 --> 00:05:40,284
- Interesting, okay.

133
00:05:40,284 --> 00:05:43,483
So, can I have less than zero percent?

134
00:05:43,483 --> 00:05:45,305
- No. You can have a negative, but

135
00:05:45,305 --> 00:05:48,515
- If it's negative percent...

136
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,311
- Can you have a negative percent?

137
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:53,647
- What do you think?

138
00:05:53,647 --> 00:05:57,266
- Well, I was going to say
something could be, like,

139
00:05:57,266 --> 00:06:01,425
one point, like, point one percent

140
00:06:01,425 --> 00:06:04,755
less than something, if
you're comparing two things.

141
00:06:04,755 --> 00:06:06,740
- Okay, your percent of
increase or decrease,

142
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,934
have you looked at that
in Earth Science yet?

143
00:06:08,934 --> 00:06:10,474
Standard deviation? Okay.

144
00:06:10,474 --> 00:06:11,836
We'll talk about that somewhere else

145
00:06:11,836 --> 00:06:15,049
the percentage of increase-decrease. 
I'm talking about a negative

146
00:06:15,049 --> 00:06:17,272
increase in or decrease in percent.

147
00:06:17,272 --> 00:06:19,395
And whether that's below one or zero.

148
00:06:19,395 --> 00:06:21,288
Okay, so can you give an example

149
00:06:21,288 --> 00:06:22,855
of where this could occur?

150
00:06:22,855 --> 00:06:26,431
Where I can have less than 1%?

151
00:06:26,431 --> 00:06:29,113
- It can occur I think 
with that fraction.

152
00:06:29,113 --> 00:06:30,944
- Okay, but that's just a made up.

153
00:06:30,944 --> 00:06:32,986
Can you give me something in real life

154
00:06:32,986 --> 00:06:36,063
that I could have less than 1%?

155
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,118
You can have an example of 
more than 100%.

156
00:06:38,118 --> 00:06:41,763
So my question is, does
percent go from 100 to one,

157
00:06:41,763 --> 00:06:45,164
or zero, or is there
anything less in between?

158
00:06:45,164 --> 00:06:47,463
What do you think?

159
00:06:47,463 --> 00:06:50,864
- Like, a gas tank in your backyard.

160
00:06:50,864 --> 00:06:51,782
- Okay.

161
00:06:51,782 --> 00:06:56,782
- Like when you call in to get
it filled and it's really low.

162
00:06:57,075 --> 00:06:59,397
The meter's low, and under one.

163
00:06:59,397 --> 00:07:02,218
- Okay, that's typically not going to

164
00:07:02,218 --> 00:07:03,634
be measured in percent,
it's going to be measured

165
00:07:03,634 --> 00:07:05,434
in how many gallons for your tank,

166
00:07:05,434 --> 00:07:08,081
it's going to be a volume situation.

167
00:07:08,081 --> 00:07:08,882
- Oh.

168
00:07:08,882 --> 00:07:10,402
- Okay, but we'll talk about that.

169
00:07:10,402 --> 00:07:11,796
So let's keep that in mind.

170
00:07:11,796 --> 00:07:13,223
We're still trying to find an example

171
00:07:13,223 --> 00:07:15,615
when we have less than 1%.

172
00:07:15,615 --> 00:07:17,739
Think of one, Alice?

173
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:20,223
- Like, on the labels and
stuff on the vitamins,

174
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:24,277
less than 1% of your
recommended day or something.

175
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,876
- I just so happen to have here, vitamins.

176
00:07:26,876 --> 00:07:27,699
You're right.

177
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:29,755
And there are some examples when,

178
00:07:29,755 --> 00:07:31,113
if I take this, I'm not going to get

179
00:07:31,113 --> 00:07:33,822
my daily 1%, I'm going
to get less than that.

180
00:07:33,822 --> 00:07:37,479
But there's some of these
in here, ooh, like if I take

181
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:41,659
one of these I get 100% of vitamin C.

182
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:43,713
Now, I drank a glass of
orange juice this morning,

183
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,085
when I took my vitamin.

184
00:07:47,335 --> 00:07:49,831
What happened to the percent of vitamin C?

185
00:07:49,831 --> 00:07:50,992
Where's it at?

186
00:07:50,992 --> 00:07:52,419
- It went over 100.

187
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:54,300
- Over 100.

188
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,053
So, there's a real-life when I can

189
00:07:56,053 --> 00:07:58,753
get over 100% of something.

190
00:07:58,753 --> 00:08:01,741
Anybody get over 100%
on a quiz or test ever?

191
00:08:01,741 --> 00:08:04,031
Over?

192
00:08:04,031 --> 00:08:05,544
And, how do you get that?

193
00:08:05,544 --> 00:08:06,414
- Bonus.

194
00:08:06,414 --> 00:08:08,047
- Ah, bonus questions.

195
00:08:08,047 --> 00:08:10,884
So we're good with coming
up with more than 100%.

196
00:08:10,884 --> 00:08:11,948
But we're still trying to figure out

197
00:08:11,948 --> 00:08:12,978
if we can think of an example

198
00:08:12,978 --> 00:08:14,635
where it's less than one percent.

199
00:08:14,635 --> 00:08:16,410
So, we'll go back to that.

200
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,699
Any other connections?

201
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:18,918
Let's see if we can connect the ones

202
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:21,019
we haven't done yet.

203
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:24,382
Anything with the leftover ones?

204
00:08:24,382 --> 00:08:27,172
- One-fifth and 20% are equal.

205
00:08:27,172 --> 00:08:31,833
- Okay. Box right there.

206
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:35,079
They're equivalent to each other, right?

207
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:37,758
How did you know they were equivalent?

208
00:08:37,758 --> 00:08:40,965
- Because one-fifth of 100 is 20.

209
00:08:40,965 --> 00:08:44,185
- Okay, she did one-fifth
of 100, because we think of,

210
00:08:44,185 --> 00:08:47,471
again we keep going back
to a hundred for 100%,

211
00:08:47,471 --> 00:08:48,671
is 20 out of 100.

212
00:08:48,671 --> 00:08:50,134
Excellent. What else?

213
00:08:50,134 --> 00:08:52,316
- One-tenth and 10%.

214
00:08:52,316 --> 00:08:54,592
- Ah, what can you say
about one-tenth and 10%?

215
00:08:54,592 --> 00:08:55,869
- They're equivalent.

216
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,771
- Again, equivalent.

217
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,489
Going to go back to Ian.

218
00:09:00,489 --> 00:09:04,575
Ian, they're finding
the percent and the decimal,

219
00:09:04,575 --> 00:09:07,431
but there's no fraction there.

220
00:09:07,431 --> 00:09:12,431
Fraction with a percent, but
there's no decimal.

221
00:09:12,655 --> 00:09:14,381
Is there a third for all of them?

222
00:09:14,381 --> 00:09:15,944
You said there's an equivalent fraction,

223
00:09:15,944 --> 00:09:18,053
decimal, percent for all of them.

224
00:09:18,053 --> 00:09:18,750
- No.

225
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,703
- But there can be.

226
00:09:19,703 --> 00:09:21,325
- The decimal would be (inaudible)

227
00:09:21,325 --> 00:09:22,773
- So what would you like to add here, Ian?

228
00:09:22,773 --> 00:09:27,330
Let's go to the... which one? 
You pick one.

229
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,747
Find the equivalent relationship

230
00:09:28,747 --> 00:09:32,195
and see if we can find that
third piece we're missing.

231
00:09:34,655 --> 00:09:38,008
- Well, 150 and six-fourths is equal.

232
00:09:38,008 --> 00:09:39,812
- Okay.

233
00:09:41,252 --> 00:09:44,321
Do we think they equal each other?

234
00:09:44,321 --> 00:09:44,736
- No.

235
00:09:44,736 --> 00:09:45,431
- Yeah.

236
00:09:45,431 --> 00:09:47,664
- Yeah.

237
00:09:47,664 --> 00:09:48,773
- Convincing, but not yet,

238
00:09:48,773 --> 00:09:50,543
you haven't convinced everybody.

239
00:09:50,543 --> 00:09:54,123
(Classroom chatter)

240
00:09:55,405 --> 00:09:59,107
Do you think that equals...?

241
00:10:00,087 --> 00:10:03,679
Okay, four-fourths would equal 100%

242
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:06,308
- And one-fourth, each fourth is 25%

243
00:10:06,308 --> 00:10:07,714
and if it's two over, then

244
00:10:07,714 --> 00:10:09,676
- I've got two-fourths left over.

245
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:12,134
- And that'd be 50.

246
00:10:12,434 --> 00:10:14,556
- And they can also equal 0.5.

247
00:10:14,556 --> 00:10:18,359
- So now we need the decimal piece.

248
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:19,776
1.5. What did you say, Alan?

249
00:10:19,776 --> 00:10:22,817
- Uh, two-fourths can equal 0.5.

250
00:10:22,817 --> 00:10:24,849
- So what do you think six-fourths,

251
00:10:24,849 --> 00:10:26,996
give me the decimal that I'll put here.

252
00:10:26,996 --> 00:10:28,529
We agree that these are equal.

253
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:29,992
- 1.5.

254
00:10:29,992 --> 00:10:33,533
- Oh, so there is a
decimal that goes there.

255
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,076
- How'd you get 1.5?

256
00:10:35,076 --> 00:10:37,834
- Oh, because one and a half.

257
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:40,648
- Got it? See where the half came from?

258
00:10:40,648 --> 00:10:42,715
You said, Ruby, you had told us

259
00:10:42,715 --> 00:10:45,774
that one-half and five-tenths were equal.

260
00:10:45,774 --> 00:10:48,908
So, if we have that one-half here,

261
00:10:48,908 --> 00:10:49,813
we do the same thing,

262
00:10:49,813 --> 00:10:52,061
we combine it here to get the 50%.

263
00:10:52,061 --> 00:10:54,383
Okay. So, any others?

264
00:10:54,383 --> 00:10:56,321
What's the missing piece, Ian?

265
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:59,622
- Uh, you mean like
another decimal to put in

266
00:10:59,622 --> 00:11:01,108
or do you mean like, another...

267
00:11:01,108 --> 00:11:02,628
- Well, pick two that are equivalent

268
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:05,902
and give me the missing third piece.

269
00:11:05,902 --> 00:11:10,326
- One in one-thousands.

270
00:11:10,326 --> 00:11:12,093
- One thousandths.

271
00:11:12,093 --> 00:11:15,968
- One thousandths and 0.1%.

272
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:17,466
- Ah. Are these equivalent?

273
00:11:17,466 --> 00:11:18,649
- No.

274
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:20,047
- Yes.

275
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,488
- No.

276
00:11:22,798 --> 00:11:23,955
- You're going to have
to convince them, Ian.

277
00:11:23,955 --> 00:11:26,021
It's the day of Ian
convincing, I don't know.

278
00:11:26,021 --> 00:11:28,423
- They are.

279
00:11:28,423 --> 00:11:31,977
- Why do you say they are?

280
00:11:31,977 --> 00:11:35,703
- Because one percent over a hundred...

281
00:11:35,703 --> 00:11:39,174
(Classroom discussion)

282
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:47,115
- Well, because that's tenth,
that's not thousandths.

283
00:11:47,965 --> 00:11:52,965
- It's not one-tenth, it's
one-tenth of a percent.

284
00:11:53,842 --> 00:11:56,230
So, here's another question then.

285
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,495
Are those equivalent?

286
00:12:00,495 --> 00:12:01,273
- No.

287
00:12:01,273 --> 00:12:02,851
- No. So be careful.

288
00:12:02,851 --> 00:12:05,649
That's not one-tenth, that's
one-tenth of a percent.

289
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:07,832
So could one tenth of
a percent be the same as

290
00:12:07,832 --> 00:12:10,270
one one-thousandths?

291
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,917
- Yes.

292
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:13,893
- Yeah, but when you divide it by 100.

293
00:12:13,893 --> 00:12:16,190
- Ah, so we keep hearing,
divide and multiply by a hundred,

294
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:21,190
so when I convert from
a percent to a decimal,

295
00:12:21,297 --> 00:12:23,214
or percent to a fraction,

296
00:12:23,214 --> 00:12:25,094
I'm using powers of what?

297
00:12:25,094 --> 00:12:25,963
- Ten.

298
00:12:25,963 --> 00:12:26,587
- Ten.

299
00:12:26,587 --> 00:12:30,983
So the question is: Is that
the equivalent to that?

300
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:32,040
- Yeah.

301
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,315
- How do you want to do it, Ava?

302
00:12:34,315 --> 00:12:36,637
- Um.

303
00:12:36,637 --> 00:12:38,158
- Can you fill in the missing piece?

304
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:39,760
Can you give me the equivalent decimal

305
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,639
to try to convince me
to go from here to here,

306
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,659
with a missing decimal that I have?

307
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:46,772
I have the percent and I have the fraction

308
00:12:46,772 --> 00:12:48,977
but we think we're going to
get all three of them.

309
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,020
Can you tell me what decimal that is?

310
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:55,199
- Um, zero and one-thousandth?

311
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:57,092
- How did you get that?

312
00:12:57,092 --> 00:12:58,519
- Um, divide by 100.

313
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:00,711
- Ah. Dividing by 100.

314
00:13:00,711 --> 00:13:01,768
What do you notice happens

315
00:13:01,768 --> 00:13:03,532
when we divide by 100?

316
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,891
- It goes back.

317
00:13:04,891 --> 00:13:07,051
- Okay, when we divide it...

318
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:08,529
- It moves two decimal places.

319
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:10,666
- And the decimal place
moves two places over.

320
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,210
So did that happen?

321
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,971
So, are we convinced that
these three are now equal?

322
00:13:15,971 --> 00:13:17,423
- Yes.

323
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:19,478
- Can we see that now?

324
00:13:19,478 --> 00:13:22,588
- But you divide 0.1%

325
00:13:22,588 --> 00:13:24,488
you divide it by a hundred to get...

326
00:13:24,488 --> 00:13:25,584
Oh yes, you're changing it back

327
00:13:25,584 --> 00:13:28,839
because you multiply a decimal
by 100 so you have that. Okay.

328
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:33,216
- Yeah. Now that Ava gave us the decimal,

329
00:13:33,216 --> 00:13:35,096
is it easier to convince ourselves that

330
00:13:35,096 --> 00:13:37,662
all three are equivalent to each other?

331
00:13:37,662 --> 00:13:38,521
- Yes.

332
00:13:38,521 --> 00:13:39,740
- Because now you when you read that,

333
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,738
you read it as what?

334
00:13:40,738 --> 00:13:44,500
One and one one-thousandths.

335
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,916
So are we convinced that we can find

336
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:48,284
an equivalent fraction, decimal, percent

337
00:13:48,284 --> 00:13:53,093
for every fraction, every
decimal and every percent?

338
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:54,510
- Yes.

339
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,426
- So why do we have all three?

340
00:13:56,426 --> 00:13:58,660
Why not do everything in fractions,

341
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:02,197
do everything in percents,
or do everything in decimals?

342
00:14:02,197 --> 00:14:07,197
Why do we have, in real life,
all three things going on?

343
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:09,934
- Alice?

344
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:11,269
- Because for some things it's easier

345
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:15,299
to picture it in percent, in decimal.

346
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:18,255
- Okay, so picturing a
visual to go with it,

347
00:14:18,255 --> 00:14:20,589
can you think of an example of one we use

348
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:22,411
or, in real life?

349
00:14:22,411 --> 00:14:24,837
- Well, like with money.
It's like easier to think

350
00:14:24,837 --> 00:14:27,967
that it's going to be 25 cents or 0.25

351
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:30,079
than like, 25% of a dollar.

352
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,668
Yeah, wouldn't that be
interesting if they said,

353
00:14:32,668 --> 00:14:34,723
how much is that salad today?

354
00:14:34,723 --> 00:14:37,475
Well, it's something percent of a dollar.

355
00:14:37,475 --> 00:14:38,577
- Okay, Ian?

356
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:39,751
- Well, with fractions,

357
00:14:39,751 --> 00:14:44,695
one-third is equal to 0.333 and keep going.

358
00:14:44,695 --> 00:14:48,689
- Ah, so if we did with
fractions or decimals,

359
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:53,689
we might have some repeating...
