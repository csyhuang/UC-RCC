00:00:17,236 --> 00:00:20,200
[background chatter]

2
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:46,270
- I'm not too sure if I like this screen
print with the acrylic on top of it. I'm

3
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,970
not too sure about that.

4
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,190
- It makes it less
[inaudible].

5
00:02:54,339 --> 00:03:08,150
- It's different, in an awkward way. I
don't know how to explain it. It doesn't

6
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:19,200
have any depth to it. It has no dimension.
Like, she's standing there, he has to take

7
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,990
the paint and try to add dimension to it
and then. . .

8
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,510
- It looks like she's laying down.

9
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,130
- Actually, yeah it does. I mean, he has
to take the paint and try and add

10
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:34,997
dimension to it, and then add the cool and
warm colors to make it pop. And I'm just

11
00:03:34,997 --> 00:03:39,790
not feeling it. I like the Mick Jagger
one, but I'm not feeling this Taylor Swift

12
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,458
one.

13
00:03:43,711 --> 00:03:47,073
[cross talk]

14
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:22,680
- See, I like pop art. I just, I don't
know.

15
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,475
- Did you notice that?
- What?

16
00:04:24,475 --> 00:04:29,170
- I thought it was a green that goes in
to, this. That's on them, it's more like a

17
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:36,481
quiet, like she's sleeping softness. But I
didn't notice it that it goes into purple,

18
00:04:36,481 --> 00:04:42,078
periwinkle, and this dark violet color
that comes out of this red on the bottom

19
00:04:42,078 --> 00:04:45,830
half side. Did you see that? Then it goes
in to two, and he breaks off the colors

20
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,648
And it's like
[inaudible].

21
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,833
- All right, let's take a couple of
minutes and try to just wrap up some of

22
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:08,033
our questions. And then we'll talk about a
whole group discussion, and see what we

23
00:05:08,033 --> 00:05:10,682
all have and what we want to write.

24
00:05:31,327 --> 00:05:34,462
[background chatter]

25
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:29,670
- In a sense, it would be a good picture
for the stance that she's in. You know,

26
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:35,170
the title of the album is called
"Fearless," and we decided that it is a

27
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:43,970
powerful stance she does look kinda
fearless. In the way she's standing. The

28
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,789
way he did it, it just doesn't look like
her.

29
00:06:47,643 --> 00:06:48,897
- [inaudible]

30
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,110
- It's like the wind's coming back and it
pushes her hair. . .

31
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:00,390
- Yeah, but you would think that she would
want to be looking directly at the camera.

32
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:04,060
- But then her hair wouldn't have been
like that.

33
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,860
- Yeah, but they just need some big ole
fans, it's Hollywood. You can get some big

34
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,110
ole fans to blow your hair back. You would
wanna be looking at the camera if you want

35
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:12,910
to be looking fearless.

36
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,300
[cross talk]

37
00:07:16,097 --> 00:07:17,110
- You have to think. . .

38
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:23,180
- It's more of country music. I mean, I
could see if you were saying like,

39
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,220
hip-hop, pop. And you get like all
forceful, "What's Up, I'm here."

40
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:33,140
- But they're saying, you know, she's a
pop icon. If she's a country artist, then

41
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,900
why are they putting her on pop billboards
and pop charts?

42
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,510
- Because she's mainstreaming into the
different areas, she's creating kind of a

43
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:48,680
new version of country for the younger
generations like you guys. You wouldn't

44
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,910
compare her to Kenny Chesney. Those who
want newer generation of country.

45
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,134
- Right.

46
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,891
- All right, let's just try and get to our
last question and then we'll talk about

47
00:08:01,891 --> 00:08:04,287
whole group and get you back in here.

48
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,320
Let's go ahead and start, you guys can

49
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,810
chime in when you guys have an answer, if
you want your input put in. So let's just

50
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:59,430
talk about the describe section. What we
really need to talk about is describing

51
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,570
the scene in your own words. What kind of
words would you use to describe this

52
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,940
piece? Let's start with Mick Jagger.

53
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,690
- Bold.

54
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,470
- Bold.

55
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,788
- Proud.

56
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,930
- Proud.

57
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,500
- Electric.

58
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:22,000
- Electric. Okay, those are good ones.
What about Taylor Swift?

59
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,585
- It's more feminine. More soft

60
00:09:31,193 --> 00:09:34,660
- It's pale, it's delicate and
[inaudible].

61
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,080
- Delicate.

62
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,355
- Soft.
- You said soft.

63
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:51,630
- It's like he's almost scared when he's
doing Taylor Swift, compared to Mick

64
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:58,010
Jagger. Because Mick Jagger is all rough
and boxes everywhere.

65
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:05,910
- I think he almost makes Taylor look
almost intimidated. She's kind of pushing

66
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,554
away--
- The position.

67
00:10:08,554 --> 00:10:12,640
- . . .and you have all these colors
around her. With the selection and. . .

68
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,952
- Innocence. Yeah, I think we talked about
that with Taylor a little bit. You kind of

69
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:19,859
have to look at the personality of each
artist as well.

70
00:10:19,859 --> 00:10:23,280
- Plus really you have to listen to her
lyrics then it, like, paints a picture.

71
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,996
- She has an innocent expression.

72
00:10:26,996 --> 00:10:30,829
- I'd say innocent, yeah. Okay.

73
00:10:32,157 --> 00:10:34,163
- Fierce.

74
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,108
- You say fierce? Okay.

75
00:10:38,108 --> 00:10:47,194
- It's like her personality, she just
breaks it out with this bold pose.

76
00:10:47,194 --> 00:10:53,127
- All right good. So those are some good
words, key words to describe it. So,

77
00:10:53,127 --> 00:10:58,245
analyzing. Let's figure out and pinpoint
specific elements and principles of design

78
00:10:58,245 --> 00:11:00,304
that we see in the piece that we want to
discuss.

79
00:11:00,304 --> 00:11:02,649
- Colors.

80
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:07,660
- Colors? Color's a big one. In both of
them actually.

81
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,510
- Paint strips?

82
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:15,660
- The paint strips, it looks like it's a
lot of paint. It kind of creates a lot of

83
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:21,220
movement, with the way that it's flowing
through the pieces. All right, so our big

84
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:21,910
ones are color. . .

85
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:25,080
- He said in the video color is
everything.

86
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:30,960
- And that's his main focus is color.

87
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:37,230
- The different colors make the value in
the picture, the dark colors make the

88
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:41,150
darker shades, and light colors.

89
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:53,957
- He uses more bold colors in Mick Jagger
than he did in Taylor. And like the

90
00:11:53,957 --> 00:12:00,781
contrasting colors of Mick Jagger are more
loud.

91
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:10,440
- I'd definitely say it's louder. Okay,
good. Let's discuss the movement a little

92
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:18,230
bit. So if you look at it, I see a lot of
movement personally in the touch with the

93
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:21,520
hair. I like how the hair is like that and
I like her position from the side, because

94
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,060
I think it adds interest. Like I was
saying a second ago, if she was looking

95
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,930
straight forward, I don't think the hair
would have the same effect as it does from

96
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:34,080
the side. And that's just my personal
opinion, but I like how the hair is kind

97
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:38,370
of flowing through and it's creating the
movement through the piece. And then with

98
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:45,040
the Mick Jagger one, the movement in this
piece right here is really interesting to

99
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:50,790
me. How he chose the green and the red to
contrast each other. I think that's big

100
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:59,930
bold move in this area. Good.
Now what are our focal points?

101
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:00,980
- Faces.

102
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:07,910
- Faces? And what are the big things that
factor in for that? Why is that? What did

103
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,784
he do?

104
00:13:09,784 --> 00:13:12,040
- The colors around her make her pop.

105
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:21,450
- The colors surrounding. If you look, the
face is white right here, and then her

106
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:29,260
skin tone is pale as well. So that kind of
pops out against the bold colors. What do

107
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:35,350
you guys think about the materials?
The silk screen and the acrylic paint? You

108
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:39,820
guys got to see a little bit of him
working in the video, where he gets those

109
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,570
huge rows of the acrylic paints from the
jars, and just dipped in a couple

110
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:48,003
different ones. And just started coloring.
So what do you guys think about his

111
00:13:48,003 --> 00:13:50,360
process, and the materials he uses?

112
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:56,885
- He doesn't really choose what direction,
he just kind of goes with the flow.

113
00:13:56,885 --> 00:14:01,665
- It's very free, if you watch him.
- [inaudible].

114
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:13,208
- Mindless. Mindless creativity. He does
what comes to him, which is interesting.

115
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,890
Any other comments about the actual
process or materials?

116
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:23,536
- I think It would have been more amazing
if he didn't use the silk screens.

117
00:14:23,536 --> 00:14:26,529
- So you'd rather him just paint it than
add the silk screen?

118
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:29,251
- I think it would be more like a wow
factor.

119
00:14:29,251 --> 00:14:36,111
- And some of his pieces are just
paintings. More of the people though, like

120
00:14:36,111 --> 00:14:44,480
the Rollins he painted. . .
And the ones he did for President Obama.

121
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:51,000
President Reagan, some of the Statue of
Liberty. And also some of the other people

122
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:56,989
like Aerosmith, and the Beatles as well.
And he's usually famous for painting

123
00:14:56,989 --> 00:15:00,000
his faces. And he would go into the color.
