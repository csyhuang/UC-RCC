1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,963
- [Stephen] From the top.

2
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:03,588
- [Paul] This way?

3
00:00:03,588 --> 00:00:05,250
- [Stephen] Starting from the top.

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,320
Woo hoo!

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,009
- [Paul] That went better.

6
00:00:09,235 --> 00:00:11,190
(Background Chatter)

7
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,662
- [Paul] Can we have a ruler?

8
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:16,180
- [Girl] Yeah.

9
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,617
- [Stephen] 75.

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,915
- [Teacher] Okay, make sure you record it. 75 what?

11
00:00:26,915 --> 00:00:28,186
- [Paul] 75 cm

12
00:00:28,186 --> 00:00:29,869
- [Teacher] C-M. What's C-M stand for?

13
00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:31,065
- [Paul] Centimeters!

14
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:32,167
- Centimeters.

15
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:34,042
- [Student] Okay, now we've got to get the average.

16
00:00:34,042 --> 00:00:35,551
- [Student] I'm gonna do the average.

17
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:37,131
- [Teacher] Go ahead, go to your next one.

18
00:00:37,131 --> 00:00:39,020
I'm gonna check on the next group.

19
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,618
- [Student A] Okay, no you don't
put 75 for all of them.

20
00:00:41,618 --> 00:00:43,128
- [Paul] I'm not.

21
00:00:43,128 --> 00:00:45,709
- [Stephen] Just on that one. We knew
it wouldn't go any farther.

22
00:00:46,093 --> 00:00:48,827
Just put 75 for the first one.

23
00:00:48,936 --> 00:00:50,765
- [Paul] Second part.

24
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:52,345
- [Stephen] Trial two.

25
00:00:55,342 --> 00:00:57,391
Now, what do we do?

26
00:00:59,697 --> 00:01:02,978
- [Teacher] Okay, go ahead. Tell
me what you found out?

27
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:05,189
What did you discover about bubble wrap,

28
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:09,630
sand paper, wax paper
and just the plain ramp?

29
00:01:09,681 --> 00:01:12,764
- [Brunette Girl] On the bubble wrap, it didn't go.

30
00:01:12,764 --> 00:01:14,891
Because it was a bumpy surface.

31
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:17,626
Because all the bumps,
because it was too bumpy

32
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:19,877
and had to much friction.

33
00:01:20,207 --> 00:01:22,244
- [Teacher] Too much friction, okay.

34
00:01:22,354 --> 00:01:24,764
And so, what did you discover, Sean?

35
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,883
- [Sean] I discovered that on the sand paper

36
00:01:26,883 --> 00:01:30,499
it got higher and lower

37
00:01:31,164 --> 00:01:34,052
- [Teacher] What do you mean by that,
higher and lower, and higher?

38
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:36,833
Can you explain that
a different way to me?

39
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:55,898
- [Sean] well-- (Background Chatter)

40
00:01:56,869 --> 00:01:59,906
- [Teacher] So what does that say about the surface?

41
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:03,291
- [Sean] (Background Chatter)

42
00:02:03,565 --> 00:02:05,558
- [Teacher] Increase and decrease.

43
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,753
Spencer, what did you discover?

44
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:11,341
- [Spencer] So--(Background Chatter)

45
00:02:22,826 --> 00:02:26,083
- [Teacher] So it went farther on plain
wrap versus the wax paper?

46
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:27,524
- [Spencer] Yeah.

47
00:02:27,531 --> 00:02:29,265
- [Teacher] Okay, so, right now 
you're going to find

48
00:02:29,265 --> 00:02:30,836
the average, right?

49
00:02:30,836 --> 00:02:33,136
How are you gonna find the average?

50
00:02:35,296 --> 00:02:40,296
- [Spencer] Like 32 plus, plus 30,
plus 41, divided by three.

51
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:43,845
- [Teacher] Okay, you guys go ahead and do that.

52
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:46,044
Who's going to be the calculator?

53
00:02:46,044 --> 00:02:47,043
- [Sean] I am.

54
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:48,297
- [Teacher] You are? Okay.

55
00:02:48,297 --> 00:02:51,025
I might suggest someone
else also be the calculator,

56
00:02:51,025 --> 00:02:53,440
so you can compare your numbers,

57
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,216
and then I'm gonna come back

58
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,178
and talk to you about your results. Okay?

59
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:10,750
- [Teacher] Okay, let's sit down.
Let's see what your doing.

60
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:14,145
- [Student] It's not going very
good on the sand paper.

61
00:03:14,145 --> 00:03:16,346
- [Paul] Because it's just like the carpet.

62
00:03:16,456 --> 00:03:19,747
- [Teacher] Why won't it go as far on sandpaper?

63
00:03:19,903 --> 00:03:22,545
- [Paul] Because it's like the carpet.

64
00:03:22,678 --> 00:03:25,285
- [Teacher] Okay, what does that
tell you about friction?

65
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,360
- [Paul] That if it's sand paper it
doesn't have a lot of contact--

66
00:03:30,862 --> 00:03:32,947
- [Girl] It rubs against the rug.

67
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,100
- [Stephen] It rubs against the tires--

68
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,473
I think it doesn't--

69
00:03:37,502 --> 00:03:39,557
- [Teacher] One person at a time. Paul?

70
00:03:39,557 --> 00:03:42,710
- [Paul] Because it rubs up against the tires

71
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:45,066
and it doesn't have a lot of friction.

72
00:03:45,095 --> 00:03:49,582
If it did have a lot of
friction it would go faster.

73
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:54,959
- [Teacher] Okay, so does sand paper have
friction, or not? Yes or no?

74
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:56,722
- [Students] No. No.

75
00:03:56,994 --> 00:03:58,208
- [Students] (Reconsider) Yes.

76
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,441
- [Teacher] What is friction?

77
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:02,137
One person at a time.

78
00:04:02,137 --> 00:04:04,442
- [Paul] It's like...whoosh.

79
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:06,868
- [Teacher] That's friction? Hm.

80
00:04:07,087 --> 00:04:10,636
Okay, can you explain,
what is your idea, Stephen?

81
00:04:10,836 --> 00:04:12,549
Friction?

82
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:15,542
- [Stephen] When a car rolls on carpet,

83
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:18,492
it's friction because it slows it down.

84
00:04:18,741 --> 00:04:21,547
Sand paper slows it down, too.

85
00:04:23,413 --> 00:04:27,072
- [Teacher] So far, what have you
discovered about friction,

86
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,647
and wax paper versus sand paper?

87
00:04:30,757 --> 00:04:32,499
- [Paul] Wax paper--

88
00:04:32,499 --> 00:04:34,275
- [Teacher] Let's let Stephen tell me, okay?

89
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:36,540
- [Stephen] Wax paper is, kinda like,

90
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,452
it's probably gonna be like the...

91
00:04:40,162 --> 00:04:43,261
- [Teacher] Look at your numbers and what
have you discovered so far?

92
00:04:43,261 --> 00:04:44,838
Because you already recorded them.

93
00:04:44,838 --> 00:04:46,696
- [Girl] It's the highest so far.

94
00:04:46,696 --> 00:04:48,693
- [Teacher] What does that mean,
it's the highest so far?

95
00:04:52,183 --> 00:04:56,223
- [Stephen] It's the one that has the
least amount of friction.

96
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,153
- [Teacher] It has the least
amount of friction, okay?

97
00:04:59,153 --> 00:05:00,952
And how do you know that?

98
00:05:00,952 --> 00:05:04,001
- [Stephen] Because we did the experiment.

99
00:05:04,052 --> 00:05:05,794
- [Teacher] And what happened?

100
00:05:05,794 --> 00:05:07,947
- [Stephen] It didn't go as far...

101
00:05:08,092 --> 00:05:11,000
- [Teacher] It didn't go as far on what?

102
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:15,796
- [Stephen] (Background Chatter)

103
00:05:18,571 --> 00:05:21,472
- [Teacher] Okay, go ahead an
finish your experiment.

104
00:05:21,472 --> 00:05:23,928
Go ahead and finish on the plain ramp,

105
00:05:23,928 --> 00:05:26,272
you have one more to do, I see here.

106
00:05:26,272 --> 00:05:30,109
Okay? And then we'll talk
about what we should do next.

107
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:41,011
- [Student] Oh, 39.

108
00:05:48,486 --> 00:05:51,459
- [Teacher] That's showing you more
about fourth dimension.

109
00:05:51,906 --> 00:06:11,885
(Background Chatter)

110
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:15,258
- [Teacher] Let's talk about our results.

111
00:06:15,628 --> 00:06:20,017
Talk about your results
that you've noticed. Sh.

112
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:24,568
Stephen, Tanner, I need to be
able to hear this group, okay?

113
00:06:25,138 --> 00:06:29,243
- [Sean] We found now, that our total

114
00:06:30,962 --> 00:06:33,186
averaged out to 85cm.

115
00:06:43,679 --> 00:07:01,695
- [Sean] (Background Chatter)

116
00:07:01,695 --> 00:07:04,229
- ...for our total average.

117
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:07,438
- [Teacher] Okay, what does this tell
you? Look at your averages.

118
00:07:07,651 --> 00:07:09,736
What does this tell you about friction?

119
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:12,804
- [Brunette Girl] That friction slows you down,

120
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:18,107
like the salt slows you down on ice.

121
00:07:19,363 --> 00:07:23,567
Like the plain ramp is kinda like the ice.

122
00:07:24,502 --> 00:07:26,743
It makes you go faster.

123
00:07:26,743 --> 00:07:28,732
- [Teacher] Right, and you know what
it's doing outside, right now?

124
00:07:28,732 --> 00:07:30,383
What is it doing outside right now?

125
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:31,793
- [Brunette Girl] It's sleeting.

126
00:07:31,793 --> 00:07:33,256
- [Teacher] It's sleeting, it's snowing,

127
00:07:33,256 --> 00:07:35,747
and the roads are very, very slick.

128
00:07:35,938 --> 00:07:38,933
So, what do you think's
gonna be a great idea,

129
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:41,022
because I know my husband's
coming home from work tonight.

130
00:07:41,022 --> 00:07:43,717
The roads are gonna be slippery.

131
00:07:43,717 --> 00:07:47,059
What's gonna happen so
they can create friction

132
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:49,167
so the roads are safer?

133
00:07:49,253 --> 00:07:50,959
What should the road crews do?

134
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,238
- [Students] Salt.

135
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,978
- [Teacher] They can put salt and ...?

136
00:07:53,978 --> 00:07:55,440
- [Students] Salt and sand.

137
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,054
- [Teacher] Salt and sand. Yes.

138
00:07:57,054 --> 00:07:59,824
- [Spencer](Background Chatter)

139
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,056
- [Teacher] Why?

140
00:08:03,056 --> 00:08:10,000
- [Spencer] (Background Chatter)

141
00:08:10,287 --> 00:08:11,833
- [Teacher] So it didn't go at all?

142
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,165
I wonder if it was small,
little bubble wrap,

143
00:08:14,165 --> 00:08:16,070
if it would work better?

144
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,938
What do you think?

145
00:08:17,938 --> 00:08:19,971
- [Sean] I think if they were popped--

146
00:08:19,971 --> 00:08:24,056
- [Teacher] Oh, if they were popped, I
wonder if they would. Maybe so.

147
00:08:24,056 --> 00:08:26,472
Okay, down here you have a graph

148
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:29,049
that we're gonna talk
about a little bit later.

149
00:08:29,049 --> 00:08:31,057
But this is what I want you to do:

150
00:08:31,057 --> 00:08:32,949
I want you to pretend
like you're a teacher,

151
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:35,767
and if you were going to
tell someone one thing

152
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:39,591
that you learned today from
this experiment that we did.

153
00:08:39,591 --> 00:08:41,003
What would you tell them?

154
00:08:41,003 --> 00:08:42,744
I want you to write it
on the back of here.

155
00:08:42,744 --> 00:08:44,857
What's one thing that you've learned today

156
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,436
that you would teach someone

157
00:08:46,436 --> 00:08:48,474
and then we're gonna talk about it, okay?

158
00:08:48,596 --> 00:08:50,743
I want you to talk about
it when you're done writing,

159
00:08:50,743 --> 00:08:52,136
talk about it with each other

160
00:08:52,136 --> 00:08:54,255
and I'll be back in a minute, okay?

161
00:08:58,485 --> 00:09:00,924
- [Spencer] We can share when we're done writing.

162
00:09:00,924 --> 00:09:03,554
- [Sean] Or we can share them as we write them.

163
00:09:04,146 --> 00:09:06,857
So, what would we tell someone?

164
00:09:09,737 --> 00:09:12,377
- (Background Chatter)

165
00:09:14,647 --> 00:09:19,144
- [Spencer] I would say friction on the ramp

166
00:09:22,014 --> 00:09:25,374
would make something go slower.

167
00:09:29,414 --> 00:09:31,624
What would you say?

168
00:09:31,994 --> 00:09:35,343
- [Brunette Girl] I would say the rougher the
surface, the more friction.

169
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:41,151
- [Sean] I would say something
about the same thing

170
00:09:41,151 --> 00:09:44,270
that you guys were saying,
except a little bit different.

171
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,789
I would say...

172
00:09:49,428 --> 00:09:54,078
it depends on which kind of surface it is.

173
00:09:54,556 --> 00:09:56,407
If it's bumpy,

174
00:09:57,857 --> 00:09:59,344
it won't go.

175
00:09:59,344 --> 00:10:02,089
If there's bumps and air all over on it.

176
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,433
If it's a smooth and soft surface,

177
00:10:05,565 --> 00:10:08,334
it will probably go a lot faster.

178
00:10:16,237 --> 00:10:19,520
- [Teacher] So, tell me what you--
are you still writing?

179
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,183
- [Sean] We all shared it.

180
00:10:21,183 --> 00:10:22,882
- [Teacher] Okay, but I want to see it in writing.

181
00:10:22,882 --> 00:10:25,370
Like I want to see something written down.

182
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,454
- [Brunette Girl] I said the bumpier the surface
the more friction it makes.

183
00:10:28,609 --> 00:10:30,857
- [Teacher] Okay-- (Background Chatter)

184
00:10:31,105 --> 00:10:33,462
Spencer, what are you gonna write?

185
00:10:33,462 --> 00:10:36,893
- [Spencer] Because I'm gonna write kind
of the same thing as Heather.

186
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:39,000
- [Teacher] Is there anything your
gonna change about it?

187
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,878
Or add to it?

188
00:10:42,728 --> 00:10:45,192
- [Spencer] I'm gonna say the bumpier

189
00:10:46,952 --> 00:10:49,033
the ramp is

190
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,908
the more friction

191
00:10:51,995 --> 00:10:57,982
and the less... and the less

192
00:10:58,095 --> 00:11:00,599
further it goes.

193
00:11:00,964 --> 00:11:03,444
- [Teacher] Okay, I like that.

194
00:11:04,686 --> 00:11:07,239
I think you guys are
learning a lot about this.

195
00:11:07,593 --> 00:11:10,200
Sean, I see your writing
something a little bit different.

196
00:11:10,344 --> 00:11:12,492
What are you writing?

197
00:11:12,492 --> 00:11:14,936
- [Sean] I'm writing the smoother the surface,

198
00:11:14,988 --> 00:11:17,316
the farther the car goes.

199
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,938
- [Teacher] You guys are right. The
farther it goes. Because why?

200
00:11:20,989 --> 00:11:22,882
- [Sean] Because the friction,

201
00:11:24,332 --> 00:11:28,460
because the surface is too bumpy

202
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,205
and it has a lot of friction

203
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:36,563
so it was causing it to not go.

204
00:11:37,393 --> 00:11:39,763
But on a smoother surface--

205
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:44,312
(Background Chatter)

206
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,703
- [Teacher] Barely any what?

207
00:11:51,683 --> 00:11:54,964
What word is she looking for?

208
00:11:55,201 --> 00:11:57,778
She said on a smoother surface
there's barely any friction.

209
00:11:57,778 --> 00:11:59,102
And I like what you said.

210
00:11:59,102 --> 00:12:01,488
You said "A smooth surface is like ice."

211
00:12:01,644 --> 00:12:04,193
A smooth surface is like ice, right?

212
00:12:04,616 --> 00:12:07,756
- [Brunette Girl] I said the bumpier the
surface, the more friction.

213
00:12:07,821 --> 00:12:09,723
- [Teacher] Right, but you also said, something,

214
00:12:09,723 --> 00:12:12,772
that if it was a smooth
surface, it's kinda like ice.

215
00:12:12,797 --> 00:12:14,855
There's no friction to keep it from,

216
00:12:14,855 --> 00:12:18,333
like if it's outside today,

217
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:21,874
if it's ice, your car could go anywhere,

218
00:12:21,925 --> 00:12:24,340
but putting sand down or
the salt, keeps it ...

219
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,306
- [Brunette Girl] Less friction.

220
00:12:27,382 --> 00:12:29,965
- [Teacher] More, it has more friction.

221
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:34,110
Okay. Okay, go ahead and finish. What?

222
00:12:34,242 --> 00:12:35,635
What do you want?

223
00:12:35,635 --> 00:12:39,734
- [Sean] I wonder what would
happen if you tried snow

224
00:12:40,254 --> 00:12:43,564
and see if it would run on
snow and then we tried ice.

225
00:12:43,564 --> 00:12:45,642
- [Teacher] Oh, so how would be do that?

226
00:12:45,642 --> 00:12:47,314
I like that. How would we do it?

227
00:12:48,574 --> 00:12:52,396
- [Sean] When it's like an icy day or something

228
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,357
and there's a little bit of ice somewhere,

229
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:58,120
we could bring the car out or something,

230
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,676
not like a real car--

231
00:12:59,676 --> 00:13:00,639
- [Teacher] Oh, okay. (Chuckles)

232
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,184
- [Sean] Just like a play car--

233
00:13:02,184 --> 00:13:03,321
- [Teacher] And try it out.

234
00:13:03,321 --> 00:13:04,621
- [Sean] Try it out on ice

235
00:13:04,621 --> 00:13:06,037
and then they would put a little snow

236
00:13:06,037 --> 00:13:07,373
and then we would try

237
00:13:07,373 --> 00:13:11,848
and see if it would go faster
on the snow or on the ice.

238
00:13:12,074 --> 00:13:14,257
- [Teacher] How could we change this experiment?

239
00:13:14,257 --> 00:13:16,300
What could we do next time
if we wanted to change it

240
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,663
to find something different out?

241
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,258
- [Brunette Girl] I think you could use a plain surface

242
00:13:21,798 --> 00:13:26,798
and you could probably
use popped bubble wrap.

243
00:13:28,594 --> 00:13:30,742
- [Teacher] We talked about that. 
Popped bubble wrap,

244
00:13:30,742 --> 00:13:32,471
and what else did you say?

245
00:13:32,471 --> 00:13:36,000
The bubble wrap could be what?

246
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,080
Talk about that, the
bubble wrap could be what?

247
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,644
Guys, I need you to not come in here.

248
00:13:47,384 --> 00:13:52,074
- [Brunette Girl] You can use 
un-popped bubble wrap

249
00:13:52,344 --> 00:13:54,511
and you can use the tile,

250
00:13:54,891 --> 00:13:58,627
and you probably use, like
a grid with the marbles.

251
00:13:58,627 --> 00:14:01,362
Instead you can, like, use a car.

252
00:14:02,168 --> 00:14:05,182
- [Teacher] Okay, talk about that.

253
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,591
- [Brunette Girl] To see if it would fall off.

254
00:14:07,591 --> 00:14:08,971
- [Teacher] Now, what would be the purpose

255
00:14:08,971 --> 00:14:10,748
to see if it would fall off?

256
00:14:10,748 --> 00:14:12,826
With force and motion,
how does that tie in?

257
00:14:12,826 --> 00:14:17,826
- [Brunette Girl] Well, what I mean is,
will it like go far...

258
00:14:19,174 --> 00:14:23,513
- [Sean] If you make a ramp
and you try to get it on

259
00:14:23,565 --> 00:14:26,571
and wanted to see if it
would fall off or not...

260
00:14:26,571 --> 00:14:28,429
- [Brunette Girl] Like if it was on the--

261
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:30,724
- [Sean] It depends how fast it would go,

262
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,617
if it went faster would it fall off?

263
00:14:34,317 --> 00:14:37,347
- [Teacher] But if we're talking about friction,

264
00:14:37,357 --> 00:14:40,094
does this have anything
to do with friction?

265
00:14:41,654 --> 00:14:54,504
- [Spencer](Background Chatter)

266
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:59,996
- [Teacher] Oh, I love that. So,
wood, carpet, and ice.

267
00:15:00,365 --> 00:15:03,303
And we could freeze ice, because
we have big containers...
