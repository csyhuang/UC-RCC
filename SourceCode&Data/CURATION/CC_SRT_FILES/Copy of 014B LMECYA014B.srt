1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,030
- [Instructor] Clipart. Okay. You show me
... well, if we wanted to insert a Clipart

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:09,160
picture, where do you think would be
the best place to go? Click on insert. And

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:14,310
then where is Clipart? Here you go. And I
bet you we're going to find some really

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,840
cool spider pictures. Click on spi-- type
in spiders and see what you come up with.

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:35,060
Hold on, I'll be right over. Yes. Wow,
look at all those spiders. You have tons.

6
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,720
Oh, your project's gonna be neat 'cause
you have all kinds of neat pictures.

7
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,390
- Um... I think something in our
computer is off.

8
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:45,440
- Okay. Let's turn this off. These
computers sometimes get a little fussy and

9
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,440
it's making bad choices.

10
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,156
- When I get 'em, I just keep pressing
enter.

11
00:00:51,156 --> 00:00:55,600
- Well, it's sort of like hitting an
elevator button. But you can't really make

12
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,820
it go any faster, but you feel a little
better about click, click, click, click,

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,770
click. So, go ahead and look over here.
Hopefully that will come up a

14
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,950
little faster. Sometimes it just is a
little slow. Start with... there you go.

15
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,230
You know what to do.
- Okay, there's a big picture.

16
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,670
- That's a huge picture. That's a neat
spider. I think that'll be a neat one for

17
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,000
your... for your project. Yeah.

18
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:22,070
- Okay. Um well, when we... when we
clicked on the... uh... and it asked

19
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,430
if we wanna include pictures from all the
ones before...

20
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:25,600
- Yeah. We did want to do that.

21
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,360
- We did? And we clicked no.

22
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:35,110
- Okay. So that's probably why. Okay. So
let's go onto Clipart office online and

23
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,630
you're going to be able to find some
really neat pictures here, too. This is

24
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:42,620
the same thing. Type in squirrel. Let's
see what we find. Make sure you spell it

25
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:42,990
correctly.

26
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,111
- Q-U-I-R-R-E.
- It's a hard word.

27
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:47,746
- I-R-R-E.

28
00:01:47,746 --> 00:01:50,290
- And then the color.
- Can I put S?

29
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,209
- Doesn't matter.

30
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:53,250
- Hit scroll or anything.

31
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,470
- Okay. And see what you can find. Look at
all those squirrels.

32
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,050
- You should pick that one, a moving one?
- Yeah.

33
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,817
- Okay. So, you copy it to your clipboard.
Now here's the problem. You need to

34
00:02:05,817 --> 00:02:24,160
accept the service agreement and you'll
have to do it again. Yes. Okay. Now, click

35
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,220
on your scroll and add it to your
clipboard.

36
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,730
- Three times.

37
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,660
- I... I know. Did you copy it to the
clipboard? Did you click on it? Okay. Then

38
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,230
go back to PowerPoint. Let's see if it
works.

39
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:33,600
- Uh.

40
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,540
- You know how to copy and paste
things, so go ahead and paste it in there.

41
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,160
- [together] Yay.

42
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,910
- He'll move, but not right now. When you
go to... make him a little bigger,

43
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,560
though, I would say.

44
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,130
- Make him fat.

45
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,750
- Now, you can check to see how he's
doing. If you wanna go to your

46
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:57,700
slideshow... and from the beginning and
see if he'll move for you. There he goes.

47
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,461
- [together] Yay.
- See? Now you know he worked.

48
00:02:59,461 --> 00:03:00,290
- Yay.

49
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,000
- Good job.
