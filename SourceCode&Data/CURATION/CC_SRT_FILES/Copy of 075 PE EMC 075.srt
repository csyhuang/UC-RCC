1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,140
- [Instructor] All right. So, I showed you
all that video for three reasons. Number

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:10,901
one, I want you to see that volleyball is
not a girl's sport. Here in the South a lot of

3
00:00:10,901 --> 00:00:16,040
people think of volleyball as a girl sport
because we don't have a lot of male high school

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:23,210
volleyball teams. I don't know why, we just
don't. That's a common misconception, that

5
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:29,250
volleyball is a girl's sport. Everybody in
that video was a male. Everybody in that

6
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:38,930
video was over 50 years of age. That means
volleyball is a lifetime activity. Raise

7
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:43,411
your hand if you can take a guess at what
a lifetime activity is. Yes ma'am.

8
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:48,091
- [Girl] A lifetime activity is something
you can do when you're older.

9
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:50,790
- [Instructor] A lifetime activity is
something you can do basically for the

10
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,220
rest of your life. Would golf be a
lifetime activity?

11
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,761
- [Students together] No.

12
00:00:54,761 --> 00:00:56,441
- [Instructor] Golf?
- [Students together] Yes.

13
00:00:58,121 --> 00:01:01,390
- [Instructor] Golf would be a lifetime
activity. There's people 70, 80, 90 years

14
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:05,650
old that are playing golf. As a matter of
fact, playing golf is an accomplishment,

15
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:10,280
to be able to go out and shoot your age.
So, I'm if I'm 70 and I go out and shoot a

16
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,581
70 on a golf course, I've done pretty
good. Golf is a lifetime activity.

17
00:01:13,581 --> 00:01:15,991
How about bowling?
- [Student together] Yes.

18
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:17,701
- [Instructor] How about tackle football?

19
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:19,290
- [Students together] No.

20
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,630
- [Instructor] No. Tackle football would
not be a lifetime activity. If I was to go

21
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,670
to the YMCA, do you think I would be able
to find a league to sign up for tackle

22
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,411
football at my age?
- [Students together] No.

23
00:01:27,411 --> 00:01:29,691
- [Instructor] No. Can I go out to the
YMCA and find a

24
00:01:29,691 --> 00:01:33,611
volleyball league for somebody my age?

25
00:01:33,611 --> 00:01:35,161
- [Students together] Yeah.

26
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:36,280
- [Instructor] Yes. So, volleyball is what
we consider a lifetime activity. Something

27
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:42,201
you can do the rest of your life. Okay, the
third thing, those guys were pretty good.

28
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:43,800
- [Students together] Mmhmm.

29
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,580
- [Instructor] And they were pretty
athletic. So by playing volleyball and

30
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:53,160
staying active, you're going to be more
athletic than a lot of people that are

31
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,730
your age. So, not only is volleyball a
lifetime activity, it's going to help you

32
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:03,980
stay in shape, help you stay active, okay?
First thing we're going to do is the serve.

33
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:08,690
With the serve there are a few things we need
to remember, okay? First thing I want us to

34
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:13,480
remember with the serve is that the ball
must stay at the waist. When we hit it out

35
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,860
of our hand, we want it to stay at our
waist. If I hold the ball up here and I

36
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:24,150
hit, the ball is going to go up. It's all
about the angles, okay? If I hit the ball right

37
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:29,410
here it's going to go up and out like I want 
it to go, all right? So, then I want to hit it

38
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:34,210
at my waist. Second thing that we're going
to remember is that my opposite foot needs

39
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:40,660
to be forward. If I hit it with my right
hand, I want my left leg to be up front,

40
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:46,961
like this. What other activities have we
done that your opposite foot is forward?

41
00:02:46,961 --> 00:02:49,431
Yes?
- [Boy] Catching.

42
00:02:49,431 --> 00:02:54,960
- [Instructor] Throwing, right? With the
overhand throw we step with our opposite

43
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,911
foot. What else? Yes, ma'am?

44
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:59,191
- [Girl] The underhand toss.

45
00:02:59,191 --> 00:03:02,840
- [Instructor] The underhand toss, that is
exactly right. I think Ms. Beldo

46
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,511
taught y'all the underhand toss. Step,
tick-tock point.

47
00:03:05,511 --> 00:03:07,241
Which foot do we step with?

48
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:08,800
- [Students together] The opposite.

49
00:03:09,081 --> 00:03:10,771
- [Instructor] The opposite foot. Do you
see a trend? Can you make a little

50
00:03:10,771 --> 00:03:16,410
connection there? Opposite foot forwards, okay?
Now, the next things that I want you to

51
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:22,330
remember kind of go hand in hand. They are
tick-tock. Tick-tock looks like this.

52
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:30,210
Tick. Tock. Pretty easy, right? Tick.
Tock. Tick, I want to pull it back. Back

53
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,630
here. Tock, our arm is coming forward.
Now, we are going to add a little

54
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:39,970
something to the tock part. All the tock,
when we do tock, I want you standing like

55
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:49,950
this and do tock. When we do tock, we are
actually going to transfer our weight from

56
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,430
our back foot going forward into the front
foot. What do you think that's going to

57
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,871
do? If we transfer that weight forward.
Yes?

58
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:57,461
- [Boy] If we transfer our weight forward
it's going to put more pressure.

59
00:03:57,461 --> 00:03:59,591
- [Instructor] It's going to put more
pressure on the ball. Am I plugging it

60
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:01,471
harder or softer?
- [Students together] Harder.

61
00:04:01,471 --> 00:04:05,940
- [Instructor] Harder. It's going to
produce more force. Right? I'm going to

62
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:13,060
hit the ball harder if I do this than if I
do this. Does that make sense? Because

63
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,840
you're getting that momentum going
forward. It's just like in baseball. If

64
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,210
I'm playing baseball and I'm standing in
the outfield, am I going to throw it

65
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:23,881
harder if I do this or if I do this?

66
00:04:23,881 --> 00:04:25,381
- [Student] The one with more force.

67
00:04:25,381 --> 00:04:29,020
- [Instructor] The second one, right?
Because my momentum is going forward. Does

68
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,520
that make sense? So, my momentum is going
forward. Just like in four square. If I'm

69
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,990
playing four square and I want to hit the
ball and I'm trying to get somebody out in

70
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,951
four square am I going to hit it harder if
I do this or if I do this?

71
00:04:40,951 --> 00:04:42,891
- [Student] That.

72
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:46,050
- [Instructor] The second one. I get my
force from the momentum going forward.

73
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,610
That's right, and the last thing I want
you to remember with the serve is the

74
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:55,120
follow through. Follow the ball, John will
you stand up please? If I want the ball to

75
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,070
go to John, my follow through should be
towards John, right? If I want the ball

76
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,861
going towards the flag, my follow
through...

77
00:05:03,861 --> 00:05:05,500
- [Students together] The flag.

78
00:05:05,641 --> 00:05:07,201
- [Instructor] ...towards the flag. If I
want the ball going to the cougar,

79
00:05:07,201 --> 00:05:08,831
my follow through...

80
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:10,381
- [Students together] The cougar.

81
00:05:10,381 --> 00:05:12,020
- [Instructor] ...going to the cougar. But
right now we're working on hitting it

82
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:17,620
straight so my follow through goes to my
target. Watch, see me take everything out.

83
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,461
Ball's at my waist, my opposite foot is
forward, tick...

84
00:05:20,461 --> 00:05:21,981
- [Student] Tock.

85
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:26,860
- [Instructor] Tock, just like that. Okay?
We'll do it a little bit farther. Ready,

86
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:35,350
John? Opposite foot forward, ball at the
waist, tick, tock. All right. Did you see

87
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:39,380
everything that we had just talked about?
Opposite foot forward, ball at the waist,

88
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,731
tick, transfer my weight into tock.
All right.

89
00:05:53,751 --> 00:05:55,551
- [Instructor] You're kind of hitting it
like that.

90
00:06:12,361 --> 00:06:14,391
- [Student] I hit it.
- [Instructor] Good. That's great.

91
00:06:14,391 --> 00:07:47,000
[Background noises of students practicing volleyball]

92
00:07:47:000 --> 00:08:00,000
Tony, you ready? ...Tony? You ready?
Tossin' it up and hittin' it...

93
00:08:02,821 --> 00:08:07,060
- And stop just a second, put
the ball on the ground. Ball on the

94
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:17,480
ground. A lot of people are doing a good
job getting that opposite food forward,

95
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,750
but they're not transferring their weight
to that foot, they're getting that

96
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,200
opposite foot forward and they're standing
like this. Am I going to generate much

97
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,700
force by doing this?

98
00:08:26,821 --> 00:08:28,400
- [Students together] No.

99
00:08:28,581 --> 00:08:31,340
- [Instructor] Think about baseball. I
could step with that opposite foot, but if

100
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,721
I step and then throw is that helping me
generate any force?

101
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:37,251
- [Students together] No.

102
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:41,881
- [Instructor] No. I want to step into it.
Same way in baseball. When I throw a

103
00:08:41,881 --> 00:08:47,000
baseball, I want to step and throw at the
same time to get my momentum going

104
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:55,841
forward. We're generating force. So,
instead of... Tony, are you ready? Instead

105
00:08:55,841 --> 00:09:03,280
of this, opposite foot forward and...like
that. I want to generate more force, so

106
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,481
I'm going to start with my weight back
here and go into it. You see the

107
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:09,101
difference? Ball on the ground please.
- [Students together] Yes.

108
00:09:09,101 --> 00:09:14,581
So, work on generating that
force going forward. Okay? Continue. Go.

109
00:09:14,581 --> 00:10:42,231
[Background noises of students practicing volleyball]

110
00:10:42,231 --> 00:10:43,891
And... stop just a second. Ball on the ground.

111
00:10:49,331 --> 00:10:54,350
All right. One more way that
we're going to try to generate force is by

112
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:58,990
following through after we hit the ball.
So, instead of... Alex, are you ready? I'm

113
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:05,300
going to serve this to you. Instead of
doing this, kind of almost like you're

114
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:12,910
punching the ball and stopping, I'm going
to follow through to my target. If Alex is

115
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:19,610
my target, my arm should finish up here at
my target. Watch. Do you see the

116
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:24,290
difference in the force between punching
it and following through to your target?

117
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:30,810
So, that's another thing to work on. Remember, 
if you are doing a good job with the ball

118
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:37,210
that you've got, you can switch to another
ball. If you've got one of these big

119
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:42,230
yellow ones and you're doing perfect every
time I would recommend switching to either

120
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:47,510
this or one of the yellow and blue ones.
Challenge yourself a little bit. Let's go

121
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:54,010
ahead and switch stations so that if you
were here, one person walk up here and get

122
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:59,500
a clipboard and paper so you can leave
notes for your partner. If you were over

123
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,011
there, come over here.

124
00:12:09,921 --> 00:12:12,441
- If you weren't over here just put your
clipboard on the steps there.

125
00:12:12,441 --> 00:14:19,941
[Background noises of students practicing volleyball]

126
00:14:19,941 --> 00:14:25,691
- And everybody stop. Put the
ball on the ground just a second. No balls

127
00:14:25,691 --> 00:14:32,960
in the air. Everybody stand up. Everybody
stand up. Alright, put everything on the

128
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:40,520
ground. Everybody should have to free
hands. Together, let's work on tick,

129
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:47,060
transfer your weight through to your
target. Ryan, go in his place. Tick, arm

130
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:51,930
back, transfer weight, follow through to
your target. I still see some people doing

131
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,521
this. Where's that ball going to go?

132
00:14:54,521 --> 00:14:56,100
- [Students together] That way.

133
00:14:56,271 --> 00:15:02,160
- [Instructor] That way. If I'm aiming at
the... Ball on the ground. If I'm aiming

134
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:11,430
at the white poster, my follow through is
to the white poster. Everybody pick out a

135
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,641
target. Tick, step, follow through. Go.
Pick out a target, tick,

136
00:15:14,641 --> 00:15:16,301
step, follow through.

137
00:15:16,301 --> 00:15:43,841
[Background noises of students practicing volleyball]

138
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:45,521
- Go get that ball.
We'll get you another ball.

139
00:15:52,471 --> 00:15:55,220
Who can raise their hand
and tell me the first thing we need to

140
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,491
remember for the volleyball serve.
Yes, sir?

141
00:15:57,491 --> 00:15:59,601
- [Boy] [Inaudible] 

142
00:16:01,531 --> 00:16:03,231
- [Instructor] The first thing we talked
about. Yes, ma'am?

143
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,461
- [Girl] [Inaudible] 
- [Instructor] The ball should be at your-

144
00:16:07,461 --> 00:16:08,981
- [Students together] Waist.

145
00:16:08,981 --> 00:16:12,071
- [Instructor] The ball's at your waist.
And what is that going to impact? And

146
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,661
what's it going to influence?

147
00:16:13,661 --> 00:16:15,300
- [Boy] How far the ball goes.

148
00:16:15,421 --> 00:16:17,451
- [Instructor] It's going to influence how
far the ball goes. All right? So, if the

149
00:16:17,451 --> 00:16:20,261
ball is up here, it's going to go where?

150
00:16:20,261 --> 00:16:21,800
- [Students together] Up.

151
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,381
- [Instructor] Up. If I'm down here, the
ball's going to go...

152
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,540
