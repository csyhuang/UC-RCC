1
00:00:01,995 --> 00:00:03,440
- [Child on screen] Look, I can be a serk (sic).

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,039
♫ Now, my whole house, is great

3
00:00:07,039 --> 00:00:09,222
♫ I can do anything good

4
00:00:09,222 --> 00:00:12,263
♫ I like my school, I like anything

5
00:00:12,263 --> 00:00:14,469
♫ I like my dad, I like my cousins

6
00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:17,557
♫ I like my aunts, I like my Allisons

7
00:00:17,557 --> 00:00:20,181
♫ I like my mom, I like my sister

8
00:00:20,181 --> 00:00:21,892
♫ I like my dad

9
00:00:22,742 --> 00:00:26,342
♫ I like my hair, I like my hair cuts

10
00:00:26,342 --> 00:00:29,087
♫ I like my pajamas, I like my stuff

11
00:00:29,087 --> 00:00:30,503
♫ I like my room

12
00:00:30,503 --> 00:00:33,824
♫ I like my whole house!

13
00:00:33,824 --> 00:00:36,276
♫ My whole house is great

14
00:00:36,276 --> 00:00:38,163
♫ I can do anything good

15
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,312
♫ Yeah, yeah, yeah

16
00:00:40,312 --> 00:00:42,861
♫ I can do anything good

17
00:00:44,451 --> 00:00:46,465
♫ Better then anyone ♫

18
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:50,597
(Laughter from students)

19
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:52,059
- [Teacher] Okay.

20
00:00:54,499 --> 00:00:57,113
Ok, what'cha learn from the video?

21
00:00:57,113 --> 00:00:58,343
- [Female Student] She can do anything.

22
00:00:58,343 --> 00:00:59,783
- [Teacher] Ok, what else?

23
00:00:59,783 --> 00:01:01,154
- [Boy] She likes to sing.
- [Girl] Be positive.

24
00:01:01,154 --> 00:01:02,920
- [Teacher] She likes
to sing, be positive.

25
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,509
What else?

26
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:04,814
What else did you learn about the video?

27
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:05,963
- [Female student] Believe in yourself.

28
00:01:05,963 --> 00:01:06,779
- [Teacher] Believe in yourself.

29
00:01:06,779 --> 00:01:08,525
Okay now how is this going to be

30
00:01:08,525 --> 00:01:10,367
related to our yearbook class?

31
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:11,899
- [Female student] Stay positive about it.

32
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:14,755
People get a... what's gonna--
what the outcome's gonna be.

33
00:01:14,755 --> 00:01:17,077
- [Teacher] Okay, and the outcome
is something that we wanna

34
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,236
be able to serve the entire school.

35
00:01:19,236 --> 00:01:23,456
Okay, what else? How is this
also related to yearbook

36
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:25,371
and what we're trying to accomplish?

37
00:01:25,371 --> 00:01:26,347
- [Girl in turtleneck] We shouldn't blame ourselves?

38
00:01:26,347 --> 00:01:27,925
- [Teacher] I'm sorry?

39
00:01:27,925 --> 00:01:29,086
- [Girl in turgleneck] We shouldn't blame ourselves?

40
00:01:29,086 --> 00:01:30,425
- [Teacher] Okay, good, good.

41
00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:33,537
Okay, so what we're
going to do after this

42
00:01:33,537 --> 00:01:36,764
this is a good start, I
think, for the work that

43
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:38,877
we're gonna be having
to do this afternoon.

44
00:01:38,877 --> 00:01:40,711
We're gonna have to work on our ladder.

45
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:43,242
And I know that we've
spent some time on it,

46
00:01:43,242 --> 00:01:45,657
we've had to make some
considerable changes.

47
00:01:45,657 --> 00:01:47,352
But I think that the compromise..

48
00:01:47,352 --> 00:01:50,417
the agreement that we all
talked about yesterday,

49
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:53,074
I think it can be implemented today.

50
00:01:53,074 --> 00:01:57,091
So what we're gonna try
to do, is based on...

51
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:02,543
These are the signatures,
that we have allocated.

52
00:02:04,993 --> 00:02:07,291
One signature for elementary school.

53
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:09,126
One signature for middle school.

54
00:02:09,126 --> 00:02:12,144
And five signatures for the high school.

55
00:02:12,144 --> 00:02:14,628
I think let's try to fit it in.

56
00:02:14,628 --> 00:02:16,927
Let's try to stay within
the seven signatures.

57
00:02:16,927 --> 00:02:19,667
Don't forget, we have ads also.

58
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:23,705
Okay, so I think Tanisha, and...

59
00:02:25,455 --> 00:02:26,971
Dustin, and...

60
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:28,903
Jazz, will be on team one.

61
00:02:28,903 --> 00:02:31,445
And Sammy, Emily, and

62
00:02:31,445 --> 00:02:33,931
Colleen, will be on team two.

63
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:35,574
Let's work together.

64
00:02:35,574 --> 00:02:39,354
What are the rules of
getting the teamwork going?

65
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:41,981
When we're trying to discuss,

66
00:02:41,981 --> 00:02:44,349
What are the things that
I want you to think about?

67
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:46,160
- [Girl in gray] Everyone has a voice.

68
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,809
- [Teacher] Okay, everyone has a voice.

69
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:48,412
What else?

70
00:02:48,412 --> 00:02:50,270
- [Female student] We all have to agree

71
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,547
to a middle ground.

72
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:52,267
- [Teacher] Okay.

73
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:53,544
- [Female student] And it's not just for

74
00:02:53,544 --> 00:02:55,053
the high school seniors.

75
00:02:55,053 --> 00:02:57,723
- [Teacher] Okay, so it's for the entire school.

76
00:02:57,723 --> 00:02:59,581
The elementary school, middle
school and high school.

77
00:02:59,581 --> 00:03:02,414
So let's be fair, and try
to get everybody involved.

78
00:03:02,414 --> 00:03:03,180
What else?

79
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,130
Discussion-wise, among yourselves.

80
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,313
What would I like you to be working on?

81
00:03:08,143 --> 00:03:09,821
Collaborative work?

82
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:11,191
Compromise?

83
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,421
(Students agreeing)

84
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:15,501
- [Teacher] Okay, let's go ahead and start.

85
00:03:15,501 --> 00:03:17,498
You have the books there,

86
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:19,518
you have copies of the previous ladder.

87
00:03:19,518 --> 00:03:21,584
Let's get it good.

88
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,817
(Students discuss among themselves)

89
00:03:30,005 --> 00:03:30,555
-[Teacher] Yeah?

90
00:03:30,555 --> 00:03:32,429
- [Female student] I understand, elementary school,

91
00:03:32,429 --> 00:03:33,885
middle school, high school.

92
00:03:33,885 --> 00:03:34,940
In what order--

93
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,730
- [Teacher] It's up to you honey.

94
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,302
If you want to start
with the middle school,

95
00:03:37,302 --> 00:03:39,642
elementary school, high school.

96
00:03:41,842 --> 00:03:43,996
- [Girl in gray shirt] I don't know, maybe
just 'cause I'm a senior,

97
00:03:43,996 --> 00:03:45,716
I kinda like that plan.

98
00:03:45,716 --> 00:03:49,088
- [Girl in turtleneck] It just seems weird 
starting at the elementary school.

99
00:03:49,088 --> 00:03:50,305
I think it's just that, they're

100
00:03:50,305 --> 00:03:52,095
not as important, just that--

101
00:03:52,095 --> 00:03:53,383
- [Girl in gray shirt] 'Cause it's always
started at high school.

102
00:03:53,383 --> 00:03:55,379
It starts with the seniors and it's like

103
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:56,731
this is what, for--

104
00:03:56,731 --> 00:04:00,516
- [Teacher] Okay now, remember, just
because it's always done before--

105
00:04:00,516 --> 00:04:01,603
- [Girl in gray shirt] I know but--

106
00:04:01,603 --> 00:04:04,084
- [Girl in turtleneck] If we started with
the elementary school,

107
00:04:04,084 --> 00:04:05,779
We'd be starting with the fourth grade.

108
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,117
And that's really our--

109
00:04:07,117 --> 00:04:10,149
- [Girl in gray shirt] Kind of an 
awkward place to start.

110
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:11,663
- [Teacher] Okay, now remember with your signature,

111
00:04:11,663 --> 00:04:13,730
you were gonna start with Student Life, correct?

112
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:14,705
With the High School?

113
00:04:14,705 --> 00:04:16,052
So you could start with that.

114
00:04:16,052 --> 00:04:18,377
I mean look at it and you can see.

115
00:04:20,077 --> 00:04:23,193
(Students continue discussion)

116
00:04:27,663 --> 00:04:28,981
- [Girl in blue] And then we're 
gonna start it with,

117
00:04:28,981 --> 00:04:30,791
like the introduction...

118
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:34,331
Um, like, um...

119
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:34,992
- [Boy in red] Pictures.

120
00:04:34,992 --> 00:04:36,421
- [Girl in blue] Student life, candid shots.

121
00:04:36,421 --> 00:04:37,118
- [Teacher] Right.

122
00:04:37,118 --> 00:04:40,059
- [Girl in blue] And then we're going to the

123
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:44,780
seniors and all the senior
stuff, and our classes.

124
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,246
And then the sports and night clubs?

125
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:48,291
- [Girl in pink] Yes.

126
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:53,152
- [Girl in gray shirt] We're
not gonna have a class...

127
00:04:53,922 --> 00:04:56,732
class division page, anymore.

128
00:04:56,732 --> 00:04:58,456
'Cause all of the classes are scrambled.

129
00:05:01,536 --> 00:05:05,159
Are we still thinking,
like, doing division pages?

130
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:07,458
Like how it was worded originally?

131
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,697
Except, not for the classes.

132
00:05:09,697 --> 00:05:12,182
Because all the classes were split up.

133
00:05:12,182 --> 00:05:15,280
- [Teacher] Yeah, now it makes it easier

134
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,648
to do your "me", right?

135
00:05:17,648 --> 00:05:20,527
Don't forget, what's our theme?

136
00:05:20,527 --> 00:05:21,900
- [Students] "Me".

137
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,421
- [Teacher] Okay, so keep that it mind

138
00:05:23,421 --> 00:05:24,541
when you're creating your signatures.

139
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:27,629
And I think, now that solicited more...

140
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:31,965
allocated, the sections are allocated.

141
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:36,014
Your division pages--
maybe more adaptable.

142
00:05:36,014 --> 00:05:36,948
- [Male student] They'll fit in there more.

143
00:05:36,948 --> 00:05:37,854
- [Teacher] Yeah. They'll fit in there more.

144
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:39,002
Don't ya think?

145
00:05:40,212 --> 00:05:40,859
- [Girl in gray shirt] I guess.

146
00:05:40,859 --> 00:05:41,718
(Teacher laughs)

147
00:05:41,718 --> 00:05:43,575
- [Girl in turtleneck] So should we 
just do one, like

148
00:05:43,575 --> 00:05:45,990
just high school division
page, then middle school--

149
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,566
- [Teacher] Yes, try it and see.

150
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:48,646
See.

151
00:05:48,646 --> 00:05:51,663
Now you might still need a
division page for sports,

152
00:05:51,663 --> 00:05:53,242
you might still need a division page.

153
00:05:53,242 --> 00:05:55,355
But you don't need as many.

154
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,307
I think--

155
00:05:56,307 --> 00:05:58,838
- [Girl in gray shirt] We definitely won't
have one for the classes.

156
00:05:58,838 --> 00:06:00,433
'Cause they're all split up.

157
00:06:00,433 --> 00:06:01,813
- [Teacher] They're already split up.

158
00:06:03,243 --> 00:06:04,602
And I think this is
what helped save us pages.

159
00:06:04,602 --> 00:06:07,016
Remember, you're getting eight signatures.

160
00:06:07,016 --> 00:06:08,393
- [Girl in gray shirt] Um, Question.

161
00:06:08,393 --> 00:06:09,369
- [Teacher] Yeah.

162
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,132
- [Girl in gray shirt] The yearbook, 
two pages and ads

163
00:06:12,132 --> 00:06:13,502
is under the high school?

164
00:06:15,092 --> 00:06:16,641
- [Teacher] Only because, I just put that as

165
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:20,851
just to remind you that we need
to have ads at the very end.

166
00:06:20,851 --> 00:06:21,850
- [Girl in gray shirt] Okay.

167
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,189
- [Teacher] So whatever, is your last section,

168
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:27,046
you have to have ads.

169
00:06:27,046 --> 00:06:29,090
We have to start selling ads.

170
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,453
And again, if you have any
questions on the photographs,

171
00:06:34,453 --> 00:06:36,520
Sammy is here she can help you

172
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,935
with what ever photograph you want.

173
00:06:41,165 --> 00:07:04,928
(student's continue to discuss)

174
00:07:05,948 --> 00:07:08,257
- [Boy in red](whispering question)

175
00:07:09,097 --> 00:07:10,895
(Teacher giggles)

176
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,329
- [Girl in blue] Show the blood drive scales.

177
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:19,537
And then...

178
00:07:22,127 --> 00:07:34,229
(Continued debate)

179
00:07:36,301 --> 00:07:38,636
- [Girl in turtleneck] But their only 
sport is the seventh grade basketball.

180
00:07:38,636 --> 00:07:40,746
Everything else is going into high school.

181
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:46,220
- [Teacher] Does it make sense?

182
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,125
- [Boy in red] Yeah, yeah.

183
00:07:51,225 --> 00:07:53,513
- [Girl in turtleneck] They all happened
right there, together.

184
00:07:58,953 --> 00:08:02,347
- [Boy in red] Are we still gonna do straight lines,

185
00:08:02,347 --> 00:08:04,321
and single lines like they did?

186
00:08:04,321 --> 00:08:07,489
- [Female Student] I think we might
just do a big column.

187
00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:08,464
- [Girl in blue] Yeah.

188
00:08:08,464 --> 00:08:11,320
- [Girl in pink] We can still do that,
and then after our seniors,

189
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,898
we can explore all the classes in line.

190
00:08:17,078 --> 00:08:18,168
- [Teacher] And it makes sense?

191
00:08:18,168 --> 00:08:19,840
If you have that quote.

192
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,783
- [Students] Yeah.

193
00:08:28,506 --> 00:08:30,178
- [Girl in blue] We are gonna do...

194
00:08:33,188 --> 00:08:35,339
"Student Life", seniors,

195
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:38,348
all the senior stuff,

196
00:08:38,348 --> 00:08:40,206
And then classes?

197
00:08:42,806 --> 00:08:45,352
- [Teacher] Make sure that you
have your page counts.

198
00:08:46,452 --> 00:08:48,302
- [Girl in gray] Are doing
school division pages or are we

199
00:08:48,302 --> 00:08:49,404
doing section division pages?

200
00:08:51,824 --> 00:08:54,664
- [Girl in turtleneck] I guess we could 
do school, and then--

201
00:08:54,664 --> 00:08:55,787
We would have to have the

202
00:08:55,787 --> 00:08:57,226
division pages that we thought of--

203
00:08:57,226 --> 00:09:00,765
the spread division page
with all the things.

204
00:09:00,765 --> 00:09:04,654
It could just be different
little division pages.

205
00:09:04,654 --> 00:09:06,814
- [Girl in gray] Yeah, okay, so...

206
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:07,936
- [Girl in turtleneck] Or like, have 
the title at the top of the page.

207
00:09:13,526 --> 00:09:15,576
(Students listing divisions to each other quietly)

208
00:09:24,736 --> 00:09:25,805
- [Teacher] Don't forget,

209
00:09:25,805 --> 00:09:28,122
she has control of the photographs.

210
00:09:28,122 --> 00:09:30,858
So you need to consult with her, okay?

211
00:09:30,858 --> 00:09:32,163
You can ask her.

212
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:36,853
- [Girl in gray shirt] Okay, um.

213
00:09:37,853 --> 00:09:39,679
- [Girl in turtleneck](whispered question)

214
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:48,085
- [Girl in gray] So are we going 
to do a senior opening page?

215
00:09:53,995 --> 00:09:55,576
- [Girl in turtleneck] I think we could just 
have... an opening page, on the division page.

216
00:10:01,436 --> 00:10:03,215
- [Girl in blue] I thought we were going 
to do the top.

217
00:10:07,445 --> 00:10:13,421
(Both groups debate to themselves)

218
00:10:14,229 --> 00:10:15,698
- [Girl in blue] Instead
of doing a collage,

219
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,716
how they put in their, like, the song

220
00:10:18,716 --> 00:10:20,341
and all that on the second page.

221
00:10:20,341 --> 00:10:23,685
Around all the photos, we should put--

222
00:10:23,685 --> 00:10:27,987
'Cause, in our theme or
whatever, it's just a strip.

223
00:10:27,987 --> 00:10:29,591
Of pictures.

224
00:10:29,591 --> 00:10:30,775
Blended in the big picture.

225
00:10:34,115 --> 00:10:37,649
So we're have written
around it, to add in these.

226
00:10:39,219 --> 00:10:41,134
So I think that we should put these,

227
00:10:41,134 --> 00:10:43,144
on the first, opening page.

228
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:45,872
- [Teacher] Now remember, we did
this only because...

229
00:10:49,832 --> 00:10:51,142
we had no choice.

230
00:10:51,142 --> 00:10:54,346
- [Girl in blue] I like, well I like, 
the happenings

231
00:10:54,346 --> 00:10:55,995
that we decided not to do,

232
00:10:55,995 --> 00:10:58,266
for the opening page for the seniors.

233
00:10:58,266 --> 00:10:59,686
Because, it's new life.

234
00:10:59,686 --> 00:11:02,646
Since our theme, it's just one strip.

235
00:11:03,316 --> 00:11:05,926
We could arrange it like this.

236
00:11:05,926 --> 00:11:08,572
I think that we should put, on that page,

237
00:11:08,572 --> 00:11:09,734
we should put these.

238
00:11:09,734 --> 00:11:10,732
- [Teacher] Oh, definitely.

239
00:11:10,732 --> 00:11:12,195
Yeah, good idea.

240
00:11:12,195 --> 00:11:14,215
Well, what happened, is the reason

241
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,560
why I placed it and you placed it here

242
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,528
because when you sort it all originally,

243
00:11:20,528 --> 00:11:22,989
it was so empty, and it
didn't mean anything,

244
00:11:22,989 --> 00:11:25,497
so, we went ahead and did that.

245
00:11:26,967 --> 00:11:28,812
- [Boy in red] I think it would have
been better to do that

246
00:11:28,812 --> 00:11:30,157
from the beginning.

247
00:11:32,117 --> 00:11:33,898
- [Teacher] And then we can have 
Alex start doing

248
00:11:33,898 --> 00:11:35,596
the onward for two others.

249
00:11:37,506 --> 00:11:38,796
- [Girl in pink] Do we...

250
00:11:38,796 --> 00:11:42,534
want to put favorites before the formal?

251
00:11:43,554 --> 00:11:46,737
- [Girl in blue] I think we should put favorites.

252
00:11:48,477 --> 00:11:50,319
- [Teacher] So, we're talking this one, right?

253
00:11:50,319 --> 00:11:53,593
These are the formals you
want before the favorites.

254
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:56,803
- [Girl in blue] No, we want our 
favorites before our formals.

255
00:11:56,803 --> 00:11:57,871
- [Teacher] Oh, Okay.

256
00:11:57,871 --> 00:11:59,821
- [Girl in blue] And then we're combining formal

257
00:11:59,821 --> 00:12:02,480
and baby pictures in quotes right?

258
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,460
- [Teacher] Yeah.

259
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,809
Well, you know, what do you think?

260
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:10,519
- [Girl in blue] Well
I like, combining it.

261
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:13,329
- [Girl in gray] Can you pull up the other ladder?

262
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:15,477
Do you still have that one?

263
00:12:15,477 --> 00:12:18,867
[Boy in red] If we have that picture,
and then another picture, and then another--

264
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:19,899
- [Teacher] This one?

265
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:21,385
Is this the ladder you want to see?

266
00:12:21,385 --> 00:12:24,032
Which section do you want to pull?

267
00:12:24,032 --> 00:12:25,379
- [Girl in gray] "Student life". 
I think it's on that.

268
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:29,747
- [Teacher] Right here?

269
00:12:29,747 --> 00:12:30,490
- [Girl in gray] Yeah.

270
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,674
- [Teacher] Let me know.

271
00:12:31,674 --> 00:12:34,321
Because then I can go
back and let her know.

272
00:12:36,831 --> 00:12:38,289
- [Girl in gray] So, you want to start off with that?

273
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:46,259
- [Girl in blue] So it'll be like...

274
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,273
The formal, then the
baby, and then the quote.

275
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:58,873
- [Teacher] Can you tell Emily what
she missed yesterday?

276
00:12:58,873 --> 00:12:59,807
About the quotes.

277
00:12:59,807 --> 00:13:00,829
No, were you present?

278
00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:03,569
When you said that a lot of seniors

279
00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:04,892
who didn't have quotes last year.

280
00:13:04,892 --> 00:13:07,627
- [Girl in gray shirt] They would rather
have a big list of them

281
00:13:07,627 --> 00:13:10,327
and just have them pick and cross it off.

282
00:13:10,327 --> 00:13:12,817
If they can come up with their own.

283
00:13:14,477 --> 00:13:15,505
- [Teacher] And I have a quote book.

284
00:13:15,505 --> 00:13:18,662
Somewhere, and we can start deciding.

285
00:13:18,662 --> 00:13:23,353
We can go from very
funny, to very serious.

286
00:13:23,353 --> 00:13:24,431
So the kids can have a good choice.

287
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:32,761
(Students continue discussing quietly)

288
00:13:37,411 --> 00:13:39,536
- [Teacher] Did you want me to go
back to the other one?

289
00:13:48,776 --> 00:14:03,505
(Both groups engage in discussion)

290
00:14:05,628 --> 00:14:07,190
- [Teacher] How are you deciding the order?

291
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:10,138
Is it, just from serious to funny or...

292
00:14:10,138 --> 00:14:13,993
- [Girl in blue] Well it's more, funner
stuff, the memories

293
00:14:13,993 --> 00:14:15,943
into the more serious stuff.

294
00:14:15,943 --> 00:14:18,381
- [Teacher] And you're ending it
with the grauduation?

295
00:14:18,381 --> 00:14:19,728
- [Boy in red] Yeah.

296
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:35,389
- [Teacher] You rather repeat our homecoming?

297
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:36,904
- [Girl in gray shirt] But that's spirit week.

298
00:14:39,874 --> 00:14:41,091
- [Teacher] There's another one--

299
00:14:41,091 --> 00:14:43,947
- [Girl in gray shirt] That's what 
homecoming fills.

300
00:14:45,767 --> 00:14:46,577
This is the problem.

301
00:14:46,577 --> 00:14:48,613
On the other ladder that we had,

302
00:14:48,613 --> 00:14:51,863
the only high school "Student Life" we had

303
00:14:51,863 --> 00:14:54,766
was "Holten Hemming" and "Spirit Week".

304
00:14:56,136 --> 00:14:57,504
- [Teacher] That's the same thing.

305
00:14:57,504 --> 00:14:59,088
- [Girl in gray shirt] Yeah, Hemming 
and Spirit Week.

306
00:14:59,088 --> 00:15:01,317
Like, one spread and
then the awards honors.

307
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,431
Well that doesn't make up
for all the signatures.

308
00:15:04,431 --> 00:15:06,201
- [Girl in turtleneck] Oh, then we had prom.

309
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:09,213
- [Teacher] You had the prom, and then you had...

310
00:15:09,223 --> 00:15:16,068
how about the senior, the um...
"Sports Banquet".

311
00:15:18,148 --> 00:15:19,322
Sports Banquet should award everybody.

312
00:15:19,322 --> 00:15:20,228
Not just seniors.

313
00:15:20,228 --> 00:15:21,621
- [Girl in gray shirt] Yeah, it's got uh--

314
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:23,537
- [Teacher] Do you want to put that under student--

315
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:25,170
- [Girl in gray shirt] I don't...

316
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,520
- [Girl in turtleneck] What if we--

317
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,718
You cut the prom down to one page,

318
00:15:31,718 --> 00:15:35,759
but maybe we could, put
it back to two pages,

319
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,707
we could show, like the planning
of prom and setting it up.

320
00:15:38,707 --> 00:15:40,635
- [Teacher] Okay, but--

321
00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:42,353
- [Girl in turtleneck] 'Cause I'm 
on the prom committee.

322
00:15:42,353 --> 00:15:46,364
- [Teacher] Okay, so, and you have
your committee meeting,

323
00:15:46,364 --> 00:15:47,716
start taking pictures.

324
00:15:47,716 --> 00:15:50,874
Guys, remember, we have seven cameras.

325
00:15:50,874 --> 00:15:54,473
So take cameras with you when
you're having little meetings.

326
00:16:04,293 --> 00:16:06,000
Just make sure you're flexible enough,

327
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,160
just in case we don't
have enough pictures,

328
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,898
you can flip back to one
page instead of the signature.

329
00:16:11,898 --> 00:16:13,965
I mean, instead of a spread.

330
00:16:13,965 --> 00:16:15,636
- [Girl in gray shirt] Well, 
I don't know how we're

331
00:16:15,636 --> 00:16:17,146
gonna fill up the signature then.

332
00:16:17,146 --> 00:16:20,514
- [Teacher] Well you don't have to have--
we can move everything up.

333
00:16:20,514 --> 00:16:22,331
- [Girl in gray shirt] And then 
we move seniors up

334
00:16:22,331 --> 00:16:23,840
into another half of the signature,

335
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,767
and that half would have to be colored.

336
00:16:25,767 --> 00:16:27,834
Because it's the senior signature.

337
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:29,711
- [Teacher] Um...

338
00:16:33,781 --> 00:16:35,686
Do you have a section for committee?

339
00:16:35,686 --> 00:16:37,776
- [Girl in gray shirt] We had those 
in with the clubs.

340
00:16:37,776 --> 00:16:41,328
With like, all of their--
what they do in the community.

341
00:16:41,328 --> 00:16:44,649
- [Teacher] Okay, if you want, you can
bring it up a little more.

342
00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:47,840
Just the overall community
that doesn't have a club.

343
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,290
And use up that space.

344
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,365
Like the blood drive.

345
00:16:53,365 --> 00:16:56,244
The blood drive is not part of the school.

346
00:16:56,244 --> 00:16:57,684
- [Girl in gray shirt] Rotary does that.

347
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,123
- [Teacher] Rotary, yes, but that's the...

348
00:16:59,123 --> 00:17:02,299
interact is with Rotary, yes?

349
00:17:02,299 --> 00:17:03,921
- [Girl in gray shirt] Yeah, we help with that.

350
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:05,732
We help Rotary.

351
00:17:05,732 --> 00:17:08,240
- [Teacher] But you also do the "Victorian Classic"?

352
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,238
- [Girl in gray shirt] Yes.

353
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:11,119
- [Teacher] You don't have enough space.

354
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,302
You need to put the blood drive up.

355
00:17:15,662 --> 00:17:18,587
I mean, how much space breaks--

356
00:17:18,587 --> 00:17:20,282
- [Girl in gray shirt] A spread.

357
00:17:20,282 --> 00:17:22,679
- [Teacher] Oh, Interact has a spread?

358
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:25,836
- [Girl in gray shirt] Yeah, we've 
covered this three times now.

359
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:26,904
- [Teacher] Okay, sorry.

360
00:17:26,904 --> 00:17:29,157
Yes, but we've changed it three times.

361
00:17:29,157 --> 00:17:30,495
So...

362
00:17:31,889 --> 00:17:33,792
Find other community things.

363
00:17:33,792 --> 00:17:36,950
Well, if you want, do you want
to talk about the tax bill?

364
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,551
- [Girl in gray shirt] Well, that's not 
really student life.

365
00:17:39,551 --> 00:17:41,617
- [Teacher] It's going to affect your life.

366
00:17:41,617 --> 00:17:42,708
- [Girl in gray shirt] Yeah, but...
