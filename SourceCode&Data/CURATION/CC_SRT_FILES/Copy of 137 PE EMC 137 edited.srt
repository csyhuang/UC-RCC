1
00:00:00,197 --> 00:00:02,099
- [Teacher] At the end of class, I want you to

2
00:00:02,099 --> 00:00:06,071
be able to explain how
to swing the bat faster

3
00:00:06,071 --> 00:00:08,707
so the ball will travel further.

4
00:00:08,707 --> 00:00:10,608
Because the faster the bat goes,

5
00:00:10,608 --> 00:00:14,145
the further the ball's gonna go.

6
00:00:14,145 --> 00:00:16,014
And there's three things
that we're going to

7
00:00:16,014 --> 00:00:18,615
do to make the bat swing faster.

8
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:20,217
Okay, we're going to hold the bat at the

9
00:00:20,217 --> 00:00:23,691
end to make it longer.

10
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:26,024
We're gonna hold the
end to make it longer.

11
00:00:26,024 --> 00:00:28,826
A longer bat means a faster bat.

12
00:00:28,826 --> 00:00:32,497
We're gonna use more body
parts or muscle when we swing

13
00:00:32,497 --> 00:00:36,401
and we're gonna apply
more time to our swing by

14
00:00:36,401 --> 00:00:39,686
stepping into the swing.

15
00:00:39,686 --> 00:00:42,106
And we're learning to
bat so that we can play

16
00:00:42,106 --> 00:00:45,410
more and more fun games
in order to stay healthy.

17
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,446
Because there's lots of
fun batting games you can

18
00:00:47,446 --> 00:00:50,148
play with your friends here at school

19
00:00:50,148 --> 00:00:53,417
and outside of school
that will help you have

20
00:00:53,417 --> 00:00:56,444
a healthy heart and muscles.

21
00:00:56,444 --> 00:00:59,523
And we're gonna do four
different things today.

22
00:00:59,523 --> 00:01:03,027
I'm gonna ask you to talk to a partner,

23
00:01:03,027 --> 00:01:05,363
I'm gonna do a little
experiment, we're gonna play

24
00:01:05,363 --> 00:01:07,365
spotlight tag, and then we're gonna

25
00:01:07,365 --> 00:01:09,314
have some personal practice.

26
00:01:09,314 --> 00:01:10,635
And I've created a little healthy

27
00:01:10,635 --> 00:01:12,073
a little helping worksheet for you

28
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:14,239
that shows you what it looks like.

29
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:17,274
Now all these things will
help you know and help you

30
00:01:17,274 --> 00:01:21,195
be able to explain how
to swing the bat faster.

31
00:01:30,588 --> 00:01:33,691
I want you to turn to a
partner and tell them

32
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:38,691
as many things, of as many games
that you can that use

33
00:01:40,065 --> 00:01:42,667
swinging a bat or an impement.

34
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:44,069
Go ahead.

35
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:49,069
(Students Chatting)

36
00:02:16,067 --> 00:02:18,837
- [Teacher] Hey everybody, let me 
get your attention.

37
00:02:18,837 --> 00:02:21,338
If I pull your stick,
I want you to tell us

38
00:02:21,338 --> 00:02:25,085
a game or an activity that
you can do that requires

39
00:02:25,085 --> 00:02:30,085
using a bat or an implement
to hit a ball or something.

40
00:02:31,816 --> 00:02:32,783
We're green?

41
00:02:32,783 --> 00:02:33,951
No, we're red.

42
00:02:33,951 --> 00:02:36,173
Jeremiah, where's Jeremiah?

43
00:02:36,187 --> 00:02:37,655
Yes?

44
00:02:37,655 --> 00:02:38,390
- [Jeremiah] Softball.

45
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,728
- [Teacher] Softball, very good.

46
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:43,294
Raquel, where's Raquel?

47
00:02:43,294 --> 00:02:44,595
What, Raquel?

48
00:02:44,595 --> 00:02:46,981
Game or something you can play.

49
00:02:50,668 --> 00:02:52,870
- [Raquel] (Background Chatter)
- [Teacher] Do we use a bat to play soccer?

50
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,571
- [Students] No.

51
00:02:53,571 --> 00:02:55,807
- [Teacher] No.

52
00:02:55,807 --> 00:02:58,828
How about...Stephanie?

53
00:02:59,911 --> 00:03:00,945
Baseball?

54
00:03:00,945 --> 00:03:03,563
Who said golf, what about golf?

55
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,084
What about ping pong?

56
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:07,652
Do you know what ping pong is?

57
00:03:07,652 --> 00:03:11,222
[Students] Yeah!

58
00:03:11,222 --> 00:03:13,891
So all of these activities
are things that we can

59
00:03:13,891 --> 00:03:18,312
play once we learn how to swing a bat.

60
00:03:20,031 --> 00:03:24,035
Now, we're gonna go around the blue house,

61
00:03:24,035 --> 00:03:26,271
and you're gonna sit on
the red dot until I say go,

62
00:03:26,271 --> 00:03:28,973
and I'm gonna do a little
experiment to show you

63
00:03:28,973 --> 00:03:33,379
how these things can
make the ball go further.

64
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,413
I would like you to
walk, please be careful.

65
00:03:35,413 --> 00:03:36,914
Go.

66
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:56,474
(Background Chatter)

67
00:03:57,034 --> 00:04:00,120
- [Teacher] Okay, thank you for sitting.

68
00:04:03,841 --> 00:04:08,179
Now over there I said the longer the bat,

69
00:04:08,179 --> 00:04:09,447
the faster it goes.

70
00:04:09,447 --> 00:04:12,416
The faster the bat, the
further the ball goes.

71
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,270
So I'm gonna show you what I mean.

72
00:04:14,752 --> 00:04:16,321
Is this a very long bat?

73
00:04:16,321 --> 00:04:17,288
- [Students] No.

74
00:04:17,288 --> 00:04:20,451
- [Teacher] No, so I'm gonna swing
and see how far it goes.

75
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:21,892
(Students Laugh)

76
00:04:21,892 --> 00:04:22,793
- [Teacher] Did it go very far?

77
00:04:22,793 --> 00:04:23,561
- [Students] No.

78
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:25,230
- [Teacher] Now I'm gonna make that longer.

79
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,665
Who thinks it's gonna go further?

80
00:04:27,665 --> 00:04:29,617
Let's see if it goes further.

81
00:04:30,468 --> 00:04:34,439
(Background Chatter)

82
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,140
(Students cheer)

83
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,609
- [Teacher] It went a little bit further, huh?

84
00:04:37,609 --> 00:04:39,026
- [Students] Yes.

85
00:04:40,144 --> 00:04:43,782
- [Teacher] Now, by holding the bat at the end

86
00:04:43,782 --> 00:04:46,917
it'll make it longer and it'll go further.

87
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:51,122
Now another way we make the bat go faster

88
00:04:51,122 --> 00:04:53,760
is by using more body parts and muscles.

89
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,862
So I'm only gonna use a couple muscles

90
00:04:56,862 --> 00:04:58,296
here to swing the bat.

91
00:04:58,296 --> 00:04:59,467
You think this will this go very far?

92
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:00,732
- [Students] Yeah.

93
00:05:00,732 --> 00:05:01,601
- [Teacher] Yeah?

94
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,684
Okay, let's see.

95
00:05:03,735 --> 00:05:04,735
- [Students] No.

96
00:05:04,735 --> 00:05:06,687
- [Teacher] I didn't use a lot of muscle.

97
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:10,008
Now I'm gonna use lots
of muscles on this step,

98
00:05:10,008 --> 00:05:12,593
and I'm gonna twist, 
see how far it goes.

99
00:05:13,878 --> 00:05:18,098
(Students cheer)

100
00:05:21,351 --> 00:05:23,861
- [Student] Do it again, do a lot of muscle.

101
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:25,758
- [Teacher] Anyone know of any other way we can make

102
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,908
the bat go faster?

103
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:33,598
Hit from the bottom? 
I had it written over there.

104
00:05:33,598 --> 00:05:35,250
Does anyone else remember?

105
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:37,234
I want to make my bat longer,

106
00:05:37,234 --> 00:05:41,141
I want to use lots of
muscles, and.... Alex?

107
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,641
- [Alex] (Background Chatter).

108
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:44,993
- [Teacher] That's how we use lots of muscles.

109
00:05:46,081 --> 00:05:49,881
I want to swing the bat
for as long as I can

110
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:51,515
in order to generate speed.

111
00:05:51,515 --> 00:05:54,152
Now, if I start my bat
right here and I swing it,

112
00:05:54,152 --> 00:05:56,020
do I have lots of time to hit the ball?

113
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:56,989
- [Students] No.

114
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,790
- [Teacher] Do you think it'll go far?

115
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,242
Let's see what happens.

116
00:06:01,826 --> 00:06:04,781
(Students chatting)

117
00:06:06,964 --> 00:06:09,771
- [Teacher] Now, if I start way back 
here, do you think I'll have more time?

118
00:06:09,771 --> 00:06:10,501
- [Students] Yeah.

119
00:06:10,501 --> 00:06:11,569
- [Teacher] You think it'll go further?

120
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:12,336
- [Students] Yeah.

121
00:06:12,336 --> 00:06:13,788
- [Teacher] All right, let's see.

122
00:06:14,973 --> 00:06:18,492
(Students cheer)

123
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,696
- [Teacher] So, raise your hand if 
you want to hit the ball far?

124
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:26,951
Hitting the ball far will help
you be successful, and if you're

125
00:06:26,951 --> 00:06:29,620
successful, you're going to have
a good time.

126
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,757
But today we're going to learn different 
ways to hit the ball further by

127
00:06:32,757 --> 00:06:35,076
making our bat go fast.

128
00:06:36,694 --> 00:06:40,315
- [Teacher] Don't swing; please tell me.

129
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,800
- [Student] (Background Chatter)
- [Teacher] It makes the bat go faster.

130
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,969
Why does the bat go faster?

131
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:47,472
- [Student] (Background Chatter).

132
00:06:47,472 --> 00:06:49,740
- [Teacher] The bat goes faster,
the ball goes faster.

133
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,393
But what makes the bat go faster,
because it's short or long?

134
00:06:52,393 --> 00:06:54,800
- [Student] (Background Chatter)
- [Teacher] Long. Longer bat means faster.

135
00:06:55,313 --> 00:06:56,764
Okay, rotate!

136
00:06:57,358 --> 00:06:58,249
Rotate!

137
00:06:58,249 --> 00:08:15,170
(Background Chatter)

138
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,500
-[Teacher] Dominant hand on top.

139
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,500
Step, twist.

140
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,600
We're practicing what
grip is the best.

141
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,000
(Background Chatter)

142
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,500
- [Teacher] How'd that one go?

143
00:08:35,000 --> 00:09:03,475
(Background Chatter)

144
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:05,561
Fernanda, what grip are you using?

145
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:07,900
- [Student] Mr. Holden, can I go to the bathroom?

146
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,750
- [Teacher] Hurry.

147
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:32,650
(Background Chatter)

148 
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,000
- [Teacher] Excellent twisting,
Derek, excellent twisting!

149
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,478
(Background Chatter)

150
00:09:40,478 --> 00:09:42,964
- [Teacher] What number are you
going to read it?

151
00:09:42,964 --> 00:09:49,500
(Background Chatter)

152
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,300
- [Teacher] Try this one: hold 
your bat with your hands apart.

153
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,300
Put your left hand on top.

154
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,800
I mean your right hand on the top.

155
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,850
Left hand at the bottom.

156
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,000
Spread your hands apart like this.

157
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,668
Now try it again.

158
00:10:03,668 --> 00:10:05,537
How did that go?

159
00:10:05,537 --> 00:10:07,206
Is that one good?

160
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:11,192
You think so? Now hold it at the end,
see what happens.

161
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,150
It's right here.

162
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:23,122
(Background Chatter)

163
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,106
- [Teacher] Now hold your hands,
put your right hand on the top.

164
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:29,110
Right hand on the top,
your right hand on top.

165
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:36,534
(Background Chatter)

166
00:10:36,534 --> 00:10:39,887
All right, Fernanda. Big step,
let's see it.

167
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,300
Big step, twist your whole body.

168
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,500
Get your bat back, there you go.

169
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,864
Try it again.

170
00:10:51,783 --> 00:10:54,435
Did the ball go further that time?

171
00:10:54,435 --> 00:11:05,096
(Background Chatter)

172
00:11:05,096 --> 00:11:06,331
(Whistle blows)

173
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:09,184
-[Teacher] Okay, sit behind your 
little cone and answer 

174
00:11:09,184 --> 00:11:10,900
the question on your card.

175
00:11:12,737 --> 00:11:15,990
Alright, now read it out loud for me.

176
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:42,000
(Background Chatter)

177
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,400
[Teacher] Which grip do you think makes
the bat swing fastest?

178
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,250
Holding it at the end?

179
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,600
Remember when we talked about
how long the bat is?

180
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,600
A longer bat can travel faster or slower?

181
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:55,700
- [Students] (Background Chatter)

182
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,850
- [Teacher] Faster, so when you hold it 
at the end it makes it longer,

183
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,150
and then you can swing it faster,
and then the ball goes further.

184
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12,05,590
Is that what happened?
- [Students and Teacher] Yeah.

185
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,292
- [Teacher] All right, rotate.

186
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:32,879
(Background Chatter)

187
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:35,500
- [Teacher] Alright, are you going
to twist or not twist?

188
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:47,264
(Background Chatter)

189
00:12:47,264 --> 00:12:49,686
- [Teacher] Back foot, step.
Put your weight on your front foot.

190
00:12:49,686 --> 00:13:21,250
(Background Chatter)

191
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,500
- [Teacher] Alright, so pretend your feet 
are stuck in mud, so you can't move them.

190
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:27,005
- [Teacher] So we've been learning
all the different ways we

191
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:29,208
can make the bat go faster so that we can

192
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,678
hit the ball far, because
when we hit the ball far,

193
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:35,948
our game and when we're
batting is more enjoyable.

194
00:13:36,915 --> 00:13:39,650
We've practiced, we've talked about,

195
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,558
and we've discussed three
different ways to make the

196
00:13:42,558 --> 00:13:46,326
bat go faster so that the ball will travel further.

197
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,427
When we're batting, okay?

198
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:50,429
I have a sentence frame for you, it says:

199
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:54,232
"I can blank to make the bat go faster

200
00:13:54,232 --> 00:13:57,368
"so the ball will go further."

201
00:13:57,368 --> 00:14:01,107
Okay, you're in your
batting team groups right now.

202
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:05,794
When I say go, I want you
to use this sentence frame

203
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:10,081
and discuss the three
different ways you can make the

204
00:14:10,081 --> 00:14:14,285
bat go faster so the
ball will travel further.

205
00:14:14,285 --> 00:14:18,656
And then I'm gonna pull our sticks,

206
00:14:18,656 --> 00:14:21,862
and you'll get to share
with the entire class how

207
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:24,064
you think you can make the bat go faster.

208
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:28,733
So now is your time to use
all of the intelligence and

209
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:33,104
brains of your group to
figure out your three answers.

210
00:14:33,104 --> 00:14:34,505
Are there any questions?

211
00:14:34,505 --> 00:14:35,380
- [Students] No.

212
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,875
- [Teacher] Okay, I'm gonna give
you about two minutes.

213
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,443
Use the sentence frame,
discuss with your group.

214
00:14:39,443 --> 00:14:40,812
Go ahead.

215
00:14:40,812 --> 00:15:26,491
(Background Chatter)

216
00:15:26,491 --> 00:15:28,092
Alright, how is your group doing?

217
00:15:28,092 --> 00:15:29,093
Jesse, you getting to share?

218
00:15:29,093 --> 00:15:30,762
I might pick your stick.

219
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:32,381
Talk with Alex.

220
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:38,919
What are we coming up with Jeremiah?

221
00:15:40,571 --> 00:15:42,642
How are we gonna make the bat go faster?

222
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:47,096
Do you remember?

223
00:15:51,982 --> 00:15:55,420
-[Teacher] Okay, how about Alex.

224
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,756
Why do we twist, Alex?

225
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:59,907
Alex, why do we twist?

226
00:16:03,954 --> 00:16:05,614
Alex, sit up, please.

227
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:10,318
When we twist, we use more what?

228
00:16:10,318 --> 00:16:11,300
- [Students] Muscles!

229
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,400
- [Teacher] What color were we?
Black or green?

230
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,200
- [Students] Red!

231
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,400
- [Teacher] Oh, we were red?

232
00:16:26,048 --> 00:16:29,048
Okay second grade, eyes on me, please.

233
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,271
Sit down on a number.

234
00:16:31,356 --> 00:16:33,725
You've had a nice opportunity
to talk with your group to

235
00:16:33,725 --> 00:16:37,128
figure out the three ways we
can make the bat go faster.

236
00:16:37,128 --> 00:16:40,831
If I pick your name, please stand up,

237
00:16:40,831 --> 00:16:43,667
speak nice and loud and
use the sentence frame,

238
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:47,728
and tell us one way we can
make the bat go faster.

239
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,000
Let's see here...

240
00:16:58,793 --> 00:17:00,851
Jonathan.

241
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:03,455
All right, Jonathan, stand up buddy.

242
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:07,041
Jonathan, use the sentence frame, "I can."

243
00:17:08,432 --> 00:17:15,700
- [Jonathan] (Background Chatter)

244
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,702
- [Teacher] I can hold the bat at
the end to make the bat go

245
00:17:18,702 --> 00:17:20,805
faster so the ball will go further.

246
00:17:20,805 --> 00:17:22,840
Good answer, give him a round of applause.

247
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,342
(Students clapping)

248
00:17:24,342 --> 00:17:26,344
When we have a longer bat,

249
00:17:26,344 --> 00:17:28,813
it generates more speed,
and more speed with the bat

250
00:17:28,813 --> 00:17:30,750
makes the ball go further.

251
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,503
Now there are two other ways
you can make the bat go faster.
