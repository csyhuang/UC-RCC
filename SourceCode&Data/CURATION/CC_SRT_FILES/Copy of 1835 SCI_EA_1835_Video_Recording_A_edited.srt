1
00:00:00,153 --> 00:00:01,224
- It's big.

2
00:00:01,224 --> 00:00:02,057
- [Voiceover] Okay.

3
00:00:02,057 --> 00:00:04,366
- And that's all, and
the little blood cells,

4
00:00:04,366 --> 00:00:07,596
and I drew one on there,
in kinda like a magnified,

5
00:00:07,596 --> 00:00:09,286
and there's little blood strands,

6
00:00:09,286 --> 00:00:12,922
they're blood strands, DNA strands.

7
00:00:12,922 --> 00:00:15,064
- [Voiceover] Now, those DNA
strands are only in the blood?

8
00:00:15,064 --> 00:00:16,586
Are they anywhere else in your body?

9
00:00:16,586 --> 00:00:19,650
- They're in your hair
and in your fingernails,

10
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,155
in your skin, they're everywhere.

11
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:23,566
- [Voiceover] Okay, so it's
not just in the blood?

12
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:27,594
- But you usually get it from the blood.

13
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,425
Blood. (laughs)

14
00:00:29,425 --> 00:00:30,613
- Okay, alright.

15
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,149
It looks like you've got
a couple questions.

16
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:34,223
You can call on whoever you want.

17
00:00:34,223 --> 00:00:35,056
- Me?

18
00:00:35,056 --> 00:00:36,030
- Are these questions?

19
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,351
You guys, are these questions for Ryan?

20
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:38,184
Okay.

21
00:00:40,412 --> 00:00:42,712
- [Voiceover] How do you know
Chuck was right? (laughs)

22
00:00:42,712 --> 00:00:43,545
- [Voiceover] What?

23
00:00:43,545 --> 00:00:44,729
- Well, he's a pretty smart guy.

24
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:45,739
- [Voiceover] Who?

25
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:46,918
- Chuck, my uncle.

26
00:00:46,918 --> 00:00:48,069
- [Voiceover] Oh, okay. (laughs)

27
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:48,902
- Maybe.

28
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:53,519
- Even though there's a
bunch of DNA on the strand,

29
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:55,246
what does that have to,

30
00:00:55,246 --> 00:00:58,888
how do you know that a piece of that DNA

31
00:00:58,888 --> 00:01:02,670
came from either the mom or the dad?

32
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,527
- That's why (mumbles) because
DNA comes from both of them.

33
00:01:07,527 --> 00:01:11,614
The dad gives the DNA and
the mom provides the DNA.

34
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:12,447
Okay, David?

35
00:01:13,521 --> 00:01:16,355
- It was in the blood, right?

36
00:01:16,355 --> 00:01:17,950
You said it was in the blood, right?

37
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:18,783
- [Ryan] Yeah.

38
00:01:18,783 --> 00:01:19,710
- Yes, but couldn't blood be transmitted

39
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,147
to another person because they had the,

40
00:01:23,147 --> 00:01:24,849
yeah, it could be transmitted
to another person,

41
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:26,439
so that's not really a trait.

42
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:28,241
- [Voiceover] Sure, when someone
gets a blood transfusion?

43
00:01:28,241 --> 00:01:29,074
- Yeah.

44
00:01:29,074 --> 00:01:29,907
- [Voiceover] Right?

45
00:01:29,907 --> 00:01:31,121
Like if you're in the hospital

46
00:01:31,121 --> 00:01:33,675
and you're injured and you
get blood transfusions?

47
00:01:33,675 --> 00:01:35,755
If your eyes are blue and
you get a blood transfusion

48
00:01:35,755 --> 00:01:38,124
from a brown-eyed person, does
that turn your eyes brown?

49
00:01:38,124 --> 00:01:39,021
- [All] No.

50
00:01:39,021 --> 00:01:42,082
- [Voiceover] It could, if (mumbles).

51
00:01:42,082 --> 00:01:42,915
- [Voiceover] Okay.

52
00:01:42,915 --> 00:01:44,913
Does it give you a widow's peak

53
00:01:44,913 --> 00:01:46,028
when you have a straight hairline?

54
00:01:46,028 --> 00:01:47,065
- [All] No.

55
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:47,898
- Okay.

56
00:01:47,898 --> 00:01:49,718
If I get a blood transfusion tomorrow,

57
00:01:49,718 --> 00:01:50,749
hopefully that doesn't happen,

58
00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:52,395
but if I get a blood transfusion tomorrow,

59
00:01:52,395 --> 00:01:54,384
is that going to give me a cleft chin?

60
00:01:54,384 --> 00:01:55,217
- [All] No.

61
00:01:55,217 --> 00:01:56,089
- If the person had a cleft chin?

62
00:01:56,089 --> 00:01:58,105
- [Voiceover] But how do
people die when they get,

63
00:01:58,105 --> 00:02:01,047
when they get blood transfusions?

64
00:02:01,047 --> 00:02:03,163
- Carlos, can we talk
about that later maybe?

65
00:02:03,163 --> 00:02:04,837
Let's stick with how we get our traits.

66
00:02:04,837 --> 00:02:07,807
Do we get it through the blood?

67
00:02:07,807 --> 00:02:09,757
Okay, not really?

68
00:02:09,757 --> 00:02:11,057
Girls, what do you think over there?

69
00:02:11,057 --> 00:02:11,919
- I was sure it had something to do

70
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,580
with the blood (mumbles),

71
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,038
but that's between your parents,

72
00:02:16,038 --> 00:02:17,423
and it has nothing to do with the traits,

73
00:02:17,423 --> 00:02:18,756
so I don't know.

74
00:02:19,975 --> 00:02:21,635
- [Voiceover] Do you want
to come over here too?

75
00:02:21,635 --> 00:02:23,165
- I want to come over there with the boys.

76
00:02:23,165 --> 00:02:24,592
- Yes, I (mumbles).

77
00:02:24,592 --> 00:02:27,455
(laughs)

78
00:02:27,455 --> 00:02:28,288
- [Voiceover] You guys are,

79
00:02:28,288 --> 00:02:29,673
you guys haven't even said anything yet,

80
00:02:29,673 --> 00:02:30,889
and already they're,

81
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:33,926
they're joining your group.

82
00:02:33,926 --> 00:02:36,386
Okay, should we hear from
the people who think,

83
00:02:36,386 --> 00:02:38,469
I've got a large (mumbles).

84
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:41,587
Lorenzo, do you want,
should we hear from you?

85
00:02:41,587 --> 00:02:44,738
Or are you thinking about
coming over to this group too?

86
00:02:44,738 --> 00:02:46,217
You're set, okay.

87
00:02:46,217 --> 00:02:48,491
Let's hear from Lorenzo.

88
00:02:48,491 --> 00:02:50,406
Okay, Lorenzo, what do you think?

89
00:02:50,406 --> 00:02:52,679
- I think that it was (mumbles)

90
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:53,512
that brown-eyed people

91
00:02:53,512 --> 00:02:55,041
have more traits than blue-eyed people,

92
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,535
because I know more people

93
00:02:56,535 --> 00:02:58,036
that are brown-eyed than blue-eyed,

94
00:02:58,036 --> 00:03:00,782
and I think I read somewhere

95
00:03:00,782 --> 00:03:03,174
that usually brown eye
is a dominant trait

96
00:03:03,174 --> 00:03:04,102
over the blue eyes.

97
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:05,289
So for most of the times,

98
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:06,792
brown-eyed people,

99
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:08,276
if you have brown-eyed parents,

100
00:03:08,276 --> 00:03:09,220
you will get brown eyes,

101
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,220
but how is--

102
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:14,280
- [Voiceover] So you heard
something about a dominant trait?

103
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,561
Okay, any questions about
that dominant trait?

104
00:03:16,561 --> 00:03:18,803
Brown eyes being dominant trait?

105
00:03:18,803 --> 00:03:20,746
- Because a lot of people
have brown eyes like that,

106
00:03:20,746 --> 00:03:23,401
and not many people have blue eyes.

107
00:03:23,401 --> 00:03:24,670
- [Voiceover] True?

108
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,992
Blue eyes are more rare?

109
00:03:25,992 --> 00:03:26,825
Okay.

110
00:03:29,758 --> 00:03:31,167
Lorenzo, whoever you want to call on,

111
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:32,733
you've got two people.

112
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:34,380
- So like, what you were saying right now,

113
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,937
(mumbles) something about your parents,

114
00:03:36,937 --> 00:03:40,031
then you would get it from your parents?

115
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:41,118
- [Voiceover] Hmm.

116
00:03:41,118 --> 00:03:41,951
- [Voiceover] What?

117
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:44,518
- Because when he was,

118
00:03:44,518 --> 00:03:47,099
when he was saying that,

119
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,189
about the traits,

120
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:49,022
he said you,

121
00:03:49,022 --> 00:03:51,465
if your parents have
brown eyes or blue eyes,

122
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:53,436
that you're gonna get
that trait from them.

123
00:03:53,436 --> 00:03:55,568
So, from your parents, so--

124
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,638
- [Voiceover] Interesting.

125
00:03:56,638 --> 00:03:57,855
Do you get what she's saying?

126
00:03:57,855 --> 00:03:58,688
- What?

127
00:04:00,754 --> 00:04:01,792
- [Voiceover] She's,

128
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:03,952
she's saying she's
sticking with this group

129
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,957
because it's coming from your parents.

130
00:04:06,957 --> 00:04:08,063
Okay.

131
00:04:08,063 --> 00:04:09,602
- That's why they say it's half and half.

132
00:04:09,602 --> 00:04:11,761
- [Voiceover] Okay.

133
00:04:11,761 --> 00:04:14,103
- Also, I'm in your group too,

134
00:04:14,103 --> 00:04:15,724
but what's it called?

135
00:04:15,724 --> 00:04:17,580
- [Voiceover] (mumbles)

136
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,457
- Yeah, I see more brown eyes,

137
00:04:18,457 --> 00:04:21,052
but still, they always get
their traits from the parents,

138
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:21,885
not only--

139
00:04:23,652 --> 00:04:24,512
- [Voiceover] But a lot of people have,

140
00:04:24,512 --> 00:04:25,794
some people still get blue eyes,

141
00:04:25,794 --> 00:04:27,422
and then others, it's because of,

142
00:04:27,422 --> 00:04:29,556
they still get the
traits from the parents,

143
00:04:29,556 --> 00:04:32,370
and some of them don't look alike, so--

144
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,145
- What about, what about,

145
00:04:34,145 --> 00:04:35,440
some people have,

146
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,567
both of the parents have brown eyes,

147
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:38,732
and some of the kids turn,

148
00:04:38,732 --> 00:04:40,446
they have their blue eyes, though.

149
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,505
- [Voiceover] Yeah, that's great,

150
00:04:41,505 --> 00:04:42,338
because that's a great,

151
00:04:42,338 --> 00:04:43,872
how many of you guys have
seen something like that?

152
00:04:43,872 --> 00:04:44,906
- I have seen it.

153
00:04:44,906 --> 00:04:47,083
- [Voiceover] Where two
parents have one trait

154
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,891
and then their kid has the opposite trait?

155
00:04:49,891 --> 00:04:52,565
Like brown-eyed parents, blue-eyed kid?

156
00:04:52,565 --> 00:04:53,986
You guys have seen that?

157
00:04:53,986 --> 00:04:55,736
Why does that happen?

158
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,869
What do you think?

159
00:04:57,869 --> 00:04:59,329
- I'm not really sure.

160
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:03,638
I know my parents have
brown eyes, and me--

161
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:04,652
- And you have green eyes.

162
00:05:04,652 --> 00:05:05,485
- Yeah.

163
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:07,279
- [Voiceover] Your parents
both have brown eyes, right?

164
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,431
And your eyes are blue?

165
00:05:08,431 --> 00:05:09,317
- Yeah.

166
00:05:09,317 --> 00:05:11,228
- [Voiceover] Okay, so why does that happen?

167
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,617
Lorenzo, since it was your idea let's
hear from you.

168
00:05:13,617 --> 00:05:15,495
- If I'm correct,

169
00:05:15,495 --> 00:05:17,299
there's more brown-eyed traits,

170
00:05:17,299 --> 00:05:18,218
so you get,

171
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:20,793
if you have a brown-eyed
parent and a blue-eyed parent,

172
00:05:20,793 --> 00:05:23,204
you get a brown-eyed trait
and a blue-eyed trait,

173
00:05:23,204 --> 00:05:24,534
but because brown-eyed is dominant,

174
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:26,181
most of the time, you get brown-eyed.

175
00:05:26,181 --> 00:05:27,477
But you still have blue-eyed traits,

176
00:05:27,477 --> 00:05:29,573
so even if you have two
parents with brown-eyed trait,

177
00:05:29,573 --> 00:05:31,545
if they both also have
the blue-eyed trait,

178
00:05:31,545 --> 00:05:33,398
you could get blue eyes.

179
00:05:33,398 --> 00:05:35,558
- [Voiceover] I have a
question for you, Lorenzo.

180
00:05:35,558 --> 00:05:37,911
You keep using this word, dominant trait.

181
00:05:37,911 --> 00:05:41,398
Does, in your mind,
does dominant mean more?

182
00:05:41,398 --> 00:05:42,235
- [Lorenzo] More?

183
00:05:42,235 --> 00:05:43,832
- [Voiceover] When you're
saying more traits,

184
00:05:43,832 --> 00:05:46,493
in your mind, does dominant
mean there's more of it?

185
00:05:46,493 --> 00:05:47,418
- Yeah.

186
00:05:47,418 --> 00:05:48,535
- [Voiceover] Okay, what do you guys,

187
00:05:48,535 --> 00:05:50,710
how many of you guys have
heard this word, dominant?

188
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,069
- [Voiceover] There's
recessive, too, which is--

189
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:53,353
- Recessive?

190
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,273
Okay, does dominant mean more?

191
00:05:55,273 --> 00:05:56,690
Anyone know that?

192
00:05:58,348 --> 00:06:00,235
- It means power over the others.

193
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,926
- Like an overpowering
trait, he's trying to say.

194
00:06:02,926 --> 00:06:04,762
- Are you trying to say more?

195
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:05,679
Are you trying to say more

196
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:07,018
or are you trying to say stronger?

197
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:08,171
- [Lorenzo] Stronger.

198
00:06:08,171 --> 00:06:09,808
- [Voiceover] Okay, so this group,

199
00:06:09,808 --> 00:06:11,196
the group you're sitting in,

200
00:06:11,196 --> 00:06:12,257
the group one, right now,

201
00:06:12,257 --> 00:06:15,662
is someone who thinks
that there's more traits,

202
00:06:15,662 --> 00:06:18,214
come from the brown.

203
00:06:18,214 --> 00:06:19,714
Do you think that?

204
00:06:21,073 --> 00:06:21,993
You're not sure?

205
00:06:21,993 --> 00:06:22,826
- Say yes.

206
00:06:22,826 --> 00:06:24,141
- [Voiceover] But you know
something about dominant?

207
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:25,574
Okay.

208
00:06:25,574 --> 00:06:26,648
- [Voiceover] I'll stay with my group.

209
00:06:26,648 --> 00:06:27,481
- [Voiceover] Yes?

210
00:06:27,481 --> 00:06:28,784
- [Voiceover] Can I make my own 
group where it's like--

211
00:06:28,784 --> 00:06:30,006
- [Voiceover] Yeah! (laughs)

212
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:30,839
Good, yes.

213
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,553
What are you thinking?

214
00:06:34,845 --> 00:06:36,414
- I'm moving.

215
00:06:36,414 --> 00:06:37,880
- Maybe it's just maybe that

216
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,181
nature decides what
something will look like,

217
00:06:40,181 --> 00:06:41,986
because I don't know,

218
00:06:41,986 --> 00:06:44,150
my parents have brown
eyes and I have blue eyes,

219
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,228
and we don't really have
anyone else who has blue eyes.

220
00:06:47,228 --> 00:06:48,961
- [Voiceover] You're picking the--

221
00:06:48,961 --> 00:06:50,340
- [Voiceover] Wait a minute.

222
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,277
- [Voiceover] Fiona, no.

223
00:06:52,277 --> 00:06:53,175
Olivia?

224
00:06:53,175 --> 00:06:55,187
- Yeah, nature.

225
00:06:55,187 --> 00:06:56,825
- Okay, nature makes,

226
00:06:56,825 --> 00:06:59,237
so you've got blue eyes,

227
00:06:59,237 --> 00:07:00,839
nature had something to do with that,

228
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:01,672
not your parents?

229
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:02,505
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

230
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,338
- Okay.

231
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:07,702
Anyone want to respond to that?

232
00:07:10,525 --> 00:07:12,592
- [Voiceover] Ryan?

233
00:07:12,592 --> 00:07:14,260
- How does nature do that?

234
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,884
How does nature choose your eye color?

235
00:07:16,884 --> 00:07:17,756
- [Voiceover] Doesn't it have something

236
00:07:17,756 --> 00:07:19,132
to do with your parents?

237
00:07:19,132 --> 00:07:20,525
- Of course (mumbles),

238
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:21,803
how could you just (mumbles),

239
00:07:21,803 --> 00:07:23,713
a slot machine
where it's like 'ching'

240
00:07:23,713 --> 00:07:25,902
and then the eye colors
roll around and stuff?

241
00:07:25,902 --> 00:07:28,224
"Oh, you got blue eyes!"

242
00:07:28,224 --> 00:07:32,317
- [Voiceover] I don't know (mumbles).

243
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:33,714
- Let him respond. You're not sure?

244
00:07:33,714 --> 00:07:35,134
- [Lorenzo] No, I'm not sure.

245
00:07:35,134 --> 00:07:36,823
I'm still (mumbles).

246
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:37,807
- Any other questions? (laughter)

247
00:07:37,807 --> 00:07:39,403
- [Voiceover] Oh, yeah?

248
00:07:39,403 --> 00:07:41,963
- [Voiceover] And like, you know how,

249
00:07:41,963 --> 00:07:43,084
I was gonna ask this,

250
00:07:43,084 --> 00:07:47,122
what if you get it from your
grandparents or your (mumble)?

251
00:07:47,122 --> 00:07:48,404
- [Voiceover] Grandparents have black eyes.

252
00:07:48,404 --> 00:07:49,841
- [Voiceover] Or from
your aunts or something.

253
00:07:49,841 --> 00:07:50,991
- [Voiceover] I really don't know.

254
00:07:50,991 --> 00:07:52,224
- [Voiceover] If your aunts
and sisters (mumbles).

255
00:07:52,224 --> 00:07:53,219
- [Voiceover] Yeah, what if his aunt

256
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:54,756
and sister has blue eyes?

257
00:07:54,756 --> 00:07:56,498
- That's right.

258
00:07:56,498 --> 00:07:57,654
What if somewhere way back,

259
00:07:57,654 --> 00:08:00,159
someone in your family had blue eyes?

260
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:01,286
- [Voiceover] You guys better (mumbles).

261
00:08:01,286 --> 00:08:02,689
- [Voiceover] I don't
see how that (mumbles).

262
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:03,636
- How does that happen?

263
00:08:03,636 --> 00:08:06,412
Does anyone know people who look like

264
00:08:06,412 --> 00:08:08,736
their grandparents?

265
00:08:08,736 --> 00:08:11,037
- [Lorenzo] Yeah, my cousin does.

266
00:08:11,037 --> 00:08:11,921
- Lorenzo?

267
00:08:11,921 --> 00:08:13,670
- My mom said that I
look like my grandparent

268
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,289
because I have a mole or something

269
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:17,718
that's in the same spot as my grandpa.

270
00:08:17,718 --> 00:08:19,064
- If that's the case for you,

271
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:21,435
does that support what he's saying?

272
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:23,174
Nature decides?

273
00:08:23,174 --> 00:08:25,656
Or does that keep you
in what you're thinking?

274
00:08:25,656 --> 00:08:27,050
- [Lorenzo] It keeps me in.

275
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,084
- [Voiceover] But I have a question.

276
00:08:28,084 --> 00:08:28,917
- Okay.

277
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:30,392
- How do people,

278
00:08:30,392 --> 00:08:33,942
one eye is blue and
the other one is green?

279
00:08:33,942 --> 00:08:35,494
- [Voiceover] Oh, I know that one.

280
00:08:35,494 --> 00:08:36,617
- [Voiceover] That's a mutation.

281
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:40,610
- [Voiceover] No, no,
some people have really--

282
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,777
- [Voiceover] Yeah, like--

283
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,675
- All right, let's refocus.

284
00:08:46,675 --> 00:08:48,402
Let's refocus.

285
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,618
We haven't heard from this group.

286
00:08:50,618 --> 00:08:52,349
We haven't heard from the few groups

287
00:08:52,349 --> 00:08:54,612
that have the most
amount of people in them.

288
00:08:54,612 --> 00:08:56,523
Okay, so let's give them a chance to talk.

289
00:08:56,523 --> 00:08:58,519
Ladies, can you start us off?

290
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:59,543
- You guys read it.

291
00:08:59,543 --> 00:09:02,649
I have to read it? (laughs)

292
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:03,948
- [Voiceover] We agree that people

293
00:09:03,948 --> 00:09:06,996
get half their traits from their parents.

294
00:09:06,996 --> 00:09:09,192
We think this is a (mumbles)

295
00:09:09,192 --> 00:09:10,488
trait from both of their parents.

296
00:09:10,488 --> 00:09:14,238
Also, (mumbles) for example,

297
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:18,651
(mumbles) that--

298
00:09:18,651 --> 00:09:21,401
- What? (laughs)

299
00:09:24,183 --> 00:09:25,629
- For example, if one person has,

300
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:26,962
one parent has--

301
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:31,526
- [Voiceover] Because for example,

302
00:09:31,526 --> 00:09:34,316
for me, I have my dad's eyes

303
00:09:34,316 --> 00:09:35,983
and I have my mom's,

304
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,353
my mom's (mumbles).

305
00:09:39,353 --> 00:09:40,505
- She has traits from,

306
00:09:40,505 --> 00:09:42,232
some from your mom and
some from your dad, okay?

307
00:09:42,232 --> 00:09:43,316
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

308
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:44,211
- It looks like you've got someone

309
00:09:44,211 --> 00:09:46,551
who wants to say something about that.

310
00:09:46,551 --> 00:09:48,260
- [Voiceover] But if,
what if you get more,

311
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,781
if you get some traits
from your ancestors too

312
00:09:49,781 --> 00:09:52,326
and not just your parents?

313
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:53,159
What about your--

314
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,738
- That would just go back
a generation, though.

315
00:09:54,738 --> 00:09:56,161
- Does that still
support what you're thinking?

316
00:09:56,161 --> 00:09:56,994
- Yeah.

317
00:09:58,897 --> 00:10:01,442
- No, because we're
talking about the parents.

318
00:10:01,442 --> 00:10:02,786
How they have half.

319
00:10:02,786 --> 00:10:04,530
- [Voiceover] Yeah, but you then
also get from your parents,

320
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,636
some of them,

321
00:10:05,636 --> 00:10:08,084
so some people don't look
like their parents at all,

322
00:10:08,084 --> 00:10:12,084
but they look like someone
else in their family.

323
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,282
- I'm seeing this issue come up again.

324
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,697
What about grandparents?

325
00:10:16,697 --> 00:10:19,107
Kids who look like their grandparents.

326
00:10:19,107 --> 00:10:20,150
How does that happen?

327
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,617
Does anyone here wanna, any of you guys?

328
00:10:22,617 --> 00:10:23,450
Go ahead.

329
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:26,457
- You still get it from your parents

330
00:10:26,457 --> 00:10:30,624
because your parents, if your
grandma has it, then that

331
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:33,578
trait is somewhere

332
00:10:34,652 --> 00:10:36,136
in your mom or your dad.

333
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,837
It just doesn't show up as much,

334
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,890
so it can transfer back to you.

335
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,229
- [Voiceover] What can we call that?

336
00:10:41,229 --> 00:10:42,490
That there's a trait in you

337
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,423
and you just don't see it?

338
00:10:44,423 --> 00:10:46,061
Does anyone know a word for that?

339
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:47,963
- Invisible? (laughs)

340
00:10:47,963 --> 00:10:48,860
- [Voiceover] I heard it over here.

341
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,111
- [Voiceover] Recessive.

342
00:10:50,111 --> 00:10:52,683
- [Voiceover] Yes, recessive, okay.

343
00:10:52,683 --> 00:10:54,493
Who else has heard recessive?

344
00:10:54,493 --> 00:10:55,910
Raise your hands.

345
00:10:57,053 --> 00:10:58,524
Scientists call a recessive gene

346
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:01,524
a gene that does not express itself.

347
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:07,072
It doesn't mean it's a
little gene that's quiet.

348
00:11:07,072 --> 00:11:11,531
It just means that it's a
gene that's not showing.

349
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:13,992
Or a trait, sorry, a
trait that's not showing.

350
00:11:13,992 --> 00:11:15,917
That's called recessive.

351
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:17,716
You also want to talk about this more,

352
00:11:17,716 --> 00:11:19,129
a little bit more, let's
stay on this topic.

353
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:20,832
I think it will help us figure it out.

354
00:11:20,832 --> 00:11:21,675
Yes, Ryan?

355
00:11:21,675 --> 00:11:23,582
- Like he was saying, it's
probably about the DNA strands,

356
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:27,421
when they, when two people (mumbles)

357
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:30,295
combine in different parts

358
00:11:30,295 --> 00:11:32,374
or put in different pieces of it,

359
00:11:32,374 --> 00:11:34,948
like maybe one, like maybe the blue eyes is out

360
00:11:34,948 --> 00:11:37,915
and brown eyes goes in there.

361
00:11:37,915 --> 00:11:40,668
Or maybe when they have one
of those recessive genes,

362
00:11:40,668 --> 00:11:42,108
the recessive genes get,

363
00:11:42,108 --> 00:11:44,842
it goes into the strand too.

364
00:11:44,842 --> 00:11:47,785
Maybe when Tyler said that none of,

365
00:11:47,785 --> 00:11:51,088
neither of his parents have blue eyes,

366
00:11:51,088 --> 00:11:54,671
maybe his grandpa or his
grandma or their grandparents,

367
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:56,272
maybe one of them had blue eyes,

368
00:11:56,272 --> 00:11:57,945
and it was in his mom or his dad,

369
00:11:57,945 --> 00:12:01,104
and it went into the strand
that he was created from.

370
00:12:01,104 --> 00:12:02,771
- It didn't show up in the mom,

371
00:12:02,771 --> 00:12:04,686
but then it popped up in the kid?

372
00:12:04,686 --> 00:12:05,529
- [Ryan] Yeah.

373
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:06,362
- Okay.

374
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,218
David?

375
00:12:08,218 --> 00:12:10,417
- [David] I don't know, I think,

376
00:12:10,417 --> 00:12:11,443
I don't know if I agree with him,

377
00:12:11,443 --> 00:12:12,738
but I think I kind of do because,

378
00:12:12,738 --> 00:12:14,510
like he said, it was dominant,

379
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,621
but he still has,

380
00:12:15,621 --> 00:12:17,301
he still has a little bit in him,

381
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:18,541
so it's kind of like a,

382
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,205
well, because you still have,

383
00:12:20,205 --> 00:12:21,566
some of your traits,

384
00:12:21,566 --> 00:12:24,484
or your parents still
kind of have a little bit.

385
00:12:24,484 --> 00:12:25,958
- How are,

386
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,031
okay, how are,

387
00:12:27,031 --> 00:12:28,569
how is this idea

388
00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:30,998
that brown-eyed kids have,

389
00:12:30,998 --> 00:12:33,401
I'm sorry, brown-eyed,

390
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:35,273
there's more traits in brown eyes, right?

391
00:12:35,273 --> 00:12:36,676
Is that what this idea is about?

392
00:12:36,676 --> 00:12:38,058
All you guys right here?

393
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:40,149
How is that like this one?

394
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:44,529
That we get half from
mom and half from dad?

395
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:46,132
Or how can we use some of this thinking

396
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,712
and layer it onto some of this thinking,

397
00:12:48,712 --> 00:12:50,086
so they're both right?

398
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:52,010
- [Ryan] The question is
how are those two the same?

399
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:52,980
- [Voiceover] Right.

400
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,213
- How are that one and this one the same?

401
00:12:54,213 --> 00:12:55,240
- [Voiceover] How are pieces from this,

402
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,429
how do we use pieces from this idea

403
00:12:56,429 --> 00:12:58,676
that Lorenzo is bringing
up, dominant and recessive,

404
00:12:58,676 --> 00:13:00,665
how do we use pieces from this

405
00:13:00,665 --> 00:13:04,230
and combine it with pieces
from this group over here?

406
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:07,353
Let me get you to talk
about that with your group.

407
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,453
Let me ask, I'll ask that
question one more time.

408
00:13:09,453 --> 00:13:12,139
What's right about what
these guys are saying

409
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:15,212
and how can we add it to
stuff this group is thinking?

410
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:16,439
- [Voiceover] What if the
kid is born blind, right?

411
00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:20,106
(all students talk at once)

412
00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:24,756
Or what if the kid comes
out deaf and blind?

413
00:13:33,588 --> 00:13:38,479
- (mumbles) some express
themselves and some don't.

414
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:39,359
- Woo!

415
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:41,200
That, you just gave me a brain scan

416
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,195
because you read my mind. (laughs)

417
00:13:46,195 --> 00:13:47,845
Say there's two DNA strands.

418
00:13:47,845 --> 00:13:49,753
One in this hand, one in this hand.

419
00:13:49,753 --> 00:13:51,229
They combine.

420
00:13:51,229 --> 00:13:53,631
The dominant ones from each of these

421
00:13:53,631 --> 00:13:55,464
take over and make one

422
00:13:56,561 --> 00:13:59,102
of all the dominant ones

423
00:13:59,102 --> 00:14:01,119
that were in them.

424
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:02,783
- Can you give me an
example (mumbles)?

425
00:14:02,783 --> 00:14:07,374
- With Tyler, maybe there
was a dominant gene.

426
00:14:07,374 --> 00:14:09,676
The blue eyes was dominant.

427
00:14:09,676 --> 00:14:12,056
Maybe it was passive before it started,

428
00:14:12,056 --> 00:14:14,132
whatever it's called, recessive,

429
00:14:14,132 --> 00:14:16,272
and then it became dominant,

430
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,127
but over time,

431
00:14:18,127 --> 00:14:21,073
and then it (mumbles)

432
00:14:21,073 --> 00:14:22,646
went in Tyler.

433
00:14:22,646 --> 00:14:26,207
- How can a dominant gene
become a recessive gene

434
00:14:26,207 --> 00:14:27,745
and become dominant again?

435
00:14:27,745 --> 00:14:30,236
- [Voiceover] Maybe (mumbles)

436
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,572
every time it gets passed down.

437
00:14:31,572 --> 00:14:32,647
- [Voiceover] Hmm.

438
00:14:32,647 --> 00:14:34,502
- [Ryan] Like with us, we get bigger.

439
00:14:34,502 --> 00:14:36,263
- What if your,

440
00:14:36,263 --> 00:14:38,084
if your mom had

441
00:14:38,084 --> 00:14:39,621
two blue-eyed parents,

442
00:14:39,621 --> 00:14:43,621
but Ryan here, today (mumbles)?

443
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,873
- And they combine.

444
00:14:47,948 --> 00:14:48,865
I found it.

445
00:14:49,903 --> 00:14:56,570
(all students talk at once)

446
00:14:58,841 --> 00:15:03,008
- [Voiceover] All right,
are we ready to pull back?

447
00:15:04,465 --> 00:15:06,049
All right.

448
00:15:06,049 --> 00:15:08,309
I didn't get to hear from
all, these two groups,

449
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:10,976
but I did get to hear from them.

450
00:15:12,437 --> 00:15:14,807
I think what this group
has is something good,

451
00:15:14,807 --> 00:15:16,579
and I think you guys want to hear it.

452
00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:19,667
(mumbles), you're gonna be the
spokesperson for that group?

453
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:20,728
Great.

454
00:15:20,728 --> 00:15:21,761
- We agree that people get

455
00:15:21,761 --> 00:15:24,485
50% of their genes from their
mom and 50% from their dad.

456
00:15:24,485 --> 00:15:25,937
We think this because

457
00:15:25,937 --> 00:15:28,015
if there's two people who made the baby,

458
00:15:28,015 --> 00:15:30,708
then it's, logically,
should be split in half.

459
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:31,541
But

460
00:15:34,657 --> 00:15:36,231
all,

461
00:15:36,231 --> 00:15:37,588
every time someone has a baby,

462
00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:40,614
all of their genes of both
parents go into the baby.

463
00:15:40,614 --> 00:15:44,781
Only some of them decide to
express themselves and show.

464
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,356
- [Voiceover] Go ahead.

465
00:15:50,356 --> 00:15:53,915
- Say I have two DNA strands
from two different people.

466
00:15:53,915 --> 00:15:56,118
Say, Mary and Joe.

467
00:15:56,118 --> 00:15:59,897
Mary and Joe both had grandparents
that both have blue eyes,

468
00:15:59,897 --> 00:16:01,688
and that gene got passed down to them.

469
00:16:01,688 --> 00:16:05,018
Now, they combined to make one gene.

470
00:16:05,018 --> 00:16:08,044
Say Mary had blue eyes,
had a blue-eyed gene,

471
00:16:08,044 --> 00:16:09,805
and Joe had a blue-eyed gene.

472
00:16:09,805 --> 00:16:11,615
Those two genes combined

473
00:16:11,615 --> 00:16:14,045
to make one dominant blue-eyed gene

474
00:16:14,045 --> 00:16:15,277
and it goes in,

475
00:16:15,277 --> 00:16:16,367
like what Tyler,

476
00:16:16,367 --> 00:16:18,299
like with Tyler.

477
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:19,782
- [Voiceover] Right, so we,

478
00:16:19,782 --> 00:16:21,446
Tyler, he used you as an example.

479
00:16:21,446 --> 00:16:23,914
Your parents both have brown eyes, right?

480
00:16:23,914 --> 00:16:24,779
- [Tyler] Mm-hmm.

481
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:26,024
- [Voiceover] And what
were you guys saying about,

482
00:16:26,024 --> 00:16:28,485
his parents both have
brown eyes, but something,

483
00:16:28,485 --> 00:16:29,547
they had something else too?

484
00:16:29,547 --> 00:16:30,380
- Yeah.

485
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,225
- Because everyone kind of has

486
00:16:31,225 --> 00:16:32,247
a little bit of everything in them,

487
00:16:32,247 --> 00:16:33,245
it's just some,

488
00:16:33,245 --> 00:16:36,194
some color or some trait just decides

489
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:39,111
to show because it's more dominant.

490
00:16:41,932 --> 00:16:42,765
- [Voiceover] You know the movie,

491
00:16:42,765 --> 00:16:43,598
you know the movie,

492
00:16:43,598 --> 00:16:44,670
(mumbles), that movie?

493
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,305
They went to some place
and they went to go get,

494
00:16:48,305 --> 00:16:49,447
(mumbles) found out,

495
00:16:49,447 --> 00:16:51,049
they got the book from some person

496
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:52,488
and they matched it up to ours,

497
00:16:52,488 --> 00:16:53,811
and it was different colors,

498
00:16:53,811 --> 00:16:56,663
so they had different kind of genes

499
00:16:56,663 --> 00:16:58,287
for like, for things.

500
00:16:58,287 --> 00:17:01,775
So if you compare a baby who has blue eyes

501
00:17:01,775 --> 00:17:03,083
and one who has brown eyes,

502
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,081
it's gonna have,

503
00:17:04,081 --> 00:17:05,850
it's gonna have different
things with the eyes.

504
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:08,217
The DNA thing will be different.

505
00:17:08,217 --> 00:17:11,240
- [Voiceover] Maybe those DNA genes that,

506
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,040
in a DNA, maybe they would look different

507
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,613
for a blue-eyed person
than a brown-eyed person?

508
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:15,446
- Yeah.

509
00:17:15,446 --> 00:17:16,639
- [Voiceover] Did you wanna say something?

510
00:17:16,639 --> 00:17:18,637
- Maybe the DNA of Tyler's parents,

511
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,715
for example, if their grandparents

512
00:17:20,715 --> 00:17:24,233
had blue-eyed DNA accumulating in them,

513
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:26,045
it might have been
passed down through them.

514
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,518
And then when they got to where

515
00:17:27,518 --> 00:17:29,334
they were forming Tyler inside their,

516
00:17:29,334 --> 00:17:31,354
his mom's stomach (laughs),

517
00:17:31,354 --> 00:17:34,680
it might have, the blue
DNA might have overpowered,

518
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,071
combining those two blue DNAs by getting,

519
00:17:38,071 --> 00:17:40,637
it might have overpowered the brown eyes,

520
00:17:40,637 --> 00:17:42,618
which made Tyler get the blue eyes.

521
00:17:42,618 --> 00:17:43,679
- [Voiceover] (mumbles) 50%?

522
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,045
It could be like 50%.

523
00:17:45,045 --> 00:17:46,046
- [Voiceover] That happened in my family.

524
00:17:46,046 --> 00:17:46,879
- They're saying,

525
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:48,555
what color eyes are your parent's, Tyler?

526
00:17:48,555 --> 00:17:50,589
What's your mom's eye color?

527
00:17:50,589 --> 00:17:51,597
- [Tyler] Brown.

528
00:17:51,597 --> 00:17:52,762
- Oh.

529
00:17:52,762 --> 00:17:55,136
- [Voiceover] Yeah, what
you got on your mom's side?

530
00:17:55,136 --> 00:17:57,855
- From my brown-eyed mom? (laughs)

531
00:17:57,855 --> 00:17:59,082
Brown.

532
00:17:59,082 --> 00:18:01,399
- [Voiceover] So what
about your mom's mom?

533
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:02,941
What about your dad's?

534
00:18:02,941 --> 00:18:04,216
- [Voiceover] What about your dad?

535
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,865
- All right, you guys, let's talk.

536
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:07,071
Let's talk for a second.

537
00:18:07,071 --> 00:18:09,229
If we've got an example of one person,

538
00:18:09,229 --> 00:18:11,840
in science, you never hang
everything on one person.

539
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,798
Let's be careful about that.

540
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:16,445
And we don't want to have
him be the reason for all.

541
00:18:16,445 --> 00:18:18,695
But this is a good example.

542
00:18:19,762 --> 00:18:23,065
Do we think that people can have

543
00:18:23,065 --> 00:18:24,787
genes in them that aren't showing,

544
00:18:24,787 --> 00:18:25,818
but then they can have a kid,

545
00:18:25,818 --> 00:18:27,546
and then those genes pop up?

546
00:18:27,546 --> 00:18:30,545
- [Voiceover] Yeah,
because if the two genes--

547
00:18:30,545 --> 00:18:32,046
- Did you want to say
something about it, Lorenzo?

548
00:18:32,046 --> 00:18:33,586
- [Lorenzo] Yeah, because I think that

549
00:18:33,586 --> 00:18:36,527
if a parent had brown eyes
and one had blue eyes,

550
00:18:36,527 --> 00:18:38,793
but the brown-eyed parent
also had some blue-eyed genes,

551
00:18:38,793 --> 00:18:40,992
then the baby would
probably come out blue,

552
00:18:40,992 --> 00:18:42,367
because it has the blue-eyed gene

553
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:43,613
and then half of the blue-eyed gene

554
00:18:43,613 --> 00:18:45,353
from the other parent.

555
00:18:45,353 --> 00:18:49,314
- How could we figure out how
we get our traits for sure?

556
00:18:49,314 --> 00:18:50,800
Because we have a lot of ideas, but what,

557
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,002
in science class, what will we do?

558
00:18:53,002 --> 00:18:55,010
What kind of activity could we do?

559
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,318
What kind of research could we do?

560
00:18:56,318 --> 00:18:57,873
How would we find out?

561
00:18:57,873 --> 00:18:59,976
- We could go on AskJeeves.com and we--

562
00:18:59,976 --> 00:19:03,790
(all students laugh)

563
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,925
- So we could look it up on the Internet.

564
00:19:05,925 --> 00:19:07,936
Okay, guys, one resource we could look at.

565
00:19:07,936 --> 00:19:10,353
How else could we figure this out?

566
00:19:10,353 --> 00:19:11,618
- We could take a survey.

567
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:14,009
- [Voiceover] Didn't we do that?

568
00:19:14,009 --> 00:19:15,811
(mumbles) the class?

569
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:16,644
- [Voiceover] We did?

570
00:19:16,644 --> 00:19:17,477
- [Voiceover] No.

571
00:19:17,477 --> 00:19:18,774
(all students talk)

572
00:19:18,774 --> 00:19:20,049
- But we could (mumbles) whole school

573
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:22,458
so we have more to research,
or more, I don't know.

574
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,786
- [Voiceover] Make a larger sample size.

575
00:19:24,786 --> 00:19:27,133
Then, we get information
and we find out that

576
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,142
X percent of our students have brown eyes

577
00:19:29,142 --> 00:19:31,964
and X percent of our
students have blue eyes.

578
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:33,668
How does that help us find out

579
00:19:33,668 --> 00:19:35,844
where those traits came from?

580
00:19:35,844 --> 00:19:39,427
- [Voiceover] It gives
us more of an idea--

581
00:19:40,742 --> 00:19:43,911
- [Voiceover] Their parents
and their grandparents too.

582
00:19:43,911 --> 00:19:46,208
And their great-grandparents.

583
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,349
- [Voiceover] We'd have to ask people to,

584
00:19:48,349 --> 00:19:49,367
we'd have to ask people to do

585
00:19:49,367 --> 00:19:51,075
some research on their families?

586
00:19:51,075 --> 00:19:53,282
Okay, so we could do some family research.

587
00:19:53,282 --> 00:19:54,325
Sonja?

588
00:19:54,325 --> 00:19:56,797
- We could make up an
assignment (mumbles).

589
00:19:56,797 --> 00:19:57,630
- [Voiceover] Sure.

590
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,194
- [Sonja] (mumbles)

591
00:19:59,194 --> 00:20:00,027
- [Voiceover] Okay.
