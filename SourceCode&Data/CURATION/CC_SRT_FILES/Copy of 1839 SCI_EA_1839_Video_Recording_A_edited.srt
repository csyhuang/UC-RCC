1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,800
(no audio)

2
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:07,781
- It's similar to when
we had the hand warmer.

3
00:00:07,781 --> 00:00:10,309
What happens is when you add heat energy

4
00:00:10,309 --> 00:00:14,226
to the hand warmer, it
makes the water rise up.

5
00:00:15,755 --> 00:00:17,659
So, in the glass,

6
00:00:17,659 --> 00:00:20,770
in the two liter bottle in the glass too,

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,687
the heat lamp added heat
to it, the heat energy.

8
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:28,408
Then the water started to rise up.

9
00:00:28,408 --> 00:00:30,158
- Of the water, okay.

10
00:00:33,938 --> 00:00:38,629
So, why do you think the
water spilled over last time?

11
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:42,666
- I think that it's because
of the molecules expanding.

12
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,256
- [Voiceover] Okay.

13
00:00:44,256 --> 00:00:45,853
- And then the molecules
didn't have enough room.

14
00:00:45,853 --> 00:00:47,929
Well, the water didn't have enough room,

15
00:00:47,929 --> 00:00:49,485
so it had to get out.

16
00:00:49,485 --> 00:00:52,818
So, then it popped out through the tube.

17
00:00:53,861 --> 00:00:55,376
- [Voiceover] Okay.

18
00:00:55,376 --> 00:00:57,162
Do you share the same idea?

19
00:00:57,162 --> 00:00:57,995
- Yeah.

20
00:00:57,995 --> 00:00:58,885
- [Voiceover] Do you agree with her?

21
00:00:58,885 --> 00:00:59,896
- Yes.

22
00:00:59,896 --> 00:01:01,130
- [Voiceover] Okay. Alright.

23
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,566
Let's talk about this. Yes.

24
00:01:02,566 --> 00:01:04,149
- I have something.

25
00:01:05,162 --> 00:01:08,438
Like, with mine, we thought that since

26
00:01:08,438 --> 00:01:11,015
there was oxygen, I mean,

27
00:01:11,015 --> 00:01:13,876
there was a glass tube,
that the water had room

28
00:01:13,876 --> 00:01:15,949
to expand and like, spill out.

29
00:01:15,949 --> 00:01:17,421
So, what's why it did.

30
00:01:17,421 --> 00:01:19,634
- Okay, thank you. Alright.

31
00:01:19,634 --> 00:01:21,420
Let me ask you something.

32
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,587
How many of you put that
water molecules expanded?

33
00:01:26,467 --> 00:01:27,472
Raise your hand.

34
00:01:27,472 --> 00:01:30,653
As a reason for water spilling.

35
00:01:30,653 --> 00:01:31,788
Alright.

36
00:01:31,788 --> 00:01:32,825
Okay.

37
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:34,947
They gave you the reason why, right?

38
00:01:34,947 --> 00:01:37,935
So, who can tell me why you put that?

39
00:01:37,935 --> 00:01:39,146
Alright, Rebecca.

40
00:01:39,146 --> 00:01:41,229
- I put that because,

41
00:01:42,565 --> 00:01:44,300
well you see it...

42
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,130
Well, in the bottle lab,

43
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,310
we had water in there,

44
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,060
so when it heated up,

45
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:52,436
they expanded,

46
00:01:52,436 --> 00:01:53,991
and they didn't have enough room,

47
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:55,809
so they had to, it had to

48
00:01:55,809 --> 00:01:57,127
come out.
- [Voiceover] So, molecules

49
00:01:57,127 --> 00:01:58,284
got bigger right?

50
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,448
- Yeah.

51
00:01:59,448 --> 00:02:00,983
- If you don't believe
molecules got bigger,

52
00:02:00,983 --> 00:02:02,746
what did you guys think
that the water spilled over?

53
00:02:02,746 --> 00:02:03,948
Yeah.

54
00:02:03,948 --> 00:02:05,303
- I think

55
00:02:05,303 --> 00:02:07,369
if the water molecules didn't get bigger,

56
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:10,250
I think that the heat
caused them to move around

57
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,374
and bump into each other.

58
00:02:12,374 --> 00:02:14,523
- Okay, so what is the
evidence for both of these?

59
00:02:14,523 --> 00:02:16,952
You played with the water heater.

60
00:02:16,952 --> 00:02:20,518
Where is the evidence to
support this? Anybody?

61
00:02:20,518 --> 00:02:21,351
Anthony.

62
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,873
- Like what I think is that,

63
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:32,418
that the steam is like
mostly involved with this,

64
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:36,251
'cause the only type of
air water has is steam.

65
00:02:37,354 --> 00:02:41,521
And like, since the water
was heated so intensely,

66
00:02:44,527 --> 00:02:48,793
it had to let out all
the air it contained.

67
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,793
So, it spewed out steam.

68
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:56,404
- Okay, thank you very much. Good job.

69
00:02:56,404 --> 00:02:58,821
I'm gonna go over with Moorea.

70
00:03:03,241 --> 00:03:05,736
Why do you think that water...

71
00:03:05,736 --> 00:03:09,648
You didn't agree with
water molecule being, expanding, right?

72
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:10,659
- Yeah.

73
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:13,097
- [Voiceover] So, what is your evidence

74
00:03:13,097 --> 00:03:14,286
that it is not expanding?

75
00:03:14,286 --> 00:03:19,216
- Well, I think when we
added the heat to the water,

76
00:03:19,216 --> 00:03:22,724
I think the molecules
started getting hotter,

77
00:03:22,724 --> 00:03:25,789
and the heat was transferred from the lamp

78
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:29,020
to the molecules, and they
started moving around more.

79
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,032
Kind of like how sugar makes people,

80
00:03:32,032 --> 00:03:33,710
like have a sugar rush, and
kind of move around more,

81
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,044
and get more excited..

82
00:03:35,044 --> 00:03:38,178
And then, they just needed more room,

83
00:03:38,178 --> 00:03:41,386
so they spilled out into the tube.

84
00:03:41,386 --> 00:03:43,206
- Okay. Now let me ask you something.

85
00:03:43,206 --> 00:03:44,633
If that is true,

86
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:48,226
how come if I press it
here, it's going down?

87
00:03:48,226 --> 00:03:49,604
Why?

88
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,679
Yes, Tyshon.

89
00:03:50,679 --> 00:03:52,368
- Because of the heat in your hand.

90
00:03:52,368 --> 00:03:54,673
- What's happening, the heat of my hand?

91
00:03:54,673 --> 00:03:55,506
Right, Saron.

92
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,321
- So, it goes down faster because

93
00:04:02,114 --> 00:04:06,550
the heat in your hand is
enclosing around the top, I guess.

94
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,575
So, it will make it come down.

95
00:04:08,575 --> 00:04:10,520
- [Voiceover] Jake.

96
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,939
- I'm not sure, but I
think it goes down faster,

97
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:16,454
yes, because of everybody else saying

98
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:20,479
that when you hold, from
the heat of your hand.

99
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,537
But I think it's also because
gravity pushes things down.

100
00:04:24,537 --> 00:04:25,870
- Okay. Alright.

101
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:31,344
Alec has two finger, means
he has something to add.

102
00:04:31,344 --> 00:04:32,720
- I agree with Jake.

103
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,711
And I also think that
since the water went down,

104
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,314
it's because it had
more room at the bottom.

105
00:04:38,314 --> 00:04:40,175
So, when you put your hand around it,

106
00:04:40,175 --> 00:04:42,698
it immediately goes down,

107
00:04:42,698 --> 00:04:44,524
also because of gravity,

108
00:04:44,524 --> 00:04:46,167
and how it has more room.

109
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:48,708
- [Voiceover] How did you
come up with that answer?

110
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,560
- Well, when you were holding the top,

111
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,961
I saw that the bottom was empty.

112
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:57,711
And like, so I thought
that 'cause of gravity,

113
00:04:59,455 --> 00:05:01,618
when you hold it at the top,

114
00:05:01,618 --> 00:05:03,349
it has more room to go down--

115
00:05:03,349 --> 00:05:05,300
- [Voiceover] But if you hold the bottom.

116
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,547
Look at the whole bottom.

117
00:05:06,547 --> 00:05:07,545
Hold the bottom.

118
00:05:07,545 --> 00:05:08,583
What's happening?

119
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:09,806
- It's right there.

120
00:05:09,806 --> 00:05:11,537
- [Voiceover] It's against
the gravity. It's going up.

121
00:05:11,537 --> 00:05:12,658
So, hold on.

122
00:05:12,658 --> 00:05:14,936
I'm gonna provide the
evidence about the result.

123
00:05:14,936 --> 00:05:16,654
This is computer simulation.

124
00:05:16,654 --> 00:05:18,639
Watch this carefully.

125
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,129
I want you to watch this carefully.

126
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:24,629
And look at this. The right side is water.

127
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:28,881
Okay, the right side is water.

128
00:05:31,335 --> 00:05:32,861
And, did I turn the heat on?

129
00:05:32,861 --> 00:05:33,860
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

130
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,696
- [Voiceover] Yeah. Okay.

131
00:05:34,696 --> 00:05:35,901
So, who turned it off?

132
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:37,984
I'm gonna reset it. Okay.

133
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,055
And then, heat is off.

134
00:05:41,055 --> 00:05:44,214
Watch. Look at air and water molecule.

135
00:05:44,214 --> 00:05:45,893
Let's look at the water molecules first,

136
00:05:45,893 --> 00:05:47,183
since we're doing the liquid part.

137
00:05:47,183 --> 00:05:48,189
Are you with me?

138
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:49,344
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

139
00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:50,177
- Alright.

140
00:05:50,177 --> 00:05:52,454
What is happening to water molecule?

141
00:05:52,454 --> 00:05:54,199
Write it down with your group.

142
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,915
You've got 30 seconds.

143
00:05:55,915 --> 00:05:56,832
30 seconds.

144
00:05:57,929 --> 00:06:01,523
(students talking loudly)

145
00:06:01,523 --> 00:06:03,028
30 seconds.

146
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:04,745
Talk to the group.

147
00:06:04,745 --> 00:06:07,995
- Molecules are vibrating very slightly.

148
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:13,827
- Since the water's mostly cooled down,

149
00:06:13,827 --> 00:06:16,036
more than the air, it's more stable.

150
00:06:16,036 --> 00:06:19,693
It's like, doesn't
vibrate as much as air,

151
00:06:19,693 --> 00:06:22,257
'cause water is like, more still,

152
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:24,840
and more like a solid than air.

153
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:28,254
- Okay.

154
00:06:29,832 --> 00:06:31,764
Please observe everything.

155
00:06:31,764 --> 00:06:35,931
And I'm going to be asking
you questions. Alright.

156
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,261
And here we go.

157
00:06:38,261 --> 00:06:40,641
I'm gonna turn the heat on.

158
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:43,462
As a group, you need do discuss
and write everything down,

159
00:06:43,462 --> 00:06:44,608
what you see here.

160
00:06:44,608 --> 00:06:47,200
Just the air. I mean, I'm sorry.

161
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,730
Just observe the water,
yes. Everything, okay.

162
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,230
Here we go. Group.

163
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:56,723
Water only.

164
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:23,000
(background noise)

165
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:28,814
Okay, now discuss with
your group. Alright.

166
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:29,731
Water only.

167
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:34,483
(students talking loudly)

168
00:07:37,485 --> 00:07:39,452
- The water molecules,
they aren't moving around

169
00:07:39,452 --> 00:07:42,869
like the air ones, but they're vibrating.

170
00:07:43,757 --> 00:07:46,392
They're moving like back and forth.

171
00:07:46,392 --> 00:07:48,567
They're vibrating like really violently.

172
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:50,843
They're staying in the same general area.

173
00:07:50,843 --> 00:07:52,510
Like (humming).

174
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,846
But the water ones are like...

175
00:07:54,846 --> 00:07:57,139
I'm sorry, the molecules in the air

176
00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:02,083
are bouncing around, and
when the heat is applied,

177
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:05,086
they start bouncing around faster.

178
00:08:05,086 --> 00:08:06,459
- I agree with Maor,

179
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:09,493
but I think that with the air ones,

180
00:08:09,493 --> 00:08:11,173
that they have more room to bounce around.

181
00:08:11,173 --> 00:08:13,268
That the water is all
contained in one thing.

182
00:08:13,268 --> 00:08:15,370
So, the molecules have
to stay in one position,

183
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,943
but the air has to--

184
00:08:16,943 --> 00:08:19,067
- What do you think, ladies?
You haven't said anything.

185
00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:21,128
- I think the same thing as Maor,

186
00:08:21,128 --> 00:08:23,396
because the air molecules have more room

187
00:08:23,396 --> 00:08:26,301
to the surrounding, because
it's really nothing in there.

188
00:08:26,301 --> 00:08:29,301
And since water is a liquid it has less room.

189
00:08:30,746 --> 00:08:31,579
Whatever.

190
00:08:32,609 --> 00:08:36,776
- I see that, the more the
heat gets on the water--

191
00:08:38,575 --> 00:08:40,147
- Alright, 30 more seconds.

192
00:08:40,147 --> 00:08:42,111
So, we're gonna start the discussion.

193
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:44,351
There are people who
need more time to write,

194
00:08:44,351 --> 00:08:46,234
but you already know what to do.

195
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,676
So, here we are. Okay.

196
00:08:47,676 --> 00:08:51,138
I'm gonna call on
individuals, so, please do so.

197
00:08:51,138 --> 00:08:52,655
You don't have to stand up.

198
00:08:52,655 --> 00:08:53,488
Ivree.

199
00:08:55,383 --> 00:08:58,357
- I saw that when you turned on the lamp,

200
00:08:58,357 --> 00:09:00,384
it started vibrating faster than--

201
00:09:00,384 --> 00:09:02,151
- [Voiceover] Which one?
We're talking about which one?

202
00:09:02,151 --> 00:09:03,554
- The water.

203
00:09:03,554 --> 00:09:04,980
- [Voiceover] Okay. Vibrating faster.

204
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,017
Joon Po, you think through?

205
00:09:07,017 --> 00:09:09,915
- The temperature also
started rising very little.

206
00:09:09,915 --> 00:09:11,156
- [Voiceover] Excellent.

207
00:09:11,156 --> 00:09:12,507
Dylan, what else did you notice?

208
00:09:12,507 --> 00:09:15,840
- I'm noticing that when the heat is on,

209
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:20,275
the water is starting to vibrate very fast

210
00:09:20,275 --> 00:09:24,431
when it's turned on, but
they are staying stationary,

211
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:26,492
they're not actually moving anymore.

212
00:09:26,492 --> 00:09:28,134
- [Voiceover] So, why do you think

213
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,190
the water molecules are vibrating?

214
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,023
Chelsea.

215
00:09:38,155 --> 00:09:39,454
- Because of the heat

216
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:40,939
that is going on to the molecules.

217
00:09:40,939 --> 00:09:42,715
- [Voiceover] So, what you're saying is

218
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,372
the heat source
is going to molecules.

219
00:09:44,372 --> 00:09:47,705
Class. What do you call the heat source?

220
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:50,798
Which is the lamp.

221
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,226
What is it?

222
00:09:52,226 --> 00:09:53,059
- Heat energy.

223
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,360
- [Voiceover] Heat energy.

224
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,018
Very good.

225
00:09:56,018 --> 00:09:57,027
So, in this case.

226
00:09:57,027 --> 00:09:58,747
I don't know if you agree with Chelsea.

227
00:09:58,747 --> 00:09:59,999
Raise your hand.

228
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,517
How many of you disagree?

229
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,549
Raise your hand.

230
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:04,629
Alright.

231
00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:07,546
How many of you agree with Chelsea?

232
00:10:08,563 --> 00:10:09,896
Raise your hand.

233
00:10:11,021 --> 00:10:12,649
Okay.

234
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:13,674
Alright.

235
00:10:13,674 --> 00:10:15,588
The molecules are transferring energy.

236
00:10:15,588 --> 00:10:18,682
The heat energy is transferring
heat to the energy.

237
00:10:18,682 --> 00:10:20,038
Thank you very much.

238
00:10:20,038 --> 00:10:21,702
Now, next part,

239
00:10:21,702 --> 00:10:25,684
I'm going to give you a
life problem to solve.

240
00:10:25,684 --> 00:10:27,840
And I want you to come up with solutions.

241
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,907
Okay.

242
00:10:28,907 --> 00:10:31,765
How many like to play ping pong?

243
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:32,772
Oh, excellent.

244
00:10:32,772 --> 00:10:34,600
You know, I grew up playing ping pong,

245
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,259
because in Asian culture,

246
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:40,081
ping pong's a lot cheaper to
purchase than basketballs.

247
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:43,380
So, most every home has ping pong,

248
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,051
or ping pong table,
because it's easy to make

249
00:10:46,051 --> 00:10:47,050
out of wood.

250
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,885
Now, having said that.

251
00:10:48,885 --> 00:10:53,052
Suppose you received a set of
ping pong balls for holiday

252
00:10:55,024 --> 00:10:56,447
because you asked for it,

253
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,752
from your parents,

254
00:10:57,752 --> 00:10:59,393
and your parents being really nice,

255
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:00,637
and you behaved really well.

256
00:11:00,637 --> 00:11:03,661
They decide to give you
these ping pong balls you got.

257
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:05,323
The problem is you lost
all of them except one.

258
00:11:05,323 --> 00:11:08,013
And your best friend came
over to play with this.

259
00:11:08,013 --> 00:11:10,298
But he stepped on it on accident.

260
00:11:10,298 --> 00:11:12,458
So, now here's a dent.

261
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,512
Right, he has to fix it.

262
00:11:14,512 --> 00:11:16,183
Can you fix it? You're all worried.

263
00:11:16,183 --> 00:11:18,749
Because you've never seen
anybody can fix this.

264
00:11:18,749 --> 00:11:23,249
So, give me some suggestions
by talking to your group.

265
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:24,248
Alright.

266
00:11:24,248 --> 00:11:26,924
You have buddies back up there, alright.

267
00:11:26,924 --> 00:11:28,051
(students talking loudly)

268
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:28,884
- Kind of like the water bottle, right.

269
00:11:28,884 --> 00:11:31,336
Especially like, you can fix another part.

270
00:11:31,336 --> 00:11:32,904
Maybe you could do the same
thing with the ping pong ball.

271
00:11:32,904 --> 00:11:36,214
- Like if you start to
squish the ping pong balls down,

272
00:11:36,214 --> 00:11:40,187
and maybe you could (mumbles) its place.

273
00:11:40,187 --> 00:11:41,503
- It'd be easier to pop it out.

274
00:11:41,503 --> 00:11:43,836
- I think you can apply air.

275
00:11:46,442 --> 00:11:49,192
You can apply air like with heat.

276
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:51,816
Like at least heat.

277
00:11:51,816 --> 00:11:52,761
'Cause you know when

278
00:11:52,761 --> 00:11:54,727
the heat was added to the water?

279
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:55,560
Right.

280
00:11:56,573 --> 00:11:59,990
Like you could apply air with a little...

281
00:11:59,995 --> 00:12:01,500
- Do you need more time?

282
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:03,340
- Like the thing--

283
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,923
- Okay.

284
00:12:04,923 --> 00:12:08,673
So, I'm going to write
the solution, alright,

285
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:13,227
by asking group that has an answer.

286
00:12:13,227 --> 00:12:14,832
Just stand up one at a time,

287
00:12:14,832 --> 00:12:16,795
the group that hasn't answered yet.

288
00:12:16,795 --> 00:12:19,295
Alright. So here's a solution.

289
00:12:21,218 --> 00:12:23,468
Say ping pong ball dilemma.

290
00:12:29,232 --> 00:12:30,582
Alright.

291
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:31,647
Okay, number one.

292
00:12:31,647 --> 00:12:32,788
Which group is gonna be?

293
00:12:32,788 --> 00:12:33,806
Just stand up.

294
00:12:33,806 --> 00:12:36,161
Just stand up, if you haven't
spoke in this group.

295
00:12:36,161 --> 00:12:37,577
- We already thought that

296
00:12:37,577 --> 00:12:39,346
you could try and use your hands and 

297
00:12:39,346 --> 00:12:41,902
like pop the air back into it

298
00:12:41,902 --> 00:12:44,637
and get it to its original shape.

299
00:12:44,637 --> 00:12:45,470
- Okay.

300
00:12:47,268 --> 00:12:50,463
Alright, number two. Something different.

301
00:12:50,463 --> 00:12:53,472
Which group that hasn't spoken yet?

302
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,305
Okay, Chelsea's group.

303
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:04,271
- Alec said that if you
push around the edges,

304
00:13:04,271 --> 00:13:06,688
it might pop back into shape.

305
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:09,903
- [Voiceover] So, kind of the same thing.

306
00:13:09,903 --> 00:13:10,736
Yes.

307
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:16,389
- We think that somehow if you maybe poked

308
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:21,334
a hole in it, you can
use, like an air pump,

309
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:24,969
or some sort of machine
to get the air in it,

310
00:13:24,969 --> 00:13:28,035
and maybe the air will
push against the dent.

311
00:13:28,035 --> 00:13:30,285
And make it a sphere again.

312
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,850
- [Voiceover] Let's see how many of you

313
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,551
believe this dilemma, raise your hand.

314
00:13:36,551 --> 00:13:37,903
Okay.

315
00:13:37,903 --> 00:13:38,904
Alright.

316
00:13:38,904 --> 00:13:41,413
How many of you believe
this is gonna work?

317
00:13:41,413 --> 00:13:42,771
Raise your hand.

318
00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:44,959
How many believe this is gonna work?

319
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:45,957
Alright.

320
00:13:45,957 --> 00:13:48,250
Is there a third option, anybody?

321
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,379
Okay. Yes.

322
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:52,038
- I don't know if this will work,

323
00:13:52,038 --> 00:13:55,643
but maybe you can put in front of a lamp.

324
00:13:55,643 --> 00:13:57,430
- Okay. Excellent start.

325
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,477
But why would you put it in front a lamp?

326
00:13:59,477 --> 00:14:00,805
Let me ask you something.

327
00:14:00,805 --> 00:14:03,309
- Maybe so that the molecules in it,

328
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,476
like in the water example,

329
00:14:06,843 --> 00:14:09,343
maybe they'll start, like vibrate...

330
00:14:10,203 --> 00:14:12,281
- [Voiceover] No, you're okay.

331
00:14:12,281 --> 00:14:13,733
- Well, it's air, so--

332
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:15,844
- [Voiceover] You want to
add heat energy, right?

333
00:14:15,844 --> 00:14:17,162
- Yeah, you want to add

334
00:14:17,162 --> 00:14:18,385
heat.
- [Teacher] Alright, so,

335
00:14:18,385 --> 00:14:19,559
we're gonna try all of those.

336
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,642
So, let's try with number one.

337
00:14:23,227 --> 00:14:25,503
So, I'm going to give Sasha

338
00:14:25,503 --> 00:14:28,420
a ping pong ball that's been dented

339
00:14:29,648 --> 00:14:31,148
by my best friend.

340
00:14:32,178 --> 00:14:33,277
Or not my best friend.

341
00:14:33,277 --> 00:14:35,275
Her best friend, so
she's gonna try to do it.

342
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:37,403
Okay, number two is what?

343
00:14:37,403 --> 00:14:38,831
Pop a hole in it.

344
00:14:38,831 --> 00:14:41,998
So, how many of you disagree with this?

345
00:14:41,998 --> 00:14:43,669
Or of this idea.

346
00:14:43,669 --> 00:14:46,473
Why would you disagree
with this idea, Dylan?

347
00:14:46,473 --> 00:14:49,462
- Because if you poked a hole in it,

348
00:14:49,462 --> 00:14:51,726
it would be kind of like, ruin it,

349
00:14:51,726 --> 00:14:52,982
and release all this stuff,

350
00:14:52,982 --> 00:14:54,337
and it would be kind of hard to--

351
00:14:54,337 --> 00:14:55,856
- [Voiceover] Okay. What are
you ruining in this case?

352
00:14:55,856 --> 00:14:56,932
- The ping pong ball.

353
00:14:56,932 --> 00:14:58,576
- [Voiceover] In other words.

354
00:14:58,576 --> 00:14:59,952
What you're saying, is
a surface of the thing?

355
00:14:59,952 --> 00:15:01,090
- Yeah.

356
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,448
- [Voiceover] Okay. Did you try?

357
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:03,712
- Yeah, like it's really hard.

358
00:15:03,712 --> 00:15:04,782
So, it's actually hard to

359
00:15:04,782 --> 00:15:05,615
pop it back in.
- [Teacher] Let's see.

360
00:15:05,615 --> 00:15:06,448
Who's strong?

361
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:07,698
- Me.

362
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,531
- Okay. You're strong.

363
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,734
She wants to do it.

364
00:15:13,734 --> 00:15:15,427
If she doesn't work, then let's do it.

365
00:15:15,427 --> 00:15:18,192
Okay, how about the lamp? Lamp thingy.

366
00:15:18,192 --> 00:15:19,025
So...

367
00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:23,692
Let's see.

368
00:15:24,987 --> 00:15:26,683
Are you the one that says the...

369
00:15:26,683 --> 00:15:27,766
Come on over.

370
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:31,539
Okay. Leave it like this.

371
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:32,652
Turn the heater on.

372
00:15:32,652 --> 00:15:34,086
Okay.

373
00:15:34,086 --> 00:15:36,419
On the top, yeah, that's it.

374
00:15:37,415 --> 00:15:38,866
The other way.

375
00:15:38,866 --> 00:15:41,033
There you go. Right there.

376
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:43,766
Yeah, there, you got it.

377
00:15:43,766 --> 00:15:45,484
- [Voiceover] Oh, okay.

378
00:15:45,484 --> 00:15:47,461
- Oh, what happened?

379
00:15:47,461 --> 00:15:51,628
It helps if it's connected
isn't it? (laughs)

380
00:15:53,505 --> 00:15:55,629
Okay. Try that again.

381
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:56,640
There.

382
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,133
So, we're gonna time it.

383
00:15:58,133 --> 00:15:59,827
While we're working on this
for a couple minutes.

384
00:15:59,827 --> 00:16:00,963
Okay.

385
00:16:00,963 --> 00:16:01,974
Alright.

386
00:16:01,974 --> 00:16:03,331
Okay.

387
00:16:03,331 --> 00:16:04,890
Alright.

388
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,756
So, who has the ping pong now?

389
00:16:06,756 --> 00:16:09,498
(laughing)

390
00:16:09,498 --> 00:16:10,954
- The dent was too strong.

391
00:16:10,954 --> 00:16:12,646
- Okay, now. Look at the ping pong ball.

392
00:16:12,646 --> 00:16:14,818
I'm gonna show it to you.

393
00:16:14,818 --> 00:16:17,073
Okay, look. You saw it right? All of you.

394
00:16:17,073 --> 00:16:18,458
What happened?

395
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:19,994
- It has more dents.

396
00:16:19,994 --> 00:16:21,489
- Not only the dent. What else?

397
00:16:21,489 --> 00:16:22,679
- It broke.

398
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:24,427
- Is this gonna work?

399
00:16:24,427 --> 00:16:27,222
That's completely ruined...

400
00:16:27,222 --> 00:16:29,047
What did that do? Nothing.

401
00:16:29,047 --> 00:16:30,513
Alright, so,

402
00:16:30,513 --> 00:16:32,390
let's say first idea is no good.

403
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,424
Okay.

404
00:16:33,424 --> 00:16:35,598
So, second idea, poke a hole.

405
00:16:35,598 --> 00:16:37,633
We agreed that it's not gonna work,

406
00:16:37,633 --> 00:16:39,310
because it's gonna compromise.

407
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,116
How many of you agree with that?

408
00:16:41,116 --> 00:16:43,478
It's gonna compromise
the shape of the thing.

409
00:16:43,478 --> 00:16:44,936
Okay.

410
00:16:44,936 --> 00:16:47,077
Alright, the third idea.

411
00:16:47,077 --> 00:16:48,838
Alright. It's about a minute.

412
00:16:48,838 --> 00:16:50,171
Nothing's happening.

413
00:16:50,171 --> 00:16:51,004
Okay.

414
00:16:51,004 --> 00:16:53,207
Do you have any other suggestions?

415
00:16:53,207 --> 00:16:55,084
Who hasn't said anything?

416
00:16:55,084 --> 00:16:56,100
Sydney?

417
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,658
- I think maybe you could like
put it between your hands,

418
00:16:58,658 --> 00:17:02,418
because it might work
the same as the lamp,

419
00:17:02,418 --> 00:17:03,751
but just faster.

420
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:06,044
- Okay.

421
00:17:06,044 --> 00:17:07,879
So, how many agree that,

422
00:17:07,879 --> 00:17:09,876
looks like both of you,

423
00:17:09,876 --> 00:17:11,475
if I'm not mistaken,

424
00:17:11,475 --> 00:17:14,828
that you have to have
some kind of heat, right?

425
00:17:14,828 --> 00:17:16,245
You said because?

426
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:20,162
- I said because, like the water,

427
00:17:21,214 --> 00:17:23,214
it needs room to expand.

428
00:17:24,979 --> 00:17:26,280
Well, it's not actually expanding,

429
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,938
but it needs room to move,

430
00:17:27,938 --> 00:17:31,512
so, the ball will probably expand.

431
00:17:31,512 --> 00:17:35,006
- Okay, I'm gonna show you this simulation.

432
00:17:35,006 --> 00:17:36,007
Is there something...

433
00:17:36,007 --> 00:17:37,005
Yes, Dylan.

434
00:17:37,005 --> 00:17:38,638
- Yeah, I want to add...

435
00:17:38,638 --> 00:17:42,228
Maybe it would work better
under a stronger heat source.

436
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,293
- [Voiceover] Okay, like a sun.

437
00:17:44,293 --> 00:17:45,652
- Yeah, like--

438
00:17:45,652 --> 00:17:46,984
- Okay.

439
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:51,027
Can I tell you something
that I did before the class?

440
00:17:51,027 --> 00:17:54,694
I put it under the
lighter and the ping pong

441
00:17:56,101 --> 00:17:57,613
went like pshhh.

442
00:17:57,613 --> 00:18:00,075
You know, to be honest with you,

443
00:18:00,075 --> 00:18:01,434
the ash was big as this one.

444
00:18:01,434 --> 00:18:02,719
That was it.

445
00:18:02,719 --> 00:18:04,004
I was looking for ping pong ball.

446
00:18:04,004 --> 00:18:05,026
It'll burn.

447
00:18:05,026 --> 00:18:07,405
Alright, now, I want to show
you this simulation again.

448
00:18:07,405 --> 00:18:08,238
Okay.

449
00:18:09,623 --> 00:18:11,607
So, bear with me here.

450
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:14,320
You all said the two things
I'm gonna talk about.

451
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,123
You all said the molecules were expanding,

452
00:18:17,123 --> 00:18:20,003
meaning molecules are
getting bigger, right?

453
00:18:20,003 --> 00:18:22,022
Tell me. Is this molecule getting bigger?

454
00:18:22,022 --> 00:18:23,731
- [Voiceover] No.

455
00:18:23,731 --> 00:18:27,046
- Okay, so molecules
are not getting bigger.

456
00:18:27,046 --> 00:18:29,349
How many of you believe
it's not getting bigger?

457
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:31,211
Remember, simulation is evidence.

458
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:32,718
Is that what is happening?

459
00:18:32,718 --> 00:18:34,070
Like many of you said already.

460
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,903
Jake.

461
00:18:34,903 --> 00:18:37,748
- They're moving around really fast

462
00:18:37,748 --> 00:18:39,176
in the space.

463
00:18:39,176 --> 00:18:42,110
For air and water, they're vibrating.

464
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:45,872
- So, look at the air this time. Alright.

465
00:18:45,872 --> 00:18:46,705
The air.

466
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:51,128
So, class, which one would
you say is moving faster?

467
00:18:51,128 --> 00:18:52,492
- [Voiceover] Air.

468
00:18:52,492 --> 00:18:53,862
- Okay. So, air is moving faster.

469
00:18:53,862 --> 00:18:55,339
Okay, we're gonna discuss this next step.

470
00:18:55,339 --> 00:18:57,499
So, everyone's gonna get a big picture.

471
00:18:57,499 --> 00:19:01,270
You have a question, I need
to see the finger thing.

472
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,693
Yes.

473
00:19:02,693 --> 00:19:05,193
- I have a, I guess, reason...

474
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:10,489
Well, I have another thing that I noticed

475
00:19:10,489 --> 00:19:12,991
about that I guess, you could say.

476
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:15,932
I think that the reason
why the water molecules

477
00:19:15,932 --> 00:19:17,963
are moving slower is because the water

478
00:19:17,963 --> 00:19:20,347
is taking up space, and
they can't travel around

479
00:19:20,347 --> 00:19:24,727
that fast because in the
air, there's really nothing

480
00:19:24,727 --> 00:19:26,683
in there that's stopping them from moving.

481
00:19:26,683 --> 00:19:28,510
But I guess, you can compare it to us

482
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,962
when we're swimming under water.

483
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:34,070
We move slower than we
normally do on land.

484
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,033
Yeah.
- [Teacher] So, air molecules

485
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:37,293
are moving really fast, right?

486
00:19:37,293 --> 00:19:39,845
So, what's happening as
it's moving very fast?

487
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,917
Sydney, you have something to add?

488
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:43,134
Okay.

489
00:19:43,134 --> 00:19:45,051
- I was just gonna say,

490
00:19:46,013 --> 00:19:47,759
if you look at water,
it sort of looks like

491
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:48,864
it's in an invisible cage.

492
00:19:48,864 --> 00:19:50,328
And it's trying to move
around, but it can't.

493
00:19:50,328 --> 00:19:51,686
- [Voiceover] So, it's restricted.

494
00:19:51,686 --> 00:19:52,753
It doesn't move as well.
