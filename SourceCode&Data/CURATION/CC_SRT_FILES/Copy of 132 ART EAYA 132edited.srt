1
00:00:00,704 --> 00:00:01,590
- Emotions.

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:03,552
- Is emotions, that's so right.

3
00:00:03,552 --> 00:00:04,694
Kippa, were you going
to say something else?

4
00:00:04,694 --> 00:00:07,703
- In this picture, he uses lots of texture

5
00:00:07,703 --> 00:00:12,996
to create, like when he's
doing the sunflowers,

6
00:00:12,996 --> 00:00:17,143
he uses texture to show
the light going on.

7
00:00:17,143 --> 00:00:19,280
- Right, and how did he
show that texture, did he,

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,290
how did he apply his paint?

9
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,766
- Sometimes he would squirt
it straight from the tube

10
00:00:23,766 --> 00:00:26,834
onto the canvas because
he wanted to do it fast.

11
00:00:26,834 --> 00:00:29,194
- Sometimes he would squirt
straight from the tube

12
00:00:29,194 --> 00:00:32,421
and he would paint so
thick, Vincent would,

13
00:00:32,421 --> 00:00:35,718
that you could almost
feel it, feel the texture.

14
00:00:35,718 --> 00:00:40,929
And emotion, like Ozea said.
Emotion was huge for Vincent.

15
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:42,651
If he was happy, he painted bright.

16
00:00:42,651 --> 00:00:45,312
If he was sad, he painted sort of dark.

17
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,881
How about our man Pablo Picasso?

18
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:49,101
What movement, Logan, is he?

19
00:00:49,101 --> 00:00:50,102
- Do you know the move--
- Cubism.

20
00:00:50,102 --> 00:00:51,389
- [Teacher] Cubism. And why,

21
00:00:51,389 --> 00:00:55,138
do you guys know what the
characteristics are of cubism?

22
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,632
Anybody besides Mr.
Logan, anybody else know?

23
00:00:57,632 --> 00:00:58,769
But thanks Logan for raising--

24
00:00:58,769 --> 00:01:00,788
What are you thinking, what...

25
00:01:00,788 --> 00:01:04,569
- Using geometric shapes to make things.

26
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:06,971
- Using geometric shapes, that's right.

27
00:01:06,971 --> 00:01:09,787
He was very involved in geometric shapes

28
00:01:09,787 --> 00:01:12,648
and you can even see,
and flattening the shapes

29
00:01:12,648 --> 00:01:14,211
and flattening his color.

30
00:01:14,211 --> 00:01:18,125
Where Van Gogh used his color

31
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:20,876
to really be part of his painting

32
00:01:20,876 --> 00:01:22,876
and it could be bright or it could be dull

33
00:01:22,876 --> 00:01:24,541
or a mixture of the two.

34
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:27,555
Picasso used very flat shapes of color

35
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:29,842
and you can even see that
in his self-portrait.

36
00:01:29,842 --> 00:01:33,757
I wanna put up the work.

37
00:01:33,757 --> 00:01:38,271
Let's start with our man Vincent again.

38
00:01:38,271 --> 00:01:41,303
Let's take a look at--
See where my hand...

39
00:01:41,303 --> 00:01:42,872
Oooh!

40
00:01:42,872 --> 00:01:45,111
You can see all the wrinkles in my hand.

41
00:01:45,111 --> 00:01:47,274
- [Student] No way!
- Isn't that cool?

42
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,158
Okay! Sorry, don't mean
to keep fooling around.

43
00:01:49,158 --> 00:01:50,836
So let's talk about this.

44
00:01:50,836 --> 00:01:53,015
Let's talk about these
two paintings, guys.

45
00:01:53,015 --> 00:01:56,571
What do you guys, and
let's see if someone else

46
00:01:56,571 --> 00:01:59,456
maybe can answer or talk about something.

47
00:01:59,456 --> 00:02:01,993
What do you see, do you
guys see a difference

48
00:02:01,993 --> 00:02:04,968
between these two paintings right here?

49
00:02:04,968 --> 00:02:08,033
Anybody, somebody besides Kippa, Carina?

50
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:11,145
- That it kinda has to
deal with his emotion,

51
00:02:11,145 --> 00:02:16,243
like where the boats are, I feel like,

52
00:02:16,243 --> 00:02:19,121
what I'm feeling is that
he was kinda depressed

53
00:02:19,121 --> 00:02:24,065
and very sad because the skies
were kinda dark and stuff.

54
00:02:24,065 --> 00:02:25,549
And then at the sunflowers

55
00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:29,920
he's really happy and bright and...

56
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,601
- That was good, Carina.
Okay, Elijah, did you wanna?

57
00:02:32,601 --> 00:02:34,563
Was that about what you were gonna say?

58
00:02:34,563 --> 00:02:36,712
You were gonna talk about the sadness.

59
00:02:36,712 --> 00:02:40,534
What colors, like do you think that if...

60
00:02:40,534 --> 00:02:41,875
Go ahead, Elijah.
- He could've been in the boat

61
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:46,504
because on the computer the
boats were really bright colors

62
00:02:46,504 --> 00:02:49,353
but the sky was darkened more

63
00:02:49,353 --> 00:02:53,517
but the boats were all
light yellow and dark,

64
00:02:53,517 --> 00:02:56,822
light red and all these
other bright colors.

65
00:02:56,822 --> 00:02:58,825
- Right, and I remember you saying that

66
00:02:58,825 --> 00:03:00,945
when you showed me with the
picture from the computer,

67
00:03:00,945 --> 00:03:02,867
that's why I looked at you
because you were talking about

68
00:03:02,867 --> 00:03:05,114
he must have been conflicted
with his emotions,

69
00:03:05,114 --> 00:03:06,153
wasn't that what you were saying?

70
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:10,491
- Yeah, he was feeling both happy and sad

71
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:12,378
'cause the sky was darkened

72
00:03:12,378 --> 00:03:14,079
and then the boats were really bright

73
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:15,834
and the sea was darkened too.

74
00:03:15,834 --> 00:03:20,018
- Right, that's good. Okay,
Jose, what did you wanna say?

75
00:03:20,018 --> 00:03:24,436
- He's sort of like there too, but

76
00:03:24,436 --> 00:03:26,567
the boats might be out to sea.

77
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:30,670
Like one's out to sea
but one's not, but torn.

78
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,059
I don't know how many are already but...

79
00:03:33,059 --> 00:03:37,291
Three are out, in. I
don't know how many are out.

80
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,876
- There's four that are here

81
00:03:38,876 --> 00:03:40,616
and then there look
like four that are out.

82
00:03:40,616 --> 00:03:42,628
- I think that's the other--
(student coughing)

83
00:03:42,628 --> 00:03:44,144
- Okay but what were you going to say...

84
00:03:44,144 --> 00:03:45,787
Oh you're right, three.

85
00:03:45,787 --> 00:03:48,615
Well what were you gonna say about them?

86
00:03:48,615 --> 00:03:50,654
- I'm guessing three,

87
00:03:50,654 --> 00:03:58,556
two or three were the
family of six kids and

88
00:03:58,556 --> 00:04:00,053
the mom and a dad.

89
00:04:00,053 --> 00:04:02,493
But they could only take three

90
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:06,648
because there's only enough for...

91
00:04:06,648 --> 00:04:08,811
There's enough room for only three boats

92
00:04:08,811 --> 00:04:11,304
or three people.

93
00:04:11,304 --> 00:04:13,745
But they only wanted their own boat,

94
00:04:13,745 --> 00:04:17,637
two or three of them
were, but three didn't go

95
00:04:17,637 --> 00:04:19,998
because they didn't know
what to do or anything

96
00:04:19,998 --> 00:04:21,696
but the other three did.

97
00:04:21,696 --> 00:04:23,800
- Interesting, that was sort of your story

98
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,589
behind the picture that you saw?

99
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:26,706
- Kind of.

100
00:04:26,706 --> 00:04:28,311
- Yeah, I like that, I like that.

101
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:30,965
Trevor, what're you gonna say?

102
00:04:30,965 --> 00:04:34,457
- It's kinda like medium of a position

103
00:04:34,457 --> 00:04:36,816
between sad and happy

104
00:04:36,816 --> 00:04:41,416
because the sunflowers, they're mostly up

105
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,543
but looks like they're starting to droop.

106
00:04:43,543 --> 00:04:44,963
They're starting to die.

107
00:04:44,963 --> 00:04:47,009
- [Teacher] That is good, I like that.

108
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:49,451
- He might be like, "Oh,
I'm happy for a while but

109
00:04:49,451 --> 00:04:51,707
"I'm starting to feel back down."

110
00:04:51,707 --> 00:04:53,709
- [Teacher] Nice. Did
you wanna say something?

111
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:56,381
- I would like to say one has
different types of (mumbles)

112
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:58,355
One looks more real.

113
00:04:58,355 --> 00:04:59,713
Those ships on the top

114
00:04:59,713 --> 00:05:01,582
look a little bit more real than the...

115
00:05:01,582 --> 00:05:05,047
- Than the bottom, more
realistic than this picture?

116
00:05:05,047 --> 00:05:09,089
He really pushed his color lips
in the sunflowers, I think.

117
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:11,378
Does anybody know, what
were you gonna say, Elijah?

118
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,635
- You can see in the sunflower one

119
00:05:13,635 --> 00:05:16,248
like at the very top there's bright yellow

120
00:05:16,248 --> 00:05:18,806
but when you go down a
little bit it's orange

121
00:05:18,806 --> 00:05:22,516
and then at the very
bottom it's dark green.

122
00:05:22,516 --> 00:05:23,553
Like right there.

123
00:05:23,553 --> 00:05:27,580
- Yes that is very
true. That is very good.

124
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,065
- The storms and the
sunflowers is trying to say

125
00:05:30,065 --> 00:05:33,278
that nothing is never everlasting.

126
00:05:33,278 --> 00:05:35,481
- [Teacher] Wow, Kyle...
(student mumbles)

127
00:05:35,481 --> 00:05:36,714
Happiness is never lasting and

128
00:05:36,714 --> 00:05:37,644
what was the last one?

129
00:05:37,644 --> 00:05:38,997
I'm moved by that opinion.

130
00:05:38,997 --> 00:05:40,717
Go ahead, and what was the...?

131
00:05:40,717 --> 00:05:44,468
- So in the flowers, the flowers are happy

132
00:05:44,468 --> 00:05:47,047
but then they start to droop and die.

133
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,169
- Because happiness can be fleeting.

134
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:49,782
And we know--

135
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:54,231
Oh, does anybody know,
what was the political,

136
00:05:54,231 --> 00:05:56,405
was there any political things going on?

137
00:05:56,405 --> 00:05:58,723
The political mood or the setting.

138
00:05:58,723 --> 00:05:59,746
Where was Vincent from,

139
00:05:59,746 --> 00:06:02,684
did you guys find that in your research?

140
00:06:02,684 --> 00:06:05,514
He stayed in France, is
that where he studied?

141
00:06:05,514 --> 00:06:06,734
Is that what you guys are telling me?

142
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:08,325
- [Students] Yeah

143
00:06:08,325 --> 00:06:11,605
- That was sorta the hub
of his movement, we'll say.

144
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:13,504
Any other facts that you guys know

145
00:06:13,504 --> 00:06:15,145
about the artwork that's up?

146
00:06:15,145 --> 00:06:17,678
You can look on your
research papers to see.

147
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:21,282
Or anything-- Go ahead, Emily.

148
00:06:21,282 --> 00:06:25,958
- I think that the actual
emotions of these paintings

149
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:30,940
don't really connect at
all with the political mood

150
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:35,833
because when he painted the
bright sunflower one so awesome

151
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:40,376
it was kind of a dark time in France.

152
00:06:40,376 --> 00:06:44,024
So really I don't think
they were much of a...

153
00:06:44,024 --> 00:06:45,233
- Really affected him? What were you...

154
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:47,839
- Going along with Emily,

155
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,241
maybe he was just so dull that,

156
00:06:51,241 --> 00:06:54,565
or maybe it was coming to
an end when he painted them.

157
00:06:54,565 --> 00:06:57,624
Because if there was a war

158
00:06:57,624 --> 00:07:01,321
or some sort of bad time

159
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:02,958
and it was coming to an end

160
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:05,003
he was probably starting
to feel better about it

161
00:07:05,003 --> 00:07:07,201
because it was ending.

162
00:07:07,201 --> 00:07:09,898
So it depends, maybe he
was going through things

163
00:07:09,898 --> 00:07:14,207
like maybe a very happy thing
happened in his life then.

164
00:07:14,207 --> 00:07:18,933
Because he didn't have the
happiest of all lives so...

165
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:20,665
- He didn't. We've even talked about that.

166
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:22,587
Do you guys remember when we talked about

167
00:07:22,587 --> 00:07:25,565
how Vincent Van Gogh suffered
a little bit mentally?

168
00:07:25,565 --> 00:07:28,384
He was a little...
- Crazy.

169
00:07:28,384 --> 00:07:30,706
- Crazy and in and out
of mental institutions.

170
00:07:30,706 --> 00:07:34,064
- Yeah so maybe something good happened.

171
00:07:34,064 --> 00:07:37,639
'Cause his life was not very happy.

172
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:41,548
So most of his pictures are...

173
00:07:41,548 --> 00:07:44,939
No, not most of them
but quite a few of them

174
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:47,146
are actually quite dull.

175
00:07:47,146 --> 00:07:49,633
But you can tell when
he's going through joy

176
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:53,894
because he has those
bright colors coming in.

177
00:07:53,894 --> 00:07:56,203
Like the boats, you can see

178
00:07:56,203 --> 00:07:57,401
a little bit of happiness in them

179
00:07:57,401 --> 00:08:00,990
but the majority of it
is dark and sort of sad.

180
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,249
And then if you look at the sunflowers

181
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:04,177
they're all bright and dreamy.

182
00:08:04,177 --> 00:08:07,125
I mean yes, this is a few dark bits

183
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,474
but I think that's
probably a time when he was

184
00:08:09,474 --> 00:08:12,065
going through something
that was better in his life.

185
00:08:12,065 --> 00:08:14,578
- Guys, this is really great.
I love all your comments.

186
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:15,497
Logan, I'm gonna take one more

187
00:08:15,497 --> 00:08:16,819
and then I'm gonna tell you something.

188
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:17,438
What, go ahead Logan.

189
00:08:17,438 --> 00:08:20,014
- I thought maybe that he was painting it

190
00:08:20,014 --> 00:08:22,103
and then something happened.

191
00:08:22,103 --> 00:08:29,524
Like maybe he heard that war
was breaking out or something.

192
00:08:29,524 --> 00:08:32,684
And then he started painting it sad.

193
00:08:32,684 --> 00:08:34,213
- I have a question.
- [Teacher] I think that--

194
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:36,101
You've got something
really important, hon?

195
00:08:36,101 --> 00:08:39,978
- Yeah, so he never really
stopped a painting in the middle.

196
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:43,044
When he started he
finished. He never stopped.

197
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:45,183
Because if the light changed

198
00:08:45,183 --> 00:08:46,938
it would totally change the picture.

199
00:08:46,938 --> 00:08:48,740
- [Teacher] That's so
true. That is very true.

200
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,079
And you guys know that--

201
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:51,939
Jose, is it okay if I speak real quick

202
00:08:51,939 --> 00:08:52,846
and then we'll go back

203
00:08:52,846 --> 00:08:56,550
because we wanna talk about
Picasso too for a minute.

204
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,255
You guys know that Vincent
used to live with a painter.

205
00:08:59,255 --> 00:09:01,811
This is my fun fact.
Not really fun I guess.

206
00:09:01,811 --> 00:09:03,149
But a fact about Vincent.

207
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:05,486
He lived with a painter, Paul Gauguin.

208
00:09:05,486 --> 00:09:07,605
This was when he was in and
out of mental institutions.

209
00:09:07,605 --> 00:09:09,929
And they had a fight
and he became so upset,

210
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:12,511
you guys know he cut off his ear.

211
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,949
And I showed you that one picture of him

212
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:19,733
is a self-portrait of
him with his ear cut off.

213
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:20,637
You guys remember that?

214
00:09:20,637 --> 00:09:22,614
And the other important
thing I wanted to tell you

215
00:09:22,614 --> 00:09:25,044
was that he didn't sell any of his works

216
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:26,205
during his lifetime

217
00:09:26,205 --> 00:09:28,811
but he did sell one of
his paintings after...

218
00:09:28,811 --> 00:09:31,028
After he died they sold
one of his paintings

219
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,895
for $8,000,000,000.

220
00:09:32,895 --> 00:09:33,728
Remember that?

221
00:09:33,728 --> 00:09:35,357
It was the most expensive painting

222
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:37,098
ever sold at the time.

223
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:39,445
Okay, now let's talk about...

224
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:40,645
And Van Gogh people,

225
00:09:40,645 --> 00:09:42,796
if you guys wanna talk
about Picasso you can,

226
00:09:42,796 --> 00:09:46,769
but let's give the Picasso
teams some time here.

227
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:51,012
This is... And I'm sorry the
lighting is not the best.

228
00:09:51,012 --> 00:09:55,634
But who knows what the name
of this painting is? Marie.

229
00:09:55,634 --> 00:09:57,325
- [Marie] Is it Three Musicians?

230
00:09:57,325 --> 00:10:00,932
- Three Musicians. And it was done by who?

231
00:10:00,932 --> 00:10:03,428
- [Students] Pablo
- Pablo Picasso.

232
00:10:03,428 --> 00:10:06,458
Does anybody know where
Pablo Picasso was from?

233
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:09,112
Let's see someone other
than Mr. Logan. Travis.

234
00:10:09,112 --> 00:10:09,905
- [Travis] Barcelona.

235
00:10:09,905 --> 00:10:12,098
- [Teacher] Barcelona.
Where's Barcelona, you guys?

236
00:10:12,098 --> 00:10:13,575
- Spain.
- [Teacher] Spain.

237
00:10:13,575 --> 00:10:15,416
- [Student] I got my Barcelona jersey.

238
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:18,148
- Alright and who knows,
Rudy, do you happen to know...

239
00:10:18,148 --> 00:10:20,775
And he's like, "Uh-oh,
I'm on the spot! Ooo!"

240
00:10:20,775 --> 00:10:21,857
Do you happen to know

241
00:10:21,857 --> 00:10:26,607
what movement or style he
painted in, Pablo Picasso?

242
00:10:26,607 --> 00:10:29,459
- In Cubism?
- Cubism, that's correct.

243
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:30,815
And we did go over,

244
00:10:30,815 --> 00:10:32,818
what were the characteristics
of cubism real fast?

245
00:10:32,818 --> 00:10:34,163
Anybody? Mr Logan.

246
00:10:34,163 --> 00:10:36,368
- [Logan] Geometric shapes.

247
00:10:36,368 --> 00:10:38,008
- [Teacher] Geometric
shapes and what else?

248
00:10:38,008 --> 00:10:39,705
- They were flat.

249
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:41,206
- [Teacher] What was flat?

250
00:10:41,206 --> 00:10:42,089
- His pictures.

251
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:44,591
- [Teacher] But what element--
- His painting the colors.

252
00:10:44,591 --> 00:10:46,339
- [Teacher] The colors
were flat. Thank you.

253
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:51,380
Okay, let's have some opinion
about what you see up here.

254
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,159
The Three Musicians, does anybody have...

255
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,791
Randy, do you have any, how
do you feel about it, honey?

256
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,378
What do you think about it?

257
00:10:56,378 --> 00:11:00,534
- I don't know. It doesn't seem
like it's in a down mood

258
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:04,089
'cause music is usually
a happy sort of thing.

259
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:06,636
So it seems like a happy kinda picture.

260
00:11:06,636 --> 00:11:07,742
- [Teacher] Kind of a happy fun picture.

261
00:11:07,742 --> 00:11:10,423
Pablo, he wasn't so concerned

262
00:11:10,423 --> 00:11:12,695
about emotions when he painted.

263
00:11:12,695 --> 00:11:14,914
He maybe was influenced

264
00:11:14,914 --> 00:11:16,475
by the political setting of his time.

265
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:17,833
Does anybody know what was happening

266
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,101
in Spain at the time?

267
00:11:19,101 --> 00:11:20,366
What are you thinking?
- [Student] Civil war.

268
00:11:20,366 --> 00:11:21,480
- There was a civil war.

269
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,564
So maybe he was a little
bit affected by that.

270
00:11:23,564 --> 00:11:24,727
He also traveled.

271
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:27,180
Does anybody know where
he traveled to, Rudy?

272
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,021
To go and study the art forms of...

273
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:33,306
- Paris? He went to Paris

274
00:11:33,306 --> 00:11:36,524
because it was of all
the artwork and stuff.

275
00:11:36,524 --> 00:11:39,511
- So he went to study
there and then where else?

276
00:11:39,511 --> 00:11:41,591
- [Student] He went to Africa.
- [Teacher] He went to Africa

277
00:11:41,591 --> 00:11:45,402
and he really became
obsessed with African masks.

278
00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:47,692
And so he did start using that

279
00:11:47,692 --> 00:11:49,332
as an influence in his painting.

280
00:11:49,332 --> 00:11:51,324
Carina, what were you gonna say, darling?

281
00:11:51,324 --> 00:11:55,679
- Oh, I was thinking it's
kind of like a mix of emotions

282
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:58,182
'cause it has so many colors.

283
00:11:58,182 --> 00:12:01,141
There's bright orange and yellow

284
00:12:01,141 --> 00:12:05,883
and then if you look deeper,
there's a blue and a black

285
00:12:05,883 --> 00:12:08,864
and it kind of just grabs your attention.

286
00:12:08,864 --> 00:12:10,210
- [Teacher] It's
attention-grabbing, isn't it?

287
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,818
'Cause of all the contrasting.

288
00:12:11,818 --> 00:12:15,685
I think more in his is
the contrasting colors.

289
00:12:15,685 --> 00:12:19,185
You can see the blue and orange
right next to each other.

290
00:12:19,185 --> 00:12:21,754
Those are colors that
lie opposite each other

291
00:12:21,754 --> 00:12:25,993
on the color wheel and
they make for very bright,

292
00:12:25,993 --> 00:12:28,271
they totally stand off each other.

293
00:12:28,271 --> 00:12:29,380
Right, the blue and the orange.

294
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,063
I can't remember what-- Oh,
they're complementary colors.

295
00:12:32,063 --> 00:12:34,821
I couldn't remember what that
was. Right, so that's why.

296
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:37,536
And I think his color contrast says a lot.

297
00:12:37,536 --> 00:12:40,225
His flat colors and they're bright

298
00:12:40,225 --> 00:12:41,950
and he puts them right next to each other.

299
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:46,394
What do you think about
this picture, Robert?

300
00:12:46,394 --> 00:12:48,744
Do you like it?

301
00:12:48,744 --> 00:12:49,746
- Yeah.

302
00:12:49,746 --> 00:12:51,013
- [Teacher] Do you know
why you might like it

303
00:12:51,013 --> 00:12:52,719
or you don't like it?

304
00:12:52,719 --> 00:12:56,799
- I like the picture, like... yeah.

305
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:01,096
- [Teacher] Well you and
Maria are talking about doing,

306
00:13:01,096 --> 00:13:03,416
remember you were talking
about making your own picture?

307
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,127
You wanna tell us about
that, what you guys wanna do?

308
00:13:06,127 --> 00:13:07,745
For your own picture?

309
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,758
And you're doing the style
of Pablo, aren't you?

310
00:13:09,758 --> 00:13:10,345
- Yeah.

311
00:13:10,345 --> 00:13:12,064
- [Teacher] So what do you
think you guys are gonna do?

312
00:13:12,064 --> 00:13:13,453
- Have a picture of me and my brother

313
00:13:13,453 --> 00:13:18,296
and a picture of the Three
Musicians on a porch.

314
00:13:18,296 --> 00:13:19,602
- [Teacher] You wanna
have the Three Musicians

315
00:13:19,602 --> 00:13:21,659
be in a picture with you and your brother?

316
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:24,044
And Maria, are you gonna--
- Not on a porch. On a deck.

317
00:13:24,044 --> 00:13:25,649
- That's what I was gonna say.

318
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:26,951
- [Teacher] And you guys are gonna,

319
00:13:26,951 --> 00:13:29,748
are you guys gonna reduce
it down to geometric shapes?

320
00:13:29,748 --> 00:13:31,012
The picture?

321
00:13:31,012 --> 00:13:32,455
- Yeah.
- Try to.

322
00:13:32,455 --> 00:13:35,131
- [Teacher] Good, good.
Do you guys have anybody--

323
00:13:35,131 --> 00:13:37,186
Oh, what were you gonna say, Elijah?

324
00:13:37,186 --> 00:13:39,333
- It makes me think about it,

325
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,396
because there's so many twists and turns

326
00:13:41,396 --> 00:13:44,905
and curves and things.

327
00:13:44,905 --> 00:13:49,326
Kinda like if you look
hard enough you can see 'em

328
00:13:49,326 --> 00:13:51,948
but when you just look at
it you're like, "Whoa."

329
00:13:51,948 --> 00:13:54,690
- Right, when you first
look at it, you're like,

330
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,572
"Whoa, what is that? Are those
people? Are those shapes?

331
00:13:57,572 --> 00:14:00,431
"There's lots of curves and turns."

332
00:14:00,431 --> 00:14:02,526
- [Student] At first
it's a little confusing.

333
00:14:02,526 --> 00:14:04,206
- At first it is a little
confusing, isn't it?

334
00:14:04,206 --> 00:14:05,727
- [Student] When you actually pick a name

335
00:14:05,727 --> 00:14:07,437
and you actually try to look for 'em

336
00:14:07,437 --> 00:14:09,333
you can actually see what it is.

337
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,369
- Right, if we didn't tell
you it was the Three Musicians

338
00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:12,780
you might not know at first.

339
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:17,949
- You can kinda tell because
of that one right there.

340
00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:18,885
That thing, yeah.
- The instrument here.

341
00:14:18,885 --> 00:14:19,677
And the guitar.

342
00:14:19,677 --> 00:14:21,795
- And then the paper with the two...

343
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:22,985
- The sheet music.
- The sheet music,

344
00:14:22,985 --> 00:14:25,842
you could kinda tell it
was about the musicians.

345
00:14:25,842 --> 00:14:29,947
- What were you gonna say?

346
00:14:29,947 --> 00:14:31,809
- When you first look at the painting,

347
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:33,150
your eyes are immediately drawn

348
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:37,046
to the first guy in blue's clarinet.

349
00:14:37,046 --> 00:14:40,431
Whereas if you peeked
a minute and look at it

350
00:14:40,431 --> 00:14:42,835
you can actually kinda see instruments

351
00:14:42,835 --> 00:14:45,759
like they were saying.

352
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,290
At first, when you just...

353
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,948
but instead you just see
a whole bunch of colors

354
00:14:49,948 --> 00:14:52,888
and then you look at it and
it kinda starts to form.

355
00:14:52,888 --> 00:14:56,737
- It does start to form. What
were you gonna say, Emily?

356
00:14:56,737 --> 00:14:59,120
- I think that in my
