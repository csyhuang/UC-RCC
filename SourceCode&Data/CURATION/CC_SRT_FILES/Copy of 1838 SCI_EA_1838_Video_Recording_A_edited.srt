1
00:00:00,462 --> 00:00:02,029
- On a regular basis.

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:04,438
Have you ever thought
about what that causes?

3
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:06,325
I mean, what causes wind
to blow in the first place?

4
00:00:06,325 --> 00:00:07,862
Whether it be a breeze.

5
00:00:07,862 --> 00:00:09,151
Whether it be a hurricane.

6
00:00:09,151 --> 00:00:10,822
Whether it be a tornado.

7
00:00:10,822 --> 00:00:12,673
Would you take a few
minutes in your notebook,

8
00:00:12,673 --> 00:00:13,506
would you just draw a line

9
00:00:13,506 --> 00:00:15,756
write after what you wrote?
(mumbles)

10
00:00:16,797 --> 00:00:18,947
And I want you to give
your best explanation

11
00:00:18,947 --> 00:00:21,885
of what the heck causes wind?

12
00:00:21,885 --> 00:00:23,449
Just do this on your own first.

13
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:26,258
What could cause wind to blow?

14
00:00:26,258 --> 00:00:29,341
Take a few moments, just on your own.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:01:11,000
(background noise)

16
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:14,365
Just like always guys,

17
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:15,467
you don't have to be right here.

18
00:01:15,467 --> 00:01:16,913
I just want to know anything that you think

19
00:01:16,913 --> 00:01:19,409
might contribute to wind blowing.

20
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:20,859
On a big scale, on a small scale.

21
00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:22,612
Anything that you've got

22
00:01:22,612 --> 00:01:26,612
that we can build on,
anything that you put down.

23
00:01:41,326 --> 00:01:43,305
Alright, when you have this
discussion in a few moments,

24
00:01:43,305 --> 00:01:45,206
share your ideas with each other.

25
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:47,590
And then remember one person
will be called from the group

26
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,022
to share either what you put down,

27
00:01:50,022 --> 00:01:51,725
or what somebody else did.

28
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:53,013
Talk to each other.

29
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:53,854
See what everyone there is thinking.

30
00:01:53,854 --> 00:01:54,687
What ideas do we have?

31
00:01:54,687 --> 00:01:57,820
(class chatter)

32
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,570
- The air pressure and
temperature changes and so

33
00:02:05,436 --> 00:02:08,116
it kind of like shocks,

34
00:02:08,116 --> 00:02:09,783
and it creates wind.

35
00:02:11,485 --> 00:02:12,318
- That's good.

36
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:13,847
I think wind develops because clouds

37
00:02:13,847 --> 00:02:18,062
carries that air (mumbles).

38
00:02:18,062 --> 00:02:20,312
- I don't really know much.

39
00:02:23,548 --> 00:02:46,215
(class chatter)

40
00:02:47,564 --> 00:02:48,397
- Alright, folks.

41
00:02:48,397 --> 00:02:50,627
When we go, let's use,

42
00:02:50,627 --> 00:02:52,960
let's see who gets to share.

43
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,377
Person two.

44
00:02:57,556 --> 00:03:00,389
We're going to go with person two.

45
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:03,610
And let me switch this
over here real quick

46
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,860
so I can write down some of your ideas.
Hold on.

47
00:03:11,842 --> 00:03:14,092
Alright, where'd my pen go?

48
00:03:16,886 --> 00:03:18,895
Okay, here we go. Person two.

49
00:03:18,895 --> 00:03:21,824
And we're going to start over here.

50
00:03:21,824 --> 00:03:24,455
Did you guys have any
ideas why wind to blow?

51
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:26,372
No, table seven. Sorry.

52
00:03:27,804 --> 00:03:29,988
- I don't know, but I
said heat and cold air

53
00:03:29,988 --> 00:03:31,334
rising and falling.

54
00:03:31,334 --> 00:03:32,925
'Cause I know how hang gliding gives us

55
00:03:32,925 --> 00:03:35,758
columns of air rising, heat rising,

56
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:38,126
how you get in the air.

57
00:03:38,126 --> 00:03:40,512
I'm really not sure so I'm just thinking.

58
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:43,035
- [Teacher] Okay, so
something about hot air rising

59
00:03:43,035 --> 00:03:44,035
and cool air

60
00:03:46,573 --> 00:03:47,527
falling.

61
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:51,589
- [Student] And like how they're (mumbles).

62
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:52,422
- [Teacher] Say that again.

63
00:03:52,422 --> 00:03:54,984
- [Student] And cold and hot
air going over mountains.

64
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:57,151
(mumbles)

65
00:04:01,853 --> 00:04:04,686
- [Teacher] Different land masses.

66
00:04:05,817 --> 00:04:07,425
Okay, very interesting.

67
00:04:07,425 --> 00:04:09,346
Now she had the toughest job.

68
00:04:09,346 --> 00:04:11,976
From now on every other
person number two that goes

69
00:04:11,976 --> 00:04:13,241
you have to either come up with

70
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:15,470
a different theory, a different idea,

71
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,714
or you can agree or disagree
with what Miah had to say.

72
00:04:18,714 --> 00:04:21,473
But you cannot say, "I don't know."

73
00:04:21,473 --> 00:04:22,306
Okay?

74
00:04:22,306 --> 00:04:24,184
So you gotta kinda run
with what's been said.

75
00:04:24,184 --> 00:04:25,554
Keisha, we're going to
go back to you first.

76
00:04:25,554 --> 00:04:27,313
What was your thought at your group?

77
00:04:27,313 --> 00:04:30,044
- [Keisha] Well, we agree with Miah

78
00:04:30,044 --> 00:04:32,426
because basically we said the same thing

79
00:04:32,426 --> 00:04:34,859
that like the temperature of the air

80
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:38,104
can have something to do with the wind.

81
00:04:38,104 --> 00:04:38,937
- [Teacher] Okay.

82
00:04:38,937 --> 00:04:42,270
So I'm just going to add on here temperature.

83
00:04:44,121 --> 00:04:47,171
- [Voiceover] I was going to add pressure.

84
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:48,467
- [Teacher] Temperature, okay. That may
be something different.

85
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:50,438
Let's see what we can add to this.

86
00:04:50,438 --> 00:04:52,243
So you're agreeing with Miah

87
00:04:52,243 --> 00:04:53,465
that it may have something to do

88
00:04:53,465 --> 00:04:55,901
with the temperatures of the air.

89
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:56,734
Yeah? Okay.

90
00:04:56,734 --> 00:04:58,811
Table three, you guys had
a different kind of theory.

91
00:04:58,811 --> 00:05:01,724
- We agree with what she said

92
00:05:01,724 --> 00:05:03,857
except we also thought the

93
00:05:03,857 --> 00:05:06,774
pressure (mumbles)

94
00:05:10,136 --> 00:05:12,284
how the wind blows and stuff.

95
00:05:12,284 --> 00:05:16,451
[Teacher] Okay, so you guys
talked mostly about pressure.
- Yeah.

96
00:05:21,793 --> 00:05:24,899
- Could you pass that up to table two?

97
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:27,232
So far we have two theories.

98
00:05:28,555 --> 00:05:30,771
One has been agreed to already.

99
00:05:30,771 --> 00:05:33,258
We have temperature, pressure.

100
00:05:33,258 --> 00:05:34,789
- Our group wasn't sure.

101
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:39,130
But I agree with Kavya in
how the pressure (mumbles).

102
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,450
- [Teacher] You're thinking that it's

103
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,198
something do with pressure.

104
00:05:42,198 --> 00:05:45,838
And, okay there's an agreement here

105
00:05:45,838 --> 00:05:47,910
with temperature as well.

106
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,035
Pass that up to table one.

107
00:05:50,035 --> 00:05:53,639
Prescott, what kind of ideas did you guys have?

108
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,018
- Well, we were talking

109
00:05:56,018 --> 00:06:00,319
and we kinda agree with
A, or hot air rising.

110
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,953
And pressure and air too,

111
00:06:01,953 --> 00:06:04,763
but I was thinking that
currents or air currents

112
00:06:04,763 --> 00:06:07,988
carry the wind, or carry the air, faster.

113
00:06:07,988 --> 00:06:09,790
- [Teacher] Okay, so let me add something

114
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,831
about currents in here.

115
00:06:11,831 --> 00:06:13,534
'Cause that's another kind
of interesting thing.

116
00:06:13,534 --> 00:06:16,599
So are currents separate from these two?

117
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:19,368
Or the same? Or added on to?

118
00:06:19,368 --> 00:06:21,183
Or they another thing all together?

119
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,296
- Just added on, I guess.

120
00:06:23,296 --> 00:06:27,036
- [Teacher] Okay, so we've
got temperature of the air,

121
00:06:27,036 --> 00:06:29,387
we've got pressure of the air,

122
00:06:29,387 --> 00:06:31,568
and we've got something
to do with currents.

123
00:06:31,568 --> 00:06:33,309
Could you pass that over to Conner?

124
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:36,550
Conner, what is your thought?

125
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,141
- [Connor] We kind of agreed that

126
00:06:38,141 --> 00:06:42,638
pressure of the air
probably makes the wind.

127
00:06:42,638 --> 00:06:44,794
Like low pressure and high pressure.

128
00:06:44,794 --> 00:06:46,035
- [Teacher] You know
that's an interesting thing

129
00:06:46,035 --> 00:06:47,133
with the low pressure.

130
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:51,481
What would cause air to
be different pressures?

131
00:06:51,481 --> 00:06:55,974
- [Connor] I thought
maybe the Earth's core

132
00:06:55,974 --> 00:07:00,223
and the gravity pulls down more
in some places than others.

133
00:07:00,223 --> 00:07:02,531
- [Teacher] Okay so, let's see.

134
00:07:02,531 --> 00:07:05,632
So you're agreeing with pressure,

135
00:07:05,632 --> 00:07:08,808
and you're kind of
saying the pressures

136
00:07:08,808 --> 00:07:10,806
have something to do with gravity.

137
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:13,389
Really interesting. Oops, hang on.

138
00:07:17,713 --> 00:07:19,377
Something to do with gravity

139
00:07:19,377 --> 00:07:21,632
causing different pressures.

140
00:07:21,632 --> 00:07:22,665
Pass that back to David.

141
00:07:22,665 --> 00:07:26,578
David, what did your conversation involve?

142
00:07:26,578 --> 00:07:29,078
- [David] Well, I thought the,

143
00:07:30,258 --> 00:07:34,425
I really didn't know exactly
what makes the wind blow, but

144
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:40,753
if I had to guess I'd
say it's air masses meeting.

145
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:42,646
- [Teacher] Let's put
that down. Okay. Hold on.

146
00:07:42,646 --> 00:07:44,132
And you threw out something that says

147
00:07:44,132 --> 00:07:45,715
air masses meeting.

148
00:07:50,455 --> 00:07:52,346
Alright, so when you talk about air masses,

149
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,318
give us more of what you thought of what that is.

150
00:07:54,318 --> 00:07:55,725
What do you mean an air mass?

151
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,702
And when they meet,

152
00:07:57,702 --> 00:08:00,526
how would that produce wind?

153
00:08:00,526 --> 00:08:03,109
- [David] Well, I know that when

154
00:08:04,622 --> 00:08:07,317
warm and moist air mass

155
00:08:07,317 --> 00:08:09,413
collides with a cool, dry air mass

156
00:08:09,413 --> 00:08:12,077
it forms a thunderstorm.

157
00:08:12,077 --> 00:08:14,501
I was thinking of

158
00:08:14,501 --> 00:08:18,334
one warm air mass meets
another warm air mass,

159
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,011
then when they collide
it might produce wind.

160
00:08:23,011 --> 00:08:24,772
I don't know why, that's just my guess.

161
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:25,613
- [Teacher] No, no that's fine.

162
00:08:25,613 --> 00:08:27,443
So you're thinking when,

163
00:08:27,443 --> 00:08:29,804
you're saying when two different
kinds of air masses meet

164
00:08:29,804 --> 00:08:30,874
it makes a thunderstorm.

165
00:08:30,874 --> 00:08:32,685
But maybe when two of the same meet

166
00:08:32,685 --> 00:08:34,009
it makes wind.

167
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:35,001
- [David] Yeah.

168
00:08:35,001 --> 00:08:36,116
- [Teacher] So let me put that on.

169
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:37,572
So air masses meeting.

170
00:08:37,572 --> 00:08:40,894
So since we're talking only
about wind right now,

171
00:08:40,894 --> 00:08:42,954
it's the same kind of air mass meeting.

172
00:08:42,954 --> 00:08:43,787
Alright.

173
00:08:43,787 --> 00:08:45,495
Would you pass that back to...

174
00:08:45,495 --> 00:08:46,645
Ah, Nathan we're going to have you go

175
00:08:46,645 --> 00:08:48,571
since Amber already went today.

176
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:50,092
Back over to Nathan.

177
00:08:50,092 --> 00:08:54,175
Nathan what did your
conversation revolve around back there?

178
00:08:55,441 --> 00:08:56,612
- [Nathan] Well, we didn't really know,

179
00:08:56,612 --> 00:08:59,195
but based on what everyone said

180
00:09:00,404 --> 00:09:01,977
I agree with Miah,

181
00:09:01,977 --> 00:09:06,368
that it's the hot air rising
and the cooler falling.

182
00:09:06,368 --> 00:09:07,201
But

183
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:09,784
I also think that David's ideas

184
00:09:09,784 --> 00:09:11,784
are kind of interesting.

185
00:09:13,225 --> 00:09:15,114
I agree with A.

186
00:09:15,114 --> 00:09:15,984
- [Teacher] You're agreeing with A,

187
00:09:15,984 --> 00:09:18,306
that it has something to
do with the temperatures.

188
00:09:18,306 --> 00:09:19,392
- [Teacher] Miah, what's your thought?

189
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,034
- [Miah] I also thought what David said,

190
00:09:21,034 --> 00:09:22,585
'cause I know how

191
00:09:22,585 --> 00:09:23,792
tornadoes are formed.

192
00:09:23,792 --> 00:09:25,998
But then I thought air
masses are way too big.

193
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,024
And I know almost all over the continent

194
00:09:28,024 --> 00:09:29,524
get a lot of wind.

195
00:09:30,984 --> 00:09:33,561
And so I think it might
have something to do with

196
00:09:33,561 --> 00:09:35,600
air meeting together.

197
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,235
I think that has to do
with hot and cold air,

198
00:09:38,235 --> 00:09:39,592
kind of mashing.

199
00:09:39,592 --> 00:09:41,259
- [Teacher] Okay so.

200
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,467
You said with hot air
rising and cool air falling.

201
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:47,563
And then you said something about

202
00:09:47,563 --> 00:09:50,140
hot and cool air mashing.

203
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,038
So when you talk about them mashing,

204
00:09:52,038 --> 00:09:53,746
are they like coming together and

205
00:09:53,746 --> 00:09:55,354
like swirling together?

206
00:09:55,354 --> 00:09:57,606
What do you mean by mashing?

207
00:09:57,606 --> 00:09:59,132
- [Miah] Mixing, not mashing.

208
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:00,306
- [Teacher] Mixing.

209
00:10:00,306 --> 00:10:02,789
- [Miah] Yeah, just kind
of colliding together,

210
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:04,619
but not swirling.

211
00:10:04,619 --> 00:10:06,053
- [Teacher] Okay, so when you're saying

212
00:10:06,053 --> 00:10:07,653
hot air rising, cool air falling,

213
00:10:07,653 --> 00:10:11,403
you're saying that those
two things are mixing,

214
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:12,955
and it's by the mixing together

215
00:10:12,955 --> 00:10:14,894
that's what's causing the wind?

216
00:10:14,894 --> 00:10:16,101
- [Miah] Yes.

217
00:10:16,101 --> 00:10:16,934
- [Teacher] Okay.

218
00:10:16,934 --> 00:10:17,852
Guys take a second.

219
00:10:17,852 --> 00:10:20,396
I want you to talk, we've
got two more tables to go.

220
00:10:20,396 --> 00:10:21,445
But I want you to take a few moments,

221
00:10:21,445 --> 00:10:23,386
talk about the theories that
have been presented so far

222
00:10:23,386 --> 00:10:26,370
and see if your opinions change so far.

223
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,100
And then any questions
that come up based on it.

224
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,316
Talk to each other.

225
00:10:30,316 --> 00:11:08,983
(class chatter)

226
00:11:10,642 --> 00:11:13,309
Alright guys, about ten seconds.

227
00:11:14,554 --> 00:11:15,804
Everybody time.

228
00:11:17,091 --> 00:11:19,091
And three, two, and one.

229
00:11:20,464 --> 00:11:22,547
Great ideas so far, guys.

230
00:11:23,412 --> 00:11:24,545
Let's go to the last...

231
00:11:24,545 --> 00:11:26,095
Any questions or comments come up in your

232
00:11:26,095 --> 00:11:27,677
discussion that you just had?

233
00:11:27,677 --> 00:11:28,510
Yes.

234
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,303
- [Student] Well, I think that if two

235
00:11:30,303 --> 00:11:31,897
of the same air masses meet it

236
00:11:31,897 --> 00:11:34,242
would just make a larger air mass.

237
00:11:34,242 --> 00:11:35,956
I mean if you're adding water with water,

238
00:11:35,956 --> 00:11:37,711
it's just making more water.

239
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:38,970
- [Teacher] Huh, so you're saying instead

240
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,304
of wind being created,

241
00:11:41,304 --> 00:11:42,590
you would just have a bigger one.

242
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,942
- [Student] And I also think maybe

243
00:11:44,942 --> 00:11:46,766
it creates a thunderstorm if it's

244
00:11:46,766 --> 00:11:48,281
two of the different air masses,

245
00:11:48,281 --> 00:11:51,257
but maybe I think that
would create wind like

246
00:11:51,257 --> 00:11:53,424
negative and positive magenets refusing
to mix.

247
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:57,427
- [Teacher] You're bringing

248
00:11:57,427 --> 00:11:59,021
a couple of interesting things.

249
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:02,027
You're saying when a warm air mass

250
00:12:02,027 --> 00:12:04,837
and a cold air mass meet,

251
00:12:04,837 --> 00:12:07,780
you're saying that those are
kind of like magnets.

252
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,991
Like opposite sides attract?

253
00:12:09,991 --> 00:12:11,803
Am I understanding what you're saying?

254
00:12:11,803 --> 00:12:15,611
- [Student] Sorry, I
mean both of the...

255
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:17,835
I'm a little confused.

256
00:12:17,835 --> 00:12:19,530
Also, I would kind of agree with David now

257
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,363
because if I'm thinking about magnets

258
00:12:22,363 --> 00:12:25,124
then two of the same magnets would refuse.

259
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:25,957
- [Teacher] Right.

260
00:12:25,957 --> 00:12:28,845
So would that analogy be a wind refusing?

261
00:12:28,845 --> 00:12:30,931
Or would coming together
be more like the wind?

262
00:12:30,931 --> 00:12:32,434
- [Student] I think
that analogy would work

263
00:12:32,434 --> 00:12:34,812
with the two different
temperatures of air mass,

264
00:12:34,812 --> 00:12:37,419
but there's, the magnets are the same,

265
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:39,252
the air masses are...

266
00:12:40,335 --> 00:12:42,529
- [Teacher] That's really interesting when you go

267
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,367
and you apply to analogy
like a magnet like that,

268
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:47,055
which is really cool to bring in.

269
00:12:47,055 --> 00:12:48,244
Let me get the two other theories and

270
00:12:48,244 --> 00:12:49,198
we'll come back to that.

271
00:12:49,198 --> 00:12:50,068
- [Student] How big are air masses?

272
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:51,228
- [Teacher] Well, let me come back to that.

273
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,395
Let me get the two others and make sure

274
00:12:52,395 --> 00:12:53,756
we get some other theories in.

275
00:12:53,756 --> 00:12:55,491
Richard, what'd you guys
end up talking about?

276
00:12:55,491 --> 00:12:57,042
Did it change as you

277
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,027
saw these ideas?

278
00:12:59,027 --> 00:13:01,290
- [Richard] Yeah, so
originally we were thinking

279
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,807
that it might have something to do with

280
00:13:03,807 --> 00:13:05,360
gravity's movement.

281
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,457
Actually, we thought

282
00:13:06,457 --> 00:13:07,827
it would probably be more something like

283
00:13:07,827 --> 00:13:09,783
a change in air pressure.

284
00:13:09,783 --> 00:13:11,403
- [Teacher] You know, I'm going to,

285
00:13:11,403 --> 00:13:13,410
because I think that's
an interesting theory,

286
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,785
I'm going to put it up here anyway.

287
00:13:14,785 --> 00:13:15,778
You said it had something to do with

288
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:18,361
gravity and the movement
of the planet itself.

289
00:13:18,361 --> 00:13:19,611
So with gravity

290
00:13:21,707 --> 00:13:23,874
and movement of the Earth.

291
00:13:28,469 --> 00:13:31,094
Okay and then once you
started throughout this round,

292
00:13:31,094 --> 00:13:32,265
you're thinking more it has to do

293
00:13:32,265 --> 00:13:33,706
with changing pressure?

294
00:13:33,706 --> 00:13:35,541
Okay, and you agree with what...

295
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:36,665
Connor, was it you that was saying

296
00:13:36,665 --> 00:13:37,863
that it was the gravity that was causing

297
00:13:37,863 --> 00:13:39,221
the change in pressure?

298
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:40,054
- [Connor] Yeah.

299
00:13:40,054 --> 00:13:41,090
- [Teacher] So are you feeling like,

300
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,605
are you taking your idea

301
00:13:42,605 --> 00:13:44,757
and kinda hooking it together?

302
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:49,553
Or does something else
cause a change in pressure?

303
00:13:49,553 --> 00:13:50,386
(laughter)

304
00:13:50,386 --> 00:13:51,219
Okay, alright.

305
00:13:51,219 --> 00:13:52,671
That's fine.

306
00:13:52,671 --> 00:13:54,720
Where's the mic?

307
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,030
Can you pass it up?

308
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,863
Here, I'll come get it.

309
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:02,831
Abigail, last theory.

310
00:14:03,975 --> 00:14:04,808
Go.

311
00:14:04,808 --> 00:14:06,684
- [Abigail] Well, at first we weren't sure.

312
00:14:06,684 --> 00:14:08,612
And we were talking about
kind of atoms moving,

313
00:14:08,612 --> 00:14:10,214
like molecules and compounds

314
00:14:10,214 --> 00:14:13,714
moving away from each other and combining.

315
00:14:15,565 --> 00:14:17,546
But then we changed our opinions

316
00:14:17,546 --> 00:14:18,713
and think that

317
00:14:20,498 --> 00:14:24,665
like the pressure of air and
the temperature of the air

318
00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:29,428
and the compounds that make up the air,

319
00:14:29,428 --> 00:14:31,095
moving and changing,

320
00:14:33,265 --> 00:14:34,098
make wind

321
00:14:34,098 --> 00:14:36,249
from the combination.

322
00:14:36,249 --> 00:14:38,275
- [Teacher] So you're really
mashing it all together.

323
00:14:38,275 --> 00:14:40,885
So your theory revolves around molecules

324
00:14:40,885 --> 00:14:42,441
moving away from each other.

325
00:14:42,441 --> 00:14:43,369
That was the first part.

326
00:14:43,369 --> 00:14:44,613
And then,

327
00:14:44,613 --> 00:14:47,923
did that end up causing
pressures did you say?

328
00:14:47,923 --> 00:14:50,673
- [Abigail] No, like and then the

329
00:14:51,522 --> 00:14:53,439
different types of air

330
00:14:55,243 --> 00:14:56,937
kinda combined I guess.

331
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,492
- [Teacher] So then molecules
move away from each other.

332
00:14:59,492 --> 00:15:01,025
When you say different types of air?

333
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,218
- [Abigail] So like warm, hot

334
00:15:02,218 --> 00:15:03,537
and pressure.

335
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:04,370
- [Teacher] And those combine?

336
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,994
- [Abigail] (mumbles)

337
00:15:05,994 --> 00:15:08,244
- [Teacher] Should I add that to this?

338
00:15:08,244 --> 00:15:10,353
- [Abigail] I don't know.

339
00:15:10,353 --> 00:15:11,682
- [Teacher] Tom. Yeah, Tom.

340
00:15:11,682 --> 00:15:12,517
- [Tom] I have a question.

341
00:15:12,517 --> 00:15:14,137
How would two air masses meet

342
00:15:14,137 --> 00:15:17,353
if they didn't have wind
to bring them?

343
00:15:17,353 --> 00:15:20,626
- [Teacher] Well, now that's
an interesting question.

344
00:15:20,626 --> 00:15:23,371
Do air masses, now that's a
really interesting question.

345
00:15:23,371 --> 00:15:24,552
Are air masses

346
00:15:24,552 --> 00:15:26,688
just these big masses of air?

347
00:15:26,688 --> 00:15:29,066
And then wind blows them around?

348
00:15:29,066 --> 00:15:30,560
- [Student] Because then
it wouldn't make the wind

349
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,477
if it couldn't,

350
00:15:32,445 --> 00:15:37,043
if it couldn't come together,
it couldn't make wind.

351
00:15:37,043 --> 00:15:39,249
- [Teacher] Oh, now that's
a really interesting thing.

352
00:15:39,249 --> 00:15:40,922
So is the wind?

353
00:15:40,922 --> 00:15:42,173
Oh, wow.

354
00:15:42,173 --> 00:15:45,415
Is wind a result of the air masses?

355
00:15:45,415 --> 00:15:48,332
Or do air masses need wind to move?

356
00:15:51,172 --> 00:15:52,921
Well, that's a really good question.

357
00:15:52,921 --> 00:15:54,761
Ben, you had a hand up.

358
00:15:54,761 --> 00:15:55,951
- [Ben] I just thought about it,

359
00:15:55,951 --> 00:15:59,063
and I didn't really want
to share the question.

360
00:15:59,063 --> 00:16:00,682
I just was thinking in my head

361
00:16:00,682 --> 00:16:02,888
and I thought through the question.

362
00:16:02,888 --> 00:16:03,721
- [Teacher] Alright.

363
00:16:03,721 --> 00:16:06,633
Does anybody have any other
theories they'd like to suggest?

364
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:07,939
Other than are there.

365
00:16:07,939 --> 00:16:08,772
Let's go through them real quick.

366
00:16:08,772 --> 00:16:10,888
So we had the theory that said

367
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:12,049
it's hot air rising

368
00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:13,361
cool air falling,

369
00:16:13,361 --> 00:16:16,779
and somehow those two
mixing that creates the wind.

370
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:17,899
We had the theory that said

371
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:19,479
it's the pressure of air

372
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:23,856
and that pressure is kind
of dictated by gravity.

373
00:16:23,856 --> 00:16:26,033
We had something with currents.

374
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:28,017
So it's somehow the currents in the air,

375
00:16:28,017 --> 00:16:29,809
whatever those happen to be,

376
00:16:29,809 --> 00:16:31,937
that's what's causing
the air to move as wind.

377
00:16:31,937 --> 00:16:34,055
There's air masses meeting.

378
00:16:34,055 --> 00:16:35,649
If it's the same, what Dave was saying.

379
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:36,975
If the same air mass meeting,

380
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:39,535
that's what causes the wind.

381
00:16:39,535 --> 00:16:41,387
It's gravity in the movement of the Earth,

382
00:16:41,387 --> 00:16:43,057
which Richard and this table suggested.

383
00:16:43,057 --> 00:16:44,284
Although they moved away from it,

384
00:16:44,284 --> 00:16:46,952
I think it's a valid
theory to be suggested.

385
00:16:46,952 --> 00:16:49,044
And then it's molecules
moving away from each other

386
00:16:49,044 --> 00:16:51,696
and then somehow combining with the other things.

387
00:16:51,696 --> 00:16:53,350
So would you take a moment,

388
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,458
and if you had to commit to one of these

389
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:58,465
as being why you thought wind would blow,

390
00:16:58,465 --> 00:16:59,621
take a moment and talk to each other

391
00:16:59,621 --> 00:17:01,813
and decide which one you
think you'd commit to

392
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,132
as far as which one you think it is.

393
00:17:03,132 --> 00:17:04,061
Talk to each other.

394
00:17:04,061 --> 00:17:16,728
(class chatter)

395
00:17:18,781 --> 00:17:22,948
- I don't really know like
what Matthew brought up,

396
00:17:26,297 --> 00:17:28,714
how they would move...

397
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:32,291
So... (mumbles)

398
00:17:42,805 --> 00:17:53,472
(class chatter)

399
00:17:55,506 --> 00:17:56,566
- [Teacher] Alright guys, here we go.

400
00:17:56,566 --> 00:18:00,014
Would you grab the voter
that is registered to you.

401
00:18:00,014 --> 00:18:01,194
And when you turn it on,

402
00:18:01,194 --> 00:18:05,032
you should have an A through F option.

403
00:18:05,032 --> 00:18:06,564
And would you choose one of those

404
00:18:06,564 --> 00:18:08,647
to be your theory please?

405
00:18:12,877 --> 00:18:14,279
- [Student] Is this graded?

406
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:15,112
- [Teacher] No, it's not.

407
00:18:15,112 --> 00:18:17,396
No, we're just theorizing right now.

408
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,630
So just go with the one
that feels best to you.

409
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:20,908
- [Student] What's the question?

410
00:18:20,908 --> 00:18:22,846
- [Teacher] It is which
one of those theories

411
00:18:22,846 --> 00:18:24,117
do you think it is

412
00:18:24,117 --> 00:18:24,950
that is

413
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:28,069
what makes wind blow?

414
00:18:30,912 --> 00:18:46,579
(class chatter)

415
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:50,739
Wait for a few more people to vote.

416
00:18:50,739 --> 00:18:53,316
Oh Mark, we gotta get to voting.

417
00:18:53,316 --> 00:18:54,149
Patrick, you in?

418
00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:55,634
Yep, you're in.

419
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,753
Okay.

420
00:18:56,753 --> 00:18:58,790
Mark, what you want to vote on

421
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,852
is which one of these theories

422
00:19:00,852 --> 00:19:01,938
you think is best.

423
00:19:01,938 --> 00:19:02,988
Votes are on your voter

424
00:19:02,988 --> 00:19:04,155
and fire away.

425
00:19:06,371 --> 00:19:07,643
And he's the last one to vote,

426
00:19:07,643 --> 00:19:08,476
as soon as he goes

427
00:19:08,476 --> 00:19:11,809
we'll see what way we as a class think.

428
00:19:14,615 --> 00:19:15,448
Oh, you got it?

429
00:19:15,448 --> 00:19:16,865
Okay, here we go.

430
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,822
Let's see what you think.

431
00:19:25,065 --> 00:19:28,398
Alright, so B is our best theory so far.

432
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:32,095
So right now as a group, let me save this.

433
00:19:32,095 --> 00:19:33,162
So right now as a group,

434
00:19:33,162 --> 00:19:35,143
we are thinking that it is

435
00:19:35,143 --> 00:19:36,760
pressure and...

436
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,579
Let me ask you this.

437
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:39,572
Let me get a quick hand vote for this,

438
00:19:39,572 --> 00:19:40,742
just out of curiosity.

439
00:19:40,742 --> 00:19:41,810
One of the things was that

440
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,162
the pressure is caused by gravity.

441
00:19:44,162 --> 00:19:45,423
How many of you are going to add

442
00:19:45,423 --> 00:19:49,698
pressure would be
caused by gravity then?

443
00:19:49,698 --> 00:19:51,281
Okay, most of the people voted that way

444
00:19:51,281 --> 00:19:52,317
look like they're going--
