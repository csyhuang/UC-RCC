1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,769
(background chatter)

2
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:10,139
- Do you know how
to make a U shape, like this?

3
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:13,483
You're gonna make the U
shape with this first.

4
00:00:13,483 --> 00:00:15,711
It's gonna make a U.

5
00:00:15,711 --> 00:00:18,546
- You're making sod homes.

6
00:00:18,546 --> 00:00:20,867
What are sod homes?

7
00:00:21,418 --> 00:00:27,226
(background chatter)

8
00:00:27,226 --> 00:00:29,914
Tell me what all you
know about a sod home.

9
00:00:29,914 --> 00:00:33,939
(background chatter)

10
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:39,238
There were some homes that were dug out.

11
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:43,569
That were built, the dugouts
were in a hill, okay.

12
00:00:43,569 --> 00:00:45,810
Tell me what else you know about sod home.

13
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:59,172
(background chatter)

14
00:00:59,172 --> 00:01:03,113
Okay, and why did they
use sod to make houses?

15
00:01:03,113 --> 00:01:13,753
(background chatter)

16
00:01:13,753 --> 00:01:16,475
Yeah, okay, so they didn't have trees.

17
00:01:16,475 --> 00:01:18,446
What kind of land were they on?

18
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:19,539
- A prairie!

19
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:21,623
- A prairie, and what is a prairie?

20
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:24,320
- It's a flat kind of land,

21
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,014
and it never has any trees.

22
00:01:26,014 --> 00:01:30,963
- Okay, okay.

23
00:01:30,963 --> 00:01:33,444
Would you have wanted
to live in a sod home?

24
00:01:33,444 --> 00:01:36,631
- I'd choose a log cabin,

25
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:38,749
where (background chatter)

26
00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:42,755
- Okay, were there any good
things about a sod home?

27
00:01:42,755 --> 00:01:43,580
- Um, yeah.

28
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,262
- What is something good about a sod home?

29
00:01:45,262 --> 00:02:04,278
(background chatter)

30
00:02:04,278 --> 00:02:07,568
Okay, what are the walls
like in a sod home?

31
00:02:07,568 --> 00:02:12,497
(background chatter)

32
00:02:12,497 --> 00:02:15,572
Are they thick, are they thick walls?

33
00:02:15,572 --> 00:02:18,085
Okay, okay.

34
00:02:18,085 --> 00:02:20,319
Did they have any furniture
in their sod homes?

35
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,333
(background chatter)

36
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,675
They did, why didn't they have furniture?

37
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:25,415
JD, why didn't they have
furniture in their sod homes?

38
00:02:25,415 --> 00:02:29,652
- [JD] Because they weren't, I think.

39
00:02:29,652 --> 00:02:36,046
(background chatter)

40
00:02:36,046 --> 00:02:38,096
- Abby, do you know why
they, they didn't have

41
00:02:38,096 --> 00:02:39,942
furniture in their sod homes?

42
00:02:39,942 --> 00:02:41,275
- [Abby] No, but--

43
00:02:41,275 --> 00:02:43,336
- Did they bring their
furniture with them?

44
00:02:43,336 --> 00:02:45,890
- [Abby] No because of the wagon.

45
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,700
- It would take up the whole wagon?

46
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,152
Okay, so what did they bring?

47
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:50,440
What did they bring, Hannah?

48
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,989
- [Hannah] A gun?

49
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:54,829
- They did, they brought a gun.

50
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:57,824
And food, okay?

51
00:02:57,824 --> 00:03:00,285
So they didn't bring
their furniture with them.

52
00:03:00,285 --> 00:03:01,789
Why not? Why didn't they
bring their furniture?

53
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:02,820
- 'Cause it was too big,

54
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,970
and it would take up the whole wagon.

55
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:05,829
- Okay.

56
00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:11,006
(background chatter)

57
00:03:11,006 --> 00:03:12,560
Okay.

58
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,628
Didn't they have more than one wagon?

59
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:16,425
- Yes, (background chatter)

60
00:03:16,425 --> 00:03:19,281
- That's right, a wagon train, very good.

61
00:03:19,281 --> 00:03:20,848
Okay, I'm gonna leave you guys to work,

62
00:03:20,848 --> 00:03:23,298
and I'm gonna be back and
check on your sod homes, okay?

63
00:03:23,298 --> 00:03:33,384
(background chatter)

64
00:03:33,384 --> 00:03:35,880
- It smells very good!

65
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:55,350
(background chatter)

66
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,101
- Okay, (mumbling) and I'll help you.

67
00:03:58,101 --> 00:04:00,199
I see that you have trunks.

68
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,593
Why do you have a trunk?

69
00:04:01,593 --> 00:04:03,867
(background chatter)

70
00:04:03,867 --> 00:04:06,929
Oh, that's very nice, to help.

71
00:04:06,929 --> 00:04:09,120
Eli, why do you all have trunks?

72
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,649
- [Eli] Because, um,
the pioneers had them.

73
00:04:12,649 --> 00:04:14,007
- The pioneers had trunks? Why?

74
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:15,424
Why did they have trunks?

75
00:04:15,424 --> 00:04:17,107
- [Eli] For their clothes and stuff.

76
00:04:17,107 --> 00:04:18,280
- And toys.

77
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,684
- And toys.

78
00:04:19,684 --> 00:04:20,985
- Like, we're making the doll.

79
00:04:20,985 --> 00:04:22,888
- Okay, what were trunks made out of?

80
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,921
- [Eli] Wood.
- Wood.

81
00:04:25,921 --> 00:04:28,177
Oh you guys are sharing, it's so great.

82
00:04:28,177 --> 00:04:29,739
Thank you!

83
00:04:29,739 --> 00:04:31,995
So their trunks were made out of wood.

84
00:04:31,995 --> 00:04:34,290
What kind of homes did they live in?

85
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,427
- [Eli] Sod houses and log homes.

86
00:04:36,427 --> 00:04:38,563
- Sod houses and log homes.

87
00:04:38,563 --> 00:04:41,245
- Log cabins.
- And log cabins.

88
00:04:41,245 --> 00:04:42,243
Okay.

89
00:04:42,243 --> 00:04:46,001
(background chatter)

90
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:47,614
That's right, that's right.

91
00:04:47,614 --> 00:04:51,955
And so, when they traveled,
when they left their homes,

92
00:04:51,955 --> 00:04:53,558
what did they travel in?

93
00:04:53,558 --> 00:04:55,591
- [Eli] A covered wagon.
- A covered wagon.

94
00:04:55,591 --> 00:04:59,230
Was there just one wagon?
- [Eli] No!

95
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,214
They got in a wagon train.

96
00:05:01,214 --> 00:05:03,886
- A wagon train, and
what was a wagon train?

97
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:07,369
- [Eli] It's a bunch of covered wagons.

98
00:05:07,369 --> 00:05:11,125
(background chatter)

99
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:14,461
- Oxen, in a wagon train.

100
00:05:14,461 --> 00:05:16,756
In a wagon train, would
you have wanted to be

101
00:05:16,756 --> 00:05:19,054
at the front or the
back of the wagon train.

102
00:05:19,054 --> 00:05:20,575
Why?
- I have an idea.

103
00:05:20,575 --> 00:05:24,197
Erase, erase, erase, erase.
- You won't get that dirty.

104
00:05:24,197 --> 00:05:26,268
- You won't get that dirty?

105
00:05:26,268 --> 00:05:28,832
Why would you not get
that dirty at the front?

106
00:05:28,832 --> 00:05:32,458
- [Eli] Because they can't
move their (mumbles).

107
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:32,940
- Okay.

108
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,861
Okay.

109
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:38,450
What would happen in the wagon train?

110
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,704
Would they take care of each other?

111
00:05:39,704 --> 00:05:41,108
- [Eli] Yeah.
- Okay.

112
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:44,460
What if a wheel broke off of a wagon?

113
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,215
- They would
have to help each other.

114
00:05:46,215 --> 00:05:48,897
(background chatter)

115
00:05:48,897 --> 00:05:52,490
- Okay, okay they would help each other.

116
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,424
Tell me this, Eli.

117
00:05:54,424 --> 00:05:57,430
Where was the wagon, where
were the wagons going?

118
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,365
- [Eli] West.
- They were going West.

119
00:06:00,365 --> 00:06:02,218
Why were they going West, Cayden?

120
00:06:02,218 --> 00:06:05,399
- They thought
they would settle the land.

121
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:09,776
- Okay, Karev, why did the
government give them free land?

122
00:06:09,776 --> 00:06:21,326
(background chatter)

123
00:06:21,326 --> 00:06:22,947
- Okay, they were (mumbling).

124
00:06:22,947 --> 00:06:25,919
What did they have to do on that land?

125
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,066
- [Eli] Build a house.

126
00:06:27,066 --> 00:06:29,945
- Okay, build a house, that's right.

127
00:06:29,945 --> 00:06:32,023
That's right, so what kind
of house did they build?

128
00:06:32,023 --> 00:06:34,681
- [Karev] (mumbling) A sod house.

129
00:06:34,681 --> 00:06:35,950
- They made a sod house.

130
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,023
Why did they not make a wood house?

131
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,642
- [Karev] Because there
weren't a lot of trees

132
00:06:40,642 --> 00:06:41,853
on the prairie.

133
00:06:41,853 --> 00:06:44,060
- Okay, but you said the
trunks were made out of wood,

134
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,744
how did they get trunks made out of wood?

135
00:06:45,744 --> 00:06:48,990
- [Karev] Because they
made it before they left.

136
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:53,461
- They made it before
they left, that's correct.

137
00:06:53,461 --> 00:06:54,843
- Can the doll have long hair?

138
00:06:54,843 --> 00:06:57,274
- You're doing a great job.

139
00:06:57,274 --> 00:07:01,001
You're just gonna have to imagine that.

140
00:07:01,001 --> 00:07:02,981
That's right, they made their
trunks before they left.

141
00:07:02,981 --> 00:07:05,093
Did they just need one trunk?

142
00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:06,316
- [Eli] No.

143
00:07:06,316 --> 00:07:07,802
- Okay.
- [Eli] Twice.

144
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,696
- Okay.

145
00:07:08,696 --> 00:07:09,718
Do you know Eli?

146
00:07:09,718 --> 00:07:11,633
Can you go show me on the map,

147
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:15,777
where the pioneers went on the prairie,

148
00:07:15,777 --> 00:07:17,321
where the prairie was?

149
00:07:23,521 --> 00:07:26,436
Okay, and what is that?
- The Prairie.

150
00:07:26,436 --> 00:07:29,036
- [Teacher] The prairie, and
how do you know it's a prairie?

151
00:07:29,036 --> 00:07:32,497
- Because there's no, like,

152
00:07:32,497 --> 00:07:33,645
mountains there.

153
00:07:33,645 --> 00:07:35,386
- [Teacher] How do you
know there's no mountains?

154
00:07:35,386 --> 00:07:38,013
- Because,

155
00:07:38,013 --> 00:07:42,094
these are the mountains.

156
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:44,557
Just like regular colors are not.

157
00:07:44,557 --> 00:07:46,670
- [Teacher] Okay, and so on the prairie,

158
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:50,908
what kind of homes did they build?

159
00:07:50,908 --> 00:07:52,324
- Sod houses.
- [Teacher] Sod houses.

160
00:07:52,324 --> 00:07:54,854
So where did they build
their log houses at?

161
00:07:54,854 --> 00:07:57,257
- [Eli] Right in this area.
- [Teacher] Okay!

162
00:07:57,257 --> 00:07:58,755
Very good, and why did
they build 'em there?

163
00:07:58,755 --> 00:07:59,998
What was there?

164
00:07:59,998 --> 00:08:01,647
- Wood.
- [Teacher] A lot of wood.

165
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,936
Good job! You can go sit down.

166
00:08:02,936 --> 00:08:05,421
Thank you! You did a great job!

167
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:07,031
Very good job.

168
00:08:07,031 --> 00:08:16,908
(background chatter)

169
00:08:16,908 --> 00:08:19,876
Did they take everything
with them on the trip?

170
00:08:19,876 --> 00:08:22,383
Why did they not take
everything with them?

171
00:08:22,383 --> 00:08:25,600
(speech drowned out by
other children talking)

172
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,713
Okay, so when they got there,
did they have furniture

173
00:08:27,713 --> 00:08:29,315
to put into their sod homes?

174
00:08:29,315 --> 00:08:32,072
- No, because
(background chatter)

175
00:08:32,072 --> 00:08:35,742
- They just moved in,
they had just moved in.

176
00:08:35,742 --> 00:08:38,029
Where there good things about a sod home?

177
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:40,037
Eli, what was good about a sod home?

178
00:08:40,037 --> 00:08:47,478
(background chatter)

179
00:08:47,478 --> 00:08:52,502
That's right, and what made them that way?

180
00:08:52,502 --> 00:08:54,990
- Because the ground is cooler.

181
00:08:54,990 --> 00:09:01,073
- Okay, the ground is cooler.

182
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:03,282
Were the log homes good as well?

183
00:09:03,282 --> 00:09:03,881
- [Eli] Yeah.

184
00:09:03,881 --> 00:09:06,346
- Okay, but what was one
bad thing about a log house

185
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:08,493
compared to a sod house?

186
00:09:08,493 --> 00:09:10,989
- [Eli] It's not warm in winter.

187
00:09:10,989 --> 00:09:13,624
- And do you remember
when we did a Venn Diagram

188
00:09:13,624 --> 00:09:15,632
about the sod house and the log house

189
00:09:15,632 --> 00:09:17,328
and compared those two?

190
00:09:17,328 --> 00:09:21,001
- Yeah, (background chatter)

191
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:23,112
- So that was the bad
thing about a sod home

192
00:09:23,112 --> 00:09:25,038
is the animals could fall through.

193
00:09:25,038 --> 00:09:27,175
What was the best structure to live in?

194
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:30,959
- [Eli] A log cabin.
- A log cabin.

195
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,548
- So that, animals
couldn't get on top of it

196
00:09:33,548 --> 00:09:35,742
and (background chatter)

197
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,060
- If you lived in a dug
out, Cayden, would you,

198
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,896
if it came a big rain storm,

199
00:09:40,896 --> 00:09:42,442
would you rather be at
the front of the dug house

200
00:09:42,442 --> 00:09:45,169
or the back of the dug out?
- [Cayden] Back.

201
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:45,953
- Why?

202
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:49,157
(background chatter)

203
00:09:49,157 --> 00:09:51,260
It's a dryer place, isn't it.

204
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,746
Okay, you guys continue to work, okay?

205
00:09:55,746 --> 00:10:26,341
(background chatter)

206
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:30,404
Tell me what you know about a log house.

207
00:10:30,404 --> 00:10:33,410
Willie, tell me something
you know about a log house.

208
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:42,014
(background chatter)

209
00:10:42,014 --> 00:10:44,947
Okay, they didn't have any
air conditioners, (mumbling).

210
00:10:44,947 --> 00:10:48,165
Kennedy, you guys are making a log house.

211
00:10:48,165 --> 00:10:50,951
What are you putting in your log house?

212
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:55,951
- Dolls and some family
and some furniture.

213
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:58,019
- Okay.

214
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:02,441
Did they have a lot of furniture
for their log house Brody?

215
00:11:02,441 --> 00:11:04,959
Did they have furniture
for their log house?

216
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,104
- [Brody] Yeah, but when they
got there, they had to have

217
00:11:09,104 --> 00:11:10,822
time to gather up some furniture.

218
00:11:10,822 --> 00:11:12,621
- That's right, when
they first moved there,

219
00:11:12,621 --> 00:11:13,759
they didn't have any furniture.

220
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:16,395
But eventually they
built some, didn't they?

221
00:11:16,395 --> 00:11:18,960
I see you're putting a fireplace in there.

222
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,768
What did they burn in their fireplace?

223
00:11:22,768 --> 00:11:27,977
- They were
burning, um buffalo chips.

224
00:11:27,977 --> 00:11:31,926
- They are? In a log house
they're burning buffalo chips?

225
00:11:31,926 --> 00:11:37,065
(background chatter)

226
00:11:37,065 --> 00:11:38,217
That's right, in a sod house,

227
00:11:38,217 --> 00:11:40,876
they're gonna burn buffalo chips.

228
00:11:40,876 --> 00:11:43,372
Why not wood in a sod house?

229
00:11:43,372 --> 00:11:47,198
- Because, in a prairie,

230
00:11:47,198 --> 00:11:49,865
they would run out of,
if they had enough wood,

231
00:11:49,865 --> 00:11:52,871
they would build a wood
house, build a log house.

232
00:11:52,871 --> 00:11:54,266
- That's exactly right.

233
00:11:54,266 --> 00:12:06,582
(background chatter)

234
00:12:06,582 --> 00:12:10,621
Were there buffalo chips
where there were log houses?

235
00:12:10,621 --> 00:12:11,292
- No.

236
00:12:11,292 --> 00:12:12,991
- Why were there not buffalo chips?

237
00:12:12,991 --> 00:12:23,996
(background chatter)

238
00:12:23,996 --> 00:12:26,876
So buffalo cannot run in the
forest where the trees were.

239
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:28,000
Where did the buffalo live?

240
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,313
What was it called?

241
00:12:29,313 --> 00:12:30,588
- The prairie.
- [Teacher] The prairie.

242
00:12:30,588 --> 00:12:31,887
And what is a prairie?

243
00:12:31,887 --> 00:12:39,930
(background chatter)

244
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:45,083
Open grasslands, that's exactly right.

245
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,095
And what are you making, Dillon?

246
00:12:47,095 --> 00:12:48,070
- [Dillon] A quilt.

247
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,957
- Why are you making a quilt?

248
00:12:50,957 --> 00:12:54,231
Tell me why the pioneers
needed quilts for.

249
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,296
(background chatter)

250
00:12:56,296 --> 00:12:58,876
To sit on them, what else
did they do with them Willie?

251
00:12:58,876 --> 00:13:00,222
(background chatter)

252
00:13:00,222 --> 00:13:03,215
They (mumbles) on them when
they were on their way.

253
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:04,620
What else, Dillon?

254
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:09,978
(background chatter)

255
00:13:09,978 --> 00:13:12,153
Okay, did they not have beds?

256
00:13:12,153 --> 00:13:13,511
- Yes!
- No they didn't.

257
00:13:13,511 --> 00:13:14,452
- Okay.

258
00:13:14,452 --> 00:13:16,894
(background chatter)

259
00:13:16,894 --> 00:13:18,931
That's right.

260
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,705
- Okay.
- they had to sleep on the floor

261
00:13:21,705 --> 00:13:24,285
Are you putting a kitchen
in your log house?

262
00:13:24,285 --> 00:13:28,020
(background chatter)

263
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,450
- No because they (mumbling).

264
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,223
- Well, where did they keep their food at?

265
00:13:32,223 --> 00:13:34,534
(background chatter)

266
00:13:34,534 --> 00:13:36,240
The root cellar.

267
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,199
Where, tell me about a root cellar.

268
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:41,530
What's a root cellar?

269
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:45,353
- It's where they kept their frozen food.

270
00:13:45,353 --> 00:13:48,340
- Okay, was it inside the
log cabin or was it outside?

271
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,761
- [Dillon] Outside.
- Okay.

272
00:13:49,761 --> 00:13:51,787
And what was the root cellar like?

273
00:13:51,787 --> 00:14:09,157
(background chatter)

274
00:14:09,157 --> 00:14:10,594
Okay.

275
00:14:10,594 --> 00:14:19,038
(background chatter)

276
00:14:19,038 --> 00:14:22,597
Brody, you're exactly right,
that is great thinking.

277
00:14:22,597 --> 00:14:24,538
That is great thinking.

278
00:14:24,538 --> 00:14:27,278
Did they keep any food inside their homes?

279
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:28,057
- Yes.

280
00:14:28,057 --> 00:14:31,021
- What'd they keep inside their homes?

281
00:14:31,021 --> 00:14:33,578
- Flour and sugar.

282
00:14:33,578 --> 00:14:35,683
- Flour and sugar, and where
would they have kept those?

283
00:14:35,683 --> 00:14:36,971
In what container?

284
00:14:36,971 --> 00:14:41,516
(background chatter)

285
00:14:41,516 --> 00:14:42,369
What kind of container?

286
00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:44,336
Were they barrels that they put them in?

287
00:14:44,336 --> 00:14:46,298
- Yeah.
- Yeah, they were barrels.

288
00:14:46,298 --> 00:14:48,713
You guys are doing a great job
and you're working together,

289
00:14:48,713 --> 00:14:49,978
and I'm gonna come back and check on you

290
00:14:49,978 --> 00:14:51,081
in a little bit, all right?

291
00:14:51,081 --> 00:14:53,194
- [Billy] Look what I made!
- What is that, Willie?

292
00:14:53,194 --> 00:14:57,437
(background chatter)

293
00:14:57,437 --> 00:14:59,812
It's what?
- [Dillon] A lantern.

294
00:14:59,812 --> 00:15:02,951
A lantern, why do you have
a lantern in your log house?

295
00:15:02,951 --> 00:15:06,178
(background chatter)

296
00:15:06,178 --> 00:15:08,337
Okay, and so, you can see?

297
00:15:08,337 --> 00:15:08,948
- [Willie] Yeah!

298
00:15:08,948 --> 00:15:09,919
- That's right, 'cause they didn't have

299
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:11,540
electricity did they?

300
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:18,024
- [Willie] 'Cause they had (mumbling).

301
00:15:18,024 --> 00:15:19,742
- [Teacher] So they could see to cook?

302
00:15:19,742 --> 00:15:20,996
Good thinking!

303
00:15:20,996 --> 00:15:34,457
(background chatter)

304
00:15:34,457 --> 00:15:38,676
- I need to do my little girl, okay?

305
00:15:38,676 --> 00:15:40,321
- I'll do the girl.
