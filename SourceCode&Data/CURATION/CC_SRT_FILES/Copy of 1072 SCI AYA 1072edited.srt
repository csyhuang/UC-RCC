1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,100
[Background chatter]

2
00:00:01,375 --> 00:00:05,775
- [Boy in Blue] Isn't it nuclear
fission when, like, fusion?

3
00:00:05,775 --> 00:00:08,495
No, fusion is when they combine.

4
00:00:08,495 --> 00:00:11,235
Nuclear fission is like when
they split apart, right?

5
00:00:11,235 --> 00:00:12,612
- Yes, so it's a fission process.

6
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:13,941
- [Boy in Blue] See? Ah!

7
00:00:13,941 --> 00:00:16,298
- So that's a (mumbles), I see that,

8
00:00:16,298 --> 00:00:17,787
that efficient.

9
00:00:17,787 --> 00:00:20,009
- [Boy in Blue] Efficient.

10
00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:22,133
- It increases the safety though, right?

11
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:23,851
- [Boy in Blue] It's
impossible to explain.

12
00:00:23,851 --> 00:00:26,207
- No, I'm just saying, does it?

13
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,758
- [Boy in Blue] No, I don't understand.

14
00:00:28,758 --> 00:00:30,422
Am I the only one here?

15
00:00:31,485 --> 00:00:34,397
- Apparently to you, though. (chuckles)

16
00:00:34,397 --> 00:00:36,586
- So, why is it that when
the atom is unstable

17
00:00:36,586 --> 00:00:38,264
it's radioactive?

18
00:00:39,256 --> 00:00:42,830
- It could be it's removing
protons and neutrons?

19
00:00:44,601 --> 00:00:46,023
- I think you guys can discuss this.

20
00:00:46,023 --> 00:00:47,484
- [Boy in Blue] Isn't it
when like it starts releasing

21
00:00:47,484 --> 00:00:51,047
the neutrons to a different
atom, or something,

22
00:00:51,047 --> 00:00:52,629
and then it gains the neutron,

23
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:55,703
and that's when it starts becoming, like--

24
00:00:55,703 --> 00:00:56,841
- More vulnerable--

25
00:00:56,841 --> 00:00:58,084
- [Boy in Blue] More vulnerable,

26
00:00:58,084 --> 00:01:00,257
and it starts, like, a chain reaction.

27
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:04,825
- [Boy in Blue] You guys agree?

28
00:01:04,825 --> 00:01:05,288
- I agree.

29
00:01:05,288 --> 00:01:06,102
- [Multiple] I agree.

30
00:01:06,102 --> 00:01:07,228
- [Boy in Red] I agree with everybody.

31
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:08,218
- That's right.

32
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:09,578
(chuckles)

33
00:01:12,058 --> 00:01:13,959
- [Boy in Blue] So, how
can radiation help them?

34
00:01:14,986 --> 00:01:16,519
Like Amy said--

35
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:18,121
- It could also help in the electricity

36
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:19,964
and helps us get our resources.

37
00:01:19,964 --> 00:01:20,845
- Like you said.

38
00:01:20,845 --> 00:01:23,196
(students chuckle)

39
00:01:24,614 --> 00:01:26,518
- [Boy in Red] What else though?

40
00:01:26,518 --> 00:01:27,539
- Like cancer.

41
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:28,411
- [Voiceover] Cancer?

42
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:29,390
- [Boy in Blue] Cancer.

43
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,612
- I mean, I had an aunt
that suffered from cancer

44
00:01:31,612 --> 00:01:35,270
and it kind of helped her
even though she passed away.

45
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,325
It kept her longer than it would have been

46
00:01:37,325 --> 00:01:39,838
without her having medication.

47
00:01:44,508 --> 00:01:46,396
- Any last thoughts?

48
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:53,091
Okay, that's fine, thank you.

49
00:01:55,918 --> 00:01:58,865
I have only one major, I guess comment,

50
00:01:58,865 --> 00:02:00,762
about that one.

51
00:02:03,424 --> 00:02:05,781
I noticed Steve used a
lot of vocabulary words.

52
00:02:05,781 --> 00:02:09,089
He did remember a lot of the words,

53
00:02:09,089 --> 00:02:10,703
and I think he planned for that.

54
00:02:10,703 --> 00:02:12,363
And then I liked the way that David

55
00:02:12,363 --> 00:02:14,580
actually redirected the group.

56
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,308
He asked the group, "How
can radiation help us?"

57
00:02:17,308 --> 00:02:18,459
right at the end,

58
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:20,142
and then people responded to that.

59
00:02:20,142 --> 00:02:21,709
So, he kind of helped redirect the questions

60
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:24,041
for the discussion group.

61
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:27,073
So, and then people were able to respond.

62
00:02:27,073 --> 00:02:30,637
So, that was a nice way
to create a discussion.

63
00:02:30,637 --> 00:02:32,878
Okay, question number two.

64
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:33,633
- [Student] Three.

65
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:34,294
- [Multiple] Three.

66
00:02:34,294 --> 00:02:35,571
- I'm sorry.

67
00:02:35,571 --> 00:02:37,174
Okay, I mean...

68
00:02:38,314 --> 00:02:39,235
- How about number four next?

69
00:02:39,235 --> 00:02:40,603
- [Teacher] Okay, I'm
going to do number four next.

70
00:02:40,603 --> 00:02:41,315
- No!

71
00:02:41,315 --> 00:02:43,140
- Do number three.

72
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,546
The one with three.

73
00:02:44,546 --> 00:02:45,652
- No, I'm going to do four.

74
00:02:45,652 --> 00:02:47,042
- No, I want to do three.

75
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,944
Okay, number four is going to go next.

76
00:02:48,944 --> 00:02:51,103
You have two minutes to prepare.

77
00:02:51,103 --> 00:02:54,519
(students chatter)

78
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:56,031
Number four.

79
00:02:56,031 --> 00:03:07,984
(students chatter)

80
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:09,707
Just ignore it.

81
00:03:09,707 --> 00:03:10,566
- What is that?

82
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:11,575
- [Teacher] A microphone.

83
00:03:11,575 --> 00:03:12,655
- Oh, it works?

84
00:03:12,655 --> 00:03:13,909
So, they can hear me right now?

85
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:15,047
Oh. (laughs)

86
00:03:15,047 --> 00:03:16,667
- It's recording?

87
00:03:18,934 --> 00:03:20,315
- [Voiceover] Well, why do
you think President Obama

88
00:03:20,315 --> 00:03:22,126
might support building
nuclear power plants

89
00:03:22,126 --> 00:03:25,985
in the USA and what are some arguments

90
00:03:25,985 --> 00:03:28,331
for nuclear energy?

91
00:03:29,868 --> 00:03:31,900
- [Teacher] David, put that away.

92
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,716
(chuckles)

93
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,047
- [Teacher] Okay, Jane,
who's going to go next?

94
00:03:36,047 --> 00:03:36,826
- [Jane] Me.

95
00:03:36,826 --> 00:03:37,585
- Jane.

96
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:38,784
- [Teacher] Okay, so which
vocabulary and evidence

97
00:03:38,784 --> 00:03:41,054
are you going to focus on?

98
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,246
- [Jane] Nuclear power plant,

99
00:03:44,594 --> 00:03:45,550
nuclear power plant--

100
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,688
- [Teacher] Well, pick several.

101
00:03:46,688 --> 00:03:48,288
- [Jane] The nuclear, yeah.

102
00:03:48,288 --> 00:03:51,411
The nuclear power plant can
help us create more energy.

103
00:03:51,411 --> 00:03:52,411
I mean, well it's--

104
00:03:52,411 --> 00:03:54,065
- Nuclear radiation,

105
00:03:55,395 --> 00:03:57,230
for my argument.

106
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,707
- [Teacher] You know what Dano was saying?

107
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:01,368
- No.

108
00:04:01,368 --> 00:04:03,184
- [Teacher] He was just
going to put power plants.

109
00:04:03,184 --> 00:04:04,895
- Do you know what it is?

110
00:04:04,895 --> 00:04:07,856
- Yeah, it's where they
(drowned out by chatter).

111
00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:09,782
Yeah.

112
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:13,068
- [Teacher] Okay, what does it do?

113
00:04:13,068 --> 00:04:15,317
- Creates energy.

114
00:04:15,317 --> 00:04:16,805
- [Teacher] Okay.

115
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:20,599
- [Teacher] Okay, what
other evidence are you

116
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:22,397
going to use, though?

117
00:04:24,993 --> 00:04:27,989
- The fact that we are running out of,

118
00:04:27,989 --> 00:04:31,668
well, we're not running out of, but,

119
00:04:31,668 --> 00:04:33,642
in the future we might not be

120
00:04:33,642 --> 00:04:37,932
able to find enough energy
(drowned out by chatter).

121
00:04:43,382 --> 00:04:45,113
So, we need to start.

122
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:49,769
We need to start thinking
about the future, like--

123
00:04:50,587 --> 00:04:51,563
- Jobs and stuff.

124
00:04:51,563 --> 00:04:54,109
- No, future things that are like,

125
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:57,695
the future and what's going to happen

126
00:04:57,695 --> 00:05:00,184
and energy and how are we going to have
a good supply.

127
00:05:00,184 --> 00:05:02,537
Like what if we were running out

128
00:05:02,537 --> 00:05:05,042
and start thinking about that?

129
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:11,593
- Okay, so the next person.

130
00:05:13,457 --> 00:05:37,433
(students chatter)

131
00:05:38,267 --> 00:05:40,415
Okay, so the people on the outside,

132
00:05:40,415 --> 00:05:43,959
if you were recording
the vocabulary last time,

133
00:05:45,926 --> 00:05:47,689
I want the people on the outside to switch

134
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:50,481
so that you're recording
something different.

135
00:05:53,308 --> 00:05:55,799
So if you did evidence
first, switch to vocabulary.

136
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:58,664
If you did vocabulary, switch to evidence.

137
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,329
- Oh, Sindi, sit like right here.

138
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:22,404
(students chatter)

139
00:06:23,105 --> 00:06:26,100
- Okay, this question is why
do you think President Obama

140
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,687
might support building nuclear
power plants in the U.S.,

141
00:06:29,687 --> 00:06:31,498
and based on the video we watched,

142
00:06:31,498 --> 00:06:34,128
what are some arguments to
be made for nuclear energy?

143
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,478
- I think President Obama
might support building

144
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:39,300
nuclear power plants in the U.S.

145
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,703
because it doesn't release chemicals,

146
00:06:41,703 --> 00:06:43,166
therefore it's eco-friendly,

147
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:46,125
making the U.S. more green.

148
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,815
Environmentally, green.

149
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:51,160
- I agree with her, because
another reason I think

150
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,978
the president might support
it is because, like,

151
00:06:55,978 --> 00:06:59,884
like right now we're
in an economic crisis,

152
00:06:59,884 --> 00:07:02,073
what you call the thing? And then like

153
00:07:02,073 --> 00:07:05,898
making new plants may
create more jobs for people.

154
00:07:07,378 --> 00:07:09,020
It'll create jobs for building them,

155
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,440
and then it'll also benefit
everybody for clean power.

156
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:14,837
- [Multiple] I agree.

157
00:07:14,837 --> 00:07:16,995
(students chuckle)

158
00:07:16,995 --> 00:07:19,411
- I agree because it builds
economic stabilization,

159
00:07:19,411 --> 00:07:23,504
and it'll create jobs for the future,

160
00:07:23,504 --> 00:07:26,128
like, for more years,

161
00:07:26,128 --> 00:07:28,740
because in order to run
a nuclear power plant

162
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,307
you need, you know, like, to build it.

163
00:07:31,307 --> 00:07:33,466
And once it's built, you
still need to work with it

164
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:36,844
so I think the job's
going to last for a while.

165
00:07:36,844 --> 00:07:37,587
- I agree.

166
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:40,744
- [Boy in Glasses] But if
we're in an economic crisis,

167
00:07:40,744 --> 00:07:42,787
like if we're in an economic crisis

168
00:07:42,787 --> 00:07:44,565
how are you going to pay for it?

169
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:46,747
Like, where's the money going to come from?

170
00:07:46,747 --> 00:07:48,501
- Well, we're already in debt, so we'll

171
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,849
get even more debt.

172
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:51,589
- [Boy in Glasses] Yeah,
it costs a lot to build

173
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:53,900
a nuclear reactor.

174
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,281
- We'd get funding.

175
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:56,383
- [Multiple] Yeah.

176
00:07:56,383 --> 00:07:57,985
- And we have to, like,
think about the future

177
00:07:57,985 --> 00:08:00,203
and how it's going to benefit, you know,

178
00:08:00,203 --> 00:08:04,858
for the economy and
making more power plants

179
00:08:04,858 --> 00:08:08,027
would just provide, like, a stable future

180
00:08:08,027 --> 00:08:10,720
for the upcoming people and the jobs

181
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,195
because it supplies more jobs and stuff.

182
00:08:13,195 --> 00:08:14,463
- [Boy in Gray] And more, you know,

183
00:08:14,463 --> 00:08:15,830
we'll get more electricity.

184
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,575
You know, if we build
more nuclear power plants.

185
00:08:17,575 --> 00:08:20,755
- Yeah, and not just 20%, but
more like the other countries

186
00:08:20,755 --> 00:08:23,093
who have 30 and stuff like that--

187
00:08:23,093 --> 00:08:26,815
- (mumbles) needs luxuries,
rising electricity demands.

188
00:08:26,815 --> 00:08:28,504
It won't leave the U.S. behind

189
00:08:28,504 --> 00:08:31,053
and all the new tech stuff?

190
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:40,282
(student murmurs)

191
00:08:45,122 --> 00:08:46,422
- [Boy in Black Hoodie]
And the more factories,

192
00:08:46,422 --> 00:08:48,767
and the more power plants
we produce, we make,

193
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:51,588
the more electricity
and the more factories,

194
00:08:51,588 --> 00:08:53,044
it will get more stuff.

195
00:08:53,044 --> 00:08:55,343
It will build the more jobs,

196
00:08:55,343 --> 00:08:58,296
and that will raise up
the economic problems.

197
00:08:59,265 --> 00:09:02,010
- Yeah, because more stuff
will be done that way.

198
00:09:02,817 --> 00:09:04,953
- So, now you guys have
given a lot of arguments

199
00:09:04,953 --> 00:09:07,077
supporting nuclear energy.

200
00:09:07,077 --> 00:09:09,689
What do you think is the biggest
problem with nuclear energy

201
00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:11,535
that we should be aware of?

202
00:09:11,535 --> 00:09:13,068
- The thing that causes cancer.

203
00:09:13,068 --> 00:09:15,737
- Probably be the radioactive waste

204
00:09:15,737 --> 00:09:19,340
that the nuclear power plants give off.

205
00:09:19,694 --> 00:09:22,366
Well, they don't give it
off, the water, the coolant

206
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:23,503
or whatever.

207
00:09:23,503 --> 00:09:26,039
And then, like, they don't
have nowhere to store it.

208
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:28,725
I think it was some cave thingy

209
00:09:28,725 --> 00:09:30,495
that they were trying to
build, but they didn't build.

210
00:09:30,495 --> 00:09:31,992
- [Boy in Black Hoodie]
They're going to run out of space

211
00:09:31,992 --> 00:09:33,211
to put the waste in.

212
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:40,816
(students talk over each other)

213
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,333
- [Boy in Black Hoodie]
Also, it's going to cause cancer

214
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,896
to everyone.

215
00:09:44,896 --> 00:09:47,179
- But doesn't it cure cancer and stuff?

216
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:50,917
- It has benefits, but more
like some freak accident

217
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:54,121
can happen, like what
happened in Fukushima.

218
00:09:54,121 --> 00:09:55,642
- Or the third mile.

219
00:09:55,642 --> 00:09:56,757
- At the Three Mile?

220
00:09:56,757 --> 00:09:57,976
- Yeah.

221
00:09:57,976 --> 00:10:00,006
(students speak over each other)

222
00:10:00,006 --> 00:10:02,438
- So, say you never know what can happen,

223
00:10:02,438 --> 00:10:03,297
that's the downside.

224
00:10:03,297 --> 00:10:04,737
Because if it does happen,

225
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,582
then it's like downhill from there

226
00:10:06,582 --> 00:10:08,440
because people start getting sick,

227
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,598
then their kids start
dying, and I don't know.

228
00:10:11,598 --> 00:10:15,147
- Yeah, and like Giovanni said, if
we are in an economic crisis,

229
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:17,039
like where are we going to
get the rest of the money?

230
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:17,935
We're just going to get it from debt

231
00:10:17,935 --> 00:10:19,177
and stuff like that.

232
00:10:19,177 --> 00:10:20,871
We're going to help raise it up,

233
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:22,570
but we'll also fall more in debt.

234
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:23,730
- Yeah.

235
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,297
- Going back to the nuclear waste,

236
00:10:28,297 --> 00:10:30,536
can someone elaborate on
why is the nuclear waste

237
00:10:30,536 --> 00:10:32,331
such a problem?

238
00:10:34,298 --> 00:10:35,796
- Because it's just there--

239
00:10:35,796 --> 00:10:36,933
- Kevin?

240
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:39,859
- [Kevin] I think nuclear
waste will cause more

241
00:10:39,859 --> 00:10:41,697
wars and pollution.

242
00:10:41,697 --> 00:10:42,939
That's what I think.

243
00:10:42,939 --> 00:10:43,577
- [Teacher] Cause more what?

244
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:45,538
- [Kevin] It causes
more war and pollution.

245
00:10:45,538 --> 00:10:46,839
- [Multiple] War?

246
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:48,441
- [Kevin] Well, I mean.

247
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:51,762
(students chuckle)

248
00:10:51,762 --> 00:10:53,549
This isn't on camera, right?

249
00:10:53,549 --> 00:10:59,677
(students laugh)

250
00:11:04,396 --> 00:11:07,238
- Okay, someone else?

251
00:11:07,238 --> 00:11:08,992
- Wait, what was the question again?

252
00:11:08,992 --> 00:11:10,850
- Elaborate on what is nuclear waste?

253
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:11,512
- Nuclear waste?

254
00:11:11,512 --> 00:11:13,136
- Why is that such a problem for us?

255
00:11:13,136 --> 00:11:15,377
- Well, it's a problem
because there's nowhere

256
00:11:15,377 --> 00:11:17,653
where you could actually safely put it.

257
00:11:17,653 --> 00:11:20,311
Other than like, I think they have this,

258
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:22,517
I read something about they have an island

259
00:11:22,517 --> 00:11:25,754
where all the waste of nuclear waste goes.

260
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,383
That's the only place that
you can, like, get rid of it.

261
00:11:30,383 --> 00:11:31,642
Don't throw it in the ocean

262
00:11:31,642 --> 00:11:33,299
because it'll contaminate everything.

263
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:34,669
You can't just, like,
leave it in the ground

264
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:36,155
because then it'll probably like leak.

265
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:38,875
- And also, doesn't it, if it rains,

266
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,705
if water gets in it, it's dangerous?

267
00:11:40,705 --> 00:11:41,935
So, that's why they have to find a place

268
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:42,911
where it's not like--

269
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,127
- Why is it dangerous
if water gets into it?

270
00:11:45,127 --> 00:11:47,647
(students speak over each other)

271
00:11:47,647 --> 00:11:49,357
- Soil, I guess?

272
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,517
- [Boy in Black Hoodie]
The waste and the water mix

273
00:11:53,517 --> 00:11:54,992
and then, like, it runs down into the soil

274
00:11:54,992 --> 00:11:58,389
and it might go into
the ocean or the sewers

275
00:11:59,264 --> 00:12:03,596
and it'll mess up the
ocean, or, like, water--

276
00:12:03,596 --> 00:12:05,863
- And we end up drinking it.

277
00:12:05,863 --> 00:12:08,760
- [Boy in Black Hoodie]
And scientists are trying

278
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,470
to find ways to get rid of the waste,

279
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,675
like they're thinking of
shooting it out into space

280
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:14,675
or anything.

281
00:12:14,675 --> 00:12:16,843
(students chatter)

282
00:12:16,843 --> 00:12:19,583
- One thing nobody talked
about was half-life.

283
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,072
What does the half-life have
to do with nuclear waste?

284
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:26,136
- I think a bunch of years.

285
00:12:26,827 --> 00:12:28,934
- [Boy in Black Hoodie] What
does it have to do with Obama?

286
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:33,380
(students murmur)

287
00:12:34,222 --> 00:12:35,781
- Say it louder.

288
00:12:35,781 --> 00:12:36,609
- What?

289
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:37,839
- Say it louder.

290
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:41,681
- We're talking about that noise.

291
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:43,730
(students chuckle)

292
00:12:46,522 --> 00:12:47,729
- Wait, what was your question?

293
00:12:47,729 --> 00:12:50,031
- What does half-life have
to do with nuclear waste?

294
00:12:50,031 --> 00:12:52,307
- Half-life, nuclear waste.

295
00:12:52,307 --> 00:12:53,827
- So, energy?

296
00:12:53,827 --> 00:12:56,171
- So, why is nuclear waste bad exactly?

297
00:12:56,171 --> 00:12:59,362
- Oh, because they haven't
determined the amount of years

298
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,708
of when the half-life is.

299
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:03,779
I think they determined like
10,000 years or something.

300
00:13:06,849 --> 00:13:09,287
So they, so it was an estimate.

301
00:13:09,287 --> 00:13:11,294
It wasn't actually a fact,
they just estimated that,

302
00:13:11,294 --> 00:13:14,910
so it could be before,
so they wouldn't be able

303
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:18,336
to prevent, to prevent it

304
00:13:18,336 --> 00:13:20,632
from affecting society.

305
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:28,751
- Oh, good.

306
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:30,271
So, let's just get this done.

307
00:13:30,271 --> 00:13:31,747
Let's try the next group, okay?

308
00:13:31,747 --> 00:13:33,245
Thank you.

309
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:44,982
(students chattering)

310
00:13:45,655 --> 00:13:46,935
- I know, Bryan.

311
00:13:46,935 --> 00:13:48,073
- I don't need to look it up.

312
00:13:48,073 --> 00:13:49,396
I know this already.

313
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:50,861
- Okay.

314
00:13:53,221 --> 00:13:55,895
Do you guys want to
break before you go up?

315
00:13:58,185 --> 00:13:59,512
Okay, you guys get one or two minutes

316
00:13:59,512 --> 00:14:01,493
to prep yourself.  So it's not a shock

317
00:14:01,493 --> 00:14:25,833
(chattering)

318
00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:28,799
Okay, question number
three, let's come up.

319
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:29,929
People seem anxious, let's do this.

320
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:33,568
(students chattering)

321
00:14:37,403 --> 00:14:39,127
Okay, no phone Diana.

322
00:14:39,127 --> 00:14:43,179
(students chattering)

323
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,626
- We're missing people.

324
00:14:50,626 --> 00:14:52,872
- Yeah, we are.

325
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:58,206
Okay, so people on the outside,

326
00:14:58,206 --> 00:14:59,227
you guys should switch.

327
00:14:59,227 --> 00:15:01,480
So, if you did evidence, you know.

328
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,111
So, what you did one time
evidence, looking for evidence,

329
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,433
and one time you're
looking for vocabulary.

330
00:15:06,433 --> 00:15:08,511
Okay?

331
00:15:08,511 --> 00:15:09,416
So, people on the outside

332
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:12,003
make sure you're checking different parts.

333
00:15:21,733 --> 00:15:24,501
Okay, so what, I might change
the question, you guys.

334
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:25,674
- What?

335
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:26,683
- It happens.

336
00:15:26,683 --> 00:15:28,287
Okay, number three.

337
00:15:28,287 --> 00:15:30,523
What recommendations would
you make to President Obama

338
00:15:30,523 --> 00:15:32,601
regarding clean energy and climate change?

339
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:33,902
So, for example, they're trying to build

340
00:15:33,902 --> 00:15:36,304
two nuclear power plants in Georgia.

341
00:15:36,304 --> 00:15:38,418
So, what recommendations
will you make to him

342
00:15:38,418 --> 00:15:40,635
about building in Georgia?

343
00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:42,922
- Building in jorj-ee-uh?

344
00:15:43,722 --> 00:15:46,506
- Georgia, the state.

345
00:15:46,506 --> 00:15:49,745
- Um, I think he should
make sure that employees

346
00:15:49,745 --> 00:15:51,266
aren't making careless mistakes

347
00:15:51,266 --> 00:15:53,321
such as the human error in the

348
00:15:53,321 --> 00:15:56,206
Three Mile Island.

349
00:16:03,248 --> 00:16:05,093
- [Girl in Black] I think that
he should promote programs

350
00:16:05,093 --> 00:16:09,458
on alternative energy, but
not just nuclear energy.

351
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:13,238
But he could also use nuclear
energy because it could,

352
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,974
because the field cost
and operating cost is low

353
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:19,839
and 20% of our energy already
comes from nuclear energy.

354
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,409
So, we could just get more
energy through nuclear power.

355
00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:27,873
- [Boy in Stripes] I think we
shouldn't use it because of,

356
00:16:27,873 --> 00:16:30,334
it causes harm to people
and you never know

357
00:16:30,334 --> 00:16:31,884
when an accident happens,

358
00:16:31,884 --> 00:16:33,886
and it might hurt the environment

359
00:16:33,886 --> 00:16:35,634
and it leads to cancer.

360
00:16:37,101 --> 00:16:40,166
- Okay, nuclear energy
affects public safety

361
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,791
and it creates,

362
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:45,138
nuclear power plants create toxic waste.

363
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:51,919
- [Boy in Stripes] I would
still try to build a nuclear

364
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,134
power plant because it
could also boost our economy

365
00:16:55,134 --> 00:16:57,602
when it's most struggling.

366
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:00,915
- [Boy in White]
Recommendations I would make

367
00:17:00,915 --> 00:17:03,574
to Obama regarding nuclear energy is that,

368
00:17:03,574 --> 00:17:06,407
to stop because it's
too dangerous to handle,

369
00:17:06,407 --> 00:17:09,587
and that if it gets in
the hands of terrorists,

370
00:17:09,587 --> 00:17:11,747
they can use it to murder,

371
00:17:11,747 --> 00:17:15,126
to murder me or destroy countries.

372
00:17:15,126 --> 00:17:16,774
We can't prevent natural disasters

373
00:17:16,774 --> 00:17:19,793
from destroying nuclear power plants,

374
00:17:19,793 --> 00:17:22,914
then the nuclear radiation,
which is unstable,

375
00:17:22,914 --> 00:17:26,026
can harm by radioactivity,

376
00:17:26,026 --> 00:17:29,805
and a nuclear spill has
happened in the past

377
00:17:29,805 --> 00:17:32,299
with human error that hit Fukushima.

378
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:35,637
And this means that it can
happen to anyone, even us.

379
00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:38,957
That's what I wrote.

380
00:17:40,303 --> 00:17:42,427
- I think it could be a good idea,

381
00:17:42,427 --> 00:17:45,748
but I think they should focus more on

382
00:17:45,748 --> 00:17:47,767
how it could harm people,

383
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:50,879
to try and control the harmfulness

384
00:17:50,879 --> 00:17:52,919
so it won't harm people.

385
00:17:54,187 --> 00:17:56,494
Yeah, I think it's a good idea.

386
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,929
- I think my recommendation
for Obama is that it

387
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:08,431
is not good to (mumbles) nuclear

388
00:18:08,431 --> 00:18:12,579
because it's going to affect us,

389
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:14,988
it's going to affect our pollution.

390
00:18:16,921 --> 00:18:19,845
And he's going to spend
like more energy on that

391
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:22,350
and he can save more money
if he didn't do that.

392
00:18:27,903 --> 00:18:30,979
- Yeah, I agree with Charlie, too.

393
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:33,278
We don't know what nuclear energy

394
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:36,586
could also, like, harm us, which ways.

395
00:18:36,586 --> 00:18:39,279
Or, I mean we do, but I mean, it's better.

396
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:42,924
Like we could just focus
on studying more, like,

397
00:18:42,924 --> 00:18:46,779
having more thoughts.

398
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:49,929
Like, ask him what's better?

399
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:52,355
It's like to choose nuclear plants or

400
00:18:52,355 --> 00:18:55,052
to keep using what we're using now.

401
00:18:56,563 --> 00:18:59,106
- So, I have to change one question.

402
00:18:59,106 --> 00:19:01,589
Based on all the videos and the articles

403
00:19:01,589 --> 00:19:03,308
you guys saw and read,

404
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:07,045
what argument has influenced you the most?

405
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,743
- [Boy in White] The Fukushima argument.

406
00:19:13,743 --> 00:19:15,740
- So, go ahead and explain
it to the group, though.

407
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:19,066
- Because, um,

408
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:20,923
things happen and they just prove to us

409
00:19:20,923 --> 00:19:23,060
that they can also happen to us,

410
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,859
like human error.

411
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:28,585
And I think they made
people evacuate the cities

412
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:32,370
and the damage, the area which is,

413
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,550
nobody can go because it's radioactive,

414
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:39,370
and they have to wait
for the atoms to decay

415
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,923
which is like, I don't know,

416
00:19:43,923 --> 00:19:47,127
thousands of years just for the half-life,

417
00:19:47,127 --> 00:19:51,036
and we won't be able to
use that space anymore.

418
00:19:53,804 --> 00:19:55,857
It kills everything.

419
00:20:00,957 --> 00:20:02,120
People got cancer.
