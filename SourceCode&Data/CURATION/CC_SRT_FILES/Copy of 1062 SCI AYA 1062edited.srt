1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,847
- [Voiceover] How much
bigger is one than the other?

2
00:00:02,847 --> 00:00:05,771
- It’s like a thousand times.

3
00:00:05,771 --> 00:00:07,520
- [Voiceover] It’s like four times.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,142
Wait.

5
00:00:10,142 --> 00:00:14,851
- Those zeros are really
skinny [mumbles]

6
00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:20,683
- Well, they weren’t too bad.

7
00:00:20,683 --> 00:00:22,838
It’s quite a big difference isn’t it?

8
00:00:22,838 --> 00:00:26,317
So, is our picture drawn to scale?

9
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:27,531
- No.

10
00:00:27,531 --> 00:00:29,536
- No. Can we make judgments

11
00:00:29,536 --> 00:00:31,038
on what’s happening

12
00:00:31,038 --> 00:00:32,413
by our picture?

13
00:00:32,413 --> 00:00:33,252
- No.

14
00:00:33,252 --> 00:00:35,630
- [Voiceover] Not unless
its drawn to scale, right?

15
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,441
Rachel, how would we redraw that

16
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:40,779
to make it more in line with our numbers?

17
00:00:40,779 --> 00:00:44,897
- [Rachel mumbles]

18
00:00:44,897 --> 00:00:46,603
- [Voicover] Which side is bigger?

19
00:00:46,603 --> 00:00:50,528
- The one with the negative [mumbles]

20
00:00:50,528 --> 00:00:51,541
- [Voiceover] Okay, so we want

21
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:53,411
to make that three times seven to 
the sixth

22
00:00:53,411 --> 00:00:55,399
minus six much smaller, right?

23
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:56,099
- Yes.

24
00:00:56,099 --> 00:00:57,054
Would you please redraw.

25
00:00:57,054 --> 00:00:59,934
Make it about a fourth of the size.

26
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,356
- [voiceover] I’ll try.

27
00:01:02,356 --> 00:01:06,905
- [Voiceover] You can just do a new one.

28
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:19,204
Don’t forget arrow tips please.

29
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:23,688
Okay. Now does that picture
help us understand why

30
00:01:23,688 --> 00:01:27,261
our hypotenuse is almost
the same as the side?

31
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:29,799
Okay, so, do we use our picture

32
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,505
to make judgments?

33
00:01:31,505 --> 00:01:32,794
- Yeah.

34
00:01:32,794 --> 00:01:36,284
- Okay, only if it's to
scale. Thank you, ma’am.

35
00:01:36,284 --> 00:01:38,014
Okay, Sam. You understand that? Okay.

36
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,913
Alright, now one more
thing we needed to do for the-

37
00:01:40,913 --> 00:01:41,947
Yeah. Go ahead.

38
00:01:41,947 --> 00:01:44,465
- That hypotenuse has got a curve.

39
00:01:44,465 --> 00:01:45,821
[chuckles]

40
00:01:45,821 --> 00:01:48,752
- It’s okay. We’ll make allowances.

41
00:01:48,752 --> 00:01:51,175
He doesn’t have a straight
edge up at the board.

42
00:01:51,175 --> 00:01:53,839
- Okay, Raci, what else
do we have to do here?

43
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:55,173
- [Raci] Find the direction.

44
00:01:55,173 --> 00:01:57,357
- Find the direction. Raci, how would we

45
00:01:57,357 --> 00:01:59,259
go about doing that?

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
[student mumbles]

47
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,588
- [Voiceover] Okay so tangent...

48
00:02:10,887 --> 00:02:12,707
[mumbles]

49
00:02:12,707 --> 00:02:15,269
- No, that’s fine. We can use tangent.

50
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:16,794
Which numbers will we use then?

51
00:02:16,794 --> 00:02:21,170
[mumbles]

52
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:27,065
- Okay. And-

53
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:29,676
- Pardon me?

54
00:02:29,676 --> 00:02:30,998
- Are we trying to find
the hypotenuse right now?

55
00:02:30,998 --> 00:02:32,131
- [Voiceover] No.

56
00:02:33,597 --> 00:02:36,038
- [Voiceover] We, well, yeah, we’re going to.

57
00:02:36,038 --> 00:02:37,487
We just didn’t write it that way.

58
00:02:37,487 --> 00:02:40,874
To solve for Theta we would
do inverse tangent okay?

59
00:02:40,874 --> 00:02:42,285
Now,

60
00:02:42,285 --> 00:02:45,393
what do I tell you always
to do with this? Make sure...

61
00:02:45,393 --> 00:02:47,378
- It’s

62
00:02:47,378 --> 00:02:49,853
in degrees.

63
00:02:49,853 --> 00:02:54,721
- [voiceover] In degrees. A
couple of you had it in radians.

64
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:59,342
- That’s because in
Precal, we [mumbles].

65
00:02:59,342 --> 00:03:01,682
- [voiceover] I understand that, but-

66
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:05,544
So. Okay, now we have the angle. Is that

67
00:03:05,544 --> 00:03:07,879
the angle of the resultant?

68
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,223
- No.

69
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:10,663
- [voiceover] What would you do, Jonah?

70
00:03:10,663 --> 00:03:13,436
- 180.
-Add 180 because?

71
00:03:13,436 --> 00:03:14,846
[mumbles]

72
00:03:14,846 --> 00:03:16,445
It’s in the third quadrant.

73
00:03:16,445 --> 00:03:19,154
Drew would you agree with that?

74
00:03:19,154 --> 00:03:19,732
- Yes.

75
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:22,794
- Because?

76
00:03:22,794 --> 00:03:26,994
- Because the resulting forces can’t--

77
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,671
They can’t, there’s no forces
in the other quadrants,

78
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:34,085
so the resulting force couldn’t possibly

79
00:03:34,085 --> 00:03:35,355
be in another quadrant.

80
00:03:35,355 --> 00:03:40,315
- Okay, but how do we measure that angle?

81
00:03:40,315 --> 00:03:42,853
Counter clockwise from East. Okay good.

82
00:03:42,853 --> 00:03:45,764
Alright. Any questions? Sam?

83
00:03:45,764 --> 00:03:50,414
- Question. I didn’t add the 180,

84
00:03:50,414 --> 00:03:52,875
but then I put my answer as

85
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:55,674
a certain number of degrees southwest.

86
00:03:55,674 --> 00:03:59,095
- That would be fine. So
you can do south of west

87
00:03:59,095 --> 00:04:03,449
also because it defines where
that angle is. Alright?

88
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:07,713
Now, do you guys feel
better about this problem?

89
00:04:07,713 --> 00:04:12,123
Okay. John?

90
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:18,379
- Can you measure that
from? I said it was...

91
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:21,903
I’m pretty sure this is incorrect,
but 12 and a half degrees

92
00:04:21,903 --> 00:04:26,903
west of south. I mean,
now that I realize it's...

93
00:04:27,432 --> 00:04:28,662
- Yes, you could have.

94
00:04:28,662 --> 00:04:30,302
I guess it's technically the same thing.

95
00:04:30,302 --> 00:04:32,393
- It would have been west of
south. Did I mark it wrong?

96
00:04:32,393 --> 00:04:33,181
- Yeah.

97
00:04:33,181 --> 00:04:34,773
- Alright, well just
show it to me later.

98
00:04:34,773 --> 00:04:36,732
I might have just missed that angle there.

99
00:04:36,732 --> 00:04:40,571
Okay. I’ll make that
correction for you, John.

100
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:43,432
Okay. Let’s go on. Jonah?

101
00:04:43,432 --> 00:04:44,862
Jake, thank you.

102
00:04:44,862 --> 00:04:47,854
Jonah, you’re going to
the board for this one.

103
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:49,594
- What should I write?

104
00:04:49,594 --> 00:04:54,212
- We can erase all of number one.

105
00:04:54,212 --> 00:04:58,398
[mumbles]

106
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,702
Taylor, would you please
read the problem for us?

107
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:05,280
- [Taylor] Sure. A proton
accelerates from rest

108
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,512
in a uniform electric field of 640...

109
00:05:09,512 --> 00:05:11,989
What does that say?

110
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:13,792
- Newtons over Coulombs.

111
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:15,746
[crosstalk]

112
00:05:15,894 --> 00:05:17,954
- Okay, let’s stop there for a second.

113
00:05:17,954 --> 00:05:20,224
Hold on. Don’t erase the nanocoulombs.

114
00:05:20,224 --> 00:05:24,372
You see the difference
between an ‘N’ slash ‘C’

115
00:05:24,372 --> 00:05:29,166
and a lower case ‘nc’? Sometimes,

116
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,536
if you’re reading too fast

117
00:05:30,536 --> 00:05:33,298
you are going to mess those
up. I do it myself.

118
00:05:33,298 --> 00:05:36,405
So, always take a good look at the units.

119
00:05:36,405 --> 00:05:38,825
Units help inform you what you have.

120
00:05:38,825 --> 00:05:40,777
Okay, thank you.

121
00:05:40,777 --> 00:05:42,451
- [Taylor] At some later time its speed

122
00:05:42,451 --> 00:05:47,195
is 1.2 times 10
to the second [mumbles].

123
00:05:47,195 --> 00:05:50,408
For A, you have to find the
magnitude of the acceleration

124
00:05:50,408 --> 00:05:54,493
of a proton. For B, how long
does it take the proton

125
00:05:54,493 --> 00:05:59,368
to reach the speed? C, how far
has it moved in an interval?

126
00:05:59,368 --> 00:06:02,228
And D, what is the kinetic
energy at the later time?

127
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:06,814
- Okay so, Connor.
Calling on you again here.

128
00:06:08,954 --> 00:06:12,014
Magnitude of the acceleration.
How would we go about

129
00:06:12,014 --> 00:06:14,755
finding acceleration
normally if I just said,

130
00:06:14,755 --> 00:06:16,462
Connor tell me how to find acceleration?

131
00:06:16,462 --> 00:06:18,927
What’s the first stuff that comes to mind?

132
00:06:18,927 --> 00:06:20,229
- [Connor] ‘f’ equals ‘m’ ‘a’.

133
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:23,372
- ‘f’ equals ‘m’ ‘a’. Okay, or ‘a’ equals-

134
00:06:23,372 --> 00:06:24,738
- [Connor] ‘f’ over ‘m’.

135
00:06:24,738 --> 00:06:26,178
- [voiceover] ‘f’ over ‘m’.

136
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,500
Jonah, ‘a’ equals ‘f’ over ‘m’.

137
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,047
We’re working with a proton.

138
00:06:31,047 --> 00:06:33,668
Mass isn’t given in the problem,

139
00:06:33,668 --> 00:06:36,196
but is that going to be an issue for us?

140
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,003
- No.

141
00:06:37,003 --> 00:06:41,791
- [voiceover] No, because
that’s our table of equations.

142
00:06:43,857 --> 00:06:45,644
So the mass of a proton:

143
00:06:45,644 --> 00:06:49,353
1.67 times 10 to the minus 27 kg.

144
00:06:49,353 --> 00:06:53,845
So, we have that part, but
we don’t have the force.

145
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:59,455
So Rachel, how might we find the force?

146
00:07:00,986 --> 00:07:04,848
- Isn't the 'e' equals 'f' over
'q', so we can use the charge

147
00:07:04,848 --> 00:07:07,587
of the proton to find the [mumbles].

148
00:07:07,587 --> 00:07:10,889
- To find the charge, and what’s e?

149
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,167
- It’s a constant. No,
no, no its not a constant.

150
00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:21,249
Oh, isn’t it the 640 newtons over coulombs, right?

151
00:07:21,596 --> 00:07:24,325
- And what does e represent, Rachel?

152
00:07:24,325 --> 00:07:25,625
- The electric field.

153
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:28,190
- Electric field, good.

154
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,639
So, if we solve this for force,
what is that going to be?

155
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:34,728
F equals-

156
00:07:34,728 --> 00:07:37,894
Okay, you can plug numbers
in first too, that’s good.

157
00:07:37,894 --> 00:07:41,708
- Jonah. Can you slow down
for some of us, please?

158
00:07:44,604 --> 00:07:45,927
- Yeah, Jonah, you’re not supposed

159
00:07:45,927 --> 00:07:48,940
to be looking at your sheet,
so put your sheet down.

160
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,538
What did Jonah just write up there?

161
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:52,799
[mumbles]

162
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:54,183
- Okay, he went too
fast. So let’s back up.

163
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:57,619
- He plugged in the variables.

164
00:07:57,619 --> 00:08:01,696
- He plugged in the
numbers. But do we all know

165
00:08:01,696 --> 00:08:04,364
where that equation came from?

166
00:08:04,364 --> 00:08:05,608
- Green sheet.

167
00:08:05,608 --> 00:08:07,737
- Green sheet. And 'e' is the?

168
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,647
- Electric field.

169
00:08:09,647 --> 00:08:11,001
- Good okay. And 'f'?

170
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:12,510
- Force.

171
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,310
- 'q'.

172
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,406
- The charge of a proton.

173
00:08:15,406 --> 00:08:17,924
- Alright. So, now do you all
know the charge of the proton?

174
00:08:17,924 --> 00:08:21,688
- It’s equal to the charge of an electron.

175
00:08:21,688 --> 00:08:25,838
- Very good, alright now
we can find force, right?

176
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:29,909
What was the force then?

177
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:33,887
- 6.13 times 10 to the 10th?

178
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:37,406
- I got 1.02 times 10 to the ninth.

179
00:08:37,406 --> 00:08:38,526
- That's the acceleration.

180
00:08:38,526 --> 00:08:42,806
- Oh, my bad. Yeah, I
was doing acceleration.

181
00:08:43,616 --> 00:08:47,434
- F equals?

182
00:08:47,434 --> 00:08:50,078
- 1.67.

183
00:08:50,078 --> 00:08:53,291
- 1.024.

184
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:56,012
How did I get this problem right?

185
00:08:56,012 --> 00:08:59,757
Oh, there it is right there.
1.024 x 10 to the negative 16th.

186
00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:03,962
- And that brings up another good point.

187
00:09:03,962 --> 00:09:05,997
Write your work more clearly, right?

188
00:09:05,997 --> 00:09:08,248
Because if you can’t follow your own,

189
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:11,586
how do you expect me or
the AP reader to do that?

190
00:09:11,586 --> 00:09:16,009
So, do yourself a favor.
Make sure its clear.

191
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:20,939
Okay. Where do we go from here, Ann?

192
00:09:20,939 --> 00:09:25,818
Back to a equals f over m.

193
00:09:27,408 --> 00:09:29,933
And we have force and
we have mass now, right?

194
00:09:29,933 --> 00:09:31,288
[mumbles]

195
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:44,793
Okay, now I have led you through
the problem solving steps

196
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:48,385
for number one and number two A.

197
00:09:48,385 --> 00:09:52,316
John, lead your classmates through 2 B.

198
00:09:53,116 --> 00:09:57,809
- Okay. 2 B. You have...

199
00:09:57,809 --> 00:10:00,837
Do you want me to lead the class?

200
00:10:00,837 --> 00:10:02,790
- I want you to ask
questions. Don’t tell us.

201
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:06,367
I want you to ask questions, okay?

202
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,118
- Okay. So, you need to find time.

203
00:10:12,165 --> 00:10:14,345
So, what equation would you use?

204
00:10:14,345 --> 00:10:15,980
- Jonah, stop using the sheet.

205
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,238
- No, I told him he could use it.

206
00:10:17,238 --> 00:10:19,566
- Wouldn’t it be velocity
equals acceleration times time?

207
00:10:19,566 --> 00:10:20,397
- It is.

208
00:10:20,397 --> 00:10:21,114
- Yes.

209
00:10:21,114 --> 00:10:25,183
[mumbles]

210
00:10:32,626 --> 00:10:34,723
- Oh, come on Jonah, don’t...

211
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:38,488
It's actually v o times x,
times t, not x v o times t.

212
00:10:38,488 --> 00:10:40,240
- That’s right.

213
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,466
- Isn’t it v o times t?

214
00:10:42,466 --> 00:10:45,309
- You are thinking of the
equation for displacement.

215
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:47,113
Oh yeah, x times v o.

216
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,213
Well v o is zero because it's from rest.

217
00:10:49,213 --> 00:10:51,870
- Alright, Drew what would you plug in?

218
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,917
[mumbles]

219
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:56,492
The speed that you’re
given at the beginning

220
00:10:56,492 --> 00:11:00,149
of the problem and you
found the acceleration.

221
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:04,765
Oh, the speed is 1.2 x 10 to the sixth,

222
00:11:07,975 --> 00:11:10,074
and then you plug the
acceleration you found

223
00:11:10,074 --> 00:11:14,857
from the previous problem, into
that equation and solve it.

224
00:11:16,613 --> 00:11:21,613
[mumbles]

225
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,750
- So, t equals...

226
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,605
- No, John’s leading.

227
00:11:27,605 --> 00:11:29,612
- Class what does t equal?

228
00:11:29,612 --> 00:11:34,550
- 1.96 times 10 to the negative fifth.

229
00:11:35,756 --> 00:11:37,506
- Negative fifth or negative seven?

230
00:11:37,506 --> 00:11:41,686
- Five.

231
00:11:44,852 --> 00:11:47,532
- Alright, Sam, you lead for part C.

232
00:11:47,532 --> 00:11:49,217
Read part C. You lead.

233
00:11:49,217 --> 00:11:53,103
- Part C. How far has
it moved in the interval?

234
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:55,535
And if you look up to the problem,

235
00:11:55,535 --> 00:11:58,158
nope you don’t have to
look up to the problem.

236
00:11:58,158 --> 00:12:00,677
You look up to number B
which we just did. Number B.

237
00:12:00,677 --> 00:12:04,197
Yes, you do. Number B,
and you look at the time

238
00:12:04,197 --> 00:12:06,403
that we just found, and
that’s going to be the interval.

239
00:12:06,403 --> 00:12:11,055
Thank you, Jonah. So, how
are we gonna find time, Ann?

240
00:12:12,795 --> 00:12:16,946
Or distance? Sorry, distance.

241
00:12:19,216 --> 00:12:20,773
- Why’d you ask me a question?

242
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,118
- You told me to ask you a question.

243
00:12:22,118 --> 00:12:23,317
- No, I didn’t.

244
00:12:23,317 --> 00:12:25,057
- Alright, anyone else know?

245
00:12:25,057 --> 00:12:26,266
Gretchen, you look like you know.

246
00:12:26,266 --> 00:12:30,287
What’s the equation to
find distance in number C?

247
00:12:30,287 --> 00:12:34,198
- Distance equals velocity times time.

248
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:36,768
- Nope. That's not what I got.

249
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:40,671
But, I guess you could do
that. You could do that.

250
00:12:40,671 --> 00:12:41,769
- No, you can’t. You can’t do that.

251
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:43,348
- Why not?

252
00:12:43,348 --> 00:12:46,526
Because I was gonna do
that at first Gretchen,

253
00:12:46,526 --> 00:12:48,660
but then I thought in my head,

254
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,282
that since the object’s accelerating,

255
00:12:51,282 --> 00:12:53,740
the velocity is not going to
be constant throughout

256
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,408
the path of the travel.

257
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,166
I have an equation.

258
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,308
- You have an equation, Ann?

259
00:12:59,308 --> 00:12:59,925
- I do.

260
00:12:59,925 --> 00:13:00,559
- What is it?

261
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:05,158
- How about x equals, x, the original x

262
00:13:05,888 --> 00:13:10,224
plus v o times,

263
00:13:10,224 --> 00:13:13,384
times t

264
00:13:13,384 --> 00:13:17,392
plus one half 'a' 'v' squared.

265
00:13:17,392 --> 00:13:19,734
- So, what do we know
about v o and x o, Ann?

266
00:13:19,734 --> 00:13:21,364
- That they are just zero.

267
00:13:21,364 --> 00:13:23,314
- So what can we do

268
00:13:23,314 --> 00:13:24,964
to both those first parts of the equation?

269
00:13:25,114 --> 00:13:25,979
- Just throw them out the window.

270
00:13:25,979 --> 00:13:28,464
- Drop it like a bad habit.

271
00:13:28,464 --> 00:13:30,322
- Drop it like it's hot.

272
00:13:30,322 --> 00:13:32,985
- So, that would be half times acceleration

273
00:13:32,985 --> 00:13:36,515
times time squared.

274
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:39,790
And conveniently, letter A,

275
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,776
letter A we found the acceleration

276
00:13:42,776 --> 00:13:47,469
which was what, Drew?

277
00:13:47,469 --> 00:13:50,173
- 6.13 x 10 to the 10.

278
00:13:50,173 --> 00:13:51,973
Nice.

279
00:13:51,973 --> 00:13:54,225
½ is just ½

280
00:13:54,225 --> 00:13:58,992
and the time in letter B. What was it

281
00:13:59,902 --> 00:14:01,704
Raci?

282
00:14:01,704 --> 00:14:04,553
- 1.93 times 10 to the negative

283
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:06,403
[mumbles].

284
00:14:06,403 --> 00:14:08,993
- So, if you pound that out on the calc...

285
00:14:08,993 --> 00:14:10,779
- Can we just pound it out?

286
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:13,690
- You cannot just pound
it out because you have to...

287
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,104
- Do what, Miranda?

288
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:18,195
- I don’t know, [mumbles].

289
00:14:18,195 --> 00:14:22,001
- Put the square in there?

290
00:14:23,191 --> 00:14:25,380
- Change back to degrees?

291
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,724
- Oh, you snuck it in.

292
00:14:26,724 --> 00:14:27,918
- Snuck what in?

293
00:14:27,918 --> 00:14:29,017
- The square.

294
00:14:29,017 --> 00:14:30,479
- I don’t think I said
the square. No I didn’t,

295
00:14:30,479 --> 00:14:32,291
but Jonah thank you for
saying the square for me.

296
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,872
Pound that out in sig
fig-wise, what do you get?

297
00:14:34,872 --> 00:14:36,334
- I got 11.8.

298
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,509
- 11.7.

299
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,925
- John.

300
00:14:46,925 --> 00:14:49,613
- If acceleration does matter,

301
00:14:49,613 --> 00:14:54,604
couldn’t you also use the equation ½ v t?

302
00:14:55,964 --> 00:14:57,404
Because I also did that and I got the same.

303
00:14:57,404 --> 00:14:59,326
- D equals one. Write
it on the board, please.

304
00:14:59,326 --> 00:15:00,504
D equals?

305
00:15:00,504 --> 00:15:02,875
What’s d? [mumbles]

306
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,992
I know it works. I just
don't know how it works.

307
00:15:04,992 --> 00:15:06,104
I’m going to tell you in a second.

308
00:15:06,104 --> 00:15:10,273
One half v average times t.

309
00:15:10,273 --> 00:15:13,078
So, why will this also work, then?

310
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,318
Let’s get some of your thoughts. Ann?

311
00:15:15,318 --> 00:15:19,563
- Because if it’s the average,
then it’s looking at the middle

312
00:15:19,563 --> 00:15:24,411
velocity instead of the
top and bottom so you just-

313
00:15:25,374 --> 00:15:26,453
- Wait a minute.

314
00:15:26,453 --> 00:15:29,363
- It’s the average velocity;
and really the equation is

315
00:15:29,363 --> 00:15:31,795
½ the quantity vo plus v times t.

316
00:15:31,795 --> 00:15:34,238
- Yeah, that’s what I wrote down.

317
00:15:34,238 --> 00:15:36,617
- Right and so you take into
account the acceleration

318
00:15:36,617 --> 00:15:38,869
with the change in velocity.

319
00:15:38,869 --> 00:15:41,686
- So, wait a minute. If the
equation is ½ vo plus v?

320
00:15:41,686 --> 00:15:43,392
- Then you just get rid of the ½.

321
00:15:43,392 --> 00:15:44,489
- No.

322
00:15:44,489 --> 00:15:45,567
- Yeah, you do.

323
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:49,300
- ½ v plus vo times t.

324
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:53,875
- ½ the quantity vo plus v.

325
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,295
- Times t would just be v average times t.

326
00:15:56,295 --> 00:15:58,451
- Okay, let’s write the whole equation out.

327
00:15:58,451 --> 00:16:01,452
John, one half

328
00:16:01,452 --> 00:16:02,558
parenthesis

329
00:16:02,558 --> 00:16:05,386
v o plus v end parenthesis t.

330
00:16:05,386 --> 00:16:10,386
- Then isn’t ½ vo plus v just v average?

331
00:16:11,988 --> 00:16:13,759
- So, t equals v average times t.

332
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,486
- Not ½ v average?

333
00:16:15,486 --> 00:16:18,901
[mumbles]

334
00:16:18,901 --> 00:16:19,503
- No.

335
00:16:19,503 --> 00:16:19,944
- Yes.

336
00:16:19,944 --> 00:16:23,752
- But vo plus v divided by 2...

337
00:16:23,752 --> 00:16:25,003
[crosstalk]

338
00:16:25,003 --> 00:16:26,979
- Oh okay. I’m sorry. I see what you mean.

339
00:16:26,979 --> 00:16:29,508
I missed that. Yes, sorry.

340
00:16:29,508 --> 00:16:33,775
But it can’t just be final velocity.

341
00:16:33,775 --> 00:16:36,602
Okay. Is there another
equation we could’ve used?

342
00:16:36,602 --> 00:16:40,318
I saw some of the other ones
on your sheets that worked.

343
00:16:41,657 --> 00:16:46,579
[mumbles]

344
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,762
Anybody in this class have
one of the other ones?

345
00:16:50,762 --> 00:16:51,499
Jonah, did you?

346
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:54,690
- You could do

347
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,771
V squared equals 2 a x.

348
00:16:58,771 --> 00:17:03,226
- [voiceover] So another way,

349
00:17:03,226 --> 00:17:06,314
v squared eqals 2 a x
and solve for x, right?

350
00:17:06,314 --> 00:17:08,009
Good job, so you can see
there’s multiple ways

351
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:10,068
of getting at the same answer, right?

352
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:14,926
And D, letter D.

353
00:17:17,542 --> 00:17:21,164
I'll have Gretchen lead.

354
00:17:21,164 --> 00:17:24,803
- [Gretchen] Letter D is asking
to find the kinetic energy

355
00:17:24,803 --> 00:17:29,230
at the later time. So, what
equation would you use?

356
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,583
Sam?

357
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:35,177
- [Sam] Would it be kinetic
energy equals ½ times the mass

358
00:17:35,177 --> 00:17:37,919
of the object times the
velocity of the object squared?

359
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,919
- Yes. And then if we know
the mass of the object

360
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:49,347
of the proton from the
first equation and that was?

361
00:17:50,459 --> 00:17:53,795
- 1.67 x 10 -27 kilograms.

362
00:17:56,958 --> 00:18:01,760
- Thank you for using the unit.

363
00:18:03,905 --> 00:18:07,638
- And then we found
the velocity in letter...

364
00:18:08,638 --> 00:18:09,750
- Given.

365
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:14,287
- Or it was given, right.
So 1.2 x 10 to the 6th...

366
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,984
- Meters per second.

367
00:18:19,984 --> 00:18:22,522
- Thank you.

368
00:18:22,522 --> 00:18:24,332
- Squared.

369
00:18:24,332 --> 00:18:27,910
- And then you can just plug
that into your calculator.

370
00:18:29,185 --> 00:18:33,089
- Sig figs 1.2 times 10
to the negative 15th gs

371
00:18:33,089 --> 00:18:35,563
or kilogram meters per second.

372
00:18:35,563 --> 00:18:39,271
- [voiceover] Meters
squared over seconds squared.

373
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,195
Don’t forget you have to square the units.

374
00:18:41,195 --> 00:18:43,760
- Kilogram meters squared
over seconds squared?

375
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,509
- Kilograms meters squared
over seconds squared. Yeah.

376
00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:48,406
- What is kilogram meters per second?

377
00:18:48,406 --> 00:18:50,307
- You have to convert the meters.

378
00:18:50,307 --> 00:18:52,046
- I could have sworn
kilogram meters per second

379
00:18:52,046 --> 00:18:53,046
was something.

380
00:18:53,046 --> 00:18:55,419
- Oh, momentum.

381
00:18:55,419 --> 00:18:57,251
- That’s not what we’re
looking for though, right?

382
00:18:57,251 --> 00:18:59,250
- No, it’s not. No, we’re good.

383
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,799
- Okay, now. Better understanding?

384
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:02,812
- Yes.

385
00:19:02,812 --> 00:19:04,086
- You gotta stay on top of stuff.

386
00:19:04,086 --> 00:19:06,367
You can’t let those
distractions get to you. Okay.

387
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,552
Pass your quizzes to the front face down.

388
00:19:08,552 --> 00:19:10,696
I’ll put them in your files for you.

389
00:19:10,696 --> 00:19:12,488
- Do you want to see [mumbles]?

390
00:19:12,488 --> 00:19:14,621
- I’ll take yours separate.

391
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:17,426
- Are we allowed to retake them?

392
00:19:18,426 --> 00:19:19,720
- Pardon me?

393
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,607
- Can we retake them?

394
00:19:21,607 --> 00:19:23,987
- Sure. Thank you.

395
00:19:23,987 --> 00:19:28,204
[mumbles]

396
00:19:28,204 --> 00:19:29,830
- You gave me a minus six.

397
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,624
- Well...

398
00:19:31,624 --> 00:19:32,976
- I had everything

399
00:19:32,976 --> 00:19:37,976
[mumbles].

400
00:19:39,258 --> 00:19:43,615
- Okay now, we are starting
the next chapter today,

401
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:47,141
so I have some handouts to give to you.

402
00:19:47,141 --> 00:19:51,903
[mumbles]

403
00:19:53,988 --> 00:19:55,962
- Do we have till this Friday
to retake the last test?

404
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:58,554
- Yeah, and quarter ends on Friday,

405
00:19:58,554 --> 00:20:00,128
so anything you guys need...
