1
00:00:00,063 --> 00:00:04,289
(Background Chatter)

2
00:00:06,164 --> 00:00:09,524
- [Boy in black shirt] I think that Igneous and Metamorphic,

3
00:00:09,524 --> 00:00:13,357
they're the least (Backgroud Chatter), there are two books

4
00:00:13,357 --> 00:00:17,380
that don't use 'em
'cause they're (Background Chatter).

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,081
- [Student] Well my Igneous (Background Chatter).

6
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:25,465
- [Boy in black shirt] Yeah, it (Background Chatter).

7
00:00:25,465 --> 00:00:29,281
Igneous and Metamorphic
cool off and react.

8
00:00:30,491 --> 00:00:35,491
And only a few particles came
off, but I was (Background Chatter).

9
00:00:35,817 --> 00:00:37,227
- [Girl in yellow] Yeah, it's
just awkward because

10
00:00:37,227 --> 00:00:40,348
mine was, boosting most of yours.

11
00:00:40,348 --> 00:00:41,499
- [Boy in black] Well yeah.

12
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:46,733
- [Girl in yellow] When I did my alien, on my
first try, it was 42 grade.

13
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:50,839
Then now when I'm measuring
it again, it was 22 grade.

14
00:00:50,839 --> 00:00:52,447
It (Background Chatter).

15
00:00:52,447 --> 00:00:54,259
- [Girl in gray] Mine never changed, all it did was lost

16
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:56,741
a little bit of it's rice crispies.

17
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:58,119
- [Girl in yellow] That was mine.

18
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:02,907
But, I feel like Igneous
rock, (Background Chatter) like, 20.

19
00:01:02,907 --> 00:01:04,095
- [Girl in gray] Well yeah.

20
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,690
'Cause the weathering does a lot of things

21
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,907
to the rock's outside.

22
00:01:09,907 --> 00:01:11,028
And--

23
00:01:11,398 --> 00:01:15,098
- [Girl in purple] Mine was the same as Igneous
and metamorphic (Background Chatter).

24
00:01:16,428 --> 00:01:18,572
- [Girl in yellow] And so, if I'd shake it...

25
00:01:19,274 --> 00:01:23,756
like through weathering, a
bunch of rock would fall off.

26
00:01:29,946 --> 00:01:31,582
- [Girl in gray] I haven't done anything yet.

27
00:01:35,492 --> 00:01:37,164
It was three.

28
00:01:39,595 --> 00:01:41,390
I can't wait to--
- [Voiceover] Oh.

29
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,274
(Background Chatter)

30
00:01:49,014 --> 00:01:51,987
- [Girl in gray] I have to say, the one
with the marshmallows

31
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:53,540
'cause it's (Background Chatter).

32
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,822
- [Voiceover] Well for my
Sedimentary, it was harder.

33
00:01:55,822 --> 00:01:56,924
- [Voiceover] Yeah, mine too.

34
00:01:56,924 --> 00:01:59,318
- [Voiceover] What (Background Chatter)

35
00:01:59,318 --> 00:02:00,042
(Background Chatter)

36
00:02:00,042 --> 00:02:02,747
- [Boy in black shirt] 'Cause when I
did mine, only one piece of my

37
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:06,101
Sedimentary broke apart, and--

38
00:02:06,101 --> 00:02:07,846
- [Girl in purple] The Sedimentary--
- [Girl in yellow] My Igneous rock--

39
00:02:07,846 --> 00:02:12,846
- [Girl in purple] It has, like almost (Background Chatter).

40
00:02:16,181 --> 00:02:17,819
- [Boy in black shirt] It might be a
little inaccurate since these

41
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:20,477
are not real Sedimentary rocks.

42
00:02:20,477 --> 00:02:21,882
You have to keep that in mind.

43
00:02:21,882 --> 00:02:23,136
- [Girl in purple] Well yeah.

44
00:02:23,136 --> 00:02:26,825
- [Girl in gray] So, but what if
they were real Sedimentary?

45
00:02:26,825 --> 00:02:30,085
Would we be able to tell what they are?

46
00:02:30,085 --> 00:02:32,502
- [Girl in yellow] Yeah.
- [Girl in purple] Obviously.

47
00:02:32,502 --> 00:02:34,239
- [Boy in black shirt] Do you know
any Sedimentary rocks

48
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,155
that looks like a granola bar?

49
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:39,612
- [Girl in gray] Yes, I saw them in my yard.

50
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:41,893
They're called a granola ball.

51
00:02:41,893 --> 00:02:42,671
- [Voiceover] No.

52
00:02:43,941 --> 00:02:47,322
- [Boy in black shirt] That was probably granite,
which is an Igneous rock.

53
00:02:47,322 --> 00:02:50,901
- [Girl in purple] For Jeanie, do
we write just how many lasts?

54
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:53,861
'Cause mine must've had (Background Chatter).

55
00:02:54,501 --> 00:02:57,683
- [Girl in gray] Okay so when I, when
I did the blendering,

56
00:02:57,683 --> 00:03:01,224
of my Sedimentary, I lost only three grams

57
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:06,181
off of my, Sedimentary rock.

58
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:14,203
So I'm not sure what would
happen if I add these two.

59
00:03:14,203 --> 00:03:17,825
(Background Chatter)

60
00:03:19,485 --> 00:03:21,833
- [Girl in gray] Because of the heat out of the,

61
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:25,246
'cause if you were to
put heat to a rock like

62
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:30,246
our little blue Metamorphic rocks,

63
00:03:30,307 --> 00:03:34,034
what would happen was
the heat would melt it,

64
00:03:34,034 --> 00:03:37,179
and it would give pressure
to stick down to the tinfoil.

65
00:03:37,179 --> 00:03:38,352
- [Boy in black shirt] Yeah,
that's how that happens.

66
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:42,071
(Background chatter)
because this is probably

67
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:45,668
the farthest off we have
from a little while.

68
00:03:45,668 --> 00:03:46,376
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

69
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:49,871
- [Boy in black shirt] Like last
we (Background Chatter), and like

70
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:54,871
have you ever heard of
a rock that's called

71
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,454
(Background Chatter) Metamorphic rock?
- [Girl in yellow] Yeah.

72
00:03:58,454 --> 00:03:59,675
- [Girl in purple] It can be greasy.

73
00:03:59,675 --> 00:04:01,625
- [Teacher] Let's talk about why we use the models.

74
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:04,766
Obviously, you're never gonna
be so lucky as come across a

75
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:06,606
rock that's like the taffy.

76
00:04:06,606 --> 00:04:09,718
Why did we use the Laffy
Taffy for our model?

77
00:04:09,718 --> 00:04:12,841
- (Girl in yellow) Because the heat and the pressure,

78
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:14,604
the heat and the pressure would like

79
00:04:14,604 --> 00:04:17,686
stick together, but
like a Sedimentary rock,

80
00:04:17,686 --> 00:04:21,405
(Background Chatter).

81
00:04:21,405 --> 00:04:23,965
- [Teacher] We use our fingers to
add that heat pressure.

82
00:04:23,965 --> 00:04:25,532
We had to simulate it somehow,

83
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:28,225
we couldn't do the actual
Earth process in the classroom.

84
00:04:28,225 --> 00:04:29,627
Do you agree with that?
- [Students] Mm hmm.

85
00:04:29,627 --> 00:04:32,607
- [Teacher] Okay, so you understand
why, you understand why

86
00:04:32,607 --> 00:04:34,452
we use that material for our model?

87
00:04:34,452 --> 00:04:35,811
Okay.

88
00:04:35,811 --> 00:04:39,746
- [Boy in black shirt] (Background Chatter)

89
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,325
- [Teacher] Right, it probably melts.

90
00:04:41,325 --> 00:04:43,948
And why did we use the
microwave for the Igneous rock?

91
00:04:43,948 --> 00:04:44,902
- [Boy in black] Because--
- [Teacher] What were we

92
00:04:44,902 --> 00:04:46,295
trying to simulate there?

93
00:04:46,295 --> 00:04:48,334
(Background Chatter)
- [Teacher] From?

94
00:04:49,904 --> 00:04:52,171
- [Boby in black] Magma is a really hot substance,

95
00:04:52,171 --> 00:04:55,483
and this is what Igneous
rocks can form from.

96
00:04:55,483 --> 00:04:57,782
- [Teacher] Could we actually
manipulate and touch magma

97
00:04:57,782 --> 00:04:58,722
in the classroom?

98
00:04:58,722 --> 00:04:59,622
- [Boy in black shirt] No.
- [Teacher] No.

99
00:04:59,622 --> 00:05:01,780
Could we work a marshmallow?
- [Boy in black shirt] Yep.

100
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,727
- [Teacher] So we understand
the connection there.

101
00:05:03,727 --> 00:05:05,578
We're trying to use materials,

102
00:05:05,578 --> 00:05:07,372
that we can bring into the classroom,

103
00:05:07,372 --> 00:05:11,470
but that will still simulate
lava, magma, the processes.

104
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,818
Okay? So pressure--

105
00:05:16,188 --> 00:05:21,188
- [Girl in purple] I think it has less
effect of all the (Background Chatter).

106
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:24,056
- [Teacher] It had a lesser effect going through

107
00:05:24,056 --> 00:05:27,991
the processes of?
- [Girl in purple] Of both.

108
00:05:27,991 --> 00:05:29,616
- [Teacher] Weathering?
- [Girl in gray] And erosion.

109
00:05:29,616 --> 00:05:31,056
- [Teacher] And erosion, okay.

110
00:05:31,056 --> 00:05:32,670
Now you guys can think about this,

111
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,198
if you didn't like the
samples and examples up here

112
00:05:34,198 --> 00:05:36,539
that I used, you could
always do it different.

113
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:38,923
Food material.

114
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:41,268
To make up your own experiment later.

115
00:05:41,838 --> 00:05:42,477
Okay?

116
00:05:42,477 --> 00:05:54,230
(Background Chatter)

117
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:56,037
[Teacher] Let's talk for a moment.

118
00:05:56,037 --> 00:05:58,313
Why should we measure again
after our rock samples

119
00:05:58,313 --> 00:06:00,494
have been through weathering and erosion?

120
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:02,596
Why are we measuring again?

121
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:06,671
- [Boy in yellow](Background Chatter)

122
00:06:08,881 --> 00:06:10,722
- [Teacher] Look at your rock samples,
do they look the same

123
00:06:10,722 --> 00:06:12,084
as what we measured in here?

124
00:06:12,084 --> 00:06:13,299
- [Boy in yelow] No.
- [Teacher] No.

125
00:06:13,299 --> 00:06:14,277
What happened?

126
00:06:14,277 --> 00:06:16,255
- [Boy in yellow] You have to measure the difference.

127
00:06:16,255 --> 00:06:18,206
- [Teacher] The difference, and why
would there be a difference?

128
00:06:18,206 --> 00:06:19,948
What could we do to our rock samples?

129
00:06:19,948 --> 00:06:24,479
- [Boy in yellow] (Background Chatter)

130
00:06:28,739 --> 00:06:31,861
- [Teacher] Changed dramatically when you
did the weathering on them.

131
00:06:31,861 --> 00:06:41,256
(Background Chatter)

132
00:06:42,105 --> 00:06:44,357
- [Teacher] Let's use the same
(Background Chatter), what did you use

133
00:06:44,357 --> 00:06:46,045
when you pre-measured?

134
00:06:46,045 --> 00:06:47,422
I would keep it the same.

135
00:06:47,422 --> 00:06:48,808
Why would I keep it the same?

136
00:06:49,498 --> 00:06:53,457
- [Boy in yellow] Because it's (Background Chatter).

137
00:06:54,725 --> 00:06:58,030
- [Teacher] Can we compare
centimeters to inches?

138
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,727
- [Boy in yellow] Yes.
- [Teacher] You can?

139
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:05,333
Think about that, because later
when you have to come back

140
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,060
and do the difference, how are
you gonna do the difference

141
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,731
with some centimeters and some inches?

142
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:15,416
(Background Chatter)

143
00:07:17,903 --> 00:07:21,173
- [Teacher] How can you compare those two measurements?

144
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:23,434
- [Boy in yellow] (Background Chatter)

145
00:07:23,434 --> 00:07:24,864
- [Teacher] You're telling me, you wanna go centimeters here,

146
00:07:24,864 --> 00:07:26,013
but inches down here.

147
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:29,565
-[Boy in yellow] (Background Chatter)

148
00:07:30,755 --> 00:07:32,104
- [Teacher] I would keep it the same.

149
00:07:32,104 --> 00:07:34,952
They would make it
mathematically (Background Chatter).

150
00:07:34,952 --> 00:07:39,498
(Background Chatter)

151
00:07:41,781 --> 00:07:43,171
- [Teacher] You working on your difference?

152
00:07:44,471 --> 00:07:46,808
Your difference in mass?

153
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,332
This your pre-mass?

154
00:07:51,693 --> 00:07:53,158
- [Student] (coughing)

155
00:07:54,318 --> 00:07:55,755
- [Teacher] Explain to me how you got to that.

156
00:07:55,755 --> 00:07:57,265
- [Girl in purple] Where are the books?

157
00:07:57,265 --> 00:07:58,573
They might add on to another

158
00:07:58,573 --> 00:08:01,639
sedimentary rock, 'cause
it's like never ending.

159
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:05,620
- [Girl in yellow] For some reason, my
Sedimentary and my Igneous rock.

160
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,695
They both lost a half inch in length.

161
00:08:08,695 --> 00:08:09,900
- [Boy in black] Yeah, mine too.

162
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:16,740
- [Girl in yellow] In my igneous rock
grams, it lost 20 grams

163
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:19,789
and my sedimentary lost 10 grams.

164
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:21,507
- [Girl in purple] Mine lost no grams.

165
00:08:21,507 --> 00:08:24,010
- [Girl in gray] Mine gained grams.

166
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,077
- [Girl in yellow] Your gained grams?
- [Girl in gray] Yeah, I had 17 grams.


167
00:08:31,537 --> 00:08:35,173
I had 17 grams, and
then it came back to 21.

168
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:40,355
And this one went up one.

169
00:08:40,355 --> 00:08:42,995
Because when this one went up three.

170
00:08:42,995 --> 00:08:44,493
- [Girl in purple] Maybe you should check that over.

171
00:08:44,493 --> 00:08:49,288
'Cause it weathers and erodes away.

172
00:08:52,968 --> 00:08:56,728
- [Girl in gray] Well, I'm guessing that most
of the bits and pieces of the

173
00:08:56,728 --> 00:09:01,093
other people's stuff, went
into mine, and made it bigger.

174
00:09:02,073 --> 00:09:04,194
'Cause, it can do that, it can.

175
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,222
See? Right there.

176
00:09:08,222 --> 00:09:11,101
All around the--
- [Girl in purple] Oh! I see it!

177
00:09:11,101 --> 00:09:13,984
- [Girl in gray] See? Other bits and
pieces of other people's

178
00:09:13,984 --> 00:09:16,384
went into mine, and made mine bigger.

179
00:09:16,384 --> 00:09:20,778
(Background Chatter)

180
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:24,662
- [Girl in yellow] With mine, a bunch of bits
and pieces (Background Chatter).

181
00:09:24,662 --> 00:09:26,537
- [Girl in purple] And mine started to melt.

182
00:09:29,767 --> 00:09:32,624
- [Teacher] Because your
observations say it crumbles apart,

183
00:09:32,624 --> 00:09:34,677
it's breaking apart and moving.

184
00:09:37,437 --> 00:09:40,484
- [Boy in yellow] (Background Chatter)

185
00:09:40,484 --> 00:09:42,805
- [Teacher] Okay, what about these gaps here.

186
00:09:42,805 --> 00:09:44,057
- [Boy in yellow] These gaps?

187
00:09:44,057 --> 00:09:45,534
- [Teacher] Yeah, how you gonna do that?

188
00:09:49,474 --> 00:10:53,897
(Heavy Background Chatter)

189
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:59,612
- [Girl in gray] For some reason,
my Igneous rock (Background Chatter).

190
00:11:01,532 --> 00:11:06,204
(Background Chatter)

191
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,464
- [Teacher] Into the sample?

192
00:11:19,464 --> 00:11:20,984
- [Girl in gray] It made it bigger.

193
00:11:20,984 --> 00:11:22,203
- [Teacher] Made it heavier?

194
00:11:22,203 --> 00:11:24,519
Did it have more mass after the (Background Chatter)?

195
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,748
Your protective sleeve's coming off.

196
00:11:26,748 --> 00:11:28,270
That's a good possibility, that might

197
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,697
throw your measurements off.

198
00:11:29,697 --> 00:11:30,820
Did it happen to anything else?

199
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,973
Any other sample?

200
00:11:33,843 --> 00:11:36,234
Now you're working on a difference in...?

201
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:38,961
You gotta find the difference
in length and width,

202
00:11:38,961 --> 00:11:41,410
and you're gonna find
the difference in mass.

203
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,136
That's interesting, you could
explain that away right there.

204
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:47,619
Mm hmm, isn't that the one,
Igneous, the one you were saying

205
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:49,177
got the strange results?

206
00:11:49,177 --> 00:11:50,302
You can talk to me then.

207
00:11:51,822 --> 00:12:00,056
(Background Chatter)

208
00:12:02,645 --> 00:12:05,752
- [Girl in gray] Well, that's probably how
they make the canyons bigger.

209
00:12:06,712 --> 00:12:08,655
Maybe because some of the rocks,

210
00:12:08,655 --> 00:12:13,132
after rain and the sandstorms, they could

211
00:12:14,202 --> 00:12:16,862
just pound together and
make a big old rock.

212
00:12:17,672 --> 00:12:18,625
So...

213
00:12:24,632 --> 00:12:28,312
Okay, so if it erodes off another rock--

214
00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:31,046
- [Teacher] I'm listening, are you
talking about real life

215
00:12:31,046 --> 00:12:33,949
rocks when they really--erode away

216
00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:34,611
Mmhmm.

217
00:12:34,611 --> 00:12:37,538
- [Girl in gray] And it starts to rain,
'cause a lot of times

218
00:12:37,538 --> 00:12:39,674
it's like wind and rain.

219
00:12:39,674 --> 00:12:44,573
A lot of times it takes the
sand away from the rain,

220
00:12:44,573 --> 00:12:46,941
with the rain, and here's another rock,

221
00:12:46,941 --> 00:12:48,394
which makes a bigger.

222
00:12:49,484 --> 00:12:52,740
- [Teacher] You're thinking sometimes with real life
rocks, you could have actual

223
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,810
sediment mixing in with igneous rocks?

224
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,365
Right, do you remember how we talked about

225
00:12:57,365 --> 00:13:00,087
how igneous can morph
back into sedimentary?

226
00:13:00,087 --> 00:13:03,804
Those bits and pieces are
melding with igneous rock

227
00:13:03,804 --> 00:13:05,845
when you have that blend, where igneous

228
00:13:05,845 --> 00:13:09,307
is morphing into sedimentary rock, okay?

229
00:13:09,307 --> 00:13:11,589
So that would also cause
reason for your measurements

230
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:13,470
(Background Chatter)

231
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,174
I like where you're going with that.

232
00:13:16,174 --> 00:13:20,314
(Background Chatter)

233
00:13:21,004 --> 00:13:22,907
Try to make that connection.

234
00:13:22,907 --> 00:13:25,369
You know, Unis was giving me
a hard time earlier about how

235
00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:27,923
'metamorphic rock's not made of Laffy Taffy.

236
00:13:27,923 --> 00:13:32,822
So how's this go back
to rocks in real life'?

237
00:13:32,822 --> 00:13:34,423
Think about that.

238
00:13:34,423 --> 00:13:48,835
(Heavy Background Chatter)

239
00:13:51,855 --> 00:13:53,779
- [Teacher] Some of our videos that we were watching?

240
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:57,238
About what salts quartz
in these two processes.

241
00:13:57,238 --> 00:14:01,366
(Heavy Background Chatter)

242
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,519
- [Teacher] You have to let the water go down.

243
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:08,019
- [Girl in gray] 'Cause the heat inside
of it could've frozen.

244
00:14:08,469 --> 00:14:12,477
'Cause they heat over there,
we had it kinda (Background Chatter).

245
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:13,920
(Heavy Background Chatter)

246
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,718
- [Student] Whoa, what's the answer?

247
00:14:16,718 --> 00:14:21,008
(Heavy Background Chatter)

248
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:29,342
- [Boy in red] 19 grams.
- [Boy in gray] 19.

249
00:14:29,342 --> 00:14:30,793
- [Teacher] --Igneous--

250
00:14:30,793 --> 00:14:34,991
(Heavy Background Chatter)

251
00:14:36,319 --> 00:14:40,133
(Background Chatter)

252
00:14:44,247 --> 00:14:45,693
- [Boy in gray] Igneous!

253
00:14:53,766 --> 00:14:55,060
- [Teacher] How could you make that?

254
00:14:58,203 --> 00:15:01,188
Explain it to your
little sister (Background Chatter).

255
00:15:01,738 --> 00:15:04,210
She's not gonna be able to
understand that, she wasn't here.

256
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,796
What could you put on
your rock cycle diagram?

257
00:15:06,796 --> 00:15:10,431
- [Boy in black](Background Chatter)
- [Teacher] Okay.

258
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:13,244
So you're gonna have (Background Chatter).

259
00:15:13,244 --> 00:15:15,072
- [Boy in red] This is 17.

260
00:15:15,642 --> 00:15:19,115
- [Boy in gray] 17 for what? Igneous?

261
00:15:22,465 --> 00:15:24,791
What about sedimentary?

262
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:32,500
(Background Chatter)

263
00:15:35,997 --> 00:15:37,561
- [Teacher] Tell me how Sean needs help.

264
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,362
- [Boy in yellow] Um, he needs help with (Background Chatter)

265
00:15:39,362 --> 00:15:40,359
- [Teacher] Okay.

266
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:42,415
(Background Chatter) where he's
trying to find the mass of

267
00:15:42,415 --> 00:15:44,377
the sedimentary rock.

268
00:15:46,537 --> 00:15:47,538
- [Girl in gray] What do ya mean?

269
00:15:47,538 --> 00:15:50,572
- [Girl in purple] No, I was saying that
it may have gotten darker.

270
00:15:50,572 --> 00:15:51,988
- [Girl in gray] Darker, because of the heat.

271
00:15:51,988 --> 00:15:53,923
- [Girl in purple] Yeah.

272
00:15:53,923 --> 00:15:54,805
- [Girl in gray] A lot of rocks do that.
- [Girl in purple] Yeah.

273
00:15:54,805 --> 00:15:56,603
- [Girl in gray] But it could be jus the pink.

274
00:15:56,603 --> 00:16:00,621
- [Girl in purple] Yeah, it could be, I could
write down that, it could be pink.

275
00:16:02,701 --> 00:16:04,950
- [Girl in gray] Yeah, what happened to my 
metamorphic rock, is (Background Chatter).

276
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:07,480
- [Girl in purple] I can (Background Chatter)

277
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,871
- [Girl in gray] Yeah that's because of this thing.

278
00:16:10,871 --> 00:16:12,253
- [Teacher] (Background Chatter)
in between our finger

279
00:16:12,253 --> 00:16:13,899
and (Background Chatter)

280
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:16,293
- [Girl in yellow] Mine, it didn't get
darker than mine though.

281
00:16:16,293 --> 00:16:19,740
(Background Chatter)

282
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,234
- [Girl in purple] So you could add
that to what you put in (Background Chatter).

283
00:16:27,234 --> 00:16:29,353
- [Teacher] So how would
that affect our measurements?

284
00:16:30,913 --> 00:16:32,226
How did it affect your width?

285
00:16:33,236 --> 00:16:48,904
(Heavy Background Chatter)

286
00:16:49,704 --> 00:16:54,531
- [Girl in gray] Igneous and
sedimentary rock could (Background Chatter).

287
00:16:55,831 --> 00:16:57,579
- [Teacher, offscreen] Now talk
to me though, if it's in

288
00:16:57,579 --> 00:17:01,712
(Background Chatter)

289
00:17:01,712 --> 00:17:12,903
(Heavy Background Chatter)

290
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,645
- [Girl in gray] You wanna know why those are
there? Because a lot of rocks

291
00:17:15,645 --> 00:17:18,457
don't have protection
that doesn't help them.

292
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:21,856
And a lot of kids drop theirs

293
00:17:21,856 --> 00:17:25,338
inside their bag, which
mixed with the Sedimentary.

294
00:17:25,338 --> 00:17:26,857
- [Girl in purple] It could (Background Chatter).

295
00:17:26,857 --> 00:17:29,664
- [Girl in gray] And sooner or
later if it just stays in there

296
00:17:29,664 --> 00:17:32,834
and rolls around, guess what it would do?

297
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:34,889
It would also become a sedimentary.

298
00:17:38,269 --> 00:17:40,512
- [Girl in purple] It's just like the rocks,

299
00:17:40,512 --> 00:17:42,507
it's just like the rocks in life

300
00:17:42,507 --> 00:17:44,704
It's more similar to real life.

301
00:17:44,704 --> 00:17:49,704
(Background Chatter)
- [Girl in gray] Yeah!

302
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:59,632
(Background Chatter)

303
00:18:01,256 --> 00:18:03,403
- [Girl in gray] The eroded bits would
stick to other rocks.

304
00:18:03,403 --> 00:18:06,909
- [Girl in purple] So I just added, like bits.

305
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:20,053
(Background Chatter)

306
00:18:20,063 --> 00:18:21,513
- [Boy in black shirt] We have bits and pieces.

307
00:18:21,513 --> 00:18:23,475
- [Girl in gray] See, if I
was to shove this in my bag

308
00:18:23,475 --> 00:18:25,588
and just roll it around in all of this,

309
00:18:25,588 --> 00:18:29,547
this would also become this,
because this isn't on the mat.

310
00:18:29,547 --> 00:18:31,985
This would begin to stick.

311
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:35,505
And when you ball it
together, it makes it appear

312
00:18:35,505 --> 00:18:38,857
coloring to it, that show
that it's inside there.

313
00:18:38,857 --> 00:18:41,957
- [Girl in purple] I think that the igneous
and the metamorphic rock,

314
00:18:41,957 --> 00:18:45,683
(Background Chatter)

315
00:18:45,683 --> 00:18:54,172
(Background Chatter)

316
00:18:54,992 --> 00:18:58,123
- [Boy in gray] After each sample, ones that
were weathering and erosion.

317
00:18:58,123 --> 00:18:59,678
- [Teacher] So you're gonna compare
your two measurements--

318
00:18:59,678 --> 00:19:01,326
pre-measurement, post-measurement--

319
00:19:01,326 --> 00:19:03,521
to see if there's a
difference for each rock.

320
00:19:03,521 --> 00:19:05,262
- [Boy in gray] Hmm.

321
00:19:05,262 --> 00:19:07,796
- [Teacher] Hmm.
- [Boy in gray] Do we have to subtract?

322
00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:10,071
- [Teacher] Do we? What's your key word that could

323
00:19:10,071 --> 00:19:13,615
tell you what to do? Difference?

324
00:19:13,615 --> 00:19:25,097
(Background Chatter)

325
00:19:28,537 --> 00:19:30,210
- [Teacher] Go show me, I know you're thinking.

326
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,622
You just told me, what key
word tells you what to do?

327
00:19:34,622 --> 00:19:38,255
(Background Chatter)

328
00:19:39,515 --> 00:19:40,655
- [Teacher] Where were we?

329
00:19:41,402 --> 00:19:42,983
Finding the mass?

330
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:44,817
After we've done the
weathering and erosion?

331
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:46,836
Okay, are you gonna get started?

332
00:19:46,836 --> 00:19:48,218
- [Student] Yes.
- [Teacher] Yes.

333
00:19:48,218 --> 00:19:50,332
Jack, are you finished with that scale?

334
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:52,533
Can we use manners, please?

335
00:19:52,863 --> 00:19:54,180
Can we use manners?

336
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,560
Can you say please pass the balance?

337
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,827
(Background Chatter)

338
00:20:03,985 --> 00:20:06,358
- [Teacher] Talk to me guys, just for a
moment, about the differences

339
00:20:06,358 --> 00:20:09,481
in those, in your (Background Chatter).

340
00:20:11,271 --> 00:20:13,544
We've got Ashley's igneous,
we talked about that.

341
00:20:14,494 --> 00:20:16,354
- [Girl in purple] I figured out
for the metamorphic that

342
00:20:16,354 --> 00:20:19,233
changes did actually
happen, because they put

343
00:20:19,233 --> 00:20:22,646
the sedimentary, came
on to the metamorphic.

344
00:20:22,646 --> 00:20:24,456
- [Teacher] So we can
see again, how, just,

345
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,210
and it probably had a lot
to do with our service

346
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:29,093
and our bag, that's how
those pieces of sediment

347
00:20:29,743 --> 00:20:31,572
got attached to our metamorphic rock.

348
00:20:31,572 --> 00:20:36,239
- [Girl in purple] And I think it became darker
because the heat (Background Chatter) because of the pink.

349
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:38,422
- [Teacher] And because of the pink?
- [Girl in purple] Yeah.

350
00:20:39,182 --> 00:20:41,371
- [Teacher] Okay, think about in
real life sedimentary rock,

351
00:20:41,371 --> 00:20:44,297
when those levels, when those
layers are smashed together.

352
00:20:44,297 --> 00:20:46,867
Okay, don't some of those
layers change the color

353
00:20:46,867 --> 00:20:48,429
with all that heat and pressure?

354
00:20:49,899 --> 00:20:52,063
Okay, that was your metamorphic.

355
00:20:52,063 --> 00:20:53,562
Yes Brooke.
- [Girl in yellow] And also,

356
00:20:53,562 --> 00:20:56,417
you get the igneous in
there, it sticks to it,

357
00:20:56,417 --> 00:21:01,002
and you can just put it inside
there, cover the layers off,

358
00:21:01,002 --> 00:21:03,034
and it actually gets
inside the metamorphic.

359
00:21:03,034 --> 00:21:04,636
- [Teacher] So you all
noticed how your rock samples

360
00:21:04,636 --> 00:21:07,408
are very true to real actual rocks,

361
00:21:07,408 --> 00:21:09,745
and how they could
combine with one another,

362
00:21:09,745 --> 00:21:12,137
and result in a completely different rock.

363
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:14,482
Okay? So, on your next
page where you get to make

364
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:17,501
your rock cycle diagram,
maybe you could use

365
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:19,675
those observations and
those understandings

366
00:21:19,675 --> 00:21:21,703
when explaining your outcome.

367
00:21:21,703 --> 00:21:24,791
Not the candy rock cycle, the real one.

368
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:28,721
- [Girl in purple] (mumbling)

369
00:21:31,548 --> 00:21:34,508
- [Teacher] It says that you could
use a diagram, okay?

370
00:21:34,508 --> 00:21:36,748
Using your textbook, Level
Readers Science Journal,

371
00:21:36,748 --> 00:21:39,221
or the rock cycle experiment
that we just completed.

372
00:21:39,221 --> 00:21:42,042
Anything you want to be able
to explain the rock cycle.

373
00:21:42,932 --> 00:21:44,073
Okay?

374
00:21:45,542 --> 00:21:50,110
- [Girl in purple] (Background Chatter)

375
00:21:51,538 --> 00:21:54,528
- [Girl in gray] My igneous has gone down just a bit.
