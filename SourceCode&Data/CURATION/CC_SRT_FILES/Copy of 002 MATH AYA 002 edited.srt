1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,691
(all students speaking at once)

2
00:00:03,691 --> 00:00:05,174
(coughing)

3
00:00:07,105 --> 00:00:10,518
(laughing)

4
00:00:10,518 --> 00:00:15,078
(consistent murmuring throughout room)

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,990
- Negative x minus it?

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,693
(muffled speaking)

7
00:00:21,693 --> 00:00:24,214
- It's one over, oh wait,
oh wait wait wait wait.

8
00:00:24,214 --> 00:00:25,245
- [Voiceover] How do we solve for X?

9
00:00:25,245 --> 00:00:27,079
- [Voiceover] X is the value of R anyway.

10
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:28,609
X is the value of R.

11
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:30,629
- What would you do for the one over X?

12
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:31,547
Wouldn't that be the first term?

13
00:00:31,547 --> 00:00:33,007
- [Voiceover] X is the value
of R (speech drowned out).

14
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:35,107
- What I would suggest you do is,

15
00:00:35,107 --> 00:00:38,125
is that you could rewrite
this as an expression.

16
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,441
- Oh, as the power (inaudible)?

17
00:00:39,441 --> 00:00:41,621
Oh. Oh, okay okay.

18
00:00:41,621 --> 00:00:43,461
- I used (inaudible).
- [Voiceover] Oh, yeah yeah.

19
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:45,188
All right, yeah I got it.

20
00:00:45,188 --> 00:00:49,085
So it's gonna be negative
X minus one, okay.

21
00:00:49,085 --> 00:00:50,962
Okay, no I got it.

22
00:00:50,962 --> 00:00:52,054
So the first,

23
00:00:52,644 --> 00:00:56,388
it's gonna be, so what--
(coughing over talking)

24
00:00:56,388 --> 00:00:57,322
- [Voiceover] Whatever.

25
00:00:57,322 --> 00:01:00,742
(multiple students talking at once)

26
00:01:00,742 --> 00:01:01,885
- [Voiceover] Oh, come on.

27
00:01:01,885 --> 00:01:03,658
- [Voiceover] I just wanted
to find where it talks about--

28
00:01:03,658 --> 00:01:06,736
- [Voiceover] It would be
one minus one (inaudible).

29
00:01:06,736 --> 00:01:09,682
- [Voiceover] Oh we have one (inaudible).

30
00:01:09,682 --> 00:01:11,784
- [Voiceover] Is one over x the sum?

31
00:01:11,784 --> 00:01:13,215
- [Voiceover] Do you
see, see what I'm saying?

32
00:01:14,965 --> 00:01:15,805
Yeah.

33
00:01:17,705 --> 00:01:18,995
- [Voiceover] I'm gonna put it in there,

34
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:22,025
so negative X minus one,
'cause later it's gonna change

35
00:01:22,025 --> 00:01:23,590
- [Voiceover] Wait, you don't
really have to do it out

36
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,670
since it's gonna change the
(inaudible) so it's higher.

37
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,742
You'll have to, you gotta
(speech drowned out by talking).

38
00:01:29,742 --> 00:01:30,292
Yeah.
(laughing)

39
00:01:30,292 --> 00:01:32,977
- No no no no no, don't,
don't don't don't.

40
00:01:32,977 --> 00:01:34,206
Don't even do that.

41
00:01:34,716 --> 00:01:35,501
Do you know why?

42
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:37,561
Because it's part of a (inaudible).

43
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:38,854
Well--

44
00:01:38,854 --> 00:01:40,402
(speech drowned out)
- [Voiceover] Yeah yeah yeah.

45
00:01:40,402 --> 00:01:42,752
'Cause the whole thing is
negative, and then that's the

46
00:01:42,752 --> 00:01:45,908
(speech drowned out by
other students talking)

47
00:01:45,908 --> 00:01:49,278
- Remember the (inaudible).
(laughing)

48
00:01:49,278 --> 00:01:52,918
(conversations going throughout the room)

49
00:01:54,668 --> 00:01:59,088
- [Voiceover] He's a natural.
(laughs)

50
00:01:59,088 --> 00:02:03,508
(muffled conversing throughout the room)

51
00:02:07,758 --> 00:02:09,375
- [Teacher] But now here's the question.

52
00:02:09,705 --> 00:02:12,060
You guys kind of already
answered this question.

53
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,550
(speaker drowned out by background noise)

54
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,807
Could you have found it?

55
00:02:18,547 --> 00:02:22,283
- They give you, basically R is two X.

56
00:02:22,283 --> 00:02:23,022
- Uh huh.

57
00:02:23,022 --> 00:02:26,328
- And, since it converges,
it has to be less than

58
00:02:26,728 --> 00:02:28,465
the absolute value of (speech
drowned out by others).

59
00:02:28,465 --> 00:02:29,346
- You got it.

60
00:02:30,286 --> 00:02:31,072
Okay.

61
00:02:31,072 --> 00:02:33,212
(all students speaking at once)

62
00:02:33,212 --> 00:02:34,592
- [Voiceover] That makes sense.

63
00:02:34,592 --> 00:02:36,192
(all students speaking at once)

64
00:02:36,192 --> 00:02:37,842
- [Teacher] Go back for a second.

65
00:02:39,412 --> 00:02:41,362
- Yeah, you multiply
both sides by a third.

66
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:44,552
So it'd be one third times
every single one of 'em.

67
00:02:45,612 --> 00:02:50,152
And the interval (speech
drowned out by others talking).

68
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:52,752
- [Teacher] Um--
- [Voiceover] Oh.

69
00:02:52,752 --> 00:02:56,251
Maybe someone's (speech drowned
out by consistent chatter).

70
00:02:57,681 --> 00:03:01,009
It means it's gonna get
shifted, and then (inaudible).

71
00:03:02,508 --> 00:03:05,507
- [Teacher] You were just
scaling the (speech drowned out).

72
00:03:05,507 --> 00:03:09,718
Because it's like, (speech
drowned out by others talking).

73
00:03:12,378 --> 00:03:14,719
- I'd never, I never considered
(speech drowned out).

74
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:17,082
Oh, okay.

75
00:03:17,086 --> 00:03:20,032
- [Teacher] Yeah.
(students chattering)

76
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:22,306
- [Voiceover] It's not gonna
change the domain of the--

77
00:03:22,306 --> 00:03:25,135
- [Voiceover] Oh, no, no,
I'm putting plus negative--

78
00:03:25,135 --> 00:03:28,138
(speaker drowned out by background noise)

79
00:03:28,468 --> 00:03:29,989
- [Voiceover] The answer.
- [Teacher] Yeah.

80
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:33,270
So, the only thing I'm thinking is

81
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:37,438
it might be easier for you
to just (speech drowned out).

82
00:03:38,128 --> 00:03:39,828
It might make sense somehow.

83
00:03:39,828 --> 00:03:41,454
- Oh, how do you read (inaudible)?

84
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:42,517
- Yeah, how do you--

85
00:03:42,517 --> 00:03:44,745
- [Teacher] No no no, no no no no no.

86
00:03:44,745 --> 00:03:46,472
It doesn't reduce the
time it takes for it to--

87
00:03:46,472 --> 00:03:47,988
- No man, right?

88
00:03:47,988 --> 00:03:48,715
(speech drowned out)

89
00:03:48,715 --> 00:03:50,065
- Oh, okay yeah.

90
00:03:50,575 --> 00:03:51,285
- [Voiceover] One third.

91
00:03:51,935 --> 00:03:53,325
Oh, I get it, I get it.

92
00:03:54,425 --> 00:03:56,825
- [Voiceover] It only converges
as you, (muffled speech).

93
00:03:56,825 --> 00:03:58,975
No matter what, well no matter what.

94
00:03:58,975 --> 00:04:01,088
(students chattering)

95
00:04:01,088 --> 00:04:02,683
- [Voiceover] One over X.

96
00:04:02,683 --> 00:04:06,223
Three X, five X, two in, two over X.

97
00:04:06,223 --> 00:04:07,700
- [Teacher] I think it does.

98
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,547
(students conversing around the room)

99
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,765
- [Voiceover] Thank you.
- [Voiceover] You're welcome.

100
00:04:20,103 --> 00:04:21,699
- [Voiceover] That's what I'm,
yeah, that's what I'm saying.

101
00:04:22,309 --> 00:04:23,974
- [Teacher] One over X.

102
00:04:25,544 --> 00:04:27,354
Because what they want you to do now,

103
00:04:27,354 --> 00:04:30,091
(speaker drowned out by background noise)

104
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:32,598
So, you'd say power series
is gonna be written as

105
00:04:32,598 --> 00:04:34,940
a form of, say, geometric series.

106
00:04:35,452 --> 00:04:36,799
Because now you've got, what?

107
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:37,995
What's the first term?

108
00:04:37,995 --> 00:04:40,691
(speech drowned out)
- [Teacher] Yeah? Right.

109
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:42,389
Okay, what's the ratio?

110
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:45,578
- Negative (speech drowned
out by others talking).

111
00:04:49,128 --> 00:04:50,951
- And when you write that out,

112
00:04:50,951 --> 00:04:53,260
put (inaudible) around it.

113
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,115
(laughing)
Let him once, show him.

114
00:04:57,115 --> 00:04:58,584
- Okay.
(laughs)

115
00:04:58,584 --> 00:05:02,101
(muffled conversations)

116
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:12,357
- [Voiceover] Is it saying three X?

117
00:05:13,057 --> 00:05:15,445
(speech drowned out by others talking)

118
00:05:16,455 --> 00:05:19,873
- I would be, I would take
the (speech drowned out).

119
00:05:23,754 --> 00:05:25,511
- [Teacher] Are you sure
you're working together?

120
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:27,145
- Yes.

121
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:32,019
(inaudible speech drowned
out by others talking)

122
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:35,132
- [Voiceover] And I'll turn it, one.

123
00:05:35,132 --> 00:05:38,312
We got one, minus X squared.

124
00:05:39,152 --> 00:05:41,502
- One over one plus X squared.

125
00:05:41,782 --> 00:05:43,952
- That's X to the fourth, right?

126
00:05:45,162 --> 00:05:48,882
Minus X to the sixth,
plus X to the eighth.

127
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:51,484
- This is, if you are indexing this.

128
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,393
This is your first term,
this is your second term,

129
00:05:53,393 --> 00:05:55,249
this is your third term, right?

130
00:05:55,249 --> 00:05:57,644
Think about the first one, okay?

131
00:05:57,984 --> 00:06:01,131
We have left that, in
order to get that a two X.

132
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:04,469
Like the first R, okay,
the first side of it.

133
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:07,350
And say, it's the second term that

134
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,460
(speech drowned out) the first time.

135
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,728
So it's probably gonna,
probably gonna be it.

136
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:12,727
Probably.

137
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:13,658
- Okay.

138
00:06:13,658 --> 00:06:14,723
- [Teacher] At least on these simple ones.

139
00:06:14,723 --> 00:06:15,212
- Okay.

140
00:06:15,212 --> 00:06:16,403
- [Teacher] Okay, leave that
for (speech drowned out).

141
00:06:16,403 --> 00:06:17,284
- Okay.

142
00:06:19,954 --> 00:06:22,863
- [Voiceover] N minus
one over one minus one,

143
00:06:22,863 --> 00:06:24,834
x minus one would be zero,
which would be (inaudible).

144
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:28,034
- [Voiceover] Originally we
have negative one (inaudible).

145
00:06:28,034 --> 00:06:31,536
- [Voiceover] X minus one.
(muffled conversing)

146
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:33,116
- [Voiceover] The right
one, so it's either gonna be

147
00:06:33,116 --> 00:06:34,096
(speech drowned out by
other students talking).

148
00:06:34,096 --> 00:06:36,038
- [Voiceover] Now you're
expanding by three

149
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:37,494
instead of zero six.

150
00:06:37,494 --> 00:06:42,494
- [Voiceover] So, it's like
negative X squared switched.

151
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:43,832
So the negative that goes over here,

152
00:06:43,832 --> 00:06:45,682
is negative X squared, too.

153
00:06:45,682 --> 00:06:47,582
So the negative is which
Y (speech drowned out).

154
00:06:47,582 --> 00:06:48,665
- [Voiceover] I don't, uh!

155
00:06:48,665 --> 00:06:50,755
(laughing)

156
00:06:51,075 --> 00:06:52,951
I don't know what I'm doing!

157
00:06:52,951 --> 00:06:56,973
(students all talking at once)

158
00:06:56,973 --> 00:06:58,224
- [Voiceover] All right look, hold on.

159
00:06:58,224 --> 00:07:00,308
Isn't it the same as the third one?

160
00:07:00,308 --> 00:07:03,595
- [Voiceover] That means that
the Y, like the same one,

161
00:07:03,595 --> 00:07:05,785
Y is the common one.
- [Voiceover] Right?

162
00:07:05,785 --> 00:07:10,465
(students consistently conversing)

163
00:07:13,825 --> 00:07:17,364
- To the one, so this
would be X minus one.

164
00:07:17,364 --> 00:07:20,324
And negative (speech drowned
out by others speaking).

165
00:07:20,324 --> 00:07:23,957
(students consistently conversing)

166
00:07:31,857 --> 00:07:34,733
Just put in one here, four, all right?

167
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:36,513
What's the ratio here?

168
00:07:36,513 --> 00:07:40,563
(speech drowned out by others talking)

169
00:07:43,993 --> 00:07:47,333
(laughing)

170
00:07:51,673 --> 00:07:55,247
- [Voiceover] One, you're
multiplying the outside of two X.

171
00:07:55,247 --> 00:07:56,769
Another one you're doing it as the two X.

172
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:58,874
That means you're moving
the X to the inside.

173
00:07:59,694 --> 00:08:02,778
If you take a function and you
just scale it by a multiple,

174
00:08:02,778 --> 00:08:06,979
if you take arcsine of
x, any function you want,

175
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:09,264
and you multiply it by scale,
like one third, one fourth,

176
00:08:09,264 --> 00:08:12,254
(speech drowned out by others talking).

177
00:08:12,254 --> 00:08:15,988
(consistently conversing
throughout the room)

178
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:19,142
- [Voiceover] Ah, but then there we said--

179
00:08:19,142 --> 00:08:21,161
- [Voiceover] No! Oh my
God, what arc, what are you,

180
00:08:21,161 --> 00:08:23,657
wait wait, hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on, hold on.

181
00:08:25,474 --> 00:08:28,372
- There's gonna be another
one I haven't, there,

182
00:08:28,372 --> 00:08:30,873
and one third after that
is what we're doing here.

183
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:35,375
Our R remains the same.

184
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,724
It's the whole series multiplied
by the factor of one third.

185
00:08:38,724 --> 00:08:40,903
- [Voiceover] Okay yeah,
I'm agreeing to that.

186
00:08:40,903 --> 00:08:42,500
- [Voiceover] I'm pretty
sure that's right.

187
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,554
- You multiply this out,
it's gonna be one over three,

188
00:08:47,554 --> 00:08:49,266
plus three x minus one.

189
00:08:52,672 --> 00:08:53,943
- Why are you multiplying it out?

190
00:08:53,943 --> 00:08:55,892
Just think of it as a scale.

191
00:08:57,028 --> 00:08:59,264
It's not anything to do, it's
not gonna affect our domain

192
00:08:59,264 --> 00:09:00,392
outside the function.

193
00:09:00,392 --> 00:09:01,789
It's only gonna affect the range.

194
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:04,807
And therefore you're not
gonna have any remains

195
00:09:04,807 --> 00:09:06,732
'cause the remains only
matter if you didn't have

196
00:09:06,732 --> 00:09:09,752
but like one third of it, so
we're not doing it like that.

197
00:09:09,752 --> 00:09:13,304
One third after it, we're
doing like a stretched version.

198
00:09:14,344 --> 00:09:17,634
So it's not gonna affect the equation.

199
00:09:17,634 --> 00:09:21,114
(consistent chatter throughout the room)

200
00:09:41,794 --> 00:09:44,314
- [Voiceover] (inaudible),
so it's negative X.

201
00:09:44,934 --> 00:09:46,764
- [Voiceover] What? No no no no no no.

202
00:09:46,764 --> 00:09:50,674
(all students speaking at once)

203
00:09:53,484 --> 00:09:58,194
- [Voiceover] That's the series
for (speech drowned out).

204
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,172
- [Voiceover] Uh, all right.

205
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:09,606
- [Voiceover] I'm just
(inaudible) negative X squared.

206
00:10:11,156 --> 00:10:12,036
Right?

207
00:10:12,036 --> 00:10:15,566
(consistent chatter among students)

208
00:10:24,696 --> 00:10:27,616
- [Voiceover] No, no, no, I'm
putting negative x squared.

209
00:10:28,026 --> 00:10:32,134
It's easier, 'cause then
later on when you do plus--

210
00:10:32,134 --> 00:10:33,579
- [Voiceover] No, no, no, no, no, I--

211
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:34,962
(speech drowned out by others talking).

212
00:10:34,962 --> 00:10:36,329
- [Voiceover] The sine's been switching.

213
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:37,721
No, no.

214
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,063
- [Voiceover] Yeah, but you
can represent that by saying--

215
00:10:39,063 --> 00:10:40,674
- [Voiceover] Yeah, it's gonna be smaller.

216
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:43,268
(consistent conversing among students)

217
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,518
Well, it'll be switching, but like

218
00:10:45,518 --> 00:10:47,278
would you represent,
how would you represent

219
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:48,848
X in the whole thing?

220
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:51,803
- [Voiceover] To the
negative, see the n minus one

221
00:10:51,803 --> 00:10:53,469
is put, that's how I'm doing it.

222
00:10:53,469 --> 00:10:57,496
(consistent chatter among students)

223
00:10:58,326 --> 00:10:59,707
- [Voiceover] Wait, how would you find the

224
00:10:59,707 --> 00:11:01,377
(speech drowned out by others talking)?

225
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:03,983
- [Voiceover] If it's the
absolute value of x minus one,

226
00:11:03,983 --> 00:11:05,460
it would be less than one.

227
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,563
- [Voiceover] Mrs. Dockin?
- [Teacher] Yes.

228
00:11:08,691 --> 00:11:10,751
(consistent speaking among students)

229
00:11:10,751 --> 00:11:12,964
- [Voiceover] Is this, is this, is this X?

230
00:11:14,714 --> 00:11:16,241
- We're not sure where we are because

231
00:11:16,241 --> 00:11:18,161
of these coefficients that change.

232
00:11:19,151 --> 00:11:23,321
(speech drowned out by others talking)

233
00:11:24,606 --> 00:11:26,162
- What is X over R?

234
00:11:27,102 --> 00:11:29,799
- Take this series right
here, which is that.

235
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:31,809
So, then integrate it.

236
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:34,374
We just though you integrate
every term to get it.

237
00:11:34,374 --> 00:11:36,276
- Now you're looking for
a general expression.

238
00:11:36,276 --> 00:11:36,995
- Right.

239
00:11:37,243 --> 00:11:38,487
- You have a general expression.

240
00:11:39,127 --> 00:11:40,868
It didn't tell you to come up with.

241
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:41,910
no, they didn't tell you to do that.

242
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,760
- Oh, okay okay.

243
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,538
Okay, because, in fact,
that's not a power series.

244
00:11:48,628 --> 00:11:50,255
- [Voiceover] That's not a power series?

245
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:54,206
- It is, okay, but it's a
different form of a power series.

246
00:11:54,206 --> 00:11:57,253
(speaker drowned out by background noise)

247
00:11:57,253 --> 00:11:59,372
So you don't have to write
'em like this because

248
00:11:59,372 --> 00:12:01,401
you would also need to have, what?

249
00:12:01,401 --> 00:12:03,223
You also have to have (inaudible).

250
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,675
- [Voiceover] Right, yeah okay.

251
00:12:04,675 --> 00:12:06,391
- Got it? Okay.

252
00:12:06,391 --> 00:12:10,651
(consistent conversing among students)

253
00:12:32,911 --> 00:12:34,521
- [Voiceover] You flip it around.

254
00:12:39,351 --> 00:12:42,201
- One, good, yeah good, what's R?

255
00:12:47,161 --> 00:12:50,294
The negative of, yeah you're
the negative x plus one,

256
00:12:50,294 --> 00:12:52,105
but it needs to be in parentheses.

257
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,500
So now you need your R, okay?

258
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,086
Now, you're gonna do
them when you get to--

259
00:12:58,086 --> 00:13:01,934
- [Voiceover] It needs
to be a form of K over R.

260
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,046
- Oh, I thought we just solve for R?

261
00:13:07,046 --> 00:13:09,011
You said the third nominated was R.

262
00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:13,001
(speech drowned out by others talking)

263
00:13:19,592 --> 00:13:20,681
- [Voiceover] All right guys,

264
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,201
she said 1/3 times one,

265
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:26,125
whatever that is.

266
00:13:26,545 --> 00:13:28,562
How do you multiply these?

267
00:13:32,972 --> 00:13:36,767
- Does it need to be on the
(speech drowned out by talking).

268
00:13:41,707 --> 00:13:45,624
(students chattering)

269
00:13:47,422 --> 00:13:49,544
- Yeah, so you do it again.

270
00:13:49,544 --> 00:13:52,153
- Yeah, multiply the whole interval, yeah.

271
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,003
Multiply the interval.

272
00:13:54,983 --> 00:13:57,397
- [Voiceover] And this is
not in the form of a series.

273
00:13:57,397 --> 00:14:01,941
(consistent chatter among students)

274
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:29,045
- That one third, does that
impact the greatness of one?

275
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,312
That's the question you want to answer.

276
00:14:32,312 --> 00:14:33,554
I'm not answering it for you right now,

277
00:14:33,554 --> 00:14:35,259
you need to figure it out.

278
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:38,327
- [Voiceover] So, when it's asking for,

279
00:14:38,327 --> 00:14:42,957
does the function of the
(speech drowned out)?

280
00:14:42,957 --> 00:14:47,468
(consistent talking among students)

281
00:14:53,702 --> 00:14:55,591
- This, it's like that.

282
00:14:55,591 --> 00:14:56,914
- [Voiceover] You didn't
divide it by seven.
