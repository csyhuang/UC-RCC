1
00:00:00,641 --> 00:00:05,082
- What part of soccer
you really want to know?

2
00:00:05,082 --> 00:00:07,212
- What about the measuring
or even the measure?

3
00:00:07,212 --> 00:00:09,281
- That's what you've got to figure out.

4
00:00:09,281 --> 00:00:10,791
- Or how long you can.

5
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:12,031
- Okay.

6
00:00:13,611 --> 00:00:15,449
- I mean how many like,
times you can do it.

7
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:19,440
- Okay, so you could sit there
and count how many bounces,

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,639
kicks, or you could sit
here with the timing.

9
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:23,649
- How much you can do it

10
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:25,200
and how much time you need.

11
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,850
- Okay, how many per minute.

12
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,340
So, you've got lots of ideas.

13
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,939
You're going to have to choose that.

14
00:00:33,529 --> 00:00:34,532
Do you need a little more time

15
00:00:34,532 --> 00:00:37,252
to bounce it off each other?

16
00:00:37,252 --> 00:00:37,892
- Yeah.

17
00:00:37,892 --> 00:00:40,322
- Okay, so I think you
have both come up with,

18
00:00:40,322 --> 00:00:41,615
all four of you.

19
00:00:41,615 --> 00:00:44,188
You guys come up with an
experiment to support each other

20
00:00:44,188 --> 00:00:45,882
and you two come up with one.

21
00:00:45,882 --> 00:00:48,022
And you'll collect your data
and you'll collect your data

22
00:00:48,022 --> 00:00:50,673
and then present it as a company.

23
00:00:50,673 --> 00:00:51,862
How about that?

24
00:00:51,862 --> 00:00:54,371
(Inaudible) soccer team or company.

25
00:00:54,371 --> 00:00:55,772
Alright?

26
00:01:04,922 --> 00:01:06,966
Alright, you've got a good name.

27
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:09,446
Alright, that's part of it.  It works.

28
00:01:10,606 --> 00:01:12,161
Catch your attention.

29
00:01:12,161 --> 00:01:13,331
- I know, Stephanie.

30
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:14,897
- We're having trouble.

31
00:01:14,897 --> 00:01:16,271
- Because we barely decided on it.

32
00:01:16,271 --> 00:01:19,171
We didn't do the friction one, but 
the one where you drop the marble in the

33
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:21,221
the shampoo bottle.

34
00:01:22,651 --> 00:01:23,912
The little car that you pull back

35
00:01:23,912 --> 00:01:25,323
and see how far it goes.

36
00:01:25,323 --> 00:01:26,431
- (Inaudible)

37
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:27,362
- Okay.

38
00:01:27,362 --> 00:01:28,522
- And the parachute one,

39
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:30,393
so I thought of the parachute one.

40
00:01:30,393 --> 00:01:31,251
- What do you think?

41
00:01:31,251 --> 00:01:32,041
- Yeah.

42
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:34,361
- You're a team on it, okay.

43
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:37,492
So, what are you going to
measure with a parachute?

44
00:01:37,492 --> 00:01:40,751
- (Inaudible)

45
00:01:42,822 --> 00:01:46,654
- Pardon?  Yeah, you're going to use
metric, which is centimeters.

46
00:01:46,654 --> 00:01:49,541
Stephanie's got control of the metrics.

47
00:01:53,861 --> 00:01:56,630
So, can you tell me what your experiment

48
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,891
is going to look like
with these parachutes?

49
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:03,041
- Well, we don't know how far (inaudible).

50
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:04,696
Because we know we can't
throw it out the window.

51
00:02:04,696 --> 00:02:05,726
- Oh no.

52
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:06,406
- It's too far.

53
00:02:06,406 --> 00:02:09,226
- Okay, but you know what...

54
00:02:09,226 --> 00:02:10,246
- Maybe on the counter?

55
00:02:10,246 --> 00:02:11,186
- You guys are coordinated,

56
00:02:11,186 --> 00:02:12,586
I would let you stand on this counter

57
00:02:12,586 --> 00:02:16,386
and you could kind of
measure different heights.

58
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,235
How high you could...

59
00:02:19,015 --> 00:02:20,827
You could do some test runs, right?

60
00:02:20,827 --> 00:02:21,216
- Yeah.

61
00:02:21,216 --> 00:02:22,616
- Don't you think scientists
would do test trials

62
00:02:22,616 --> 00:02:25,266
before they make a real decision?

63
00:02:25,266 --> 00:02:26,625
Okay.

64
00:02:28,905 --> 00:02:29,615
- Yeah.

65
00:02:29,615 --> 00:02:31,996
- And you know what?

66
00:02:31,996 --> 00:02:34,256
If you'd like, if we have time,

67
00:02:34,256 --> 00:02:36,355
I want you to do test runs in here,

68
00:02:36,355 --> 00:02:40,425
but we could do a final
drop off the balcony

69
00:02:40,425 --> 00:02:41,347
and get it clear.

70
00:02:41,347 --> 00:02:42,735
- That's what I was thinking.

71
00:02:42,735 --> 00:02:45,486
- Okay, but I do want you to
do test runs in here first

72
00:02:45,486 --> 00:02:47,095
and then we could do a final.

73
00:02:47,095 --> 00:02:50,006
But make your hypothesis,
what you're thinking

74
00:02:50,006 --> 00:02:52,365
because I think you're on a roll here.

75
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:54,175
It's going to be good.

76
00:02:55,394 --> 00:02:57,453
- I don't like his interview.

77
00:03:02,054 --> 00:03:04,034
- So how far?

78
00:03:12,463 --> 00:03:13,233
- In this experiment,

79
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:14,983
can we put like some sort
of weight on the parachute

80
00:03:14,983 --> 00:03:17,583
to see how fast or something?

81
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,513
- Okay, I think you're making
another experiment, right?

82
00:03:21,513 --> 00:03:24,113
So, what's your first experiment?

83
00:03:24,113 --> 00:03:26,632
- Just how fast it would drop by itself.

84
00:03:26,632 --> 00:03:29,443
- How fast from one distance?

85
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:30,293
- Yeah.

86
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,983
- Okay, so one distance
you're going to see

87
00:03:32,983 --> 00:03:35,653
how fast it'll drop.

88
00:03:35,653 --> 00:03:37,893
And then you're going to compare that to

89
00:03:37,893 --> 00:03:39,833
from that distance.

90
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:40,963
- Adding weights to it.

91
00:03:40,963 --> 00:03:42,933
- Okay, alright.

92
00:03:46,023 --> 00:03:48,643
- Well, I wondered how
far will the parachute go

93
00:03:48,643 --> 00:03:49,853
from different heights.

94
00:03:49,853 --> 00:03:51,802
- Okay, so she's got one experiment

95
00:03:51,802 --> 00:03:53,382
and you've got another one.

96
00:03:54,313 --> 00:03:56,852
Do you want to do two in one

97
00:03:58,062 --> 00:04:00,222
and kind of combine it together?

98
00:04:00,222 --> 00:04:03,312
You do yours and you do yours.

99
00:04:03,932 --> 00:04:06,832
Because you only can change one
variable at a time, right?

100
00:04:06,832 --> 00:04:07,643
- Yeah.

101
00:04:07,643 --> 00:04:10,622
- So, what's your variable
you're going to measure?

102
00:04:10,622 --> 00:04:14,392
- I'm going to measure
the distance, how far.

103
00:04:14,392 --> 00:04:16,472
- How high, different distances.

104
00:04:16,472 --> 00:04:17,322
And what are you going to do?

105
00:04:17,322 --> 00:04:18,460
- (mumbles)

106
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,522
- And you're going to time it, right?

107
00:04:20,522 --> 00:04:21,073
- Yeah.

108
00:04:21,073 --> 00:04:22,672
- Okay, and you're going to do,

109
00:04:22,672 --> 00:04:25,582
what's your variable that
you're going to change?

110
00:04:25,582 --> 00:04:26,432
- The weight.

111
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,892
- Okay.

112
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,531
But you're going to see how fast it drops?

113
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:30,882
- Yeah.

114
00:04:30,882 --> 00:04:33,741
- Alright, so I think you're
going to need another paper.

115
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:34,351
- Okay.

116
00:04:34,351 --> 00:04:36,612
- Because you've got two
experiments going.

117
00:04:36,612 --> 00:04:38,402
Are you going to support
each other in each one?

118
00:04:38,402 --> 00:04:38,901
- Yeah.

119
00:04:38,901 --> 00:04:41,771
- That's pretty cool, double points.

120
00:04:48,902 --> 00:04:50,481
How are you guys doing?

121
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:51,631
Oh, I like it.

122
00:04:51,631 --> 00:04:53,381
Okay, tell me about this one.

123
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:55,551
- Okay, so we're going to get two or three

124
00:04:55,551 --> 00:04:57,051
different size basketballs,

125
00:04:57,051 --> 00:04:59,951
like a really small one
and maybe a medium one

126
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:01,061
and then...

127
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:02,081
Yeah.

128
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:04,946
And then we're going to like
have two meters or a meter

129
00:05:04,946 --> 00:05:06,782
and like drop it from there.

130
00:05:06,782 --> 00:05:10,183
So, like how high it bounces
depending on its size.

131
00:05:11,283 --> 00:05:13,694
- Oh, so the size of the balls

132
00:05:14,374 --> 00:05:15,994
to see how--

133
00:05:15,994 --> 00:05:16,923
- High it bounces.

134
00:05:16,923 --> 00:05:17,615
- Okay.

135
00:05:17,615 --> 00:05:19,074
- If it bounces higher (inaudible)

136
00:05:19,074 --> 00:05:21,885
(inaudible).

137
00:05:22,304 --> 00:05:23,505
- What do you think?

138
00:05:23,505 --> 00:05:25,844
- I think the small
one will bounce higher.

139
00:05:25,844 --> 00:05:27,344
- Because there's less material to like

140
00:05:27,344 --> 00:05:29,384
have to drop from there.

141
00:05:31,014 --> 00:05:32,715
- Like when in gym class when they have

142
00:05:32,715 --> 00:05:34,914
the huge balls for exercising,

143
00:05:34,914 --> 00:05:37,114
if you drop a bigger one
usually it doesn't go up as high

144
00:05:37,114 --> 00:05:39,454
and the smaller ones do bounce higher.

145
00:05:39,454 --> 00:05:41,688
- So, based on your observations.

146
00:05:41,688 --> 00:05:43,274
You're a good observer.

147
00:05:43,274 --> 00:05:45,134
- [Voiceover] So, your
large ball went the highest

148
00:05:45,134 --> 00:05:47,314
and you thought the small one would.

149
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:50,104
Whoa, are these your averages?

150
00:05:50,744 --> 00:05:51,914
- [Voiceover] Yeah, they're my averages.

151
00:05:51,914 --> 00:05:53,984
- Wow, okay.

152
00:05:54,714 --> 00:05:56,534
Good.

153
00:05:56,534 --> 00:06:00,114
So, how are you guys going
to present it as a team?

154
00:06:01,603 --> 00:06:04,504
- She's probably going to
do like what we thought

155
00:06:04,504 --> 00:06:08,223
would happen (mumbles).

156
00:06:08,223 --> 00:06:09,494
And I'm probably going to do the results

157
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,663
of what actually happens.

158
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:14,584
- [Voiceover] Are you
comfortable with that?

159
00:06:14,584 --> 00:06:15,344
- Uh-huh.

160
00:06:15,344 --> 00:06:17,833
- Okay, to make it really
clear what you did?

161
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:18,713
- [Voiceover] Yeah, yeah.

162
00:06:18,713 --> 00:06:20,924
- Okay, I think that'll be really good

163
00:06:20,924 --> 00:06:24,813
because this is great,
this is great to show,

164
00:06:24,813 --> 00:06:27,882
and then you're writing
your conclusion with numbers

165
00:06:27,882 --> 00:06:29,203
in it, I like that.

166
00:06:29,203 --> 00:06:31,833
And then you told, yours
was rejected, right?

167
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:32,673
- Yeah.

168
00:06:32,673 --> 00:06:35,653
- Okay, now does that
mean you're a failure?

169
00:06:35,653 --> 00:06:36,243
- [Voiceover] No.

170
00:06:36,243 --> 00:06:37,853
- Do you guys mind going first?

171
00:06:37,853 --> 00:06:38,633
- Sure.

172
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:40,343
- [Voiceover] Because if they
see that yours is rejected

173
00:06:40,343 --> 00:06:43,543
and yet you still could write
up a scientific experiment,

174
00:06:43,543 --> 00:06:45,933
I think that might give
them some confidence

175
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:47,453
and it'll take the pressure off them

176
00:06:47,453 --> 00:06:49,853
because they don't really want to go first.

177
00:06:50,673 --> 00:06:53,103
- [Voiceover] Okay, so let's go.

178
00:06:59,233 --> 00:07:02,829
- (Spanish)
(mumbles) Aqui tenemos que cambiar la 
friccion sobre dos.

179
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:06,978
(Spanish)
Tenemos que cambiar.

180
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:09,348
- [Voiceover] Oh wow,
the graph looks good.

181
00:07:09,348 --> 00:07:11,578
And your data chart looks good.

182
00:07:15,048 --> 00:07:18,019
So, Jenni will you shows yours?

183
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:22,039
- On the first dictation thing

184
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:23,239
when we have to go up there,

185
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:24,449
do we have to go up by step,

186
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:26,629
like show everything?

187
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:27,539
- [Voiceover] What do you think?

188
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:29,479
- Or just show our graph?

189
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:31,930
- [Voiceover] What do you
think would be the best?

190
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:33,940
- [Voiceover] I say showing the graph.

191
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:37,169
- Should we show like, our question

192
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:40,619
and then should we show the whole thing?

193
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:42,545
- [Voiceover] What do you think?

194
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,189
- I don't know.

195
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:44,559
- [Voiceover] I think so.

196
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:46,909
Showing both.

197
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:47,932
- Okay.

198
00:07:48,622 --> 00:07:50,239
- But it's probably the
most important thing

199
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:52,299
to convince them.

200
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:57,259
I'd definitely show your data.

201
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:58,469
- [Voiceover] Okay, we'll show his

202
00:07:58,469 --> 00:07:59,259
because it's better than mine.

203
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:01,208
- Okay, very good.

204
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:04,729
And let's see, yes it looks professional.

205
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:08,719
So, these numbers...

206
00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:11,096
How many times did you do this experiment?

207
00:08:11,096 --> 00:08:13,969
- Three times, wait, four,

208
00:08:13,969 --> 00:08:15,028
three, twelve.

209
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,688
- [Voiceover] 100, I don't know.

210
00:08:16,688 --> 00:08:18,868
- [Voiceover] Because there's
five and there's three.

211
00:08:18,868 --> 00:08:20,448
15 times.

212
00:08:21,288 --> 00:08:23,138
- Okay.

213
00:08:23,138 --> 00:08:26,418
We've got one, two, three,
four, five trials here.

214
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:27,828
Is that correct?

215
00:08:27,828 --> 00:08:30,478
- No, we went up three,
but he wrote trials

216
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:31,499
for these.

217
00:08:31,499 --> 00:08:32,568
- [Voiceover] Oh, okay.

218
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:34,608
So, we can fix that?

219
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:38,198
- [Voiceover] (Spanish)
Que dibujaste? No tienes que poner esto.

220
00:08:39,868 --> 00:08:42,678
(Spanish)
Tienes que poner esto.

221
00:08:45,702 --> 00:08:47,498
- It's very neat.

222
00:08:50,148 --> 00:08:51,898
So, you added one, two, three

223
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:53,638
and divided by...

224
00:08:53,638 --> 00:08:55,518
- [Voiceover] By three.

225
00:08:55,518 --> 00:08:57,957
- [Voiceover] Okay, alright,
that's how you got the average?

226
00:08:57,957 --> 00:08:58,888
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

227
00:08:58,888 --> 00:09:01,028
- [Voiceover] Okay, and
who figured out the answer?

228
00:09:01,028 --> 00:09:02,108
- Me.
- [Voiceover] Jenni.

229
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,298
- Wow, Jenni.

230
00:09:03,298 --> 00:09:06,357
- We did, was it highest to lowest?

231
00:09:06,357 --> 00:09:07,008
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

232
00:09:07,008 --> 00:09:09,687
- Highest minus lowest, divided by two.

233
00:09:09,687 --> 00:09:11,437
- Awesome.

234
00:09:11,437 --> 00:09:13,178
You definitely should show this.

235
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,237
And then this would be uncertainty.

236
00:09:15,237 --> 00:09:17,038
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

237
00:09:17,038 --> 00:09:18,828
- And these are the mounted distance

238
00:09:18,828 --> 00:09:21,118
with different kinds of...

239
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,104
What are these five things?

240
00:09:25,104 --> 00:09:26,064
- [Voiceover] The shoes.

241
00:09:26,064 --> 00:09:27,684
- [Voiceover] Okay.

242
00:09:28,904 --> 00:09:30,752
- [Voiceover] The shoes.

243
00:09:30,752 --> 00:09:31,392
- [Voiceover] It gets tiring when you have

244
00:09:31,392 --> 00:09:32,842
to do it three times.

245
00:09:32,842 --> 00:09:34,291
- [Voiceover] Right.

246
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:38,352
Now my question is, if
you didn't have the shoes

247
00:09:38,352 --> 00:09:41,101
how did you get the data for it?

248
00:09:42,321 --> 00:09:43,342
- [Voiceover] I did it at my house.

249
00:09:43,342 --> 00:09:45,322
- You did them at your house?

250
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:46,882
Okay.

251
00:09:46,882 --> 00:09:49,361
And then what's this one right over here?

252
00:09:49,361 --> 00:09:50,212
- [Voiceover] The socks.

253
00:09:50,212 --> 00:09:52,724
- Okay, and that's one you
definitely did at school?

254
00:09:52,724 --> 00:09:53,792
- [Voiceover] Yeah, we did it here

255
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:55,660
and we also did the Vans here.

256
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,761
- And the Vans.

257
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:58,900
Alright, so that's good.

258
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,370
Would you explain that to the class?

259
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,110
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

260
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,161
- That these you did at home

261
00:10:03,161 --> 00:10:04,741
and these you did here

262
00:10:04,741 --> 00:10:08,010
and so would you have
any sources of error?

263
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,455
- Yeah, because of the surface.

264
00:10:12,215 --> 00:10:16,485
Like at his house it would have been

265
00:10:16,485 --> 00:10:19,015
not like floor, it would be carpet

266
00:10:19,015 --> 00:10:21,073
or something like that.

267
00:10:21,073 --> 00:10:22,053
- [Voiceover] Yeah, what's your floor like

268
00:10:22,053 --> 00:10:23,984
where you did it?

269
00:10:23,984 --> 00:10:27,625
- [Voiceover] Well, I had to do it like outside

270
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:28,584
during the rain.

271
00:10:28,584 --> 00:10:29,274
- Oh my goodness.

272
00:10:29,274 --> 00:10:32,504
Okay, so you've got to explain that

273
00:10:32,504 --> 00:10:33,454
and then do you think that would

274
00:10:33,454 --> 00:10:35,684
affect your experiment any?

275
00:10:35,684 --> 00:10:36,652
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

276
00:10:36,652 --> 00:10:38,144
- Okay, maybe it would.

277
00:10:38,144 --> 00:10:39,554
And so what would a scientist do

278
00:10:39,554 --> 00:10:41,246
in the next time?

279
00:10:41,246 --> 00:10:43,227
- Would have done it in a dry place.

280
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:44,459
- [Voiceover] Yeah, do it in a dry place.

281
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:45,786
- [Voiceover] (laughs) Yeah, I like that.

282
00:10:45,786 --> 00:10:47,747
Okay, so you'll tell
that for the next time?

283
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:48,297
- Yeah.

284
00:10:48,297 --> 00:10:51,156
- But I really liked how
you guys didn't give up.

285
00:10:51,156 --> 00:10:54,300
How you actually did the socks

286
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,680
compared to your Vans.

287
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,951
- And you know how you pull those out

288
00:11:02,151 --> 00:11:04,812
what are (inaudible) research,

289
00:11:04,812 --> 00:11:06,260
we could have done your boot.

290
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,730
- [Voiceovoer] Oh yeah, my boot.

291
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:08,690
Yeah, I could have.

292
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:09,970
Want to do my boot?

293
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,001
- [Voiceover] No, I'm good.

294
00:11:11,001 --> 00:11:12,150
- No (laughs).

295
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,770
- [Voiceover] My legs are tired (inaudible).

296
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,590
- Okay, I'm sure they are.

297
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,189
- [Voiceover] Well, did
you accept or reject

298
00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:18,850
your hypothesis?

299
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:19,650
- Accept.

300
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,983
- [Voiceover] We accepted it.

301
00:11:20,983 --> 00:11:23,329
- [Voiceover] And tell us why.

302
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:26,850
- Because (inaudible).

303
00:11:29,868 --> 00:11:31,199
- [Voiceover] You've got
the evidence right there,

304
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,578
don't you?

305
00:11:42,358 --> 00:11:46,168
- [Voiceover] The experiment,
like that one question we had,

306
00:11:46,168 --> 00:11:48,728
it goes with the real world
or something like that.

307
00:11:48,728 --> 00:11:51,978
(inaudible)

308
00:11:57,324 --> 00:12:00,827
(inaudible)

309
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,818
- [Voiceover] Could you
repeat this experiment?

310
00:12:04,818 --> 00:12:06,198
- The whole thing?

311
00:12:06,198 --> 00:12:08,488
- [Voiceover] Yeah, or could
anybody do this experiment?

312
00:12:08,488 --> 00:12:09,628
- Yeah, it's easy.

313
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:10,488
- [Voiceover] It is?

314
00:12:10,488 --> 00:12:13,098
Did you write your procedure so it's easy?

315
00:12:13,098 --> 00:12:16,458
- (inaudible)

316
00:12:21,978 --> 00:12:23,288
It's hard to write a procedure

317
00:12:23,288 --> 00:12:26,607
because it (inaudible).

318
00:12:29,907 --> 00:12:31,813
- [Voiceover] Okay, and if you had to do

319
00:12:31,813 --> 00:12:33,583
this experiment over again,

320
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,434
would you do it any differently or not?

321
00:12:37,953 --> 00:12:38,693
- No.

322
00:12:38,693 --> 00:12:41,124
- [Voiceover] Would you
test for anything else?

323
00:12:44,353 --> 00:12:47,074
- (inaudible)

324
00:12:47,074 --> 00:12:48,423
- [Voiceover] Good point.

325
00:12:48,423 --> 00:12:50,403
How much pressure, right?

326
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:53,623
Okay, alright, any other questions?

327
00:12:54,553 --> 00:12:56,044
Nice job. Thanks.

328
00:12:56,044 --> 00:12:59,003
(class applauding)

329
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:01,373
Jenni's team.

330
00:13:05,303 --> 00:13:06,583
Sorry to rush you guys,

331
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:10,033
but we got the idea.

332
00:13:13,453 --> 00:13:17,073
(class chatting)

333
00:13:22,973 --> 00:13:26,462
(class chatting)

334
00:13:33,933 --> 00:13:37,683
(class chatting)

335
00:13:51,942 --> 00:13:54,243
- [Voiceover] What was your experiment?

336
00:13:54,813 --> 00:13:56,372
- Our experiment was to find out

337
00:13:56,372 --> 00:13:59,012
what types of shoes would work

338
00:13:59,012 --> 00:14:00,513
to do the moon walk.

339
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:08,362
(inaudible)

340
00:14:08,362 --> 00:14:10,322
uses four different pairs of shoes

341
00:14:10,322 --> 00:14:13,242
like Adidas, (inaudible),

342
00:14:13,242 --> 00:14:15,712
Converse or Vans.

343
00:14:18,392 --> 00:14:20,683
The Adidas would go the farthest.

344
00:14:20,683 --> 00:14:23,294
The Vans (inaudible).

345
00:14:23,294 --> 00:14:25,994
(inaudible)

346
00:14:32,314 --> 00:14:34,343
- [Voiceover] No, just show the data.

347
00:14:39,453 --> 00:14:41,046
- You were correct.

348
00:14:43,685 --> 00:14:46,934
(inaudible)

349
00:14:56,723 --> 00:14:57,424
And you were correct

350
00:14:57,424 --> 00:14:59,184
because the Adidas were here

351
00:14:59,184 --> 00:15:02,564
and the first time it
went like 112 centimeters

352
00:15:04,294 --> 00:15:08,354
and the second trial
it went 118 centimeters

353
00:15:08,354 --> 00:15:10,404
and the final was like 12

354
00:15:10,404 --> 00:15:14,394
and then it was like 116.6 centimeters.

355
00:15:14,923 --> 00:15:18,373
(inaudible)

356
00:15:20,463 --> 00:15:22,896
We accepted our hypothesis.

357
00:15:22,896 --> 00:15:24,693
Jenni, continue this.

358
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:26,094
- [Voiceover] Why me?

359
00:15:26,094 --> 00:15:27,944
- [Voiceover] Because you're professional.

360
00:15:31,204 --> 00:15:34,775
- Well, we were going to do

361
00:15:34,775 --> 00:15:37,536
an interview (inaudible),

362
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:41,466
but we forgot to.

363
00:15:44,296 --> 00:15:46,626
(inaudible)

364
00:15:50,076 --> 00:15:52,106
So, what do we do?

365
00:15:59,406 --> 00:16:01,425
It's really bad.

366
00:16:01,425 --> 00:16:03,566
- [Voiceover] Why do you
think it's bad, Jenni?

367
00:16:03,566 --> 00:16:05,056
- I don't know.

368
00:16:05,056 --> 00:16:07,866
- (Spanish)
Esta bien, esta bien.

369
00:16:10,546 --> 00:16:12,776
- Well, here's the amount of distance

370
00:16:12,776 --> 00:16:16,235
and here's the kind of (inaudible)

371
00:16:16,235 --> 00:16:20,755
and I marked them as the
average they all went.

372
00:16:29,065 --> 00:16:32,237
So, we can see that the Adidas went more

373
00:16:32,237 --> 00:16:34,328
than the Vans did

374
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:37,468
because the Vans were like, the lowest.

375
00:16:44,068 --> 00:16:46,337
(inaudible)

376
00:16:46,337 --> 00:16:49,667
- [Voiceover] Will you tell
us about your source of error

377
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:50,953
because that was interesting.

378
00:16:50,953 --> 00:16:52,629
Because you had a good way to solve it

379
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:54,853
if you did your project over again.

380
00:16:54,853 --> 00:16:56,252
- Oh, yeah.

381
00:16:56,252 --> 00:17:00,432
Well, it's because Jose
did half of the experiment,

382
00:17:00,432 --> 00:17:02,109
he did it at home

383
00:17:02,109 --> 00:17:05,559
and the other part of it we did here

384
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:09,099
and I think it did it different

385
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:12,999
because he did it in the rain

386
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:15,889
and we did it like on dry.

387
00:17:15,889 --> 00:17:19,206
So, I think that affected the experiment.

388
00:17:21,895 --> 00:17:24,156
- [Voiceover] There's probably
different traction on shoes.

389
00:17:27,575 --> 00:17:28,636
- (Spanish)
Si.  Simon.

390
00:17:32,825 --> 00:17:34,996
- [Voiceover] What kind of
shoe would you try next time?

391
00:17:34,996 --> 00:17:36,066
- A boot.

392
00:17:36,066 --> 00:17:40,262
- [Voiceover] Oh, like my
major walking boot (laughs).

393
00:17:40,262 --> 00:17:41,046
- Si.

394
00:17:41,046 --> 00:17:42,067
- [Voiceover] Alright.

395
00:17:42,587 --> 00:17:46,877
What would you hypothesize would happen

396
00:17:46,877 --> 00:17:49,096
if you tried my boot?

397
00:17:49,427 --> 00:17:51,478
If you look at the...

398
00:17:51,478 --> 00:17:53,407
- Well, because it's soft,

399
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,056
so I think it'll go farther.

400
00:17:56,056 --> 00:17:57,097
- Possibly go farther.

401
00:17:57,097 --> 00:17:58,974
- [Voiceover] Okay, alright.

402
00:17:58,974 --> 00:18:01,984
That would be interesting to try out.

403
00:18:01,984 --> 00:18:03,714
Does everybody see how this can apply

404
00:18:03,714 --> 00:18:05,154
to real life?

405
00:18:05,843 --> 00:18:08,053
- (inaudible)

406
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:11,334
- (Spanish)
Tienen preguntas?

407
00:18:12,723 --> 00:18:15,663
- (Spanish)
Hablan en ingles, no espanol.

408
00:18:19,324 --> 00:18:20,524
- [Voiceover] Can you
explain how this would apply

409
00:18:20,524 --> 00:18:23,563
to real life, if you
aren't just moon walking?

410
00:18:25,383 --> 00:18:26,413
- Jose?

411
00:18:26,413 --> 00:18:27,433
- Jenni?

412
00:18:27,433 --> 00:18:29,594
- Don't look at me.

413
00:18:30,563 --> 00:18:31,623
- I don't know.

414
00:18:31,623 --> 00:18:33,923
- [Voiceover] Go on the actual moon.

415
00:18:33,923 --> 00:18:35,954
- [Voiceover] Gym class.

416
00:18:35,954 --> 00:18:37,953
- [Voiceover] Yeah, gym class.

417
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:40,454
- [Voiceover] Does anybody
change out of their shoes

418
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:41,813
for gym class?

419
00:18:41,813 --> 00:18:42,923
- [Voiceover] Sometimes.

420
00:18:42,923 --> 00:18:44,544
- [Voiceover] Okay, some people do.

421
00:18:44,544 --> 00:18:45,413
- [Voiceover] I don't.

422
00:18:45,413 --> 00:18:46,843
- [Voiceover] You don't?

423
00:18:46,843 --> 00:18:48,253
- [Voiceover] Yeah, like
these shoes, they slide a lot

424
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:51,233
like, in the gym (inaudible).

425
00:18:51,233 --> 00:18:53,803
- [Voiceover] Okay, so it
might be different shoes

426
00:18:53,803 --> 00:18:55,763
for different jobs?

427
00:18:55,763 --> 00:18:57,742
- [Class] Yeah.

428
00:18:57,742 --> 00:18:59,743
- [Voiceover] Okay, well thank you.

429
00:18:59,743 --> 00:19:01,283
Nice job.

430
00:19:01,283 --> 00:19:03,783
Good, we have time for
our last presentation.

431
00:19:03,783 --> 00:19:04,683
Thank you.

432
00:19:04,683 --> 00:19:05,922
(clapping)

433
00:19:05,922 --> 00:19:08,171
Alright, sorry to rush everybody.

434
00:19:08,171 --> 00:19:10,503
I know you could talk more about it.

435
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:16,765
Thanks for being a good audience.

436
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:21,446
(class chatting)

437
00:19:27,505 --> 00:19:31,125
(class chatting)

438
00:19:39,365 --> 00:19:43,035
(class chatting)

439
00:19:47,685 --> 00:19:49,505
- Hello class, how are we doing today?

440
00:19:49,505 --> 00:19:50,998
- [Class] Good.

441
00:19:51,413 --> 00:19:54,798
- So our title was

442
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:57,248
dirty water versus clean water.

443
00:20:00,248 --> 00:20:01,724
Thank you.

444
00:20:01,724 --> 00:20:04,855
Our experiment had to do with a sailboat

445
00:20:04,855 --> 00:20:08,480
in four different types of water.
