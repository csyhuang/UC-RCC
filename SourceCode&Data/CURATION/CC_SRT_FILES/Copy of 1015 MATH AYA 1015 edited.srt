1
00:00:00,735 --> 00:00:02,520
- Three.

2
00:00:04,393 --> 00:00:06,644
- Oh, it makes like a cubic graph.

3
00:00:06,644 --> 00:00:08,468
- It's like a cube.

4
00:00:08,468 --> 00:00:10,121
- Oh, whoa, that's pretty cool.

5
00:00:10,121 --> 00:00:16,880
- What about...
what if only two of them are the same?

6
00:00:18,206 --> 00:00:30,546
- It's like a quadratic.
(inaudible)

7
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,065
- All right, so as we go
through the investigation now

8
00:00:34,065 --> 00:00:35,901
we're gonna look at,

9
00:00:35,901 --> 00:00:37,874
try to come up with conjecture for that.

10
00:00:37,874 --> 00:00:39,463
Numerically, why do
you think that happens?

11
00:00:39,463 --> 00:00:40,371
If two factors are the same.

12
00:00:40,371 --> 00:00:44,902
- Because it makes... like, 
because if you have two factors are the same

13
00:00:44,902 --> 00:00:49,191
that's the same as, like,
squaring one of the factors.

14
00:00:49,191 --> 00:00:52,177
- What happens if you square numbers?

15
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,822
- They become positive, I believe.

16
00:00:54,822 --> 00:00:57,296
So, it's always positive for that section.

17
00:00:57,296 --> 00:00:59,429
- Very nice.

18
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:01,460
Okay, keep on, keep on going with that.

19
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,747
- All right.

20
00:01:06,394 --> 00:01:10,009
- [Student] Just say A, B, C, D, E, etcetera.

21
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:13,056
E is the zeros of the law.

22
00:01:13,056 --> 00:01:15,280
- I'm on the first one.

23
00:01:15,558 --> 00:01:16,838
- Why are they the same?

24
00:01:16,838 --> 00:01:18,662
They're squared.

25
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:32,933
- (background chatter)

26
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:36,488
- Go to Google Docs.

27
00:01:36,488 --> 00:01:37,948
See if you can do files. 

28
00:01:37,948 --> 00:01:52,065
- The file is gray.

29
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:55,195
- Okay, so what's gonna happen is

30
00:01:55,195 --> 00:01:57,234
you're gonna have a factor formula.

31
00:01:57,234 --> 00:01:59,409
Unlike the other one we had it instead.

32
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:01,052
And what you want to look at is look

33
00:02:01,052 --> 00:02:03,142
at the factors, and look at the zeros.

34
00:02:03,142 --> 00:02:05,169
What's the relationship
between the factors and zeros.

35
00:02:05,169 --> 00:02:07,941
You may already know
what the relationship is.

36
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:10,822
Can you predict what it's gonna be?

37
00:02:10,822 --> 00:02:12,593
- That the factors tell you the zeros?

38
00:02:12,593 --> 00:02:14,981
Like the numbers and the factors

39
00:02:14,981 --> 00:02:17,626
tell you what the zeros are?

40
00:02:17,626 --> 00:02:19,845
- And why would that makes sense to you?

41
00:02:19,845 --> 00:02:23,482
- Oh, because when it's X and
you have a number after that,

42
00:02:23,482 --> 00:02:27,280
that's where it is on the X axis.

43
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,081
So, that could be where the zeros

44
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:31,385
in a set right, maybe?

45
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:33,050
- Teresa, does that make sense to you?

46
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,713
You look kinda confused.

47
00:02:34,713 --> 00:02:37,763
- Like, so X minus one is...

48
00:02:37,763 --> 00:02:38,937
No, that is wrong then.

49
00:02:38,937 --> 00:02:40,195
- Well here, look at your flag.

50
00:02:40,195 --> 00:02:42,734
Look right here. It's sittin' right here.

51
00:02:42,734 --> 00:02:44,121
So X minus one.

52
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:45,134
- So that's one.

53
00:02:45,134 --> 00:02:46,500
So, there's one one.

54
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,653
And then X minus two is the there too.

55
00:02:48,653 --> 00:02:51,939
- Oh, so it's the opposite of the form.

56
00:02:51,939 --> 00:03:01,008
- (background chatter)

57
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:04,963
- So, if you haven't factored form

58
00:03:04,963 --> 00:03:06,818
then you know that it's even zero.

59
00:03:06,818 --> 00:03:10,283
- (background chatter)

60
00:03:10,283 --> 00:03:11,723
- [Student] Yeah, yeah.

61
00:03:11,723 --> 00:03:14,389
It would be equal to zero right?

62
00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:15,542
- Yeah, you're right.

63
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:17,153
Remember in algebra one
the zero chronic thing?

64
00:03:17,153 --> 00:03:18,774
- Yeah.

65
00:03:18,774 --> 00:03:21,493
- All right, so that does make sense.

66
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:24,845
Does the end behavior make sense?

67
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:28,925
It's in factored form, but
what's the degree of that?

68
00:03:28,925 --> 00:03:30,791
- It's three.

69
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:31,688
- It's the third degree.

70
00:03:31,688 --> 00:03:32,806
- And what does a third degree,

71
00:03:32,806 --> 00:03:34,247
what did we learn last time.

72
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,634
- It can intersect three times.

73
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:37,010
- It can intersect three times.

74
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:37,586
Does it?

75
00:03:37,586 --> 00:03:38,885
- Yeah.

76
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,348
- And what's the end date?

77
00:03:40,348 --> 00:03:42,214
- Down and up.

78
00:03:42,214 --> 00:03:43,026
- Down and up.

79
00:03:43,026 --> 00:03:43,761
And it is, right?

80
00:03:43,761 --> 00:03:44,593
- Yup.

81
00:03:44,593 --> 00:03:45,179
- So, that makes sense.

82
00:03:45,179 --> 00:03:45,429
- That does make sense.

83
00:03:45,429 --> 00:03:47,984
- Why don't you try it
with quadratic factor here.

84
00:03:47,984 --> 00:03:49,958
And why don't you put in an extra factor.

85
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,356
- Just edit that.

86
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,610
- Just add that X, whatever
something we've not used yet.

87
00:03:55,576 --> 00:03:58,179
- What's the F in this one?

88
00:03:58,179 --> 00:03:58,925
- [Student] The eraser.

89
00:03:58,925 --> 00:04:00,087
- But you added this one, right?

90
00:04:00,087 --> 00:04:02,630
- Yeah.

91
00:04:04,429 --> 00:04:07,564
- So what do we except's gonna happen?

92
00:04:07,564 --> 00:04:08,642
How many zeros are we gonna get this time?

93
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:11,949
- [Student] Four?

94
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:14,476
- [Teacher] What's the degree?

95
00:04:14,476 --> 00:04:17,942
So, what should the end behavior be?

96
00:04:17,942 --> 00:04:18,636
Because you weren't here last time,

97
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:21,664
so let's see if you pick it up.

98
00:04:21,664 --> 00:04:22,316
So, if it's fourth degree,

99
00:04:22,316 --> 00:04:23,436
what's gonna happen on the right?

100
00:04:23,436 --> 00:04:25,391
What's gonna happen on the left?

101
00:04:27,798 --> 00:04:28,918
- [Student] Both... (inaudible.)
- [Teacher] Good.

102
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:31,051
- [Student] Yay.

103
00:04:31,051 --> 00:04:32,415
- [Student] High five.

104
00:04:32,415 --> 00:04:33,120
- [Teacher] Get rid of the space

105
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,358
after the parenthesis.

106
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:35,199
- [Student] Which one?

107
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,046
- [Student] Between the
parenthesis and the F.

108
00:04:37,046 --> 00:04:39,407
Yeah add a space.

109
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:41,908
- [Teacher] There's not an F.

110
00:04:41,908 --> 00:04:43,146
See the sliders here?

111
00:04:45,506 --> 00:04:47,167
- [Student] This F was
there to start out with.

112
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:49,956
So, just delete it then.
Yeah, just delete that.

113
00:04:51,903 --> 00:04:54,399
So, X minus E is just that.

114
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,540
- [Teacher] So we expect...
did it come out the way

115
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,948
you excepted it to come out?

116
00:05:00,948 --> 00:05:03,508
- [Student] Yeah, there's four zeros.

117
00:05:03,508 --> 00:05:04,647
- And if you slide those zeros,

118
00:05:04,647 --> 00:05:05,779
go ahead and slide some zeros

119
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:11,843
and see if it still makes sense.

120
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,983
- Oh, that's good.

121
00:05:14,983 --> 00:05:16,829
- Oh, because it changes whatever

122
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:18,642
the final one would be at.

123
00:05:18,642 --> 00:05:20,082
- So, if we had, like, X plus something,

124
00:05:20,082 --> 00:05:23,020
where is the actual zero?

125
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:27,889
- Oh, it is X plus something,

126
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:31,175
it's the actual place that it is

127
00:05:31,175 --> 00:05:33,618
instead of the opposite of the place.

128
00:05:33,618 --> 00:05:35,377
- So if we say X,

129
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:38,875
X plus three, where's the zero?

130
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:39,750
- Negative three.

131
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,155
- Does that make sense?

132
00:05:40,155 --> 00:05:41,351
Because X plus three equals zero.

133
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:41,979
- Yeah.

134
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:45,077
- All right, what's the
next question on there?

135
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,757
- Does the Y intercept change?

136
00:05:50,757 --> 00:05:52,645
- All right, so let's look at your zeros

137
00:05:52,645 --> 00:05:53,722
and look at your Y intercept.

138
00:05:53,722 --> 00:05:54,726
As you change the sliders,

139
00:05:54,726 --> 00:05:56,955
does the Y intercept change?

140
00:05:56,955 --> 00:05:57,531
- [Student] We can't see our Y intercept,

141
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:59,689
you gotta scroll out.

142
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,256
- Mr. Dillard, would you get me
me the mouse over there?

143
00:06:02,256 --> 00:06:03,034
The silver one.

144
00:06:03,034 --> 00:06:05,683
- Yeah, it's a lot easier
to do this with a mouse.

145
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:08,333
- [Student] I got it.

146
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,969
- [Student] Other way.

147
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:12,334
Because the Y intercept is...

148
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:13,593
- Now it might be really...

149
00:06:13,593 --> 00:06:14,327
- Yeah, it's right there.

150
00:06:14,327 --> 00:06:16,460
- Why don't we try making
some of these factors smaller,

151
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,794
so that we can see it a little better.

152
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:18,669
- [Male Student] I got it.

153
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:19,682
- [Female Student] Oh, fine.

154
00:06:19,682 --> 00:06:21,586
I see how it is.

155
00:06:24,663 --> 00:06:26,705
- [Student] Okay, can you see it?

156
00:06:27,756 --> 00:06:30,475
- [Student] It's like at negative 15.

157
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:32,588
- Okay, is there a relationship
between that Y intercept

158
00:06:32,588 --> 00:06:34,784
and the factors?

159
00:06:34,784 --> 00:06:36,902
Or the zeros?

160
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:38,294
Why don't you guys talk it over.

161
00:06:38,294 --> 00:06:40,577
- [Student] What are the zeros?

162
00:06:40,577 --> 00:06:42,849
- [Students] So, the zeros are,

163
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:44,352
what are the zeros?

164
00:06:44,352 --> 00:06:48,170
And the zeros are all the numbers that are,

165
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,355
they're the opposite of this.

166
00:06:49,355 --> 00:06:51,990
So, it would be negative
two, four and a half,

167
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,397
and one.

168
00:06:53,397 --> 00:06:55,998
- [Student] Wait, what's the Y intercept?

169
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,658
It's 15?
- [Student] Two.

170
00:07:00,114 --> 00:07:03,213
- Yeah, it's down here.

171
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:06,418
It's actually 18.

172
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:08,774
- And it's negative 18.

173
00:07:08,774 --> 00:07:12,626
- Four and a half times two is nine,

174
00:07:12,626 --> 00:07:14,984
times two is 18 times one.

175
00:07:14,984 --> 00:07:15,986
It's 18.

176
00:07:15,986 --> 00:07:17,511
You multiply all the end numbers together

177
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:19,473
and you get the Y intercept.

178
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:20,455
- Well, that's nice.

179
00:07:20,455 --> 00:07:21,511
- That is cool.

180
00:07:21,511 --> 00:07:22,407
- [Teacher] But, why does that make sense?

181
00:07:22,407 --> 00:07:23,378
Why would that work?

182
00:07:23,378 --> 00:07:26,313
- Why does that work?

183
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:28,923
- [Student] Oh! Because to get the Y intercept,

184
00:07:28,923 --> 00:07:30,107
the Y intercept doesn't have an X value

185
00:07:30,107 --> 00:07:31,055
so you just,

186
00:07:31,055 --> 00:07:33,211
in order to factor this equation,

187
00:07:33,211 --> 00:07:35,673
you would just multiply
all the end ones to get it.

188
00:07:35,673 --> 00:07:38,672
- Oh, yeah because it's the
numbers after X, like, almost...

189
00:07:38,672 --> 00:07:39,674
- zeros... zeros?

190
00:07:42,704 --> 00:07:44,633
- [Teacher] Well, are the numbers after
X the actual zeros?

191
00:07:44,633 --> 00:07:46,074
If it said X plus three.

192
00:07:46,074 --> 00:07:47,673
- The roots.

193
00:07:47,673 --> 00:07:50,809
- [Teacher] X plus three, what would
the zero be for that?

194
00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:52,292
- [Students] Negative.

195
00:07:52,292 --> 00:07:54,020
- So, they're the inverse of the zeros.

196
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:54,650
- The opposite.

197
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:57,458
- The opposite, yeah.

198
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,096
- [Teacher] You have to be careful
with the word inverse

199
00:07:59,096 --> 00:08:01,720
because it has a lot more meaning.

200
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,726
All right, so, if we know what the zeros are,

201
00:08:03,726 --> 00:08:05,944
and we multiply those and
we got the Y intercept, right?
- [Student] Yeah.

202
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,099
- [Teacher] What about A?

203
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:09,209
What happens when you slide A around?

204
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:10,824
Does that change?

205
00:08:11,181 --> 00:08:20,042
- [Student] Slide A around.

206
00:08:21,015 --> 00:08:21,993
- [Student] I already know what should happen.

207
00:08:21,993 --> 00:08:23,748
- [Student] You can just use the mouse.

208
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:27,625
- [Student] I can't click it.
- [Student] Move.

209
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,946
- [Student] Oh, that's why.

210
00:08:32,297 --> 00:08:34,633
- It changes the middle one.

211
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:35,731
- [Teacher] Did it change the zero?

212
00:08:35,731 --> 00:08:36,297
Start with that.

213
00:08:36,297 --> 00:08:37,726
Does it change the zeros at all?

214
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:38,900
- [Student] No.
- [Student] No.

215
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,817
- [Student] No, it doesn't change the zeros.

216
00:08:39,817 --> 00:08:42,697
- [Student] Well, okay, go back to...

217
00:08:42,697 --> 00:08:43,859
- [Student] It's not changing the zero.

218
00:08:43,859 --> 00:08:45,235
Well actually...

219
00:08:45,235 --> 00:08:48,222
- [Student] Well, it's just changing it's steepness.

220
00:08:48,222 --> 00:08:50,120
- [Student] Yeah, it's changing it's
steepness and the width,

221
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,530
but it's not changing the zeros.

222
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,553
- [Student] Well, yeah it does,

223
00:08:53,553 --> 00:08:56,029
because when it's flat then
every number's changed.

224
00:08:56,029 --> 00:08:58,876
- [Student] But when its flat, but that's only

225
00:08:58,876 --> 00:08:59,688
- [Student] If A is zero,

226
00:08:59,688 --> 00:09:02,162
since they're multiplying everything by A,

227
00:09:02,162 --> 00:09:05,309
then if A is zero, everything is zero.

228
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:08,700
- So, yeah, you have a zero
degree polynomial at that point.

229
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,185
- [Student] Yeah.
- [Student] Yeah.

230
00:09:11,185 --> 00:09:13,415
- Okay, so other than when A is zero...

231
00:09:13,415 --> 00:09:16,508
- [Student] All it's changing is the
steepness of the graph.

232
00:09:16,508 --> 00:09:18,053
And not changing the zeros.

233
00:09:18,053 --> 00:09:21,157
- So, does that change the Y intercept?

234
00:09:21,157 --> 00:09:24,234
- [Student] Um, yes, it is changing the Y intercept.

235
00:09:27,173 --> 00:09:31,984
But I think it still works out as, um,

236
00:09:31,984 --> 00:09:34,719
you can still multiply all of them together.

237
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:36,602
- [Teacher] Does that make sense?

238
00:09:36,602 --> 00:09:38,223
Check and see if it still works.

239
00:09:38,223 --> 00:09:39,097
- [Student] Oh, whatever A is,

240
00:09:39,097 --> 00:09:42,148
is A is the opposite of the Y intercept.

241
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,769
Because if A is four then
the Y intercept here is,

242
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:45,210
or that might just be...

243
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,289
- Well, that's a good conjecture.

244
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:48,569
Check some of the other things

245
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:50,168
and see if it still works.

246
00:09:50,168 --> 00:09:55,168
- [Student] Um, try changing, yeah.
- (background chatter)

247
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,936
- [Student] Yeah, no, that's not right.

248
00:09:58,936 --> 00:10:00,312
- That would be cool.

249
00:10:00,312 --> 00:10:01,657
- [Student] It was just the way I had it.

250
00:10:01,657 --> 00:10:02,733
- And, that's one of the
nice thing with the sliders,

251
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:04,194
because you might see a connection,

252
00:10:04,194 --> 00:10:05,902
but you can quickly see
if it works for all cases

253
00:10:05,902 --> 00:10:08,797
and not just one case.

254
00:10:09,315 --> 00:10:09,986
- [Student] The Y intercept is six.

255
00:10:09,986 --> 00:10:12,482
Yeah, it's still, ah,

256
00:10:12,482 --> 00:10:14,456
when you change A, it's still going to

257
00:10:14,456 --> 00:10:16,077
effect the Y intercept, and

258
00:10:16,077 --> 00:10:19,575
as changing, as multiplying
all the numbers together

259
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:22,929
and then multiplying by A.

260
00:10:23,884 --> 00:10:24,758
- [Teacher] Does that make sense?

261
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:25,569
- [Student] Yeah.

262
00:10:25,569 --> 00:10:27,169
- [Student] So, all those numbers
multiplied together is still...

263
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:28,130
six.

264
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:28,983
Keep going with this,

265
00:10:28,983 --> 00:10:30,263
because the next thing
we're gonna look at is

266
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,214
what happens when some of
the zeros are the same.

267
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,569
When we use the factor more than once.

268
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:34,752
Okay?

269
00:10:34,752 --> 00:10:36,726
Keep going.

270
00:10:36,726 --> 00:10:48,731
- (background chatter)

271
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:51,796
- [Student] Are we on six now?

272
00:10:51,796 --> 00:10:53,385
- [Student] Yes.

273
00:10:53,385 --> 00:10:55,051
- [Student] What happens when two or more factors

274
00:10:55,051 --> 00:10:56,810
are the same?

275
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,090
So, make E and E.

276
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,580
- [Student] I'm gonna make them all three.

277
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,924
- [Student] I work hard for you guys,

278
00:11:03,924 --> 00:11:06,079
you criticize me.

279
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,567
- [Student] Um, the E, the E.

280
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,617
Oh, it makes the,

281
00:11:12,617 --> 00:11:13,876
when they're the same...

282
00:11:13,876 --> 00:11:21,030
- (background chatter)

283
00:11:23,857 --> 00:11:25,746
- [Teacher] Try changing one of them.
Try changing one of the sliders.

284
00:11:25,746 --> 00:11:34,262
- (background chatter)

285
00:11:36,633 --> 00:11:37,518
- [Student] We figured that one.

286
00:11:37,518 --> 00:11:39,843
It just turns out to be the opposite.

287
00:11:41,653 --> 00:11:43,641
- [Teacher] So, go ahead and change one slider.

288
00:11:43,641 --> 00:11:45,188
Just pick one other than A.

289
00:11:45,188 --> 00:11:47,177
Pick B or something like that.

290
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:52,269
- The opposite of that
variable becomes the...

291
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:53,101
- Y intercept.

292
00:11:53,101 --> 00:11:54,574
- That doesn't explain the zeros.
- [Teacher] Now, something we want to find out,

293
00:11:59,204 --> 00:12:01,070
- Is there a relationship
between the zeros

294
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,379
and the Y intercept?

295
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:03,883
- Oh, there is.

296
00:12:03,883 --> 00:12:05,610
When you change the Y, then the zeros

297
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:10,240
equal the opposite of the Y intercept.

298
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,885
- Okay, what happens if you change two?

299
00:12:12,885 --> 00:12:13,898
- [Student] No, it doesn't.

300
00:12:13,898 --> 00:12:15,018
Oh yeah, yeah it does.

301
00:12:15,018 --> 00:12:17,045
- Oh yeah, zero does.

302
00:12:17,045 --> 00:12:20,117
The one that isn't the
same numerical I think.

303
00:12:20,117 --> 00:12:21,865
- [Student] The right most zero becomes it.

304
00:12:21,865 --> 00:12:23,220
- When you move them, the Y intercept

305
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,880
and the zero both change at the same rate.
 
306
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,208
Because if you move, like, C
steadily to the left,

307
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,984
once C is two, negative two...

308
00:12:37,884 --> 00:12:39,305
- [Student] Jacob said, "Half the time, when you

309
00:12:39,305 --> 00:12:41,417
multiply them all together you get it."

310
00:12:41,417 --> 00:12:45,645
- (background chatter)

311
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:51,191
- [Student] Yeah, that's what we're discussing.
- [background chatter]

312
00:12:53,948 --> 00:12:55,901
- [Student] The absolute value of the Y intercept

313
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:58,013
and then the absolute value of the zero,

314
00:12:58,013 --> 00:13:01,943
if two of the factors
are the same that's in.

315
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,407
- [Student] If all of the variables are
the same except one of them,

316
00:13:06,407 --> 00:13:08,625
it becomes the zero,

317
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:11,932
it becomes the zero and the
opposite of the Y intercept.

318
00:13:11,932 --> 00:13:14,933
- [Teacher] So, now as you slide,
you'll actually be able to see the Y intercept.

319
00:13:17,745 --> 00:13:18,949
- [Student] If you set
all the variables the same

320
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:20,730
and change one of them,

321
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,821
it becomes the zero and the opposite

322
00:13:22,821 --> 00:13:24,902
of the Y intercept.

323
00:13:24,902 --> 00:13:42,949
- [Teacher] Okay, so on Dave's right here...
(background chatter)

324
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,308
- [Student] Yeah the multiplication, 
in case you, like,

325
00:13:46,308 --> 00:13:49,443
if you multiply all the zeros together,

326
00:13:49,443 --> 00:13:51,492
you get the opposite of the Y intercept.

327
00:13:51,492 --> 00:14:07,517
- (background chatter)

328
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:12,450
- [Student] Does it have to do
with the factor formula?

329
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,947
- [Teacher] Yeah.
- [Student] Yeah.

330
00:14:14,785 --> 00:14:16,919
- [Teacher] So, the absolute value of the...

331
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:21,029
- If you multiply the zero,

332
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:38,656
- [Teacher] So, does it make sense algebraically?

333
00:14:38,656 --> 00:14:39,755
- [Student] Yes.

334
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:41,609
- Why does it make sense algebraically?

335
00:14:41,609 --> 00:14:44,373
- When you find the factor
with that new grouping

336
00:14:44,373 --> 00:14:46,730
you have to, it becomes the opposite.

337
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,895
- But Y intercepts, algebraically.

338
00:14:48,895 --> 00:14:50,302
- [Student] Because the Y intercept is when

339
00:14:50,302 --> 00:14:52,094
all the X's are zeros,
so you're just left with

340
00:14:52,094 --> 00:14:54,324
the one that doesn't have an X on it.

341
00:14:54,324 --> 00:14:57,512
And that is the multiplication
of all the factors.

342
00:14:57,512 --> 00:14:59,987
All the numbers.
