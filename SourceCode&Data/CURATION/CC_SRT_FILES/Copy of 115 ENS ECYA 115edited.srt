1
00:00:00,431 --> 00:00:02,479
So, what we're going to do then

2
00:00:02,479 --> 00:00:04,638
is try to find two words, just like

3
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:06,222
Fernando and Nicolet told us

4
00:00:06,222 --> 00:00:08,179
that mean the same thing.

5
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:10,406
So here are some little friends

6
00:00:10,406 --> 00:00:12,369
poking out of this wall

7
00:00:12,369 --> 00:00:13,589
and I'm going to read these words to you

8
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:15,248
in case they're a little
hard for you to read

9
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:17,081
and then I'm going to ask
for volunteers to come up

10
00:00:17,081 --> 00:00:19,870
and match synonyms, okay?

11
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:22,228
If you want to read them
with me you can, okay?

12
00:00:22,228 --> 00:00:27,895
- [Class and Teacher] Happy, tiny, small,

13
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:31,724
silent, little,

14
00:00:31,724 --> 00:00:35,424
quiet, glad.

15
00:00:35,424 --> 00:00:35,959
- [Teacher] Right.

16
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:37,039
Some of these words too

17
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:39,805
you might not even know what they mean,

18
00:00:39,805 --> 00:00:42,982
but once you work with
synonyms a little bit

19
00:00:42,982 --> 00:00:44,944
you're going to actually
make your vocabulary

20
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:45,861
a little better.

21
00:00:45,861 --> 00:00:47,916
You're going to learn
what more words mean.

22
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:49,739
Okay, so that'll help
you read and everything.

23
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:51,341
Nicolet.

24
00:00:51,341 --> 00:00:53,707
- [Voiceover] That's silent and quiet.

25
00:00:53,707 --> 00:00:55,369
- Okay, you want to
come up and match those?

26
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:59,505
Let me put it on pen.

27
00:00:59,505 --> 00:01:03,507
Okay.

28
00:01:03,507 --> 00:01:06,409
You have to move over a little bit.

29
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:07,340
Great, okay.

30
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,116
Is she right guys?

31
00:01:09,116 --> 00:01:09,845
Good.

32
00:01:09,845 --> 00:01:11,946
How did you know that those were synonyms?

33
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:15,791
- Because both of them

34
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:24,189
mean that...

35
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:29,030
Because both of them mean...

36
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,935
Both of them mean the same thing.

37
00:01:30,935 --> 00:01:32,971
- [Teacher] Okay, they mean the same thing

38
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:35,492
or what else, Jabril?

39
00:01:35,492 --> 00:01:37,277
Oh, you have another one you want to mark?

40
00:01:37,277 --> 00:01:38,505
They mean the same thing right.

41
00:01:38,505 --> 00:01:41,236
You can make up a sentence like

42
00:01:41,236 --> 00:01:44,703
we should be quiet in the library

43
00:01:44,703 --> 00:01:46,781
and then you could take out the word quiet

44
00:01:46,781 --> 00:01:48,266
and put silent in.

45
00:01:48,266 --> 00:01:51,019
We should be silent in the library.

46
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:52,611
That's how you can check it

47
00:01:52,611 --> 00:01:53,539
to make sure of it.

48
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:54,559
- It's like a better word.

49
00:01:54,559 --> 00:01:56,138
- A better word, quiet or silent.

50
00:01:56,138 --> 00:01:58,286
Okay, Fernando, you see one?

51
00:01:58,286 --> 00:02:03,196
Okay, what do you see?

52
00:02:03,196 --> 00:02:03,876
Oh great.

53
00:02:03,876 --> 00:02:06,249
Can you tell us what you have?

54
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:07,770
- Happy and glad.

55
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,176
- [Teacher] Happy and glad.

56
00:02:09,176 --> 00:02:11,336
Okay, pick a sentence for those.

57
00:02:11,336 --> 00:02:12,633
Can you think of a sentence?

58
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,382
- I'm happy.

59
00:02:14,382 --> 00:02:15,524
- [Teacher] Because?

60
00:02:15,524 --> 00:02:18,937
- Because my birthday is coming.

61
00:02:18,937 --> 00:02:21,608
- Okay, I'm happy because
my birthday is coming.

62
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,130
Let's take out happy.

63
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,403
You guys can take it and throw it away.

64
00:02:25,403 --> 00:02:27,780
Take out happy and put this word in.

65
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,536
- Glad.

66
00:02:28,536 --> 00:02:30,454
- Okay, now say the sentence with glad.

67
00:02:30,454 --> 00:02:34,215
- I'm glad because my birthday is coming.

68
00:02:34,215 --> 00:02:35,775
- Alright, very good (applauding).

69
00:02:35,775 --> 00:02:37,159
Okay, you ready Jabril?

70
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:44,241
You got one?

71
00:02:44,241 --> 00:02:46,291
Okay, what did you find?

72
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,251
- Smiley and little.

73
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:51,609
No, small and little.

74
00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:53,013
- Okay, is he right guys?

75
00:02:53,013 --> 00:02:54,786
- [Class] Yes.
- He is, very good.

76
00:02:54,786 --> 00:02:58,580
You started to say
smiley and little, right?

77
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,574
But then you said, wait a minute,

78
00:03:00,574 --> 00:03:02,232
those aren't...

79
00:03:02,232 --> 00:03:02,976
What is that called?

80
00:03:02,976 --> 00:03:03,840
Those aren't...

81
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,419
- Right.

82
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:06,245
- Synonyms, right?

83
00:03:06,245 --> 00:03:09,284
So then you remembered that
word is small and little.

84
00:03:09,284 --> 00:03:10,402
Okay, very good.

85
00:03:10,402 --> 00:03:11,368
Anyone else?

86
00:03:11,368 --> 00:03:11,993
Who hasn't gone?

87
00:03:11,993 --> 00:03:13,258
Barbara.

88
00:03:13,258 --> 00:03:15,293
- But there's no words.

89
00:03:15,293 --> 00:03:16,990
- Is that all of them, alright good.

90
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,384
- [Voiceover] No.

91
00:03:18,384 --> 00:03:22,190
Tiny and little.

92
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,686
- Oh, small, little, and tiny,

93
00:03:24,686 --> 00:03:30,370
they all go together, don't they?

94
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,002
That's right, there's
three words that mean

95
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:32,825
the same thing.

96
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:34,933
Small, tiny, and little.

97
00:03:34,933 --> 00:03:38,003
Okay, so there can be more
than one synonym for a word.

98
00:03:38,003 --> 00:03:39,872
That's a good point.

99
00:03:39,872 --> 00:03:42,892
Do you guys want to
practice saying synonym?

100
00:03:42,892 --> 00:03:44,516
Cause it sounds likes it's hard to say.

101
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:45,920
Let's clap it, ready.

102
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,683
- [Teacher and Class] (clapping) Synonym.

103
00:03:48,683 --> 00:03:49,717
- Let's try again.

104
00:03:49,717 --> 00:03:51,309
- [Teacher and Class] (clapping) Synonym.

105
00:03:51,309 --> 00:03:52,333
- Let's just slow down a minute.

106
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:56,980
- [Teacher and Class]
(clapping) Syn, o, nym.

107
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,394
(clapping) Syn, o, nym.

108
00:03:59,394 --> 00:04:00,160
(laughs)

109
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,901
- Alright, we'll keep practicing.

110
00:04:02,901 --> 00:04:05,323
Okay, now we need to read these sentences

111
00:04:05,323 --> 00:04:09,803
and find out which ones have synonyms.

112
00:04:09,803 --> 00:04:11,378
Okay, let's start with this one.

113
00:04:11,378 --> 00:04:13,020
Nicolet, can you read that?

114
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,493
- The dog is angry.

115
00:04:15,493 --> 00:04:17,584
The dog is mad.

116
00:04:17,584 --> 00:04:18,985
- [Teacher] Are those synonyms?

117
00:04:18,985 --> 00:04:19,708
- [Class] Yes.

118
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,482
- [Teacher] Which two words?

119
00:04:21,482 --> 00:04:22,798
- Angry and mad.

120
00:04:22,798 --> 00:04:27,537
- [Teacher] Okay, you want to come on up?

121
00:04:27,537 --> 00:04:31,339
You're going to circle those
sentences and that dog.

122
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:39,397
Look at his face too.

123
00:04:39,397 --> 00:04:43,238
Okay, if you're writing,
you could use the word mad.

124
00:04:43,238 --> 00:04:45,226
That's kind of, like I just call it

125
00:04:45,226 --> 00:04:46,636
a first grade word, sort of.

126
00:04:46,636 --> 00:04:48,183
You want to bet a sparkle word

127
00:04:48,183 --> 00:04:50,064
so you could say he's angry.

128
00:04:50,064 --> 00:04:52,792
You could also say he furious.

129
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,056
The dog is furious.

130
00:04:55,056 --> 00:04:57,215
That's an even better word, right?

131
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,422
A better synonym.

132
00:04:58,422 --> 00:05:00,138
Jabril, you want to do the next one?

133
00:05:00,138 --> 00:05:01,868
Okay, can you read these?

134
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,280
- The dog it sick.

135
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,630
The dog is ill.

136
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,037
- So sick and ill, are those synonyms?

137
00:05:07,037 --> 00:05:10,749
Good.

138
00:05:10,749 --> 00:05:12,630
Oh, you're getting
creative with our circles.

139
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,387
Okay, Barbara, you want to read this one?

140
00:05:16,387 --> 00:05:18,156
- The dog is sad.

141
00:05:18,156 --> 00:05:20,884
The dog is crying.

142
00:05:20,884 --> 00:05:24,669
- Okay, are those synonyms?

143
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:28,368
- Yes.

144
00:05:28,368 --> 00:05:31,584
- Well, sort of.

145
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:34,929
He would be crying if he's sad.

146
00:05:34,929 --> 00:05:38,242
I'm not sure that they
mean the same thing.

147
00:05:38,242 --> 00:05:41,631
Like if you said, Barbara fell down

148
00:05:41,631 --> 00:05:45,249
and now she is crying.

149
00:05:45,249 --> 00:05:48,406
Right, that's something
that you do, right?

150
00:05:48,406 --> 00:05:50,309
Barbara fell down and now she is sad,

151
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:52,257
but it doesn't really mean the same thing.

152
00:05:52,257 --> 00:05:53,616
It's close.

153
00:05:53,616 --> 00:05:55,403
You want to try this one?

154
00:05:55,403 --> 00:05:57,520
- The dog is happy.

155
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,480
The dog is glad.

156
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,881
- Okay, happy and glad,

157
00:06:00,881 --> 00:06:02,255
do those mean the same thing?

158
00:06:02,255 --> 00:06:03,795
What do you guys think?

159
00:06:03,795 --> 00:06:05,024
Yes, you agree?

160
00:06:05,024 --> 00:06:06,920
Okay, so then she's
going to circle that one.

161
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:14,119
Put a big circle around the whole thing.

162
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:16,004
Okay, great.

163
00:06:16,004 --> 00:06:17,455
OK, who hasn't had a turn?

164
00:06:17,455 --> 00:06:19,696
Fernando, can you read this one?

165
00:06:19,696 --> 00:06:22,565
- The dog is surprised.

166
00:06:22,565 --> 00:06:24,895
- [Teacher] Oh, good reading.

167
00:06:24,895 --> 00:06:28,855
- The dog is--
- Scared.

168
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:29,472
- Scared.

169
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,444
- So surprised, see his face?

170
00:06:31,444 --> 00:06:35,363
Is surprised and scared,
are those synonyms?

171
00:06:35,363 --> 00:06:36,309
- Yes.

172
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:38,183
- Okay, who says yes?

173
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:39,433
Fernando says yes.

174
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:42,345
Who says no?

175
00:06:42,345 --> 00:06:43,966
Okay, what do you think?

176
00:06:43,966 --> 00:06:45,607
If I'm surprised, I just walked in

177
00:06:45,607 --> 00:06:47,180
and everyone's throwing me a party,

178
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,435
I said (gasps) I'm so surprised.

179
00:06:50,435 --> 00:06:53,555
Would I also say I'm so scared?

180
00:06:53,555 --> 00:06:54,031
- No.

181
00:06:54,031 --> 00:06:56,058
- [Teacher] No, I'd
probably be really happy.

182
00:06:56,058 --> 00:06:57,173
So are these synonyms?

183
00:06:57,173 --> 00:06:57,755
- [Class] No.

184
00:06:57,755 --> 00:07:01,818
- No, okay, nice job guys.

185
00:07:01,818 --> 00:07:06,490
Okay, let me see where I want to go.

186
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,767
Okay.

187
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:09,213
Alright, the next thing we're going to do

188
00:07:09,213 --> 00:07:11,530
before we do this, is I'm going to see

189
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:16,074
if you can match some synonyms

190
00:07:16,074 --> 00:07:17,767
with a fishbowl and a fish.

191
00:07:17,767 --> 00:07:20,564
Who likes fish?

192
00:07:20,564 --> 00:07:21,284
Really?

193
00:07:21,284 --> 00:07:23,558
What's your favorite animal?

194
00:07:23,558 --> 00:07:24,406
Favorite pet?

195
00:07:24,406 --> 00:07:26,368
Do you have a favorite pet?

196
00:07:26,368 --> 00:07:28,142
Do you like (mumbles)?

197
00:07:28,142 --> 00:07:28,760
- Dog.

198
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,886
- [Teacher] You like dogs?

199
00:07:29,886 --> 00:07:30,641
- Cats.

200
00:07:30,641 --> 00:07:31,860
- [Teacher] You like cats?

201
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,707
- (mumbles)

202
00:07:32,707 --> 00:07:34,739
- [Teacher] Do cats eat fish sometimes?

203
00:07:34,739 --> 00:07:35,644
- Yeah.

204
00:07:35,644 --> 00:07:37,420
- [Teacher] Uh-oh, uh-oh, well.

205
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,259
- They eat mouse.

206
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,291
- [Teacher] They eat mice, right.

207
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:41,948
- Fish.

208
00:07:41,948 --> 00:07:44,003
- [Teacher] Well, we're
going to do a fish game

209
00:07:44,003 --> 00:07:46,441
and you're going to do
this with a partner.

210
00:07:46,441 --> 00:07:48,043
Okay, I'm going to ask Jabril and Barbara

211
00:07:48,043 --> 00:07:49,703
to sit at the back table.

212
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:51,362
Hold on a minute, wait
for your directions.

213
00:07:51,362 --> 00:07:52,502
And we are going to move those things

214
00:07:52,502 --> 00:07:53,872
out of the way.

215
00:07:53,872 --> 00:07:56,877
And you're going to see if you can match

216
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:58,722
the synonyms together.

217
00:07:58,722 --> 00:08:01,215
The fish with the fishbowl, okay?

218
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:04,017
Now be sure like when we've
worked with pairs before

219
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:06,008
that one person's not doing all the work

220
00:08:06,008 --> 00:08:10,034
and the other person is
just, you know, watching.

221
00:08:10,034 --> 00:08:12,120
Okay, make sure if you
think two words go together

222
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,895
then you say, do you think these words,

223
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,659
or are these synonyms?

224
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:18,391
You need to talk to your partner.

225
00:08:18,391 --> 00:08:22,570
You need to agree, okay?

226
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:26,869
So you two can go to the
back table with those.

227
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:27,896
Mix them all up.

228
00:08:27,896 --> 00:08:31,517
Mix all your fish up and
put them on fishbowl pouch.

229
00:08:31,517 --> 00:08:33,852
Okay, and I'll come over and
help you read some of the words

230
00:08:33,852 --> 00:08:40,047
that you might have trouble with.

231
00:08:40,047 --> 00:08:42,486
Okay, mix them all up.

232
00:08:42,486 --> 00:08:43,766
And I'm going to walk around,

233
00:08:43,766 --> 00:08:46,030
but I want you to try
to work kind of your own

234
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,669
a little bit with your partner.

235
00:08:48,669 --> 00:08:51,333
Okay, so let me help you read this word.

236
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:56,306
Tease, messy,

237
00:08:56,306 --> 00:09:00,726
speedy, sleep,

238
00:09:00,726 --> 00:09:02,601
sprint.

239
00:09:02,601 --> 00:09:05,289
Okay, so those are your fishbowls.

240
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:09,613
Run, fast,

241
00:09:09,613 --> 00:09:12,916
sloppy.

242
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:15,749
This looks like brother, but it's bother.

243
00:09:15,749 --> 00:09:16,666
- Bother.

244
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,525
- And doze.

245
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:19,123
Doze.

246
00:09:19,123 --> 00:09:23,005
Okay, so you guys can sort of
see what you can put together

247
00:09:23,005 --> 00:09:25,535
and I'll be back in a minute, okay?

248
00:09:25,535 --> 00:09:27,906
Make sure you're talking to each other.

249
00:09:27,906 --> 00:09:29,873
Do you need help reading?

250
00:09:29,873 --> 00:09:33,326
Stare, mad.

251
00:09:33,326 --> 00:09:36,227
(mumbles)

252
00:09:36,227 --> 00:09:40,628
Friendly, scream.

253
00:09:40,628 --> 00:09:43,216
This is nice, angry,

254
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:47,335
(mumbles), yell, (mumbles).

255
00:09:47,335 --> 00:09:51,513
So you need to talk to your partner.

256
00:09:51,513 --> 00:09:52,423
Says.

257
00:09:52,423 --> 00:09:55,501
- (mumbles)

258
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:56,718
I want to put it on speedy.

259
00:09:56,718 --> 00:09:59,168
- Oh, speedy, yeah that's right.

260
00:09:59,168 --> 00:10:00,967
- [Teacher] Hold on, she's talking to you.

261
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,057
- I want to put it on...

262
00:10:03,057 --> 00:10:04,278
- [Teacher] Friendly.

263
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:06,550
Do you agree that those are synonyms?

264
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,798
Okay.

265
00:10:07,798 --> 00:10:09,184
- Can you help me with this word?

266
00:10:09,184 --> 00:10:15,883
- Angry.

267
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:16,790
- Tease.

268
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:22,912
- [Teacher] Tease.

269
00:10:22,912 --> 00:10:25,407
- Okay, look.

270
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:30,807
- [Teacher] What word
means the same as tease?

271
00:10:30,807 --> 00:10:33,768
Did you talk to your partner about those?

272
00:10:33,768 --> 00:10:35,703
Make sure he agrees with what you chose.

273
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:37,461
- What was this?

274
00:10:37,461 --> 00:10:38,448
- [Teacher] Doze.

275
00:10:38,448 --> 00:10:42,582
- Doze and sleep.

276
00:10:42,582 --> 00:10:45,460
- [Teacher] Are those synonyms?

277
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,617
Okay, do you know what--

278
00:10:46,617 --> 00:10:48,481
It's hard if you don't
know what a word means

279
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,438
so I can help you.

280
00:10:51,438 --> 00:10:53,191
Do you know what the word doze means?

281
00:10:53,191 --> 00:10:56,971
- Yeah, it means that like you're tired.

282
00:10:56,971 --> 00:10:59,184
- Um-hum, and you might doze off.

283
00:10:59,184 --> 00:11:01,191
Like if you're watching
TV and all of a sudden

284
00:11:01,191 --> 00:11:04,070
your eyes are closed, you dozed off.

285
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,150
- And then sleep.

286
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:05,907
- And sleep.

287
00:11:05,907 --> 00:11:09,471
Okay, so do you agree with that?

288
00:11:09,471 --> 00:11:15,450
Which ones did you pick there?

289
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,534
- Scream.

290
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:18,396
- Okay.

291
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:26,727
- (mumbles)

292
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,887
- Did you ask her?

293
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:30,709
- No, I didn't.

294
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:34,086
- No, ask her.

295
00:11:34,086 --> 00:11:35,284
- Is this bother?

296
00:11:35,284 --> 00:11:37,911
- Yes.

297
00:11:37,911 --> 00:11:43,651
- Do you know what bother and tease mean?

298
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:46,691
- They both mean like they're bothering.

299
00:11:46,691 --> 00:11:49,749
- Okay, like my sister keeps bothering me.

300
00:11:49,749 --> 00:11:52,951
My sister keeps...

301
00:11:52,951 --> 00:11:55,068
- Touching me.

302
00:11:55,068 --> 00:11:55,658
Teasing me.

303
00:11:55,658 --> 00:11:56,597
- Teasing me, right.

304
00:11:56,597 --> 00:11:59,993
You can use those words
kind of the same, right?

305
00:11:59,993 --> 00:12:03,102
Okay, so you can run around the track

306
00:12:03,102 --> 00:12:05,827
or you can sprint around the track.

307
00:12:05,827 --> 00:12:08,239
This one actually goes here.

308
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:10,792
Now you have speedy and messy,

309
00:12:10,792 --> 00:12:16,774
sloppy and fast.

310
00:12:16,774 --> 00:12:19,622
Okay, what'd you find?

311
00:12:19,622 --> 00:12:20,911
Stare.

312
00:12:20,911 --> 00:12:24,828
- This means because

313
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:27,151
they both mean that they're matched

314
00:12:27,151 --> 00:12:29,854
and this one (mumbles).

315
00:12:29,854 --> 00:12:31,438
- [Teacher] Scream and yell, right.

316
00:12:31,438 --> 00:12:38,287
- (mumbles)

317
00:12:38,287 --> 00:12:39,952
- [Teacher] Soaked.

318
00:12:39,952 --> 00:12:40,509
Great.

319
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,037
Okay, looked and stare.

320
00:12:42,037 --> 00:12:43,418
Nice and friendly.

321
00:12:43,418 --> 00:12:44,877
Angry and mad.

322
00:12:44,877 --> 00:12:46,300
Wet and soaked.

323
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,604
Yelled and screamed, awesome.

324
00:12:47,604 --> 00:12:50,228
Okay, bring your fishbowls back over.

325
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,028
Okay, how'd everybody do over here?

326
00:12:52,028 --> 00:12:52,825
- [Class] Good.

327
00:12:52,825 --> 00:12:58,031
- Okay, everybody choose
one bowl and one fish.

328
00:12:58,031 --> 00:13:03,929
Just one that you think you
can make a sentence up with.

329
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:06,392
Okay.

330
00:13:06,392 --> 00:13:10,177
So you can choose any
bowl with a matching fish

331
00:13:10,177 --> 00:13:12,067
and you have to make up a sentence

332
00:13:12,067 --> 00:13:13,694
where you're going to use both words,

333
00:13:13,694 --> 00:13:17,730
both synonyms.

334
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,554
Okay, Barbara, you ready?

335
00:13:20,554 --> 00:13:21,304
What did you find?

336
00:13:21,304 --> 00:13:22,146
Which two words?

337
00:13:22,146 --> 00:13:23,550
Tell us your words first.

338
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,885
- Friendly and nice.

339
00:13:24,885 --> 00:13:27,722
- [Teacher] Okay, so are you
ready to make up a sentence?

340
00:13:27,722 --> 00:13:31,005
- I am nice and friendly.

341
00:13:31,005 --> 00:13:34,632
- [Teacher] Okay, you put
them in the same sentence.

342
00:13:34,632 --> 00:13:36,349
Does anybody have a way that she could

343
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:38,793
make her sentence different,

344
00:13:38,793 --> 00:13:42,136
because nice and friendly
could mean anything.

345
00:13:42,136 --> 00:13:45,574
You have an idea?

346
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,615
- This time I'm using friendly.

347
00:13:47,615 --> 00:13:49,282
- [Teacher] Okay.

348
00:13:49,282 --> 00:13:53,973
- I am friendly.

349
00:13:53,973 --> 00:13:55,754
- [Teacher] How about a new classmate?

350
00:13:55,754 --> 00:13:58,404
- Yeah, a new classmate.

351
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,036
- Okay, so that's using friendly.

352
00:14:00,036 --> 00:14:01,709
Now you're going to take out this word

353
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:03,622
and use the synonym, I am?

354
00:14:03,622 --> 00:14:07,062
- I am nice to everybody in my--

355
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:07,979
- [Teacher] To the new--

356
00:14:07,979 --> 00:14:09,268
- New student.

357
00:14:09,268 --> 00:14:10,126
- [Teacher] Classmate, right.

358
00:14:10,126 --> 00:14:11,530
You use the same words in your sentence.

359
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,945
You just are going to change your synonym.

360
00:14:13,945 --> 00:14:15,875
Okay, good job, very good job.

361
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:19,265
Okay, Nicolet.

362
00:14:19,265 --> 00:14:20,538
Show us your words first.

363
00:14:20,538 --> 00:14:21,852
What do you got?

364
00:14:21,852 --> 00:14:23,929
- Doze and sleep.

365
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,555
- [Teacher] Okay.

366
00:14:25,555 --> 00:14:27,464
- I'm using the doze.

367
00:14:27,464 --> 00:14:33,015
Doze means that I am...

368
00:14:33,015 --> 00:14:34,960
- [Teacher] You can put
I-N-G at the end if you want.

369
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,701
Like dozing.

370
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:40,507
- I am dozing out in the car.

371
00:14:40,507 --> 00:14:42,108
- [Teacher] (laughs) Okay.

372
00:14:42,108 --> 00:14:44,303
I am dozing out in the car.

373
00:14:44,303 --> 00:14:47,484
- And then I am sleeping in the car.

374
00:14:47,484 --> 00:14:49,608
- [Teacher] Okay, did she do that right?

375
00:14:49,608 --> 00:14:51,164
- Um-hum, yes.

376
00:14:51,164 --> 00:14:52,243
- [Teacher] It makes me
think of when you're on

377
00:14:52,243 --> 00:14:54,440
a long trip, right?

378
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,401
Has that ever happened to you?

379
00:14:55,401 --> 00:14:56,440
- Um-hum.

380
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,656
- [Teacher] Yeah, when have you done that?

381
00:14:58,656 --> 00:15:01,020
- I've done that when
we went to Charlotte.

382
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,588
- [Teacher] Okay, and you took
a little sleep in the car?

383
00:15:02,588 --> 00:15:03,357
- Um-hum.

384
00:15:03,357 --> 00:15:05,440
- [Teacher] Okay, alright, Fernando.
