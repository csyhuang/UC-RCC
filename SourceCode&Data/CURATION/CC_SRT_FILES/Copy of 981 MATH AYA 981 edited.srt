1
00:00:00,828 --> 00:00:02,413
- [Teacher] Okay, you guys based

2
00:00:02,413 --> 00:00:04,953
on the answer tickets
that we took yesterday,

3
00:00:04,953 --> 00:00:06,563
what we realized, or what I realized,

4
00:00:06,563 --> 00:00:08,197
is that there's still confusion

5
00:00:08,197 --> 00:00:10,732
on going from the general to factor.

6
00:00:10,732 --> 00:00:13,577
General to vertex, or
vice versa on any of those

7
00:00:13,577 --> 00:00:14,788
three particular forms.

8
00:00:14,788 --> 00:00:17,465
Also, another objective we're gonna do is

9
00:00:17,465 --> 00:00:19,279
we're gonna figure out- determine why each

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,105
form is important. So, the first
thing I want you guys to do

11
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,068
is, I want you guys to look at number one

12
00:00:24,068 --> 00:00:25,838
on that task card. Can
someone read it out loud?

13
00:00:25,838 --> 00:00:26,915
- [Drew] I will.

14
00:00:26,915 --> 00:00:29,241
- [Teacher] Yeah, Drew.

15
00:00:29,241 --> 00:00:31,651
- [Drew] The Angry
Bird was blasted through a

16
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:33,986
slingshot at the initial
height of 45 meters.

17
00:00:33,986 --> 00:00:36,996
The bird's initial velocity
was 14.7 meters per second.

18
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:39,628
Write an equation that gives
the height of the Angry Bird

19
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:40,962
as a function of time.

20
00:00:40,962 --> 00:00:42,807
- [Teacher] Okay, so what
I need you guys to do is

21
00:00:42,807 --> 00:00:46,864
I need you guys to write that
equation on the white board.

22
00:00:50,554 --> 00:01:01,612
- (background chatter)

23
00:01:03,053 --> 00:01:04,447
- [Teacher] Okay, so now I want people

24
00:01:04,447 --> 00:01:06,544
to put it up on the board.

25
00:01:06,544 --> 00:01:11,098
Okay. 

26
00:01:13,308 --> 00:01:15,015
Okay, so can you guys look
around to each other too,

27
00:01:15,015 --> 00:01:16,753
I know you guys are gonna want to, 

28
00:01:16,753 --> 00:01:24,593
like, show everybody what people are getting.
- [Students] Yay...Cool...

29
00:01:26,985 --> 00:01:29,021
- [Teacher] Okay, guys,
these are the four things,

30
00:01:29,021 --> 00:01:33,377
or the three things that I saw.

31
00:01:35,848 --> 00:01:37,918
Okay, so right here.

32
00:01:37,918 --> 00:01:41,469
So, if you notice a lot of you guys,
you guys had the first one.

33
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:44,156
Negative four point nine
'x' squared plus 14.7 'x'

34
00:01:44,156 --> 00:01:47,536
plus 49. Can someone tell
me in words how you were

35
00:01:47,536 --> 00:01:48,784
able to figure that out?

36
00:01:48,784 --> 00:01:51,611
- You just did it.

37
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,787
- What was the question?

38
00:01:53,787 --> 00:01:57,684
- [Teacher] So, can someone tell me how, like,

39
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:01,021
relate this general formula to the story.

40
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:03,863
Since you've read already, I
wants someone else to speak.

41
00:02:03,863 --> 00:02:05,231
So who? Okay, Jamilah,

42
00:02:05,231 --> 00:02:07,504
can you explain how you were
able to get this equation?

43
00:02:07,504 --> 00:02:11,574
- So, the height is c, and

44
00:02:11,574 --> 00:02:14,870
the original equation is a 'x'
squared, plus b 'x', plus c.

45
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,401
And so the initial height is
b, which is the y intercept.

46
00:02:18,401 --> 00:02:22,080
And then b is the initial velocity?

47
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,302
And then negative four point
nine is just the random number

48
00:02:25,302 --> 00:02:26,658
that they chose.

49
00:02:26,658 --> 00:02:29,152
- [Teacher] So, you guys, is it random?

50
00:02:29,152 --> 00:02:30,646
- No.
- It's the scale factor.

51
00:02:30,646 --> 00:02:32,106
- [Teacher] Is there any
other terminology for that?

52
00:02:36,842 --> 00:02:38,015
- It's the starting point.

- [Teacher] Hey guys, do you think it's

53
00:02:38,015 --> 00:02:39,008
the starting point? Is
it the starting point?

54
00:02:39,008 --> 00:02:40,277
Or, what else...?

55
00:02:40,277 --> 00:02:42,015
- It's gravity.

56
00:02:42,015 --> 00:02:43,519
- [Teacher] So wait, what does this

57
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,522
negative four point nine mean?

58
00:02:45,738 --> 00:02:47,020
- That's the constant. Remember, it's gravity.

59
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,277
- [Teacher] So, I heard...

60
00:02:48,277 --> 00:02:49,471
- Scale factor?

61
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:50,591
- [Teacher] Okay, scale factor,

62
00:02:50,591 --> 00:02:51,849
but relatively to your
projectile motion, what is it?

63
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:52,682
- Acceleration?

64
00:02:52,682 --> 00:02:54,574
- [Teacher] Acceleration. So you guys...(inaudible).

65
00:02:57,298 --> 00:02:59,027
- [Teacher] It's acceleration.

66
00:02:59,027 --> 00:03:00,507
So, right now, what I want you guys to do...

67
00:03:00,507 --> 00:03:02,150
Oh, actually once again, right here-

68
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,524
here are different forms
of an equation that I saw.

69
00:03:06,524 --> 00:03:08,496
So, right here what do you think?

70
00:03:08,496 --> 00:03:10,363
Can someone tell me what's
wrong with this particular one?

71
00:03:10,363 --> 00:03:12,410
- They don't
have a squared and they don't

72
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,406
have an 'x' after the
4.2 

73
00:03:14,406 --> 00:03:19,406
- Okay, so, Ravelle, what's
the problem with this one?

74
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:24,609
- There's no 'y' intercept or... (inaudible).

75
00:03:30,313 --> 00:03:31,849
- [Teacher] So, once
again, I still notice,

76
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:33,737
now I want to go back to
the original equation.

77
00:03:33,737 --> 00:03:36,189
Okay, someone tell me in words. Ah, Jamilah,

78
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:39,723
she did a fantastic job
explaining relatively to the

79
00:03:39,723 --> 00:03:42,786
a 'x' squared, plus b
'x', plus c, but according

80
00:03:42,786 --> 00:03:45,730
to the story, can someone
refer to the story

81
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,069
back to the general equation?

82
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:50,262
- Can you rephrase the question?

83
00:03:50,262 --> 00:03:53,184
- [Teacher] Yes. How are
we able to get 14.7 here?

84
00:03:53,184 --> 00:03:56,800
How did we get 49 here? How
do you know what stuff to use?

85
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,713
- The 49 is the initial height in meters,

86
00:03:59,713 --> 00:04:02,208
so that one's gonna be your 'y' intercept,

87
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:06,600
And 14.7 is the initial velocity,

88
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,220
and the initial velocity is
always 'b' so... (inaudible)

89
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,233
- [Teacher] Awesome.

90
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:13,558
So, now what I want you guys to do is,

91
00:04:13,558 --> 00:04:15,687
I want you to go to number two.

92
00:04:15,687 --> 00:04:17,242
So, I want you to put
that on the white board.

93
00:04:17,242 --> 00:04:18,747
- Can I read it again?

94
00:04:18,747 --> 00:04:20,728
- [Teacher] Well,
actually, no. Let's have,

95
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:25,504
Fatima, can you read number two?

96
00:04:25,814 --> 00:04:29,150
- [Fatima] What does the 'x' axis
represent in this story?

97
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,723
What does the 'y' axis represent in our story?

98
00:04:32,723 --> 00:04:42,125
- [Teacher] Okay, let's do that quickly.

99
00:04:44,005 --> 00:04:45,277
- I have a question.

100
00:04:45,277 --> 00:04:46,075
- [Teacher] Yes.

101
00:04:46,075 --> 00:04:48,431
- Did 'x', never mind,
I'll wait until after this.

102
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:51,736
- [Teacher] So, let's look
around. So, a lot of people

103
00:04:51,736 --> 00:04:52,813
are getting what?

104
00:04:52,813 --> 00:04:54,871
- 'X' equals time. 'Y' equals height.

105
00:04:54,871 --> 00:04:56,632
- [Teacher] So Markeisha,
what was your question?

106
00:04:56,632 --> 00:05:01,069
- I was gonna say, could
'x' be distance as well?

107
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:02,200
- [Teacher] Can 'x' be distance, people?
- No.

108
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,150
- No. If it wanted to. 

109
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,222
- [Teacher] Why not?

110
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,888
- Because, it's meters
per second, not meters per

111
00:05:07,888 --> 00:05:11,328
(inaudible)

112
00:05:11,328 --> 00:05:12,616
- [Teacher] So, does that make sense?
- (inaudible)

113
00:05:13,427 --> 00:05:14,575
- [Teacher] All right. So, now

114
00:05:14,575 --> 00:05:15,975
what I want you guys to do... 

115
00:05:15,975 --> 00:05:17,538
So, so far, let's recap what we've done so far.

116
00:05:17,538 --> 00:05:18,393
Can everyone generalize

117
00:05:18,393 --> 00:05:19,393
what we've just done

118
00:05:19,393 --> 00:05:20,796
in the first couple of questions?

119
00:05:20,796 --> 00:05:23,153
- We set up the equation

120
00:05:23,153 --> 00:05:26,368
and we figured out our 'x'
and y axes, in the general form.

121
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,352
- [Teacher] Okay, right now,
what I want you guys to do is,

122
00:05:28,352 --> 00:05:31,382
I want you guys to work on number four.

123
00:05:31,382 --> 00:05:33,631
Okay, someone read that out loud

124
00:05:33,631 --> 00:05:34,954
that hasn't read out loud yet.

125
00:05:34,954 --> 00:05:36,642
- I haven't.

126
00:05:36,642 --> 00:05:39,480
- [Teacher] So, Leslie, you
want to read? Number four?

127
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,486
- [Leslie] From the equation that you
got from question number one,

128
00:05:42,486 --> 00:05:45,655
show the steps on how you
translate the general form

129
00:05:45,655 --> 00:05:47,177
into the factor form.

130
00:05:47,177 --> 00:05:48,565
- [Teacher] Now what
I want you guys to do,

131
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:49,869
I want you to turn and talk

132
00:05:49,869 --> 00:05:52,132
about the strategies
you're planning to use

133
00:05:52,132 --> 00:07:53,595
to work out this problem.
- (students discussing the problem)

134
00:07:55,462 --> 00:07:56,505
- [Teacher] Okay, you
guys, I'm gonna stop class

135
00:07:56,505 --> 00:07:59,555
real quick. You guys, I'm
gonna stop class real quick.

136
00:07:59,555 --> 00:08:02,137
- (inaudible)

137
00:08:02,137 --> 00:08:04,567
Okay, so Mary, can you just
ask the question that you

138
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,603
just asked me?

139
00:08:05,603 --> 00:08:08,109
- She asked me.

140
00:08:08,109 --> 00:08:10,630
- [Teacher] Okay, so one
of you guys ask the question

141
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:14,533
that we just talked about.
So Markeisha, Jamilah?

142
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:17,819
- Can we use the box to figure it out?

143
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:19,526
- Yeah, you can.

144
00:08:19,526 --> 00:08:20,548
- [Teacher] Why? How?

145
00:08:20,548 --> 00:08:23,183
Hang on.

146
00:08:23,183 --> 00:08:24,463
Put that back away. So, you guys.

147
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:27,092
So the question is...
Okay, so Autumn just asked,

148
00:08:27,092 --> 00:08:30,661
can she use the diamond
and rectangle method

149
00:08:30,661 --> 00:08:35,122
as opposed to (inaudible) and why?
- (background chatter)

150
00:08:37,756 --> 00:08:42,126
- [Teacher] You guys...

151
00:08:43,866 --> 00:08:46,102
You guys, let's listen,
please. Mary. Sorry.

152
00:08:46,396 --> 00:08:48,870
- You figure it out by dividing
negative four point nine

153
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,544
by all the numbers. So, if
you divide negative four

154
00:08:50,544 --> 00:08:53,403
point nine 'x' squared, by
negative four point nine,

155
00:08:53,403 --> 00:08:55,616
you'll get 'x' squared. 14.7 divided by

156
00:08:55,616 --> 00:08:58,857
negative four point
nine is negative three.

157
00:08:58,857 --> 00:09:01,174
And then 49 divided by
negative four point nine is

158
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:02,329
negative ten?

159
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:03,835
- [Teacher] Okay, I'll
stop you right there.

160
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:06,075
So, back to what I said. Okay,
so the diamond-rectangle

161
00:09:06,075 --> 00:09:08,347
method, people. So, when you are doing this,

162
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:10,362
what are you finding?
- We're finding the box.

163
00:09:10,362 --> 00:09:11,473
- [Teacher] You're finding the box.

164
00:09:11,473 --> 00:09:13,424
So, what are those things

165
00:09:13,424 --> 00:09:18,009
outside of the box here?
What are they called.

166
00:09:18,127 --> 00:09:19,585
- The factors.

167
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:20,327
- [Teacher] The factors.

168
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:21,287
Okay.

169
00:09:21,287 --> 00:09:22,973
Okay, when you're using, it seems like

170
00:09:22,973 --> 00:09:24,721
a lot of you guys are using
the quadratic formula.

171
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:25,959
What are you trying to find then?
- (inaudible)

172
00:09:27,826 --> 00:09:28,860
- [Teacher] All right. So, right now...

173
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,876
So, Autumn. So, you have
questions on that right?

174
00:09:30,876 --> 00:09:33,894
So, later on... So, do you mind just moving

175
00:09:33,894 --> 00:09:37,366
over there real quick?
Because Leslie said that

176
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:39,469
you got it down.

177
00:09:39,469 --> 00:09:40,587
So, you guys, so take two more minutes.

178
00:09:40,587 --> 00:09:43,787
We're gonna see both methods.

179
00:09:43,787 --> 00:09:53,787
- (students discussing the problem)

180
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:57,377
- So, are you done yet?

181
00:09:57,377 --> 00:10:01,781
- No.

182
00:10:01,781 --> 00:10:35,190
- (background chatter)

183
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,271
- [Teacher] Okay, you guys stop.

184
00:10:40,271 --> 00:10:42,834
Okay, right now, 
I'm gonna put this up right here.

185
00:10:42,834 --> 00:10:45,554
We're gonna put up the
most common mistakes

186
00:10:45,554 --> 00:10:48,407
that people tend to do.

187
00:10:49,491 --> 00:10:51,666
Okay, so right now, so how many people got

188
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,709
negative five and two?

189
00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:56,647
- [Students] No...no...no.

190
00:10:56,647 --> 00:10:58,088
- [Teacher] So, what was it?

191
00:10:58,088 --> 00:10:59,324
- Negative two (inaudible).

192
00:10:59,324 --> 00:11:01,192
- Oh, okay, I got negative
two and five. My bad.

193
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:03,110
- [Teacher] Okay, so right
now. What do you think

194
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:07,240
was the mistake that she did?

195
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,746
- She didn't square it.

196
00:11:08,746 --> 00:11:09,696
- [Teacher] She didn't what?

197
00:11:09,696 --> 00:11:12,779
- She didn't square.
And then she re-fixed it.

198
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:14,389
- [Teacher] She fixed it?

199
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:15,584
- Yeah, she copied mine.

200
00:11:15,584 --> 00:11:18,975
- It's supposed to be negative 14.7.

201
00:11:18,975 --> 00:11:20,405
- [Teacher] Is that
what its supposed to be?

202
00:11:20,405 --> 00:11:20,998
- Yeah.

203
00:11:20,998 --> 00:11:22,293
- [Teacher] And is
that what she's missing?

204
00:11:22,293 --> 00:11:22,866
- Yeah.

205
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:24,714
- [Teacher] Okay, guys, so
that's one mistake that happens

206
00:11:24,714 --> 00:11:27,081
quite a bit.

207
00:11:27,081 --> 00:11:30,431
Also, let's look at...

208
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,352
Hey, you guys, what form is this right here?

209
00:11:32,352 --> 00:11:35,401
What method did they use?

210
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:38,068
- Box and diamond method.

211
00:11:38,068 --> 00:11:39,241
- [Teacher] Box and
diamond method, right?

212
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,194
- Okay, so, you guys, what
do you call these two

213
00:11:41,194 --> 00:11:42,388
items right here?

214
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:46,783
What is it missing?

215
00:11:46,783 --> 00:11:48,978
- The number at the
beginning. The negative four.

216
00:11:48,978 --> 00:11:50,150
- [Teacher] And what is that again?

217
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,592
What is the name of the
four point nine again?

218
00:11:52,243 --> 00:11:53,390
Scale factor or what?

219
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,131
- Acceleration!

220
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:55,817
- [Teacher] Acceleration.
So, you guys, if you notice,

221
00:11:55,817 --> 00:12:00,277
this is something that
tends to be missing also.

222
00:12:00,277 --> 00:12:01,386
So, now we will look at...ah...

223
00:12:01,386 --> 00:12:05,536
- We have the same thing.

224
00:12:05,536 --> 00:12:06,796
- We all have the same thing.

225
00:12:06,796 --> 00:12:10,911
[Teacher] So, same thing, same thing. All right.

226
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,865
Okay. So, right now I
think we looked at all

227
00:12:14,865 --> 00:12:16,466
the common mistakes that people tend...

228
00:12:16,466 --> 00:12:17,809
Oh actually, (inaudible)

229
00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:21,137
So, now what I want is... so, how
many methods do people use?

230
00:12:21,137 --> 00:12:22,339
- Two?

231
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:24,579
- Okay, so tell me one
what was one method?

232
00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:26,733
What was the method that you used?

233
00:12:26,733 --> 00:12:27,928
- Quadratic formula?

234
00:12:27,928 --> 00:12:30,831
- Okay, Caleb? What was another
method that people used?

235
00:12:30,831 --> 00:12:33,618
- The box and diamond.

236
00:12:33,618 --> 00:12:35,395
- [Teacher] The box and diamond, right?

237
00:12:35,395 --> 00:12:39,299
So, right now, I want people
to explain their thinking.

238
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:43,298
So, what I want you to do is, okay,
since... Tiffany, since you said

239
00:12:43,298 --> 00:12:45,069
you did the quadratic
formula, you're gonna go up

240
00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:47,790
and talk about it. Just
talk about the process

241
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:59,748
of what you did.
- (students cheering for Tiffany)

242
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,258
- [Teacher] How are you gonna
explain the process?

243
00:13:04,258 --> 00:13:09,113
- [Tiffany] All right. So, the 
(background chatter)

244
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,634
- Can we do it on this hard board?

245
00:13:12,634 --> 00:13:19,170
- [Teacher] Yeah. Okay. Let's
do it on this hard board.

246
00:13:21,122 --> 00:13:22,786
- [Student] Make sure you talk to us, okay?
- [Teacher] Okay, while you're writing things down,

247
00:13:22,786 --> 00:13:34,589
talk about how you're going through the process.
- So, I used the quadratic formula?

248
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,409
- [Teacher] So, what
are you doing right now?

249
00:13:37,409 --> 00:13:38,348
- I'm writing it.

250
00:13:38,348 --> 00:13:39,137
- [Teacher] Writing what?

251
00:13:39,137 --> 00:13:40,300
- The quadratic formula.

252
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,126
- [Teacher] Okay. So you
see, instead of me asking,

253
00:13:42,126 --> 00:13:43,873
I just want you to explain all
the things that you're doing.

254
00:13:43,873 --> 00:13:57,873
- Okay.

255
00:13:59,694 --> 00:14:11,694
- So, you guys need some visuals...

256
00:14:13,424 --> 00:14:18,121
This will be your a, your b, and your c.

257
00:14:18,472 --> 00:14:21,644
So, you plug all this into this.

258
00:14:23,222 --> 00:14:26,284
- [Teacher] Okay, so let's (inaudible) do it.

259
00:14:26,284 --> 00:14:27,530
- [Student] I have a question.

260
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,466
- [Teacher] Yes.

261
00:14:28,466 --> 00:14:30,511
- [Student] What if the b is already negative?

262
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:34,054
- [Tiffany] That's a good question.

263
00:14:34,054 --> 00:14:50,916
- (background chatter)

264
00:14:52,386 --> 00:14:53,729
- [Teacher] So, you guys,
while Tiffany is doing

265
00:14:53,729 --> 00:14:57,518
the quadratic formula, think
about what common mistakes

266
00:14:57,518 --> 00:14:59,802
that we just talked about earlier,

267
00:14:59,802 --> 00:15:03,086
and what mistakes that
she may or may not have.

268
00:15:03,086 --> 00:15:04,064
- (background chatter)
