Gentlemen, what did you think about your

00:00:06,895 --> 00:00:10,981
performance? I wouldn't say "terrible,"
but were you accurately on pitch,

4

all of you?
- No.

5
00:00:12,738 --> 00:00:14,948
- No. Like as soon as the ladies came in,
you were like, "Whoo," and then you

forgot what you were singing. Okay? So,
don't let them distract you. They're

- The pitch was kind of off at some parts.

26
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:26,710

issues. What about energy level? It was

27
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:31,780
okay, but this.... But one of the things
about African music is it is something

28
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,500
that is like felt in their soul. Okay. It
is traditionally, when you listen, I mean,

29
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,990
they are just letting it... You know, when
we see any of the performances, or listen

30
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,387
to any of the CDs we've listened to, it's
just very gut-felt. I feel like you're,

45
00:02:52,498 --> 00:02:55,017

yourselves. You pushed yourselves there.

46
00:02:55,017 --> 00:02:58,520
It's hot. Those notes are kind of high. I
know that. And you just pushed right

47
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,510
through it. So good job. Let's review the
instrument parts we just got to touch on

48
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:06,950
last time. So, I'm going to come here so
we can do our body percussion. Real quick.

49
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:12,360
We are going to start with our bass part.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are not going

50
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,450
to use these right now because traditional
African music is by rote, meaning you

51
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:20,850
learn it by hearing. You learn it by
doing. If you are a visual learner, these

52
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:25,670
are our music stands by the instruments,
so this will help you. And you know, I

53
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,780
want everyone to be successful, so you use
the tools that will help you be

54
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,400
successful. You be an independent learner
where you decide. If this is what you

55
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,650
need, grab a music stand. Okay? If you
don't, you don't need it. Okay? So there

56
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,820
are music stands in each of the instrument
sections when you pick. Okay? So, basses

57
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:46,090
first. Let's all kind of scoot over this
way. So bass section first. We have,

58
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:53,918
starting with your left hand, [clapping as they sing]
"♪ Sing, oh sing, oh sing noel ♪

59
00:03:53,918 --> 00:03:58,334
- [Clapping together as they sing]
"♪ Sing, oh sing, oh sing noel ♪

60
00:03:58,334 --> 00:03:59,669
- And you have that crossover.

61
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:03,419
[Clapping as they sing]
"♪ Sing, oh sing, oh sing noel ♪

62
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:06,940
- Everybody feel comfortable with that?
Any questions? You look good. You look

63
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:11,826
like you have it. All right. Then we have
the xylophones. This one's a tricky one.

64
00:04:11,826 --> 00:04:16,213
So we have, for that part... Let me just
double check on our words that we decided

65
00:04:16,213 --> 00:04:28,100
for last time. So, we have, [clapping as they sing]
"♪ Sing noel, sing noel. Let's simply celebrate it. Sing

66
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,927
noel. Sing noel. Let's simply celebrate it. ♪"

67
00:04:32,927 --> 00:04:41,100
- [Clapping as they sing]  Sing noel. Sing noel. 
Let's simply celebrate it. Sing noel. Sing noel. 

68
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,206
Let's simply celebrate it. ♪

69
00:04:43,206 --> 00:04:48,540
- Okay? So the trickiest part is how many
G's. All right. So remember, we have low C

70
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:54,140
and high C, So you have, "C, C, C. C, C,
C." And there's four Gs over that

71
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:59,950
syncopated rhythm. G, G, G, G, F, E, D.
Okay? So it's kind of like, "One, two,

72
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:04,305
three, down the ladder you go."
Okay? So let's try that.

73
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:14,950
- C, C, C. C, C, C. G, G, G, G, F, E, D.
C, C, C. C, C, C. G, G, G, G, F, E, D.

74
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:23,446
- Got it? Got the idea? All right. Then we
go on to the glockenspiels. And for that

75
00:05:23,446 --> 00:05:27,400
one, we can just clap that rhythm, because
I think on the instruments it will be

76
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,070
easier to see, to show, because they're so
obviously a little, so it's not really

77
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:36,483
like that. So here we go. It goes, "♪ Sing,
oh, yes, sing noel, noel. ♪"

78
00:05:36,483 --> 00:05:45,340
- ♪ Sing, oh, yes, sing noel, noel. Sing,
oh, yes, sing noel, noel. ♪

79
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,540
- Okay? Got the idea for that rhythm? So I
will come over and help that section, and

80
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:54,890
some of you may remember that from last
time. Then we have our percussion section.

81
00:05:54,890 --> 00:06:00,540
Okay? We have first the conga drum. A real
quick review on conga drum playing.

82
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:05,450
Everything in you is going to want to tip
it toward you. If we can kind of spin back

83
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,660
here so I can show you. When you play a
conga drum you scoot over this way a

84
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:13,150
little bit. And scoot over that way. There
we go. So, when you play conga drum, you

85
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,130
actually are going to hold it in between
your legs, and put your feet around the

86
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,660
base, and you're going to tip it out from
you. So that that way the sound can come

87
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,578
out, but you also have the correct play
style. Remember pat on the ends.

88
00:06:23,578 --> 00:06:27,156
when you're playing. And those are in...
You can pat this on your lap as well.

- Thank you very much.

spot-checking to see if you have rhythmic

108
00:08:04,895 --> 00:08:07,222
accuracy when we're doing this. It's
really important that I see that

109

pick parts, I'm looking to see who has it.

110
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,997
Yes, there's choice, but also to check you
off on including this rhythm thing. Okay?

111
00:08:14,997 --> 00:08:18,481
So let's try it again. Ready.

So it would really be nice if you could

116
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:42,700
pulse with my pulse so we could all pulse
together. So again, really important. We

117
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:47,160
might add in some other, more African
instruments. They're kind of loud, so

118
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,200
we'll see if you can get the correct
sound. [Rhythmic shaking stops]
So what I'd like you to do now. Do

119
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,266
you have any question? All right. If you
really mastered the instrument that you

120
00:08:56,266 --> 00:08:59,976
got to start on last time, I would
challenge you to maybe pick a different

121
00:08:59,976 --> 00:09:03,856
one. Okay? If you were still working on
it, you're welcome to stay there. But

122
00:09:03,856 --> 00:09:08,490
without any payoffs, so just kind of
selection, I would like you all to go and

123
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:12,740

145
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,740
- [Together] You're playing too loud.

146
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:56,130
- Yes, you're playing too loud. And
remember, again, texture is everything. We

147
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:58,710
want to be able to pull out the different
parts, so maybe at the end we can

148
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:03,380
talk about different ways we can set up a
form to highlight that. But for right now,

149
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:08,080
let's make sure that we can keep it soft.
Okay? It's not a competition. All right?

150
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,350
No one's going to win. It's the whole
class that we're trying to do this

151
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:16,018
together. So if we hear bass part first.
And let's go ahead and add at least shaker

152
00:13:16,018 --> 00:13:18,997
for right now, and then we'll build in
one or two sections. One, two,

153
00:13:18,997 --> 00:13:26,952
ready, go.

00:13:26,952 --> 00:13:31,016
Okay. Time out. So, you're listening for
the beat. She's watching me instead of the

155
00:13:31,016 --> 00:13:35,071
basses, right? Because you're doing their
work a little bit, and you need to keep it

156
00:13:35,071 --> 00:13:37,788
nice and steady. What happened, we ended
up with three different tempos. Did you

157
00:13:37,788 --> 00:13:41,080
hear that? One, two, ready, go.

♪ [music] ♪

159
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,283
Okay. Pretty good. And then we started to
kind of get off where the beginning of the

160
00:14:55,283 --> 00:15:00,000
patterns are. Okay. One thing that will
help is adding the singing to it. Okay?
