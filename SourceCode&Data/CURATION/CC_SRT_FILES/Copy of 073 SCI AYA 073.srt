1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,110
- Like compared to osteoblasts... the
osteoclasts to be more efficient, and work harder

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:10,777
than the osteoclasts, therefore you're
[inaudible] more than you are building, so

3
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:14,649
that ratio can cause brittle bones.

4
00:00:14,649 --> 00:00:16,150
- [Instructor] So what--Okay, [inaudible]
right?

5
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:16,600
- Yeah.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,970
- One's up, one goes down.

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,800
- Yeah, if you're taking away more than
you're putting back--

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,750
- No, I'm sorry, why don't
osteo...

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,930
- 'Cause there's a lack of estrogen and,
or testosterone that is triggering the

10
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,756
osteoblasts to work.

11
00:00:32,756 --> 00:00:34,863
- We kind of hit on that a little, I don't
know.

12
00:00:34,863 --> 00:00:37,710
- I kinda did, but I kinda didn't.

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,010
- What causes osteoblasts to work?

14
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:47,200
- That it? Okay, so when they're saying
that the osteoclasts are working more,

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:54,020
what they're not saying more than they
used to work, they're saying more compared

16
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:59,790
to the osteoblasts, okay? It's not like
the osteoclasts have been activated and

17
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:05,010
are elevating their activity. They're just
doing what they do. It's just because the

18
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,490
blast activity dropped, which you guys got
that, the blast activity dropped. Why did

19
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:11,840
that blast activity drop?

20
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,196
- Because there weren't enough hormones to
trigger the action of osteoblasting

21
00:01:16,196 --> 00:01:17,570
Good.

22
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:21,640
- Is everybody get that? 'Cause see now,
the blast activity's what's really

23
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,570
dropping. And the clast activity keeps
going, like it normally goes, but relative

24
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:33,300
to one another, you have more clast
activity, less blast activity and

25
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:38,900
therefore you're losing bone. Everybody
got that idea? Okay, good, you did a good

26
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,400
job reasoning that out. Okay, you can keep
going, Matt.

27
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,490
- Okay, our next question kind of gets off
of like, the description of osteoblasts

28
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:51,940
and it says, "How can osteoblasts-- or,
how can osteoporosis be prevented?"
Brooke? 

29
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:57,260
- Well, they recommend having, like, a
good number, a good amount of calcium

30
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:02,790
intake, a day, about 1,000, 1,500 milligrams,
you could do that, something simple like that

31
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,760
could prevent like, osteoporosis in the long run.

32
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,680
- All right.

33
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,040
- I would also suggest regular exercise in
order to, kind of build up the bones

34
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,050
with weight bearing exercise, so that
there's less, there's more bone actually

35
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,390
broken down.

36
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:26,870
- Basically, a healthy lifestyle and
refraining from smoking and alcohol

37
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:35,540
lots of other stuff and then bisphosphonate for
extremely high risk.

38
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,890
- Along with everything else, there's a, I went
to the Food and Drug Administration, you

39
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:43,590
can have Zoledronic acid, which can be
injected every two years for, like,

40
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,860
prevention along with the diet and
exercise.

41
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,590
- Anybody else have anything they'd
like to add?

42
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,330
- I was going to say hormone replacement
therapy then some other... [inaudible]

43
00:02:58,614 --> 00:03:07,010
- Nobody else? Okay. Now who's on to how is
osteoporosis diagnosed?

44
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:12,840
- Yeah, I found the most current one is a
form called Dual Energy X-ray Reabsorption

45
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:20,130
Test to test the bone density, you get a
score of either one or below, means you're

46
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:26,980
normal, one to 2.5 is osteoporosis, 2.5
and above it's just, your bones are gonna

47
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,889
break any time.
- All right. Anybody else?

48
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,608
- There's just a bunch of ways that they
measure the bone density, so there's like

49
00:03:39,608 --> 00:03:46,963
a centimeter scanner and then a quantitative, 
that's what they use, 'cause it's like really

50
00:03:46,963 --> 00:03:53,107
hard to detect osteoporosis sometimes and not 
[inaudible] so you kinda need more ways to test...

51
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,155
- Good.

52
00:03:55,155 --> 00:04:00,340
- You can also take a sample of your
[inaudible] and analyze it to see if

53
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:07,080
there's any signs of erosion or anything
that'll lead to osteoporosis.

54
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,780
- Okay, what's that called? Anybody know
what that's called? What is it?

55
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,070
- Bioscan.
- Good.

56
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:17,920
- Before you even go to the doctor, like, it's 
really hard to diag--, like, there's not really

57
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,336
symptoms of it. But some of the symptoms are like 
bone pain and tenderness and stuff like that,

58
00:04:22,336 --> 00:04:24,928
and breaking bones with little or no
trauma.

59
00:04:24,928 --> 00:04:30,464
- What do we call that when a bone breaks
with little or no trauma? What kind of

60
00:04:30,464 --> 00:04:35,310
fracture?
- Traumatic.

61
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:41,980
- Traumatic would be if it was, kind of
trauma. Pathological, good job, yeah!

62
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,960
Pathological fracture, that would be a
pathological fracture, if there's a

63
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,630
disease under there, like osteoporosis,
which has made it weak enough to break.

64
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:58,730
Good call! So, somebody mentioned the
scanner, Zach, right? You talked about

65
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,730
that? The abbreviated, what did, what was
the full name of that scan again?

66
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,280
- Dual Energy X-ray Absorption.

67
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:13,630
- Okay, has anyone ever heard of a DEX
scan? DEXA scanner, that's where the D-E-X

68
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:18,050
comes from, Dual Energy X-ray, DEXA scan,
and that's very common, yeah?

69
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,026
- Is that like what the guy from Pursuit
of Happiness, [inaudible]... ?

70
00:05:21,026 --> 00:05:21,698
- Yeah.

71
00:05:21,698 --> 00:05:24,546
- I don't know if you ever saw that movie.
- I didn't.

72
00:05:24,546 --> 00:05:28,387
- Yeah, the bone density scanner.
- I didn't know if that was it.

73
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:35,640
- Yeah, okay, so, how did they, what the
general, how they actually, what bones do

74
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,562
they look at in the scanner?

75
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:47,912
- I think it was the wrist, the hip and the spine
those are the most common places for osteoporosis.

76
00:05:47,912 --> 00:05:50,029
- The lumbar part of your spine,
because that's the first to go

77
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:54,440
- Why?

78
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:01,670
- What else is important to consider if
you, if you think about the type of bone

79
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:06,918
being affected, what type of bone being
affected? What type of bone? I should remember.

80
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:08,960
- Trabeculae.

81
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,460
- Yeah, so that's a spongy bone, right? So
trabeculae of the spongy bone, why would

82
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,240
the lumbar vertebrae be particularly
vulnerable now?

83
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,328
- It's a spongy bone.

84
00:06:20,328 --> 00:06:30,580
- Yeah, it's an irregular shaped bone, but
the body of the vertebrae, is basically a

85
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:37,040
cortex in, and it's a spongy bone in
there, it's all trabeculae. What was the

86
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,084
other bones that you said, Madhura?

87
00:06:40,084 --> 00:06:43,316
- Wrist and hip.

88
00:06:43,764 --> 00:06:46,964
- Okay, so hip as in, what do you mean by
that do you think, Robert?

89
00:06:46,964 --> 00:06:48,308
- Ilium.
- Ilium!

90
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:50,900
- It's all a spongy bone.

91
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:57,180
- A spongy bone in the ilium, good place
to look for it. But, here's the thing, what

92
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:04,056
about the wrist? How come, think from a
practical scenario, how come the wrist?

93
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:05,020
Yeah, Lexi.

94
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:10,304
- I think it's 'cause you use it like, so
often, that they [inaudible] is probably

95
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:15,030
the most common [inaudible] because you
use your wrist for like basically...

96
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,814
- Do you use it a lot? Another possible
reason?

97
00:07:17,814 --> 00:07:24,406
- Yeah, Kevin?
- Because it's a lot of like small bones so, they 

98
00:07:24,406 --> 00:07:27,340
may be easier to break, or like, be more fragile.

99
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,850
- Okay, that's a possibility. Mikey?

100
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:33,697
- I would say 'cause it's easy to get to,
like, it's pretty hard to take like--, and

101
00:07:33,697 --> 00:07:38,049
actually have your hip where they do like
biopsies going in to your hip. It's kinda

102
00:07:38,049 --> 00:07:41,345
hard to get like a good angle, but like
your wrist can, there's not a lot of like

103
00:07:41,345 --> 00:07:45,473
skin or muscle covering it, so they can
like put it under a scanner and get a

104
00:07:45,473 --> 00:07:47,009
pretty good picture.

105
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:52,870
- Okay, thank you for that. That's exactly 
why they use the wrist. I mean the wrist

106
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:57,200
bones, when you think about 'em, you know,
they're not weight bearing, so they're

107
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,170
probably not the best to evaluate for
osteoporosis, it would be better to

108
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:05,680
evaluate weight bearing bones, but they do
have spongy bone in them, they're little

109
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,710
irregular shaped bones, which have a
cortex with some spongy bone. So there is

110
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:15,900
some material in there to evaluate, but
you don't have to disrobe, you don't have

111
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,860
to do anything, you just put your arm in
the machine and they can do what's called

112
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:26,210
a screening, a screening test. Has anyone
had a screening test for anything ever

113
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:31,170
before? Or thought of, ever heard of
screening tests being done for other

114
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:37,520
things? No? Not familiar with the
screening tests?

115
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,900
- I think I've had one.
- Have you?

116
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,540
- Yeah, because, if I had, like, it wasn't
for bones though--

117
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,610
- It could be for anything.

118
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,380
- Like they were looking for appendicitis,
but they couldn't find it so they were

119
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:52,090
doing other-- all these other kinds of
tests, I don't know if that...

120
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:55,390
- Well, a screening test, it could be, it
could be a screening test. Screening tests

121
00:08:55,390 --> 00:09:01,410
are basically more generalized testing,
not the most specific, but meant just to

122
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:08,940
give you a clue if something needs further
evaluation, okay? So if you put your arm

123
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:15,170
in the scanner, and it was towards the low
end, it's not the best for making an end

124
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:21,760
all, you know, quantitative diagnosis. But
it's a good for determining if we should

125
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,830
go ahead and do a scan of the lumbar spine
or ilium, you see? So that's why the arm.

126
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:31,620
So it's interesting that you brought that
up, that was really good, 'cause it really

127
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,420
helps us look at the whole, "Where is this
occurring?" and "Why do they use those

128
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:40,880
specific bones?" Okay, Matt, anything else
there?

129
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,940
- Our next question, we have already said
how it's diagnosed, we know what it is.

130
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:51,750
So, how can we treat osteoporosis?

131
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:57,070
- Well I said, I found online that there
were really no treatments, like true

132
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:01,370
treatments for osteoporosis. It's more of
trying to prevent it, by getting enough

133
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:07,230
calcium and all the other stuff we said
before, because you can't really treat it

134
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,140
once it's gone.

135
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,050
- Well, that's funny, I found something a
little different, there's a few medicines

136
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:14,630
right now, like talking about, you've seen
all those commercials and weird stuff that

137
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:19,590
actually do prevent it. Now, they're
actually saying, like helping you actually

138
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:24,430
reabsorb the calcium that you've lost from
the bones. But it's, also something kind

139
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,420
of funny I saw, if the bones start to
become more dense, they also found that

140
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,770
like around your jaw, starts to
deteriorate faster, some reason

141
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:37,030
actually get like sore throat. So I was
wondering if anyone, try to reason that

142
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:42,040
out. Because I could not figure out why,
just your jaw starts losing calcium, but

143
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:47,410
your long bones, start gaining it.

144
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,940
- Are you saying that they're taking
medication and then they're experiencing

145
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,330
pain? So that--

146
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:57,310
- Yeah, like the calcium [background chatter] to
deteriorate. But like your long bones it's

147
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,640
like your limbs and everything start to
become more dense.

148
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:05,780
- Is your jaw a lot of [inaudible], is it
one of those bones... ?

149
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:09,342
- Yeah, some, but there isn't a whole lot
in there, there is some.

150
00:11:09,342 --> 00:11:17,350
[Background Chatter]

151
00:11:17,381 --> 00:11:20,760
- Is it a more compact bone?

152
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:25,690
- Probably a more compact bone in your
jaw, there isn't a lot of cavity space, or

153
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:29,040
spongy bone space there. Maybe that has
something to do with that?

154
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,421
- Even having a sore throat, I don't know
why that would affect it at all. Maybe

155
00:11:34,421 --> 00:11:36,052
because it's a horrible medicine.

156
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,940
- I don't know, like the thyroid gland, like this
one, or the parathyroid, this is like calcium

157
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:50,048
[inaudible] like bone absorption, so
maybe, I don't know, it's not working as

158
00:11:50,048 --> 00:11:52,670
efficiently, so it's not getting the
through to the jawbone.

159
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:58,310
- Or maybe it's working too much or
something. Maybe since your jaw is losing

160
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:01,610
calcium, and it's kinda gaining, like
losing its calcium, so it's probably

161
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:05,680
starting the beginning phases of
osteoporosis. Your hyoid bone, isn't your

162
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,060
hyoid bone isn't it... ?
- Sort of high.

163
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,760
- It doesn't really touch any other bones,
but it's... kinda in there.

164
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,070
- So it's kinda in your throat, so that
could be like, I don't know, it's kinda

165
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,886
unusual.

166
00:12:19,886 --> 00:12:23,740
- Just answer this one with the general
area, 'cause there's a lot of instances

167
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:28,448
where you couldn't sit or lay down, for
like three hours after you took it because

168
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:33,601
it would deteriorate your esophagus. So I
don't know, there were a lot of really bad

169
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:35,937
side effects just...

170
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,976
- Well, what I was wondering, I kinda see
like some doctors like, just wanted you to

171
00:12:46,976 --> 00:12:50,900
be aware in order to treat it would
be prevention, would be the other side to

172
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,708
treatment, just go do like those lifestyle
changes. Instead of like thinking "Oh,

173
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,940
I'll wait until these signs come up, and
have platelet scans and I'll take

174
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,844
medicine." Just to be proactive about it
and have those lifestyle changes like

175
00:13:01,844 --> 00:13:05,172
not being a smoker and don't drink
excessively, and like, have those good

176
00:13:05,172 --> 00:13:08,213
workout regimens so you prevent it 
rather than treat it.

177
00:13:09,365 --> 00:13:14,293
- Yeah, seems like a disease that's either
prevented or managed, not so much treated,

178
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:18,868
but I thought, I think someone mentioned
this before but the bisphosphonates...

179
00:13:18,868 --> 00:13:23,988
'cause other people who get osteoporosis
are people who take corticosteroids,

180
00:13:23,988 --> 00:13:28,596
for like, asthma, like in your
inhaler. So it's something that inhibits

181
00:13:28,596 --> 00:13:32,404
bone breakdown, so it doesn't sound like
it treats it, but it kind of manages it so

182
00:13:32,404 --> 00:13:34,516
you don't break bones...

183
00:13:34,516 --> 00:13:40,820
- Yeah, did anyone request a name, a name
brand Fosamax? Did we see that? Yeah?

184
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,970
Did they tell you how it worked?

185
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,560
- No, actually--

186
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,350
- No, well, Fosamax is like, did you see
something there, Zach?

187
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:56,130
- Yeah, wasn't that the bisphosphonates
bind to the hydrocapsin crystals in bone

188
00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:00,000
and inhibit osteo, osteo-something bone
reabsorption?

189
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,060
- So they're inhibiting which cells?

190
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,800
- [together] Osteoclasts.

191
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:09,260
- Okay, yeah, so that's how Fosamax and
those work. They inhibit the osteoclasts,

192
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:13,680
so they're not building bone, though You see the
difference?

193
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:13,840
- Yeah.

194
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:18,670
- They're not really building the bone,
they're stopping the erosion, it's a

195
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,270
little different.

196
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:22,230
- But if you have like dead bone, or old
bone that needs to be replaced, wouldn't

197
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:26,140
that just inhibit it just as much because
there's still old calcium sitting in your

198
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:29,160
leg that... ? I don't know, whenever
there's waste in your body that doesn't

199
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,840
get dealt with, I mean, like when you have
an appendectomy and there's waste in your

200
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:38,445
appendix, that like, it can kill you if
there's like waste in your body. So, maybe

201
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:41,736
that would just prolong the process of
osteoporosis, not so much as help it in

202
00:14:41,736 --> 00:14:46,440
the long run. I'm thinking, 'cause,
any time you're keeping like, something

203
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,300
that's old in your body that's not good.
Like, you eat something, you have to like,

204
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,910
you have to digest it, and I don't know.

205
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:01,371
- Yeah, it's a good thought process. Good
thought process. So that's what Fosamax

206
00:15:01,371 --> 00:15:06,780
works that way. So if we were gonna try
and design something and our job is to

207
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:11,950
design a drug that helps, let's say
someone who has osteoporosis, let's assume

208
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:18,860
they have it now. What types of
mechanisms, in other words, what types of

209
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:25,211
things will we try and get a drug to do?
What would we want it to do?

210
00:15:25,211 --> 00:15:30,990
- You want it to like stimulate the
osteoblasts like a little bit better. And

211
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:34,550
someone already mentioned this, but they
had like estrogen supplements, like

212
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:41,020
supposedly like help out with that. Maybe
stimulating more osteoblast ability.

213
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,490
- Okay, well go with that a little bit
about the estrogen replacement. Did anyone

214
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:47,670
request that as a therapy? Yeah, Kevin?

215
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:52,890
- And there's like these, like it's, like
hormone therapy and we have like estrogen

216
00:15:52,890 --> 00:16:00,610
patches, where you can take it as a pill.
So it adds estrogen to your body so, it

217
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:10,875
balances out your loss of estrogen, and
raises it.

218
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,750
- Yeah, there's like, he was talking about
the hormone replacement, but I also read

219
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:22,790
on Google Health that it's rarely used and
it's not used twice with women. I don't

220
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:27,490
know if that has anything to do with it, 
I can Google it. I guess like if you use the

221
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,090
treatment once [inaudible].

222
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:34,390
- Any ideas why? Anybody find out why
estrogen replacement, they used to, you

223
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:39,030
know what? They used to give estrogen like
they give vitamins, it used to be "prevent

224
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:44,820
osteoporosis by taking extra estrogen."
Seriously, and it wasn't all that long

225
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,280
ago, how come it isn't get--

226
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:49,190
- Because then your body stops producing,
its like, natural estrogen, so...

227
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:54,300
- Good idea, maybe. Any other poss--, Nick
any idea you can think of?

228
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,170
- I don't know, you're not producing enough?

229
00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:03,200
- So because you're not, we should get
more, well, how come, have anybody heard

230
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,173
of anything that's related to estrogen
therapy, bad things?

231
00:17:07,173 --> 00:17:10,000
[Background Chatter]
-Facial hair growth

232
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,440
- Well, testosterone can increase facial
hair growth, someone else over here?
-Cancer.

233
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:21,140
- Cancer, and that's the problem, they saw
incidences of, particularly breast cancer,

234
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:28,730
went up substantially, and so that's why,
Artie, they're saying that, you know,

235
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,370
hormone replacement, it's still being
used--

236
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:31,960
- It's rarely used.

237
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,970
- Yeah, but not like it used to be, not
like it used to be.

238
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:45,800
- So if we could stimulate the osteoclasts to work
properly, or blasts, to work properly then shouldn't

239
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:54,340
you like, have like some sort of treatment to, like, 
make the osteoclasts work as efficiently as the

240
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:58,376
osteoblasts? We would have like, sort of a difference
in their relationship.

241
00:17:58,376 --> 00:18:00,090
- Good idea.

242
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:04,450
- But isn't that the job of the osteocytes
to basically maintain the bone? So

243
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,090
shouldn't we find a way to, like,
make sure that the osteocytes are

244
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:11,980
maintaining the bone? Because if the
osteoblasts are going to do their job once

245
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:18,140
they're stimulated. But they have to be
stimulated, so show me if you're looking

246
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:22,950
for a way to stimulate them more than...
make a more efficient solution at the

247
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:23,800
osteocytes.

248
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,440
- No, that would be more like a genetic
thing, 'cause your osteocytes, your DNA

249
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:29,040
is like breaking down as you get older. So
it's like not, it's like, I don't know, is

250
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:34,400
it mutating? When it gets older? I don't
know a lot about genetics, but I know your

251
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,410
DNA kinda breaks down as you get older,
and so that makes your cells not as

252
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:43,740
efficient. So it might be more of a DNA
kinda thing. Where you have to engineer

253
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,580
that DNA-wise to make your osteocytes work
just as well when you're, like, 78 as when

254
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:54,820
you're 12. So it might be in like that
area, but I don't know a lot about that,

255
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,730
so...

256
00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:01,270
- Yeah, it's interesting where you can go
with it. All right? You can take this,

257
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:04,810
because even Artie even you were saying
something about hormones before with maybe

258
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:09,360
why that treatment gave a sore throat.
What were you saying about that?

259
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:15,330
- I don't know, maybe it had to do with
the parathyroid gland. I don't know, maybe

260
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:22,310
it like produced too much, I don't know,
the jaw bone, and it reached the jawbone

261
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:28,530
first and I thought that it had too much
and like released all of it and went to,

262
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:31,800
the rest of the body...

263
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:39,010
- So which hormone of the calcium related
hormones would we wanna increase if we

264
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,230
thought along those lines?

265
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,790
- Maybe that's why your jaw's--, if you
release a lot of that hormone then it's

266
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:52,470
building your jaw up and when you're
building bone you get growing pains. Maybe

267
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:57,690
it was like a growing pain thing in your
jaw? Maybe.
