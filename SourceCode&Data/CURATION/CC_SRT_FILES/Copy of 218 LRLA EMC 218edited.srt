1
00:00:00,563 --> 00:00:02,200
- This is a classroom where

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,683
I push in for language arts.

3
00:00:05,683 --> 00:00:07,285
This is a morning meeting area,

4
00:00:07,285 --> 00:00:09,003
and this is also the area where

5
00:00:09,003 --> 00:00:17,328
any whole group instruction
would take place.

6
00:00:17,328 --> 00:00:19,917
Over here is the area that the assistant

7
00:00:19,917 --> 00:00:21,565
sits and works with children and does

8
00:00:21,565 --> 00:00:23,721
phonemic awareness activities.

9
00:00:23,721 --> 00:00:25,045
Here is a word wall, and

10
00:00:25,045 --> 00:00:27,007
where the students keep their folders

11
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:28,365
with their reading books in it,

12
00:00:28,365 --> 00:00:30,443
their book boxes.

13
00:00:30,443 --> 00:00:33,160
Here is where the classroom

14
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,645
teacher does word study.

15
00:00:35,645 --> 00:00:39,003
This is the independent work station.

16
00:00:39,003 --> 00:00:40,765
And here is where I sit, and I'm

17
00:00:40,765 --> 00:00:43,400
responsible for the reading instruction.

18
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,207
This is where the guided
reading groups meet.

19
00:00:48,207 --> 00:00:52,360
This is a little reading area over here.

20
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,161
Where the students can do

21
00:00:53,161 --> 00:01:06,362
some independent reading.

22
00:01:06,362 --> 00:01:07,441
- You know what Jane told me to do

23
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:09,206
that I liked also?

24
00:01:09,206 --> 00:01:10,402
Looking at the word and chunking

25
00:01:10,402 --> 00:01:12,399
are good things to do.

26
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:14,280
Jane said go back and reread and

27
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,764
make sure it sounds right and makes sense.

28
00:01:16,764 --> 00:01:18,204
And that's something, Jesus, I want

29
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:20,201
us to start practicing a little more.

30
00:01:20,201 --> 00:01:22,244
When we get to a word that tricks us,

31
00:01:22,244 --> 00:01:24,078
Put the book flat, Sarah, please

32
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:26,400
We want to go back, and reread,

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,606
and check and make sure it makes sense.

34
00:01:28,606 --> 00:01:30,197
Okay, here's something else I want us

35
00:01:30,197 --> 00:01:33,088
to do today with this book, Rascal.

36
00:01:33,088 --> 00:01:35,120
I want us to think about what

37
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,919
happened in the story today.

38
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:38,684
And we're going to do it this way.

39
00:01:38,684 --> 00:01:40,321
I want all eyes up here.

40
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:42,399
We're gonna use this wipe board.

41
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,326
- It's a big wipe board.

42
00:01:44,326 --> 00:01:45,998
- It is, and you have a little one.

43
00:01:45,998 --> 00:01:47,484
And you will probably get a chance

44
00:01:47,484 --> 00:01:48,877
to use it, too.

45
00:01:48,877 --> 00:01:50,596
But first, I'm gonna write on the big one.

46
00:01:50,596 --> 00:01:54,078
Okay.

47
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:55,774
The first word up here, Jesus,

48
00:01:55,774 --> 00:01:57,840
I'm gonna ask you to help me read it.

49
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,280
I'm gonna chunk it because you know

50
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,807
the first part of this word

51
00:02:01,807 --> 00:02:03,526
- [Child} Some.

52
00:02:03,526 --> 00:02:06,204
Okay, Jesus is gonna help us.

53
00:02:06,204 --> 00:02:09,246
Okay, Jesus, go ahead and
help me read this word.

54
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:10,079
- [Jesus] Some.

55
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:11,045
- Can you try...
- [Jesus] body

56
00:02:11,045 --> 00:02:12,844
- Somebody, good job.

57
00:02:12,844 --> 00:02:15,004
You see how he broke that into chunks?

58
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:16,037
Do you see that, Jane?

59
00:02:16,037 --> 00:02:17,407
Somebody.

60
00:02:17,407 --> 00:02:18,684
Let's think about the story.

61
00:02:18,684 --> 00:02:19,474
Hands down.

62
00:02:19,474 --> 00:02:20,484
I want you to think about the question

63
00:02:20,484 --> 00:02:21,911
before you put your hand up.

64
00:02:21,911 --> 00:02:23,607
Somebody.

65
00:02:23,607 --> 00:02:25,151
Somebody's in the story.

66
00:02:25,151 --> 00:02:26,521
Who is the somebody?

67
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,733
Who is this story mostly about?

68
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:30,163
Kelly's gonna help us.

69
00:02:30,163 --> 00:02:32,926
Kelly, who's this story mostly about?

70
00:02:32,926 --> 00:02:38,163
Put your hand down, Sarah.

71
00:02:38,163 --> 00:02:44,897
- [Kelly] I think is (inaudible)

72
00:02:44,897 --> 00:02:47,397
Josie's taking Rascal to the vet.

73
00:02:47,397 --> 00:02:48,280
- You're right.

74
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,882
Josie's taking Rascal to the vet.

75
00:02:49,882 --> 00:02:51,565
So who are we talking about in the story?

76
00:02:51,565 --> 00:02:53,400
Are we talking mostly about Rascal,

77
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,199
or are we talking mostly about the vet?

78
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,430
Hands down, let her think.

79
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,357
She'll ask for help if she needs it.

80
00:02:58,357 --> 00:03:01,399
Who do you think the story's mostly about?

81
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:02,763
- [Kelly] Um,

82
00:03:02,763 --> 00:03:04,121
Rascal.

83
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:05,718
- Rascal, I agree.

84
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,767
Thumbs up if you agree.

85
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:09,404
Thumbs up if you agree.

86
00:03:09,404 --> 00:03:11,563
Sarah, do you agree?

87
00:03:11,563 --> 00:03:15,081
I agree, do you agree?

88
00:03:15,081 --> 00:03:16,404
You do, I see a thumbs up.

89
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,240
Okay?

90
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,517
So what did you want to say about

91
00:03:18,517 --> 00:03:21,197
the title of the story?

92
00:03:21,197 --> 00:03:25,202
- [Child] Maybe the story was mostly

93
00:03:25,202 --> 00:03:30,125
about Rascal because the title.

94
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,319
- Jackie, did you hear what Sarah said?

95
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,002
She said, that's some
good thinking, Sarah.

96
00:03:34,002 --> 00:03:35,605
She said she also knew it was mostly

97
00:03:35,605 --> 00:03:37,799
about Rascal because the title was in it.

98
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:39,632
I knew it was mostly about Rascal because

99
00:03:39,632 --> 00:03:41,247
I read the story and they talked

100
00:03:41,247 --> 00:03:44,007
about Rascal a lot in the story.

101
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:47,246
Rascal.

102
00:03:47,246 --> 00:03:51,960
Rascal

103
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,923
Okay.

104
00:03:52,923 --> 00:03:54,560
Rascal's in the story.

105
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,046
Alright.

106
00:03:56,046 --> 00:03:59,158
Rascal, now, there's a problem.

107
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:01,166
At the very beginning of the story,

108
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,362
and I'm gonna go back in the book

109
00:04:02,362 --> 00:04:07,534
and look and see what it is.

110
00:04:07,534 --> 00:04:08,727
Sarah, what's a problem in the

111
00:04:08,727 --> 00:04:11,397
very beginning of the story?

112
00:04:11,397 --> 00:04:15,205
- [Sarah] I read the words and it said

113
00:04:15,205 --> 00:04:18,479
he didn't want to go in the door

114
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:20,488
to see the vet.

115
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:23,445
- He didn't want to go to the vet.

116
00:04:23,445 --> 00:04:25,245
Why do you think he didn't want

117
00:04:25,245 --> 00:04:26,963
to go to the vet, Jackie?

118
00:04:26,963 --> 00:04:28,043
How come?

119
00:04:28,043 --> 00:04:29,192
Why do you think Rascal didn't want

120
00:04:29,192 --> 00:04:30,806
to go to the doctor?

121
00:04:30,806 --> 00:04:32,966
Let's listen to what Jackie says.

122
00:04:32,966 --> 00:04:34,800
- [Jackie] 'Cause he's scared.

123
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,925
- He's scared.

124
00:04:36,925 --> 00:04:39,351
How did you know that he's scared, Jackie?

125
00:04:39,351 --> 00:04:40,373
I agree.

126
00:04:40,373 --> 00:04:41,452
How did you know that?

127
00:04:41,452 --> 00:04:45,527
(inaudible)

128
00:04:45,527 --> 00:04:47,048
- Because the picture
shows he's looking like

129
00:04:47,048 --> 00:04:48,847
he's upset or sad.

130
00:04:48,847 --> 00:04:50,682
And I like how Sarah said she read

131
00:04:50,682 --> 00:04:53,155
in the story, Eddie, she read that

132
00:04:53,155 --> 00:04:54,919
he didn't want to go to the vet.

133
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:58,809
Turn the page.

134
00:04:58,809 --> 00:05:00,167
I see other things happening.

135
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:02,414
I'm gonna ask you about that in a minute.

136
00:05:02,414 --> 00:05:04,283
Okay, so somebody is Rascal.

137
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:07,841
And Rascal, the problem is, he didn't

138
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:08,967
want to go,

139
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:14,444
Rascal didn't

140
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:16,708
want

141
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:17,962
you know what, Kelly, come up here

142
00:05:17,962 --> 00:05:19,007
and help me write.

143
00:05:19,007 --> 00:05:20,086
'Cause you can write

144
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,363
the rest of what I'm gonna write.

145
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:24,881
Come up here.

146
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:25,798
Didn't,

147
00:05:25,798 --> 00:05:28,477
Oh, I'm gonna do the want part.

148
00:05:28,477 --> 00:05:30,834
Didn't want.

149
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:32,157
Rereading helps me think about

150
00:05:32,157 --> 00:05:33,283
what I want to write.

151
00:05:33,283 --> 00:05:35,803
Rascal didn't want what?

152
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:37,149
To go.

153
00:05:37,149 --> 00:05:39,432
Can you write to go?

154
00:05:39,432 --> 00:05:49,917
Don't forget to space.

155
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:53,804
Rascal didn't want to go to,

156
00:05:53,804 --> 00:06:00,874
let's have a bigger space.

157
00:06:00,874 --> 00:06:07,724
Rascal didn't want to go to the

158
00:06:07,724 --> 00:06:12,240
I like how you're all looking to see.

159
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,517
You're good, that's fine.

160
00:06:13,517 --> 00:06:15,723
Just keep going.

161
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:17,523
Good, thank you.

162
00:06:17,523 --> 00:06:21,444
Rascal didn't want to go to the

163
00:06:21,444 --> 00:06:23,078
Who wants to try vet?

164
00:06:23,078 --> 00:06:24,039
Sarah you want to try?

165
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:26,117
That's a word we haven't written before.

166
00:06:26,117 --> 00:06:26,999
But I know that she can think

167
00:06:26,999 --> 00:06:28,125
about the sounds in it,

168
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:36,318
and I bet you she can do it.

169
00:06:36,318 --> 00:06:37,163
Good job.

170
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,402
Thank you, Sarah.

171
00:06:38,402 --> 00:06:40,039
Okay.

172
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:44,360
Rascal didn't want to go to the vet.

173
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,365
But,

174
00:06:45,365 --> 00:06:49,635
but what?

175
00:06:49,635 --> 00:06:50,761
Eddie, but what?

176
00:06:50,761 --> 00:06:53,165
He didn't want to go?

177
00:06:53,165 --> 00:07:01,449
- [Eddie] But

178
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:05,389
He went and he was scaring the animals.

179
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:06,446
Oh my goodness.

180
00:07:06,446 --> 00:07:10,437
Rascal didn't want to go to the vet, but

181
00:07:10,437 --> 00:07:14,082
he went anyway and scared the animals.

182
00:07:14,082 --> 00:07:15,441
Hold on a minute, Jane, 'cause I know

183
00:07:15,441 --> 00:07:16,683
you're gonna help me.

184
00:07:16,683 --> 00:07:22,357
But he went

185
00:07:22,357 --> 00:07:27,117
anyway.

186
00:07:27,117 --> 00:07:29,764
Hold on one second, then you can tell me.

187
00:07:29,764 --> 00:07:32,400
and scared,

188
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,083
should we say, I'm thinking

189
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,070
about how this should sound,

190
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,125
I'm thinking about what
happened in the story.

191
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:40,887
but he went anyway and
scared the other animals,

192
00:07:40,887 --> 00:07:44,602
or other animals, or the animals?

193
00:07:44,602 --> 00:07:47,679
He did scare cats, who else did he scare?

194
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:49,083
- [Child] the mouse.

195
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:51,359
- Can I have a quiet
hand for someone else?

196
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:53,484
He scared the cat, the mouse.

197
00:07:53,484 --> 00:07:54,958
Jackie, who else did he

198
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,408
We can always, let Jackie help.

199
00:07:57,408 --> 00:07:58,998
Let Jackie help, let's look.

200
00:07:58,998 --> 00:08:00,844
Jackie, let's go back and look.

201
00:08:00,844 --> 00:08:02,725
And you're looking at the pictures.

202
00:08:02,725 --> 00:08:04,765
Jackie's gonna help us.

203
00:08:04,765 --> 00:08:07,389
Jackie, I see the cat that Jane said.

204
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:08,840
What other animal do you see

205
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,481
in the picture that he scared?

206
00:08:13,481 --> 00:08:15,409
- the parrot and the rabbit.

207
00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:17,848
Oh, okay, the parrot and the rabbit.

208
00:08:17,848 --> 00:08:20,840
Okay, he went anyway and scared

209
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,728
a rabbit,

210
00:08:25,728 --> 00:08:26,680
I'm gonna put this mark here

211
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,281
'cause I have a couple things I'm saying.

212
00:08:29,281 --> 00:08:33,309
a cat

213
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:34,842
and I don't have room here, so I need to

214
00:08:34,842 --> 00:08:38,244
erase this word, so I
have room to keep writing.

215
00:08:38,244 --> 00:08:41,685
He went anyway and scared a rabbit,

216
00:08:41,685 --> 00:08:46,887
a cat, and

217
00:08:46,887 --> 00:08:49,406
what's the last thing
I need to say, Kelly?

218
00:08:49,406 --> 00:08:52,758
And, a what?

219
00:08:52,758 --> 00:08:53,640
- [Child] Parrot.

220
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,402
- Parrot.

221
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:56,644
- [Kelly] And I wanted to say

222
00:08:56,644 --> 00:08:59,918
- Okay, what did you want to say?

223
00:08:59,918 --> 00:09:03,645
- [Kelly] I want to say
that I really know about

224
00:09:03,645 --> 00:09:08,226
these, I know their
names, they call commas.

225
00:09:08,226 --> 00:09:10,327
- You're right., thank you.

226
00:09:10,327 --> 00:09:11,720
Kelly helped me because I didn't say what

227
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,044
these were called.

228
00:09:13,044 --> 00:09:15,238
She reminded us that
those are called commas.

229
00:09:15,238 --> 00:09:16,318
Thank you, Kelly.

230
00:09:16,318 --> 00:09:18,640
Okay, one moment, Jane.

231
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,161
I want us to think about the story,

232
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:22,517
and I want us to think
about what's happening.

233
00:09:22,517 --> 00:09:26,360
Rascal didn't want to go to the vet, but

234
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,402
he went anyway and scared a rabbit,

235
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,643
a cat, and a parrot.

236
00:09:31,643 --> 00:09:35,602
So we have a big problem.

237
00:09:35,602 --> 00:09:37,041
- [Child] we need to find a solution.

238
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,678
- We need to find a solution.

239
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,777
What is our solution to the problem?

240
00:09:40,777 --> 00:09:41,688
Sarah?

241
00:09:41,688 --> 00:09:42,928
Can you sit on your bottom

242
00:09:42,928 --> 00:09:45,084
so you don't fall and hurt yourself?

243
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:48,088
- [Child] my solution is that

244
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:51,199
at the end of the

245
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:57,875
story, right here,

246
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:02,995
he goes in to the vet,

247
00:10:02,995 --> 00:10:06,118
so he doesn't scare the other animals.

248
00:10:06,118 --> 00:10:07,802
- [Teacher] Okay, I
like how all of you went

249
00:10:07,802 --> 00:10:09,590
back to check the
solution, and you went back

250
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:12,202
in the story to help you
understand what happened.

251
00:10:12,202 --> 00:10:15,162
Jane, I like what Sarah said, and I'm

252
00:10:15,162 --> 00:10:16,846
thinking about how I can write that.

253
00:10:16,846 --> 00:10:18,158
Sarah was looking at this page,

254
00:10:18,158 --> 00:10:20,039
and she saw how he went into the vet,

255
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:22,082
and now he won't scare the other animals.

256
00:10:22,082 --> 00:10:23,127
Okay.

257
00:10:23,127 --> 00:10:24,601
- [Jane] Can I read this page?

258
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:27,597
Yes, and in fact, Jane wants to read it,

259
00:10:27,597 --> 00:10:28,874
and she's gonna, I want all of us

260
00:10:28,874 --> 00:10:30,400
to read it with our eyes, because I

261
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,119
want us to listen to how that sounds

262
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:34,081
with those dark parts the author said.

263
00:10:34,081 --> 00:10:35,880
Go ahead, Jane, are you ready?

264
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:41,488
(inaudible)

265
00:10:41,488 --> 00:10:42,997
I love how that sounded, and

266
00:10:42,997 --> 00:10:45,203
I saw you were practicing
that, too, Kelly.

267
00:10:45,203 --> 00:10:48,102
Let's all practice that to ourselves.

268
00:10:48,102 --> 00:10:52,041
The big dog growled, grrrrr.

269
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,477
Rascal ran.

270
00:10:54,477 --> 00:10:56,242
Jesus, how did she know,

271
00:10:56,242 --> 00:10:59,109
How did Jane know to say Rascal ran?

272
00:10:59,109 --> 00:11:02,014
How did she know to read it like that?

273
00:11:02,014 --> 00:11:06,038
- [Jesus] The author
wrote it in dark and big.

274
00:11:06,038 --> 00:11:07,768
- He wrote it in dark and big,

275
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:09,045
he sure did.

276
00:11:09,045 --> 00:11:10,484
And he said something else, Eddie,

277
00:11:10,484 --> 00:11:12,040
that I want you to look at.

278
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,607
He wrote it dark and big, and what else

279
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:17,417
did he put there at the end?

280
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:18,762
Remember what that mark's called?

281
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:22,361
It's a big, fancy long word.

282
00:11:22,361 --> 00:11:23,963
That's okay, Sarah's gonna help us.

283
00:11:23,963 --> 00:11:25,206
This mark, right here, Eddie,

284
00:11:25,206 --> 00:11:26,518
is what we're talking about.

285
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:27,644
- [Eddie] Comma?

286
00:11:27,644 --> 00:11:33,400
- Nope, but it looks

287
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,876
- [Eddie] Somebody that's talking.

288
00:11:34,876 --> 00:11:36,200
- Yes, and when they're loud,

289
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,477
go ahead, Sarah.

290
00:11:37,477 --> 00:11:38,917
- An exclamation mark.

291
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:39,520
- Yeah.

292
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,041
That word is a very long word and

293
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,806
it's new to us Eddie,
so we're learning it.

294
00:11:42,806 --> 00:11:44,559
Do you wanna try and say it after me?

295
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:47,079
Exclamation mark, yeah.

296
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:48,363
That shows they're excited

297
00:11:48,363 --> 00:11:49,537
- You mean this?
- Yeah.

298
00:11:49,537 --> 00:11:51,604
- Oh, I though you were this.

299
00:11:51,604 --> 00:11:53,484
- Oh, well, no wonder, I was tricking you

300
00:11:53,484 --> 00:11:55,723
by accident, I'm so sorry, Eddie.

301
00:11:55,723 --> 00:11:57,847
Yes, I was talking about
the exclamation mark.

302
00:11:57,847 --> 00:12:00,204
Okay, Rascal didn't want to go to

303
00:12:00,204 --> 00:12:02,317
the vet, but he went anyway and scared

304
00:12:02,317 --> 00:12:04,639
a rabbit, a cat, and a parrot.

305
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,566
And so the end of the story should say,

306
00:12:06,566 --> 00:12:08,633
that, it's a solution,

307
00:12:08,633 --> 00:12:11,884
Sarah was

308
00:12:11,884 --> 00:12:13,799
- He ran into the vet.

309
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:17,999
- What made him?

310
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:21,301
Why did he run?

311
00:12:21,301 --> 00:12:22,903
- Because he was scared.

312
00:12:22,903 --> 00:12:23,674
- Of what?

313
00:12:23,674 --> 00:12:24,887
- the dog.

314
00:12:24,887 --> 00:12:27,321
- Jesus, did you hear what Sarah said?

315
00:12:27,321 --> 00:12:29,005
So let's think about that.

316
00:12:29,005 --> 00:12:32,836
But,

317
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,647
but he saw a what?

318
00:12:34,647 --> 00:12:35,750
- [Jesus] Big dog.

319
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,480
- Come over here and help me write.

320
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,152
Me and Jesus are gonna
write this together.

321
00:12:39,152 --> 00:12:41,367
Come on over here, Jesus.

322
00:12:41,367 --> 00:12:43,480
Lemme move this out of
your way, I'm sorry.

323
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,198
Okay, go over here.

324
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:46,963
And turn around so everyone can read,

325
00:12:46,963 --> 00:12:48,321
come over by me.

326
00:12:48,321 --> 00:12:50,678
But he, you can write the word, he.

327
00:12:50,678 --> 00:12:52,280
Go ahead.

328
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:57,319
Write it under here.

329
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:58,282
Thank you.

330
00:12:58,282 --> 00:13:01,881
Now I'm gonna help you,
give me the marker?

331
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,370
Jackie, I need you to look over here, so

332
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:04,438
you can help us if we need it.

333
00:13:04,438 --> 00:13:06,479
Go stand over here for a second.

334
00:13:06,479 --> 00:13:13,357
But he, oops, he saw,

335
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:14,518
you go ahead

336
00:13:14,518 --> 00:13:19,039
a

337
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:19,824
a what?

338
00:13:19,824 --> 00:13:21,526
He saw a what?

339
00:13:21,526 --> 00:13:23,407
Jackie, he saw a what?

340
00:13:23,407 --> 00:13:24,766
- [Jackie] A big dog.

341
00:13:24,766 --> 00:13:26,484
- A big dog.

342
00:13:26,484 --> 00:13:34,878
And those are words
you know, go ahead.

343
00:13:34,878 --> 00:13:37,084
Now come down here so
we don't go too far up.

344
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:43,922
Dog.

345
00:13:43,922 --> 00:13:45,606
Oops, something's tricking you.

346
00:13:45,606 --> 00:13:51,167
Go ahead and turn that around.

347
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:53,207
Thank you, go ahead,
give me the marker back.

348
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,448
Thank you.

349
00:13:55,448 --> 00:13:57,282
Hold on.

350
00:13:57,282 --> 00:14:01,207
But he saw a big dog

351
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,726
and, what happened?

352
00:14:03,726 --> 00:14:05,892
What happened, Sarah?

353
00:14:05,892 --> 00:14:07,874
- [Sarah] He

354
00:14:07,874 --> 00:14:09,000
- [Teacher] Yeah?

355
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,879
- [Sarah] ran.

356
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:12,526
- [Teacher] And he ran.

357
00:14:12,526 --> 00:14:13,524
Okay, come over and help me

358
00:14:13,524 --> 00:14:22,197
write that then, please.

359
00:14:22,197 --> 00:14:24,365
Come on over, over here.

360
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:38,157
And he ran.

361
00:14:38,157 --> 00:14:38,877
Good.

362
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:40,804
Go ahead and sit down.

363
00:14:40,804 --> 00:14:43,321
and he ran, where?

364
00:14:43,321 --> 00:14:44,679
- [Sarah] Into the vet.

365
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:46,478
Okay, I'm gonna just finish this.

366
00:14:46,478 --> 00:14:49,648
And he ran in

367
00:14:49,648 --> 00:14:52,806
Into is easy because you
know both of those parts.

368
00:14:52,806 --> 00:14:55,720
And he ran into the

369
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,881
into the vet?

370
00:14:56,881 --> 00:15:00,899
Or into the vet's?

371
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,727
What's that place?

372
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:04,198
Let's put that, office or room.

373
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:05,243
Let's put room.

374
00:15:05,243 --> 00:15:07,649
But both of those are good choices.
