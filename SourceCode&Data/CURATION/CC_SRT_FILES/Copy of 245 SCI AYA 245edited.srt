1
00:00:00,872 --> 00:00:02,635
- Okay, so ready to go here?

2
00:00:02,723 --> 00:00:03,553
Okay.

3
00:00:07,064 --> 00:00:10,133
I'd like to take you back
to the fifth century.

4
00:00:10,753 --> 00:00:12,484
To a time when Attila the Hun

5
00:00:12,484 --> 00:00:14,800
was uniting the barbarian tribes

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,282
and he was leading his great dark horde

7
00:00:18,404 --> 00:00:21,023
to conquer the lands of
Gaul, or Western Europe,

8
00:00:21,575 --> 00:00:24,263
much to the chagrin of the Roman Empire.

9
00:00:24,814 --> 00:00:27,769
"But where," I hear you ask
"Is Attila the Hun himself?"

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,288
Well, I fear he has perished.

11
00:00:30,294 --> 00:00:31,860
He died in a drunken brawl,

12
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,799
would you believe on his wedding night?

13
00:00:35,355 --> 00:00:38,343
And who am I, I hear you ask,
to be telling such a tale?

14
00:00:39,185 --> 00:00:41,367
Why, I am Mrs. Attila the Hun

15
00:00:41,367 --> 00:00:43,997
and it has been left to
me to guide the dark horde

16
00:00:44,026 --> 00:00:47,375
as we continue to conquer
the lands of Gaul.

17
00:00:49,447 --> 00:00:51,419
Javelins, and bows and arrows,

18
00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:53,476
those were very well
and good for tacticians

19
00:00:53,476 --> 00:00:56,540
such as Attila the Hun, but
what do I know about tactics?

20
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,327
- [Josh] Not much.
- So I need something--

21
00:00:58,327 --> 00:01:00,342
- [Teacher] Very little, you are right!

22
00:01:00,474 --> 00:01:02,617
Josh the Hun is right!

23
00:01:02,774 --> 00:01:07,774
So, what I need is to get
some sort of a war machine.

24
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:10,111
Now, let's first think
about what characteristics

25
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:13,240
do I need in a weapon that
would help us against--

26
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,365
to help us conquer the lands of Gaul.

27
00:01:17,365 --> 00:01:20,712
What characteristics do
we need in the weapon?

28
00:01:20,712 --> 00:01:22,275
What do we need it to do?

29
00:01:22,884 --> 00:01:24,120
- [Male Student] Hurt people.

30
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:27,172
- In other words we need to have

31
00:01:27,172 --> 00:01:28,728
some sort of damage at

32
00:01:28,728 --> 00:01:30,990
the end of property or

33
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,047
- [Male Student] Force.

34
00:01:32,047 --> 00:01:33,045
- something else.

35
00:01:33,045 --> 00:01:35,257
So, a force, we need to
have some sort of force.

36
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:35,895
- Range.

37
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,334
- What else, I'm sorry, Jackie?

38
00:01:37,334 --> 00:01:37,986
- Range.

39
00:01:37,986 --> 00:01:39,588
- Range, the range would be a good thing,

40
00:01:39,588 --> 00:01:42,374
especially if we can get
beyond bow range, right?

41
00:01:42,374 --> 00:01:44,370
That would help out to get

42
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,713
some of the castle walls destroyed

43
00:01:47,713 --> 00:01:50,262
before we even get far, right?

44
00:01:50,268 --> 00:01:51,266
- Steph.

45
00:01:51,266 --> 00:01:52,173
- [Steph] Efficiency?

46
00:01:52,173 --> 00:01:54,558
Efficiency, can you tell me
more about what you're thinking?

47
00:01:54,668 --> 00:01:58,767
- [Steph] Well, being
able to complete said task

48
00:01:58,767 --> 00:02:03,602
without much power used in maneuvering?

49
00:02:03,621 --> 00:02:07,794
- All right, we need to be
able to move the machine around

50
00:02:07,974 --> 00:02:09,826
to be able to get the job done.

51
00:02:10,075 --> 00:02:12,152
We need to be able to not, perhaps,

52
00:02:12,152 --> 00:02:14,138
use every single Hun for it.

53
00:02:14,138 --> 00:02:15,762
So efficiency in being able to load it

54
00:02:15,762 --> 00:02:17,326
and being able to use it.

55
00:02:17,423 --> 00:02:20,730
Anything else that we need
in a weapon to help us

56
00:02:20,793 --> 00:02:24,745
in our destroying and pillaging
of towns and villages?

57
00:02:24,795 --> 00:02:25,816
Yes, Katie.

58
00:02:25,816 --> 00:02:27,888
- [Katie] Possibly something
that you could use again?

59
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,497
- [Teacher] Oh yes, if we only use it once

60
00:02:29,497 --> 00:02:31,017
that's kind of a problem, isn't it?

61
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:33,095
We want to be able to use it repeatedly.

62
00:02:33,095 --> 00:02:34,146
Good idea.

63
00:02:34,152 --> 00:02:35,288
Other things we want to think about?

64
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:36,025
Joe.

65
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:37,251
- [Joe] Something that's mobile.

66
00:02:37,251 --> 00:02:39,120
- [Teacher] All right, so
maybe wheels might help,

67
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,449
or being able to be something that

68
00:02:40,477 --> 00:02:41,785
could be lifted or carried.

69
00:02:42,035 --> 00:02:43,150
Okay, those are good thoughts.

70
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:43,777
Jackie.

71
00:02:43,777 --> 00:02:46,185
- [Jackie] Accessibility, like
making sure it's easy to use

72
00:02:46,192 --> 00:02:47,861
and not like difficult to set up?

73
00:02:47,861 --> 00:02:49,522
- [Teacher] So if it
takes a bunch of people

74
00:02:49,522 --> 00:02:51,832
and they're struggling to reset it,

75
00:02:51,832 --> 00:02:53,283
maybe not a good idea.

76
00:02:53,283 --> 00:02:56,830
Something that perhaps a few
people might be able to handle.

77
00:02:57,137 --> 00:03:00,545
All right so we've had a
good deal of ideas so far.

78
00:03:00,596 --> 00:03:01,479
That's really good.

79
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:04,783
So, I need some sort of a war machine.

80
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:08,602
Something that would have all
of those properties in it.

81
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,201
Hmmm, why, what is this?

82
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,454
- [Male Student] Message
for you Mrs. The Hun.

83
00:03:16,624 --> 00:03:18,643
- [Teacher] A message, okay, let's see.

84
00:03:19,135 --> 00:03:24,135
Why, it is news of a new siege
engine called a trebuchet.

85
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:26,099
- [Students] Ooh.

86
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:29,215
- We have a picture of our new war weapon,

87
00:03:29,215 --> 00:03:31,138
but here's the challenge:

88
00:03:32,176 --> 00:03:34,845
I need to build the best trebuchet,

89
00:03:34,845 --> 00:03:37,256
the best war machine that I can

90
00:03:37,992 --> 00:03:41,695
and I'm not certain what
properties, what characteristics,

91
00:03:41,695 --> 00:03:44,806
what parts of this machine,
I should emphasize.

92
00:03:44,806 --> 00:03:47,379
How big they should be,
how strong they should be.

93
00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:51,413
So I'm going to need you to help me out.

94
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:56,144
I'm going to make little
groups of Huns in order

95
00:03:56,144 --> 00:03:59,156
to create a model of our trebuchet.

96
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:02,145
Each group can then test
a different quality.

97
00:04:02,145 --> 00:04:05,112
What sorts of things could we change

98
00:04:05,164 --> 00:04:08,768
to test our trebuchet, to see
what would be the best one?

99
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:09,877
Caroline.

100
00:04:09,877 --> 00:04:11,781
- [Caroline} The weight on the opposite end?

101
00:04:11,781 --> 00:04:13,185
- [Teacher] All right, the weight,

102
00:04:13,185 --> 00:04:15,763
the counter weight and the load.

103
00:04:15,763 --> 00:04:18,502
Both of those things, and
perhaps the ratio of them,

104
00:04:18,502 --> 00:04:19,941
could be rather important.

105
00:04:19,941 --> 00:04:20,662
Josh.

106
00:04:20,662 --> 00:04:22,774
- [Josh] Like the ratio of the arm

107
00:04:22,774 --> 00:04:24,399
on either side of the axle.

108
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,617
- [Teacher] All right, the
lever arm and how it changes,

109
00:04:26,617 --> 00:04:28,334
that could be an important idea.

110
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,382
Other things that we
might be able to change,

111
00:04:30,382 --> 00:04:32,012
to vary or test?

112
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:34,729
Anything else we might be thinking of?

113
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:35,456
Kate.

114
00:04:35,456 --> 00:04:37,057
- On the angle, right there.

115
00:04:37,057 --> 00:04:38,741
- Ah yes, the angle and

116
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:40,574
the angle of launch has a lot to do with.

117
00:04:40,574 --> 00:04:45,299
There's a little pin that
holds the sling in position

118
00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:47,273
until the lever arm releases it.

119
00:04:47,273 --> 00:04:50,691
So the angle of launch and
changing that could be important.

120
00:04:51,512 --> 00:04:52,969
Anything else we might try?

121
00:04:53,032 --> 00:04:54,571
Anything else we could change?

122
00:04:55,471 --> 00:04:57,139
We've had some really good ideas.

123
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:02,182
All right, so I'd like to break
you into your small groups

124
00:05:02,182 --> 00:05:04,841
and I'd like you to decide on what exactly

125
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:06,959
your group is going to test.

126
00:05:07,047 --> 00:05:11,040
We'll come back together in several days

127
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,890
in order to share the
ideas and information.

128
00:05:14,186 --> 00:05:16,630
So I need you to prove
your loyalty me, Huns.

129
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,386
Build this trebuchet and test it

130
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:22,318
and if Attila the Hun were here right now,

131
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:25,900
he'd say, "What are you
doing laying your duffs?"

132
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,438
"Get to work, Huns!"

133
00:05:27,826 --> 00:05:29,426
Let's get into our small groups

134
00:05:29,426 --> 00:05:33,750
and see what you can decide
on for your trebuchet.

135
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:38,971
(students talking and chairs scooting)

136
00:06:02,254 --> 00:06:05,591
And you can choose whatever
it is that interests you.

137
00:06:05,713 --> 00:06:07,548
You can choose something that we did

138
00:06:07,548 --> 00:06:08,640
or something different.

139
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,066
But what you want to remember
is that you have to decide

140
00:06:11,066 --> 00:06:13,248
what to do before any work.

141
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:15,524
You have to decide "I'm going
to change this part of it"

142
00:06:15,524 --> 00:06:18,407
"and keep everything the
same" until we take data.

143
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:21,960
(classroom noise drowns out conversation)

144
00:07:07,272 --> 00:07:09,408
Remind me, first of all, what
it was you were changing.

145
00:07:09,408 --> 00:07:10,592
- [Blond Student] Counterweight.

146
00:07:10,592 --> 00:07:12,310
- [Teacher] Counterweight,
so you're leaving

147
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,295
the same object that you're launching?

148
00:07:14,295 --> 00:07:15,851
- [Blond Student] We're
just changing counterweight.

149
00:07:15,851 --> 00:07:18,532
- So, what, is that your weight?

150
00:07:18,532 --> 00:07:19,287
- Yes.

151
00:07:19,287 --> 00:07:23,616
- [Teacher] Okay, so what
challenges did you have, if any,

152
00:07:23,616 --> 00:07:26,949
in building this to
test your counterweight?

153
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:30,345
- We had problems with
the sling and the pouch.

154
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:33,606
Like, at first we made it really long,

155
00:07:33,868 --> 00:07:35,794
so like, that didn't really work.

156
00:07:35,794 --> 00:07:38,518
It didn't go anywhere, it
kind of just fell apart

157
00:07:38,534 --> 00:07:43,027
and then the pouch itself, it's
kind of like too long.

158
00:07:43,027 --> 00:07:44,461
So like it--

159
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:45,735
- So a little engineering before

160
00:07:45,735 --> 00:07:48,010
you could quite get one to work,

161
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,391
but you did then eventually get one

162
00:07:49,391 --> 00:07:50,795
by changing the--

163
00:07:50,795 --> 00:07:53,039
shortening the string
and shortening the sling?

164
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:53,494
- Yeah.

165
00:07:53,494 --> 00:07:54,256
- All right.

166
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,488
So, at that point then, it
looks like you had some data

167
00:07:57,488 --> 00:07:58,765
and you took several trials.

168
00:07:58,765 --> 00:08:01,109
Was there anything, just off the end,

169
00:08:01,109 --> 00:08:02,827
any pattern you happened to notice,

170
00:08:02,827 --> 00:08:04,656
just as you were taking the data?

171
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,604
- We noticed that if the
counterweight was too heavy,

172
00:08:08,604 --> 00:08:10,193
it would just kind of smack down

173
00:08:10,193 --> 00:08:11,866
and then if it was too
light it would just of like,

174
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,372
it would float and then just kind of fall.

175
00:08:14,372 --> 00:08:16,869
So there is an ideal
weight to counterweight

176
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:18,065
that would make it ...

177
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:21,246
- Yeah, like, our data, we
went from light to heavy

178
00:08:21,246 --> 00:08:25,007
and then it went from like not
so far to like, really far,

179
00:08:25,007 --> 00:08:26,754
to like back again.

180
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:33,291
- What if I wanted to know,
not 600 grams or 650, but 625?

181
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,296
How could you analyze
your data to allow me

182
00:08:38,296 --> 00:08:40,822
to interpolate between your data points

183
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:43,289
or to go beyond, if I wanted to know

184
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,274
what's going to happen at 775?

185
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,184
- [Female Student] Make
a graph or an equation.

186
00:08:47,184 --> 00:08:48,043
- Yeah.

187
00:08:48,043 --> 00:08:49,247
- [Teacher] Actually,
either of those would work,

188
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:51,603
coming up with an equation
or coming up with a graph.

189
00:08:51,603 --> 00:08:54,377
To me the graph is a very
visual way of doing it.

190
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:59,300
You could determine then
whether or not it is a parabola

191
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,888
or whether it's some
other sort of a curve.

192
00:09:02,588 --> 00:09:04,357
All right and that will
allow us to look at

193
00:09:04,357 --> 00:09:06,487
other data points which I
think would be very helpful.

194
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:10,776
So, your job then,
between now and Wednesday,

195
00:09:10,776 --> 00:09:13,655
is to come up with how
you want to analyze this

196
00:09:13,655 --> 00:09:16,175
so that you can explain
what the results were,

197
00:09:16,175 --> 00:09:18,979
from your trebuchet, without
sharing all of the numbers,

198
00:09:19,369 --> 00:09:22,107
but just by giving the ideas
of what it is you found.

199
00:09:22,107 --> 00:09:24,093
I think this is actually
very fascinating that

200
00:09:24,093 --> 00:09:26,670
you found your limit and
then it comes back down.

201
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,970
I think that's very interesting,

202
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,351
the fact that it's consistent.

203
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:31,935
So, help everyone else
figure out what would

204
00:09:31,935 --> 00:09:34,405
be the ideal conditions
according to your data.

205
00:09:34,405 --> 00:09:35,449
- [Female Student] Okay.

206
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,668
- All right.

207
00:09:36,668 --> 00:09:37,864
- [Female Student] We can do that.

208
00:09:42,104 --> 00:09:43,185
- [Female Student] Hello!

209
00:09:44,175 --> 00:09:46,161
- [Teacher] Ready to share trebuchet.

210
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:47,577
- Here's our data.

211
00:09:47,577 --> 00:09:49,644
- Okay, so first remind me what it was

212
00:09:49,644 --> 00:09:51,591
that you were changing or testing.

213
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,125
- [Female Student] We were
looking for the angle.

214
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,019
- [Teacher] The angle, okay,

215
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,840
and when you were trying
to build your trebuchet,

216
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,139
what challenges, if any, did you have

217
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:01,215
in trying to test this angle?

218
00:10:01,215 --> 00:10:02,480
- Well, when we were doing it,

219
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,660
we tried to make the arm in a way

220
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,628
that it would be really easily changeable.

221
00:10:08,796 --> 00:10:10,781
So it couldn't be like super secure.

222
00:10:10,781 --> 00:10:11,617
It had to be--

223
00:10:11,617 --> 00:10:12,917
we ended up doing it with rubber bands

224
00:10:12,917 --> 00:10:15,489
and like popsicle sticks, so
it was really easy to move.

225
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,295
- [Teacher] Okay.

226
00:10:16,295 --> 00:10:17,871
- [Female Student] It wasn't
a super intense trebuchet,

227
00:10:17,871 --> 00:10:18,799
but it works.

228
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:20,679
- Yeah, we built the whole
thing out of popcicle sticks.

229
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,050
- Now, I'm not certain they had

230
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,872
popcicle sticks back in the fifth century, but I think . . .

231
00:10:23,872 --> 00:10:24,776
- No, like twigs.

232
00:10:25,656 --> 00:10:26,556
- [Female Student] Twigs!

233
00:10:26,556 --> 00:10:28,432
- We'll do it with twigs,
that's a good idea.

234
00:10:28,432 --> 00:10:30,975
Alright, so, then it looks like you took

235
00:10:30,975 --> 00:10:32,495
some data at different angles,

236
00:10:32,495 --> 00:10:34,678
and you figured out then
the range that it went.

237
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,993
Was there any pattern or
anything that you noticed

238
00:10:37,993 --> 00:10:39,625
while you were taking the data?

239
00:10:41,622 --> 00:10:43,156
It's okay to say no.

240
00:10:43,156 --> 00:10:46,818
- Yeah, we noticed you'd want
to start it like farther back,

241
00:10:46,818 --> 00:10:48,490
like there'd be really no reason for you

242
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,516
to start it at a positive degree angle.

243
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:51,230
- Right.

244
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,525
- Because then it's--

245
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:55,073
- Because if it was positive
it wouldn't really go anywhere.

246
00:10:55,073 --> 00:10:56,999
- Starting with angles that made sense,

247
00:10:56,999 --> 00:10:59,768
that you knew would give you
enough energy to start it.

248
00:10:59,832 --> 00:11:02,397
All right, and then what did you discover

249
00:11:02,397 --> 00:11:04,308
about the angles that you did try?

250
00:11:05,638 --> 00:11:07,459
- That the farther back you went,

251
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:10,727
the greater length that it would go.

252
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:12,556
- So the very farthest
that you took it back

253
00:11:12,556 --> 00:11:14,692
did get the longest range.

254
00:11:14,692 --> 00:11:16,675
- Yes, that was the negative 45

255
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,041
and that was the largest one.

256
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,263
- Now, what limited you,
or was there a limit?

257
00:11:20,373 --> 00:11:21,836
You stopped at negative 45,

258
00:11:21,836 --> 00:11:23,298
could you have gone negative 50 or--

259
00:11:23,298 --> 00:11:25,295
- No, that was when we hit the ground

260
00:11:25,295 --> 00:11:26,851
because ours was so small.

261
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:29,394
It wasn't like high up
to go all the way back.

262
00:11:29,394 --> 00:11:30,577
- Ah, okay, all right,

263
00:11:30,577 --> 00:11:32,238
You were commenting on being high up.

264
00:11:33,408 --> 00:11:34,548
When we get together on Wednesday

265
00:11:34,548 --> 00:11:35,731
and we talk about conclusions,

266
00:11:35,731 --> 00:11:38,332
we'll also ask about what
could we try in the future

267
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:40,235
and that sounds like another something

268
00:11:40,235 --> 00:11:42,592
that you could potentially do.

269
00:11:42,592 --> 00:11:44,170
Where if you took the same model,

270
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:45,737
- but just lift it up?

271
00:11:45,737 --> 00:11:48,895
- Lifted it up, adapted it,
see if that would matter.

272
00:11:50,135 --> 00:11:51,596
All right that sounds good.

273
00:11:51,596 --> 00:11:53,593
So we've got several angles to comment on.

274
00:11:54,653 --> 00:11:58,068
If I wanted to make a guess as to what

275
00:11:58,068 --> 00:12:01,348
would happen at 35
degrees, or negative 35,

276
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:05,254
or at negative 50, is there
some way I could interpolate

277
00:12:05,254 --> 00:12:07,686
between data points or extrapolate beyond?

278
00:12:08,016 --> 00:12:09,933
Is there some way that you
could analyze your data

279
00:12:09,933 --> 00:12:12,290
that might allow me to
choose a different angle than

280
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,891
the ones you actually chose?

281
00:12:13,891 --> 00:12:16,793
- Yeah, you could probably
think of an average,

282
00:12:16,793 --> 00:12:18,766
you wouldn't assume that it
would be like 100% accurate,

283
00:12:20,246 --> 00:12:23,782
we wouldn't guarantee that,
but it would give a good idea.

284
00:12:23,782 --> 00:12:25,686
- [Teacher] All right so if
you did some averaging work,

285
00:12:25,686 --> 00:12:27,667
if you did some, been thinking of--

286
00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:29,005
- Actually, not so much averaging.

287
00:12:29,005 --> 00:12:30,180
- You could even set it up like ...

288
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,722
- Like side by side, like triangles.

289
00:12:32,722 --> 00:12:33,964
- Okay, okay.

290
00:12:33,964 --> 00:12:38,671
So, figuring out, maybe the ratios.

291
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,640
- Yeah, that's --

292
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,298
- That you should get here, using your,

293
00:12:42,298 --> 00:12:44,980
when you say your size and dimensions.

294
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,980
All right, and that is an
analysis that is so legitimate.

295
00:12:51,121 --> 00:12:52,898
These are equations you can come up with.

296
00:12:53,453 --> 00:12:56,014
You do have the option
of doing it visually,

297
00:12:56,065 --> 00:12:57,384
that is with a graph.

298
00:12:58,122 --> 00:13:00,060
Where you have your angles one direction,

299
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,208
and your range the other.

300
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,089
Just see what would happen now

301
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:05,548
with just the three data
points you have so far.

302
00:13:06,405 --> 00:13:09,749
You may find that there isn't enough data

303
00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:12,093
to be for certain of what would happen

304
00:13:12,093 --> 00:13:14,573
but you're certainly
welcome to attempt that

305
00:13:15,263 --> 00:13:17,828
in case there is a direct
linear relationship

306
00:13:17,828 --> 00:13:19,680
or something that's easily recognizable.

307
00:13:19,825 --> 00:13:22,793
So you get to choose however
you want to analyze your data.

308
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,609
When we come together on Wednesday,

309
00:13:24,609 --> 00:13:28,620
I will ask you to come up with
a conclusion if there is one.

310
00:13:28,626 --> 00:13:31,025
Some groups will find that
there's no conclusion that the

311
00:13:31,025 --> 00:13:32,849
(classroom noise covers voice)

312
00:13:32,849 --> 00:13:34,885
So that everyone else could know

313
00:13:34,885 --> 00:13:36,580
what the results were without looking

314
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,787
at actual data numbers.

315
00:13:37,787 --> 00:13:39,262
So that's your job for Wednesday,

316
00:13:39,262 --> 00:13:40,922
and any other potential questions

317
00:13:40,922 --> 00:13:43,720
or things that you might
consider for the future

318
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,727
if you were to do another test.

319
00:13:45,727 --> 00:13:48,056
Also a bonus that we can measure data.

320
00:13:48,056 --> 00:13:48,627
- Okay.

321
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:49,910
- All right, thank you, good job.

322
00:13:52,946 --> 00:13:55,394
The farthest range.

323
00:13:55,394 --> 00:13:58,402
- It was 650 grams for the counterweight.

324
00:13:58,402 --> 00:13:59,527
- Six five zero?

325
00:13:59,527 --> 00:14:00,637
- [Female Student] Yeah.

326
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,705
- [Teacher] Alrighty, so that's good.

327
00:14:04,705 --> 00:14:07,678
So we did discover that
there was a maximum

328
00:14:07,678 --> 00:14:10,330
and then we have lesser
returns after that.

329
00:14:10,962 --> 00:14:12,072
All right, very good.

330
00:14:12,344 --> 00:14:16,318
Fifth group, tell us about
your data and your trebuchet.

331
00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:20,239
- Okay, our variable was
the angle of launch as well.

332
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:21,729
- [Teacher] Angle, okay, that's good.

333
00:14:21,729 --> 00:14:25,068
- And we analyzed it visually, basically,

334
00:14:25,085 --> 00:14:28,823
and we found that the larger the angle

335
00:14:28,823 --> 00:14:32,555
or the higher it was,
the larger the range was.

336
00:14:32,643 --> 00:14:33,268
- [Teacher] The larger the angle

337
00:14:33,268 --> 00:14:35,178
equals the larger the range

338
00:14:35,577 --> 00:14:38,220
and did you have any limits to that?

339
00:14:39,592 --> 00:14:41,753
- Not really, it just kind of continues.

340
00:14:41,758 --> 00:14:43,883
- [Teacher] As long as you
continue to increase the angle,

341
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,206
you increase the range.

342
00:14:46,206 --> 00:14:49,154
- So you mean like the angle
of release of the sling?

343
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:52,561
Or the like, how far back the
arm goes before you let it go?

344
00:14:53,288 --> 00:14:54,728
- [Teacher] How did
you measure your angle?

345
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:57,293
- Oh we measured the distance from

346
00:14:57,293 --> 00:15:01,634
the counterweight to our platform

347
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,724
and like the farther that we raised it up,

348
00:15:03,724 --> 00:15:06,070
the larger the distance was.

349
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:10,068
- [Teacher] Okay, so the
larger the angle to platform.

350
00:15:10,068 --> 00:15:12,305
- Like what other angle,
could we have used?

351
00:15:12,305 --> 00:15:13,449
- [Female Student] The back arm.

352
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:16,095
- [Teacher] Okay and this one
was how far we pulled it back?

353
00:15:16,403 --> 00:15:17,297
- [Female Student] Yeah.

354
00:15:18,007 --> 00:15:20,041
- So isn't that the same angle then?

355
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:23,541
- [Female Student] Yeah, but
we just measured it inside.

356
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:26,827
- [Teacher] All right.

357
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:30,118
All right so slightly
different perspectives

358
00:15:30,118 --> 00:15:31,661
we've all found angles on.

359
00:15:31,661 --> 00:15:32,915
All right, our sixth group.

360
00:15:32,915 --> 00:15:35,288
- We varied the counterweight also.

361
00:15:35,588 --> 00:15:37,228
- [Teacher] Okay, counterweight

362
00:15:39,116 --> 00:15:42,280
and how did you choose
to analyze your data?

363
00:15:42,363 --> 00:15:44,272
- We made a chart and a graph.

364
00:15:44,685 --> 00:15:46,705
- [Teacher] Okay, so you had
a chart and then the graph

365
00:15:46,705 --> 00:15:50,077
and when you graphed, what did you graph?

366
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:53,043
- We graphed the weight of

367
00:15:53,043 --> 00:15:54,174
the counterweight versus the range.

368
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,813
- [Teacher] That's reasonable.

369
00:15:56,004 --> 00:15:58,031
The counterweight versus ...

370
00:16:00,661 --> 00:16:01,383
range.

371
00:16:04,693 --> 00:16:09,171
All right and as you examined
your chart and the graph data,

372
00:16:10,395 --> 00:16:12,328
what did you come up with as a conclusion?

373
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:16,414
- The more weight we put on,
the further the range was.

374
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,329
- [Teacher] Was there
an upper limit or not?

375
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:21,812
- Not from the amount of
weight that we tested.

376
00:16:22,027 --> 00:16:24,267
I mean I would suppose that
if you put more weight

377
00:16:24,267 --> 00:16:26,925
than the trebuchet could handle,

378
00:16:26,925 --> 00:16:29,996
then it would probably
would have bad results.

379
00:16:30,443 --> 00:16:31,743
- [Teacher] So that actually gives us

380
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,241
a place to go in future.

381
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:35,731
If we were to try to add more to the slab,

382
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:38,250
that might be something kind
of interesting to find out,

383
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:39,690
is what is the upper limit

384
00:16:40,654 --> 00:16:42,953
and at what point does the equipment fail?

385
00:16:43,225 --> 00:16:46,220
That might make a difference
with our big trebuchet.

386
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,913
We want the biggest one
that was successful.

387
00:16:47,913 --> 00:16:49,946
Were there any other
questions that came to mind

388
00:16:49,946 --> 00:16:52,151
or any other things that occurred to you

389
00:16:52,151 --> 00:16:54,890
while you were either
taking data or analyzing it

390
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,336
or building your trebuchet?

391
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,357
Josh.

392
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,033
- The angle at which the sling
was released mattered a lot.

393
00:17:02,246 --> 00:17:03,559
- [Teacher] All right and, in fact,

394
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:06,328
if we were to combine that
with your counterweight,

395
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,024
we have a couple of
variables we might examine

396
00:17:08,024 --> 00:17:10,316
at the same time for the same trebuchet.

397
00:17:11,878 --> 00:17:14,362
Other questions or things
that you thought about

398
00:17:14,362 --> 00:17:15,803
that maybe you would've liked

399
00:17:15,803 --> 00:17:18,086
to have added to or varied? Steph?

400
00:17:18,926 --> 00:17:20,150
- When the sling did release,

401
00:17:20,178 --> 00:17:22,808
we could never really tell where it did,

402
00:17:22,884 --> 00:17:24,844
and we couldn't really
tell if it released it

403
00:17:25,354 --> 00:17:29,083
after the object was launched

404
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,903
or if it released at the

405
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,505
point in time that it's supposed to.

406
00:17:33,505 --> 00:17:34,467
So you could never really tell--
