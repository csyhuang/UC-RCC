1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,920
- Some of you are ready to print, so I
wanted to go through the actual printing

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,370
press process today. Some of you might
even be ready to try that today. If you're

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,870
not ready to try it right after I do the
demonstration, you can go back to your

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,300
etching or engraving, and then by
tomorrow, you'll be able to run it through

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,180
the press. Before I do that, I wanted to
share something with you that's a little

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,580
exciting, and the fact that I actually
have a relative who was a professional

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,480
engraver. My grandfather was an engraver.
He started in the 1930s and '40s. After

8
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,600
World War II, he was part of something
called the GI Bill. Does anybody know what

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,300
that is?

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,000
- Oh, I do.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,112
- Yeah, what is it?

12
00:00:38,112 --> 00:00:43,542
- They pay people to go to college.

13
00:00:43,542 --> 00:00:47,370
- Yes, exactly. Yeah. After the World War
II veterans came back from war, the

14
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,970
government paid for them to go to college.
And he went to a college called The Art

15
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,980
Students League, which I was just talking
with Alex about, and he had an extensive

16
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,750
education in figure drawing and he chose
the trade of an engraver. I'm going to

17
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:04,490
pass some of these around. These are his
actual engraved plates that he lent to me

18
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:09,810
to show you. You can take some of those.
So you can see that the tradition of

19
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,790
engraving as we talked about yesterday
goes back a long time. A hundred

20
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,820
years at least or even more. But this is
from the early '30s and '40s, these

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,640
engravings. And these were actual etchings
done with the acid bath that I explained

22
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,950
that we don't do here because of the
safety. You're doing a plexiglass

23
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,290
engraving instead without the use of the
acid. So I'm going to demonstrate how to

24
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:37,840
do all that inking and you can get to see
the difference between the copper plates

25
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,180
that I'm passing around now and then the
plexiglass plates that we're working with

26
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,760
today. And it's kind of cool my
grandfather gave those to me and asked if

27
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:50,020
one of you would ink it up and print one
for him while we were printing all of

28
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,410
this. So I'm going to let one of you use
his actual etched plates and then print it

29
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,220
for him. All right, so the materials that
we have out here include all the different

30
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:06,510
colors of print-making ink. So for the
most part, we're going to start with black

31
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:11,070
today, but you can choose any color that
you want. So you can see some of the

32
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,980
examples that I put up here from past
students. One student decided, instead of

33
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,410
putting black ink on the white ground, he
used white ink on black ground. So that's

34
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,230
another method that you might choose to do
after learning the basic process. So all

35
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,690
the steps that we're going to go over are
up here to remind you during the class

36
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:35,450
period during the rest of the week. It's
going to remind you of all the steps. So

37
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,710
the first step after you've beveled all
the edges in your plate that I

38
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:45,220
demonstrated yesterday is to get yourself
some print-making ink. And all of these

39
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,620
materials will be out for you in front of
the room and take it to your desk when

40
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,410
you're ready. You'll take a little bit of
print-making ink and put it on the plate

41
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,370
like this.

42
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,910
[thud]

43
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:04,000
- Just like that. And you'll use a tool
called a brayer. And the brayer will hold

44
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:10,670
your ink and it gives you a nice flat
surface to apply the ink onto your plate.

45
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:16,090
So once your brayer is filled with
the ink, you'll apply it to the plate.

46
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:22,670
And I'm actually using my grandfather's
plate from several years ago. All right,

47
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:29,822
so you'll gently apply the ink over the
entire plate.

48
00:03:29,822 --> 00:03:30,910
[shuffling]

49
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,017
- Okay, just take a seat
and I'll hand it out.

50
00:03:34,017 --> 00:03:37,090
[shuffling]

51
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:43,170
- All right. And after you have the entire
plate inked, you'll check and make sure

52
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:47,770
that you didn't miss any spots. All right,
notice that I missed a spot there so I'm

53
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:55,900
going to have to bring it back to the
plate to get all of the areas covered.

54
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,920
Once you have all the areas covered... And
this is just in interest of time, I'll

55
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:05,800
just show you the next step. Once the
entire plate is covered, you'll take a

56
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:10,263
small piece of mat board.

57
00:04:10,263 --> 00:04:15,900
[shuffling]

58
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:29,900
- I'll just use this instead. Okay, I have
little pieces of mat boards for you. Okay,

59
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,140
so you're going to take a little piece of
mat board or you can use a piece of the

60
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:39,800
wood that I have cut up here. After you
apply the entire ground with ink, you have

61
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:44,670
to remove it so you have the clean surface
with everything except all the ink that's

62
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:50,620
going to be on your inside lines. This has
a dual purpose. It removes some of the ink

63
00:04:50,800 --> 00:05:00,390
for you plus it also pushes the ink down
into the surface of the plate. This has

64
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:06,290
been prepared for you to take off the
excess ink when you're done. This will

65
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:14,150
push all the ink in the surface. Okay, and
then once you get most of it removed, then

66
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:19,490
you can take the cheesecloth. I found one
of my mat boards. Here we go. All right,

67
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:26,710
so you can use the mat board here to get
off most of the ink. And then you can take

68
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:32,670
a piece of cheesecloth like this and you
want to wad the cheesecloth into your hand

69
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:39,460
like this so you have a nice solid piece
of it in front. This will lift the ink off

70
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:47,050
pretty easily. And after you do this
process... This is the messy process, so

71
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:53,640
you should take a paper towel and wash
your hands after you're done with this

72
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:59,300
before we move to the printing press. I'll
show you how to do that. Sometimes a

73
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:04,580
circular motion with this will help. So
I'm going to show so you can all see.

74
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:14,850
Circular motion to get off all of the ink
from the surface. I'm showing you this

75
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:19,360
quickly, all the steps, but I have one
prepared for us to print with. Just like a

76
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,620
cooking show, so it's ready to go. All
right, so you're going to use... Flat on

77
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,060
the table. I'm showing you this so you can
see it, but you're going to do all of this

78
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,550
flat at your desk. Get all of the ink off
with the cheesecloth. If you run out of

79
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:44,280
space, you could fold it over to a cleaner
side and start again. Then the last step

80
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,560
before you clean your edges... At this
point, if you want to go clean your hands

81
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,770
so you don't get it on anything again, you
could go clean your hands as well. We'll

82
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:57,060
take a piece of newsprint, a flat piece of
newsprint and just buff the top of it

83
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:06,020
again to make sure any last-minute or
leftover fingerprints are taken off of it

84
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:11,280
with this piece of paper. The newsprint
works the best, so I have cut-up piece of

85
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,590
newsprints for you also to make a nice,
smooth surface. And before you're ready to

86
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:26,000
print, you could take a Q-tip, dip it in
some water, and then clean your edges. So

87
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,130
the beveled edge that you
made of your printing plates,

88
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:36,180
you should take the Q-tip to clean
any ink off of that bevel because the idea

89
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:42,580
is to make sure the bevel around your
image is clean. So this print was left up

90
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,060
here for a reason. It doesn't have a clean
edge. I wanted you to see the difference

91
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,770
between a student that cleaned their edge
and a student that didn't clean their

92
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:54,820
edge. Okay, this has a nice, clean edge.
This has a little bit of ink left on the

93
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,050
edge. So when you pull a perfect print,
you want to make sure you have a clean

94
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,000
edge. And the way you guarantee that is
cleaning it off--
