1
00:00:00,474 --> 00:00:02,072
- [Voiceover] What you just said.

2
00:00:02,072 --> 00:00:03,103
They're going to go back together.

3
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:05,611
- Well, I've glued them
down so they can't.

4
00:00:05,611 --> 00:00:08,371
The green and the red charts
are locked down in place.

5
00:00:08,371 --> 00:00:10,894
They can't get back, but I've
taken up the orange field.

6
00:00:10,894 --> 00:00:13,173
- [Voiceover] Wouldn't
it generate a new field?

7
00:00:13,173 --> 00:00:15,482
- They're going to make a new field

8
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:17,232
and that new field will be?

9
00:00:17,232 --> 00:00:18,682
- [Voiceover] (mumbles)

10
00:00:18,682 --> 00:00:20,042
- Say it again.

11
00:00:20,042 --> 00:00:21,594
Oh, like the earlier drawing?

12
00:00:21,594 --> 00:00:25,042
- [Voiceover] (mumbles)

13
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:27,052
- We can actually say a little more than that.

14
00:00:27,052 --> 00:00:29,072
In this vicinity here?

15
00:00:29,072 --> 00:00:31,393
- [Voiceover] (mumbles)

16
00:00:31,393 --> 00:00:34,051
- They'll be trying to pull
each other back together.

17
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:35,692
So, we're going to end up with a field

18
00:00:35,692 --> 00:00:39,574
that's exactly opposite (mumbles).

19
00:00:39,574 --> 00:00:42,131
What we did was they move around.

20
00:00:42,131 --> 00:00:44,351
(laughs)

21
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:48,344
- [Voiceover] As long
as it's still running.

22
00:00:48,344 --> 00:00:51,764
- They move apart until the field

23
00:00:51,764 --> 00:00:54,754
is basically nullified.

24
00:00:59,504 --> 00:01:01,554
- [Voiceover] Let's look at one more example.

25
00:01:01,554 --> 00:01:04,186
- [Voiceover] Do you have one
more potato shape in there?

26
00:01:04,186 --> 00:01:05,624
- [Voiceover] Most people.

27
00:01:05,624 --> 00:01:07,604
- [Voiceover] Most people, right.

28
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,015
So, let's start for this last one,

29
00:01:13,015 --> 00:01:16,355
let's look at this shape and say

30
00:01:16,355 --> 00:01:18,605
that I observe

31
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,985
fields coming out like that.

32
00:01:26,985 --> 00:01:29,055
Write down a couple of observations

33
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:31,355
before you make your prediction.

34
00:01:31,355 --> 00:01:34,126
Based on what you're seeing in there,

35
00:01:34,126 --> 00:01:36,945
what can you say about what you see?

36
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:44,225
(class chatting)

37
00:01:49,415 --> 00:01:51,735
- Are those lines all
supposed to be straight?

38
00:01:51,735 --> 00:01:52,675
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

39
00:01:52,675 --> 00:01:54,935
To the best of my drawing
ability they're horizontal,

40
00:01:54,935 --> 00:01:56,625
parallel lines.

41
00:01:59,235 --> 00:02:00,965
My drawing was perfect.

42
00:02:00,965 --> 00:02:03,676
- Mr. Shields, what (mumbles)?
 
43
00:02:03,676 --> 00:02:05,966
- [Voiceover] They're
going in two directions.

44
00:02:05,966 --> 00:02:06,796
- [Voiceover] The orange?

45
00:02:06,796 --> 00:02:07,996
- [Voiceover] Yeah, the orange one.

46
00:02:07,996 --> 00:02:10,556
- [Voiceover] Like a very large plate.

47
00:02:11,956 --> 00:02:15,566
(class chatting)

48
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:22,328
(class chatting)

49
00:02:25,348 --> 00:02:26,378
- [Voiceover] It could
be just a potato in there

50
00:02:26,378 --> 00:02:29,269
and that's (mumbles).

51
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:35,709
(class chatting)

52
00:02:41,059 --> 00:02:42,299
- [Voiceover] The thing in your hand.

53
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:43,279
- [Voiceover] This one?

54
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:44,749
- [Voiceover] Yep.

55
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:50,889
(class chatting)

56
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:03,430
(class chatting)

57
00:03:08,859 --> 00:03:12,449
(class chatting)

58
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:19,289
- [Voiceover] Okay, let's take a look.

59
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:25,801
Chris, can I get you to shut the door

60
00:03:25,801 --> 00:03:27,519
to keep the noise down?

61
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,369
We'll give you a break in
about 10 minutes or so.

62
00:03:29,369 --> 00:03:31,699
It's nice to have the extra period here.

63
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,929
First thing before we
talk about this new one,

64
00:03:35,929 --> 00:03:39,119
I failed to address Hannah's question

65
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:41,489
and good insight earlier.

66
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:43,729
Yes, (mumbles).

67
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:48,009
The orange lines in here will
be drawn into the negative

68
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:51,619
and they're going to bend and 
will be coming outward
 
69
00:03:51,619 --> 00:03:53,109
from the positive end.

70
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:55,419
So, you're definitely going
to see this sort of pattern.

71
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:58,859
I think people saw a little
bit of that in the simulations.

72
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:01,489
Anytime you've got a
conducting material...

73
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:03,889
Anytime you've got a conducting material

74
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:07,460
the field lines always
intersect exactly perpendicular

75
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,779
with (mumbles).

76
00:04:09,779 --> 00:04:11,499
It's a conductor.

77
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:15,339
So, it definitely makes a
difference when you call it

78
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:17,559
a conductor and look at
what happened in the field.

79
00:04:17,559 --> 00:04:20,080
Let's talk about this new one.

80
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,099
There's a couple of observations.

81
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:24,159
Ian give me one observation

82
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:27,223
and Claire give me the second observation.

83
00:04:27,223 --> 00:04:29,403
- Besides the fact that
the lines are straight.

84
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:30,363
- [Voiceover] No, that's a good one.

85
00:04:30,363 --> 00:04:31,623
The lines are straight.

86
00:04:31,623 --> 00:04:32,543
Very important.

87
00:04:32,543 --> 00:04:33,863
Claire?

88
00:04:34,433 --> 00:04:36,583
- They're going in opposite directions.

89
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,474
- [Voiceover] Exactly opposite directions.

90
00:04:38,474 --> 00:04:41,093
Okay, Hakim give me another one.

91
00:04:41,683 --> 00:04:44,073
- Well, the lines are coming out of it.

92
00:04:44,073 --> 00:04:46,483
- [Voiceover] Okay, they're
coming outward not inward.

93
00:04:46,483 --> 00:04:47,073
Good.

94
00:04:47,073 --> 00:04:49,683
- To indicate that the (mumbles).

95
00:04:49,683 --> 00:04:52,023
- [Voiceover] Okay, so
that one we know from

96
00:04:52,023 --> 00:04:53,583
the very first piece here.

97
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,867
The net charge is positive.

98
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:59,364
The fact that they're horizontal.

99
00:05:00,587 --> 00:05:02,104
- They indicate like a plate or something.

100
00:05:02,104 --> 00:05:03,465
- Yeah, is it like two parallel plates?

101
00:05:03,465 --> 00:05:07,305
(mumbles)

102
00:05:07,305 --> 00:05:08,545
- [Voiceover] Two parallel plates?

103
00:05:08,545 --> 00:05:09,465
So, where would you draw them?

104
00:05:09,465 --> 00:05:11,315
Above and below?

105
00:05:12,115 --> 00:05:14,247
- There are two on top.

106
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:17,655
- [Voiceover] So, like
above and below like this?

107
00:05:21,235 --> 00:05:22,761
- [Voiceover] Four plates.

108
00:05:22,761 --> 00:05:23,581
- [Voiceover] Four plates.

109
00:05:23,581 --> 00:05:25,303
Let's make it 16.

110
00:05:25,303 --> 00:05:28,270
(class chatting)

111
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,183
- But if you had a plate

112
00:05:30,183 --> 00:05:31,861
and the thing is neutral

113
00:05:31,861 --> 00:05:34,203
or no net charge and
then they would just...

114
00:05:34,203 --> 00:05:36,140
- But what if you had one positive plate

115
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,841
straight up and down the middle,

116
00:05:37,841 --> 00:05:41,011
then it would push away on both sides.

117
00:05:41,011 --> 00:05:43,431
- Two positive plates (mumbles).

118
00:05:43,431 --> 00:05:45,261
- Two plates sounds twice as good as one,

119
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,593
but I'm not sure that it is.

120
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:49,082
Four plates sounds even more appealing.

121
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:52,361
An infinite number of
plates sounds fantastic.

122
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:54,863
I'm hearing good ideas here.

123
00:05:54,863 --> 00:05:57,642
I want you guys to think
about what it would look like

124
00:05:57,642 --> 00:05:58,800
in different scenarios.

125
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,841
So, two positive plates.
 
126
00:06:00,841 --> 00:06:02,201
Okay, two positive plates

127
00:06:02,201 --> 00:06:04,000
and I'm looking at the
vicinity in the middle here,

128
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,360
is that right?

129
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,920
And do I want my two positive
plates to be on the sides?

130
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,381
- [Voiceover] Negative plates.

131
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:10,203
- [Voiceover] Well, negative plates, okay.

132
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,702
Two negative plates on the sides like this

133
00:06:12,702 --> 00:06:15,161
so the field would look like what?

134
00:06:15,161 --> 00:06:16,021
- Bend.

135
00:06:16,021 --> 00:06:16,841
- [Voiceover] Okay,
we're getting a bending

136
00:06:16,841 --> 00:06:19,371
because if I draw it here--

137
00:06:19,951 --> 00:06:22,401
- But you still have to compare (mumbles).

138
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:24,062
- [Voiceover] It'd be like
this kind of a picture?

139
00:06:24,062 --> 00:06:25,373
- It'd still be bent.

140
00:06:26,903 --> 00:06:28,761
Greater than the distance.

141
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:31,251
- [Voiceover] Okay, so you've got...

142
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:33,141
So, based on that you've got some things

143
00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:35,601
going on above and below

144
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:39,041
that should be penetrating
into that shape.

145
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,711
- What about two infinitely long?

146
00:06:40,711 --> 00:06:43,501
- [Voiceover] Two infinitely long plates.

147
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:45,573
Both negative?

148
00:06:46,093 --> 00:06:47,140
What would the field look like?

149
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,041
Forge the potato shape.

150
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:48,841
What would the field look like

151
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,991
in the vicinity of two infinitely long,

152
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:53,431
evenly charged negative plates?

153
00:06:54,061 --> 00:06:56,641
- Wouldn't they go (mumbles)?

154
00:06:56,641 --> 00:06:59,222
- [Voiceover] If I take a
single positive test charge and

155
00:06:59,222 --> 00:07:01,351
release it right in the middle,

156
00:07:01,351 --> 00:07:02,501
what would it do?

157
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:03,281
- [Class] (mumbles)

158
00:07:03,281 --> 00:07:04,321
- [Voiceover] What if I
release it a little bit

159
00:07:04,321 --> 00:07:05,402
to the left side?

160
00:07:05,402 --> 00:07:07,244
- [Class] (mumbles)

161
00:07:07,244 --> 00:07:09,831
- [Voiceover] An infinitely long plate.

162
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:14,871
We derived this one before, a single one.

163
00:07:14,871 --> 00:07:16,681
Remember the equation for the field

164
00:07:16,681 --> 00:07:18,381
or the general shape of the field

165
00:07:18,381 --> 00:07:19,781
from an infinite plane?

166
00:07:19,781 --> 00:07:20,681
- [Voiceover] It's constant.

167
00:07:20,681 --> 00:07:22,622
- [Voiceover] It's a
constant, exactly right.

168
00:07:23,482 --> 00:07:24,711
Brittany didn't even
have to look at her notes

169
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,481
on that one.

170
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:28,101
But you remember, what was our analogy

171
00:07:28,101 --> 00:07:30,391
to an infinitely large plate?

172
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:33,852
- [Voiceover] (mumbles)

173
00:07:34,322 --> 00:07:36,062
- [Voiceover] Yeah,
gravity on the earth here,

174
00:07:36,062 --> 00:07:37,802
you know, big flat earth.

175
00:07:38,672 --> 00:07:40,521
I don't care how far
above the ground I am,

176
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:42,561
it's the same number, it
doesn't change at all.

177
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:44,842
That's exactly right.

178
00:07:44,842 --> 00:07:48,591
So, an infinite plate,
the field is some number,

179
00:07:48,591 --> 00:07:50,982
another identical infinite plate,

180
00:07:51,752 --> 00:07:53,481
it nullifies it.

181
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:55,552
So, in the same charge, okay?

182
00:07:55,552 --> 00:07:57,901
Well, that isn't going to work.

183
00:07:57,901 --> 00:07:58,964
- [Voiceover] Infinitely far.

184
00:07:58,964 --> 00:08:00,822
- Infinitely far away from each other.

185
00:08:00,822 --> 00:08:02,822
(laughs)

186
00:08:04,532 --> 00:08:07,192
When Brittney says it's a constant,

187
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:08,862
even if you go to infinity,

188
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:10,522
I guess it'd still be a constant,

189
00:08:11,232 --> 00:08:13,061
either that or you go to zero.

190
00:08:13,991 --> 00:08:16,092
- It would be two sets,

191
00:08:16,092 --> 00:08:18,302
one set like that except that

192
00:08:18,902 --> 00:08:21,221
they are horizontal and vertical

193
00:08:21,221 --> 00:08:22,261
and they're infinitely far away

194
00:08:22,261 --> 00:08:25,381
where (mumbles).

195
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:26,762
- Two horizontal plates like this?

196
00:08:26,762 --> 00:08:29,652
- Yeah, because (mumbles).

197
00:08:30,442 --> 00:08:33,612
(mumbles)

198
00:08:35,342 --> 00:08:38,262
- I don't think that's
going to work either.

199
00:08:38,262 --> 00:08:40,592
Ben, you're getting agitated back there.

200
00:08:41,072 --> 00:08:43,002
And what are you saying?

201
00:08:43,762 --> 00:08:44,882
- We were just talking.

202
00:08:44,882 --> 00:08:46,622
- You're saying there's
no way in the world

203
00:08:46,622 --> 00:08:47,401
they can be infinite.

204
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,202
Is that what you're saying?

205
00:08:48,202 --> 00:08:48,962
- Yeah.

206
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,442
(laughs)

207
00:08:50,442 --> 00:08:52,972
- [Voiceover] (mumbles)

208
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:57,302
- You can't have an
infinite plane anything

209
00:08:57,302 --> 00:08:59,471
because you're defining the shape?

210
00:09:01,571 --> 00:09:02,646
- [Voiceover] So, that's a good question.

211
00:09:02,646 --> 00:09:05,385
When I've got the shape here,

212
00:09:05,385 --> 00:09:07,645
do we require that the
thing that I'm talking about

213
00:09:07,645 --> 00:09:09,605
fit inside of the shape?

214
00:09:10,155 --> 00:09:10,845
- [Voiceover] No.

215
00:09:10,845 --> 00:09:12,276
- [Voiceover] I'm going to say no.

216
00:09:12,276 --> 00:09:14,656
Okay, so does that change your answer?

217
00:09:15,216 --> 00:09:16,315
Okay.

218
00:09:17,035 --> 00:09:21,186
I think we can and will look at situations

219
00:09:21,986 --> 00:09:24,626
where the surface...

220
00:09:24,626 --> 00:09:25,506
And remember this is all leading up

221
00:09:25,506 --> 00:09:27,186
to that Gaussian surface idea

222
00:09:27,186 --> 00:09:28,685
we mentioned on Friday.

223
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:31,366
Where the Gaussian surface does not fully

224
00:09:31,366 --> 00:09:32,516
enclose an object.

225
00:09:32,516 --> 00:09:34,466
Like an infinite plane, we
need to be able to study those

226
00:09:34,466 --> 00:09:37,925
even though I can't
fit it inside of a box.

227
00:09:37,925 --> 00:09:39,976
So, we have to expand a little bit

228
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,646
to the possibility that whatever it is

229
00:09:42,646 --> 00:09:44,876
is inside of there.

230
00:09:46,006 --> 00:09:49,376
- An infinitely long positive plate

231
00:09:49,376 --> 00:09:50,866
right in the middle.

232
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:51,885
- [Voiceover] Right in the middle.

233
00:09:51,885 --> 00:09:53,526
Is that what you said
about seven minutes ago?

234
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:54,966
- Yeah.

235
00:09:55,486 --> 00:09:56,895
- [Voiceover] I tried to ignore him

236
00:09:56,895 --> 00:09:58,125
because I didn't want you
guys to get the answer

237
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,885
too quick.

238
00:09:59,885 --> 00:10:02,566
But I do want to acknowledge him (laughs).

239
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:06,155
Yeah, tell me if this makes sense and why?

240
00:10:06,155 --> 00:10:08,177
Somebody besides John and Ian.

241
00:10:08,177 --> 00:10:09,965
It doesn't make sense
that I've got a plate

242
00:10:09,965 --> 00:10:13,685
and this is slicing my potato in half

243
00:10:13,685 --> 00:10:15,446
and it's a positive plate.

244
00:10:15,446 --> 00:10:18,166
- [Voiceover] Would it
have to be infinitely long?

245
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,986
- [Voiceover] Much longer (mumbles).

246
00:10:20,986 --> 00:10:23,186
(mumbles)

247
00:10:23,186 --> 00:10:24,166
- If I don't...

248
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:27,086
Now, I'm not very good at drawing in 3D

249
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:30,065
so is the potato lines,

250
00:10:30,065 --> 00:10:32,625
are they diverging this way at all?

251
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:33,716
I can't tell.

252
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,576
They're uniform this way,

253
00:10:36,306 --> 00:10:37,586
parallel lines this way,

254
00:10:37,586 --> 00:10:41,375
so we know that it has
to be infinite this way.

255
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,866
And not have divergence
this way (mumbles).

256
00:10:43,866 --> 00:10:47,255
- [Voiceover] (mumbles)

257
00:10:48,505 --> 00:10:51,796
- Well, I didn't draw any lines
coming out of the (mumbles).

258
00:10:52,396 --> 00:10:54,006
Do they have to be parallel to the ones

259
00:10:54,006 --> 00:10:56,686
that are on the board

260
00:10:56,686 --> 00:10:59,086
or would they be diverging?

261
00:10:59,086 --> 00:11:02,065
That's going to change
the answer that you give.

262
00:11:04,505 --> 00:11:07,106
If I draw another red line
that's coming like this,

263
00:11:07,106 --> 00:11:10,106
that's clearly diverging
from this red line.

264
00:11:13,476 --> 00:11:15,306
So, I'm going to assume that every line,

265
00:11:15,306 --> 00:11:17,356
for this problem, every line that I draw

266
00:11:17,356 --> 00:11:20,416
is parallel and then
we'll get a new (mumbles).

267
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,175
- [Voiceover] Perpendicular
with the plate.

268
00:11:22,175 --> 00:11:24,826
- [Voiceover] Yeah, perpendicular

269
00:11:24,826 --> 00:11:26,276
to the board.

270
00:11:28,216 --> 00:11:30,426
And then all positive
coming out both sides.

271
00:11:30,426 --> 00:11:31,605
Very good.

272
00:11:33,095 --> 00:11:35,986
Alright, I've got one
more drawing on there

273
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,626
I want to hit and then we'll just say

274
00:11:37,626 --> 00:11:40,336
some fantastic summary words

275
00:11:40,336 --> 00:11:42,796
and then I'll give you guys a break.

276
00:11:42,796 --> 00:11:43,805
The last one here,

277
00:11:43,805 --> 00:11:45,586
instead of the three dimensional shape,

278
00:11:45,586 --> 00:11:49,836
now all I've got is a
single sheet of paper.

279
00:11:50,556 --> 00:11:53,286
And this sheet of paper I've got,

280
00:11:53,286 --> 00:11:55,245
I noticed...

281
00:11:55,245 --> 00:11:57,946
(mumbles)

282
00:11:57,946 --> 00:12:01,325
I noticed parallel lines,

283
00:12:01,325 --> 00:12:04,496
arrows, coming straight out of that shape.

284
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,895
Write down a couple of
observations on it quick

285
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,256
and then see if you can predict,

286
00:12:11,256 --> 00:12:14,138
based on what you observed here,

287
00:12:14,138 --> 00:12:16,347
what and where, if you want to,

288
00:12:16,347 --> 00:12:19,806
what the source of the field lines is.

289
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:23,155
What can we learn from
the electric field lines?
 
290
00:12:24,425 --> 00:12:25,366
- [Voiceover] They're
all coming out parallel

291
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:26,406
in one direction.

292
00:12:26,406 --> 00:12:28,556
- [Voiceover] Yes,
parallel in one direction.

293
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:33,056
(class chatting)

294
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,075
One direction.

295
00:12:36,075 --> 00:12:39,206
They're parallel this way
and they're parallel this way also.

296
00:12:40,236 --> 00:12:42,588
So, they're normal to
the surface everywhere.

297
00:12:42,588 --> 00:12:45,626
- Are they coming from the other side?

298
00:12:47,206 --> 00:12:49,308
- [Voiceover] All I see is
lines penetrating this way,

299
00:12:49,308 --> 00:12:52,195
so I could actually draw them like this

300
00:12:52,195 --> 00:12:53,107
and that's fine.

301
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:55,068
- Do you know anything about
the other side of the plate,

302
00:12:55,068 --> 00:12:57,235
like is there anything there?

303
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,426
- [Voiceover] It's a two
dimensional structure

304
00:12:59,426 --> 00:13:02,027
and the arrows penetrate.

305
00:13:02,027 --> 00:13:03,816
- Oh, okay.

306
00:13:05,596 --> 00:13:07,966
- [Voiceover] Yeah, they're
not diverging at all.

307
00:13:07,966 --> 00:13:10,667
Yeah, uniform, orthogonal,

308
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:12,255
all that good stuff.

309
00:13:13,646 --> 00:13:17,336
(class chatting)

310
00:13:27,246 --> 00:13:30,796
(class chatting)

311
00:13:42,766 --> 00:13:46,655
(class chatting)

312
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:02,586
(class chatting)

313
00:14:06,368 --> 00:14:09,826
(class chatting)

314
00:14:11,105 --> 00:14:12,639
- [Voiceover] Into the paper?

315
00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:18,246
- So, they're coming out of here?

316
00:14:18,246 --> 00:14:20,866
- [Voiceover] They're going
into here and coming out here.

317
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:22,426
- Oh, okay.

318
00:14:26,556 --> 00:14:28,575
- To the differences,
that's a closed shape.

319
00:14:28,575 --> 00:14:30,966
This is a two dimensional surface.

320
00:14:30,966 --> 00:14:32,466
If I had wrapped it around like this

321
00:14:32,466 --> 00:14:33,885
it would make a difference, right?

322
00:14:33,885 --> 00:14:36,876
(mumbles)

323
00:14:39,366 --> 00:14:43,186
(class chatting)

324
00:14:49,386 --> 00:14:51,146
- Okay guys, let's see what we've got here.

325
00:14:51,146 --> 00:14:54,086
I'm going to ask Paul first,

326
00:14:54,086 --> 00:14:56,226
Emily second, and then
we'll see if Michael

327
00:14:56,226 --> 00:14:58,156
can go for the trifecta.

328
00:14:58,156 --> 00:14:59,336
- Oh no.

329
00:14:59,336 --> 00:15:01,176
- [Voiceover] No pressure.

330
00:15:01,176 --> 00:15:02,616
You can be wrong, it's alright.

331
00:15:02,616 --> 00:15:04,876
Paul, what is, based on your observations,

332
00:15:04,876 --> 00:15:08,405
what is the thing that
you think is the source

333
00:15:08,865 --> 00:15:10,125
of the electric field here?

334
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:13,016
Where is it coming from
that it makes this pattern

335
00:15:13,016 --> 00:15:16,316
in this object, on this sheet?

336
00:15:17,106 --> 00:15:19,066
- I think this is like the second

337
00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:20,876
or the third example we did

338
00:15:20,876 --> 00:15:22,266
when it was passing through.

339
00:15:22,266 --> 00:15:23,645
- [Voiceover] Where they're
just passing through?

340
00:15:23,645 --> 00:15:24,126
- Yeah.

341
00:15:24,126 --> 00:15:25,396
- [Voiceover] So, then where
do you think it's coming from?

342
00:15:25,396 --> 00:15:26,806
What does that tell you about the source

343
00:15:26,806 --> 00:15:28,756
of the electric field?

344
00:15:32,445 --> 00:15:34,055
- I'm not sure.

345
00:15:38,235 --> 00:15:39,208
- [Voiceover] You have more to say?

346
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,356
- No.

347
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,566
- [Voiceover] Emily, give it a try.

348
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,886
- Since it's positive on this side?

349
00:15:43,886 --> 00:15:44,566
- [Voiceover] Yup.

350
00:15:44,566 --> 00:15:45,606
- You can see that there might be

351
00:15:45,606 --> 00:15:49,165
a positive charge (mumbles).

352
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,705
- [Voiceover] Okay, so if
I had a positive charge

353
00:15:51,705 --> 00:15:53,614
on this side, I would
get electric field lines

354
00:15:53,614 --> 00:15:55,115
going like this?

355
00:15:56,335 --> 00:15:57,655
That's correct, okay.

356
00:15:57,655 --> 00:15:59,634
- Or if you had a
negative charge (mumbles).

357
00:15:59,634 --> 00:16:01,375
- Ah okay, so you're answering two things,

358
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:04,114
which is pretty
overachieving, but I like it

359
00:16:04,114 --> 00:16:07,155
that you're saying that instead
of a positive back here,

360
00:16:07,155 --> 00:16:08,635
it could be a negative over here.

361
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,454
Okay, now there's something incomplete

362
00:16:11,454 --> 00:16:12,534
about what you're saying.

363
00:16:12,534 --> 00:16:14,575
The positive here versus there
could be a negative here,

364
00:16:14,575 --> 00:16:16,435
that's a great insight that
it could be one or the other,

365
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:17,735
but Michael's going to help us out

366
00:16:17,735 --> 00:16:19,054
because you're a little incomplete

367
00:16:19,054 --> 00:16:20,024
on what you're telling us.

368
00:16:20,024 --> 00:16:21,214
- They have to be infinite.

369
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:22,455
- [Voiceover] Infinite.

370
00:16:22,455 --> 00:16:24,325
Infinitely strong charge.

371
00:16:24,325 --> 00:16:27,154
- Infinitely long, whatever, a plane.

372
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:27,954
- A plane, yeah.

373
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:31,143
A plane back here that's infinitely large,

374
00:16:31,143 --> 00:16:33,333
distributive charge that's positive.

375
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,234
That's the only way to
get a uniform field here.

376
00:16:36,234 --> 00:16:38,014
Can it work with what
Emily was saying about

377
00:16:38,014 --> 00:16:40,274
it could be a negative over here?

378
00:16:40,274 --> 00:16:43,564
It could be an infinitely long thing here?

379
00:16:43,564 --> 00:16:44,854
There's one more option.

380
00:16:44,854 --> 00:16:46,393
Does anybody (mumbles)?

381
00:16:46,393 --> 00:16:50,043
- It could be intro (mumbles).

382
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:51,796
- [Voiceover] That this
piece of paper here

383
00:16:51,796 --> 00:16:52,913
is neutral?

384
00:16:52,913 --> 00:16:54,974
- And you could just put
a new positive charge.

385
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:55,874
- [Voiceover] But be careful.

386
00:16:55,874 --> 00:16:57,753
Any positive charge, if I start off with

387
00:16:57,753 --> 00:17:00,393
the very first drawing,
and I look at what happens

388
00:17:00,393 --> 00:17:02,494
when I put a sheet here,

389
00:17:02,494 --> 00:17:03,854
the field lines are like this.

390
00:17:03,854 --> 00:17:05,193
(mumbles)

391
00:17:05,193 --> 00:17:06,334
(laughs)

392
00:17:06,334 --> 00:17:07,784
They're diverging.

393
00:17:07,784 --> 00:17:10,176
I'm not having divergence here at all.

394
00:17:10,176 --> 00:17:13,214
So, it can't come from
any old point source.

395
00:17:15,594 --> 00:17:18,404
We are going to assume that
this thing is neutral though.

396
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,154
Okay, that itself is not...

397
00:17:20,154 --> 00:17:22,716
It's just capturing the story

398
00:17:22,716 --> 00:17:24,124
of what's going on.

399
00:17:24,124 --> 00:17:24,884
Hannah?

400
00:17:24,884 --> 00:17:26,253
- Could there be both a positive

401
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,204
and negative along the plate?

402
00:17:28,204 --> 00:17:30,354
- [Voiceover] Yeah, you can have both.

403
00:17:30,354 --> 00:17:31,914
You bet.

404
00:17:33,354 --> 00:17:35,824
- [Voiceover] That seems like
a little bit of overkill,

405
00:17:36,314 --> 00:17:38,543
but as long as you're making
your sheet infinite in size,

406
00:17:38,543 --> 00:17:41,121
you might as well make two infinite's.

407
00:17:41,121 --> 00:17:44,161
- You have all your infinite (mumbles).

408
00:17:44,161 --> 00:17:45,450
- [Voiceover] That's right.

409
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:48,081
And two parallel plates,

410
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:49,601
two plates that are
parallel to each other,

411
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:50,501
one positive, one negative,

412
00:17:50,501 --> 00:17:52,001
is a very common thing.

413
00:17:52,001 --> 00:17:54,980
So common in fact that
it's on my tie today.

414
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,131
Oh yeah, there it is.

415
00:17:56,131 --> 00:17:57,731
See that?

416
00:17:58,461 --> 00:18:00,121
(laughs)

417
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,560
Hakim, do you have a question?

418
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,861
- Okay, so it's the positive plane

419
00:18:04,861 --> 00:18:08,601
that's standing or negative plane?

420
00:18:08,601 --> 00:18:09,441
- [Voiceover] Yeah, the infinite plane.

421
00:18:09,441 --> 00:18:11,530
- The infinite plane.

422
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,451
I was about to say that.

423
00:18:13,451 --> 00:18:15,001
That it would be infinite.

424
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:17,901
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I
think Michael was saying

425
00:18:17,901 --> 00:18:18,940
that it would probably be.

426
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,561
Not the charge distribution, the sigma,

427
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:23,840
how much charge per unit area

428
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,260
will be some number,

429
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,520
but it would just keep on going on.

430
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,520
Chris?

431
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,970
- (mumbles)

432
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,461
- [Voiceover] Yeah, you know,

433
00:18:34,461 --> 00:18:36,281
that would be a lot.

434
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,141
- (mumbles)

435
00:18:39,141 --> 00:18:40,480
- [Voiceover] Reasonably
speaking, if something goes

436
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,511
to infinity, all of your homework is easy.

437
00:18:43,511 --> 00:18:47,001
So, there's no purpose for me doing that.

438
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:47,820
What is the answer?

439
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,881
Infinity or zero.

440
00:18:49,881 --> 00:18:51,980
It's got to be one.

441
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,781
Infinitely large in size

442
00:18:53,781 --> 00:18:56,441
with a uniform charge distribution

443
00:18:56,441 --> 00:18:58,841
does add up to an infinite charge,

444
00:18:58,841 --> 00:19:01,104
but it's distributed infinitely far away.

445
00:19:01,104 --> 00:19:02,641
So that's okay.

446
00:19:03,861 --> 00:19:06,581
Now, remember the goal of this

447
00:19:06,581 --> 00:19:08,850
as we were getting into this today,

448
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,981
is to figure out what can we learn

449
00:19:10,981 --> 00:19:13,141
from an electric field?

450
00:19:13,141 --> 00:19:14,371
And here's the thing.

451
00:19:14,371 --> 00:19:17,111
In the first three or four examples

452
00:19:17,111 --> 00:19:20,401
or five I guess for some people,

453
00:19:20,401 --> 00:19:24,801
if I take a closed
surface I can learn a lot.

454
00:19:25,261 --> 00:19:28,181
Not everything necessarily,
but I can learn about

455
00:19:28,181 --> 00:19:30,281
what's inside of that.

456
00:19:30,281 --> 00:19:32,931
Infinitively, is the first one positive?

457
00:19:32,931 --> 00:19:33,761
- [Class] Yes.

458
00:19:33,761 --> 00:19:35,321
- [Voiceover] Yes.

459
00:19:35,321 --> 00:19:39,391
The next one that I drew
was negative, absolutely.

460
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,671
This most recent closed surface,

461
00:19:41,671 --> 00:19:46,063
it had to be a positive
plate shoved in there.

462
00:19:46,893 --> 00:19:50,731
This last one with just a
two dimensional structure

463
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,850
to measure with, to
gauge what's happening,

464
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,211
I don't know everything.

465
00:19:55,211 --> 00:19:57,891
We've got a lot of ambiguity.

466
00:19:57,891 --> 00:20:00,181
And this is why with Gauss' law

467
00:20:00,181 --> 00:20:02,940
we need to use this closed surface.

468
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,401
We need to look at it from all sides.

469
00:20:04,401 --> 00:20:07,421
We need to be fully
envelop in what's going on

470
00:20:07,421 --> 00:20:09,641
or else we might miss something.

471
00:20:10,571 --> 00:20:11,941
We'll go back again.

472
00:20:11,941 --> 00:20:13,920
The equation that I showed you last week,

473
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,431
we'll put that on the
board in a few minutes

474
00:20:15,431 --> 00:20:16,920
when we come back from a break

475
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,400
as well as looking at
a couple of scenarios,

476
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,040
just conceptually how
we can draw these things

477
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,230
to capture all that field.

478
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:27,870
Go ahead and take a break
and be back in five minutes.
