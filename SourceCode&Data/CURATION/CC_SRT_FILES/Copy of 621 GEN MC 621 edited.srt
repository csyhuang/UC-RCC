00:00:00,981 --> 00:00:09,000
All right, Mr. Bailey.

2
00:00:09,981 --> 00:00:11,208
- 5.03.

3
00:00:11,208 --> 00:00:15,382
[Background Chatter]

4
00:00:16,987 --> 00:00:19,733
- 5.03.

5
00:00:19,733 --> 00:00:22,049
All right let's talk for a
minute before you continue

6
00:00:22,049 --> 00:00:24,475
with your little test.

7
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:27,719
First of all, let's talk about motion.

8
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:29,245
What do you know about motion?

9
00:00:29,245 --> 00:00:32,493
- Motion is the way that you
get from one place to another.

10
00:00:32,493 --> 00:00:33,955
It's changing position.

11
00:00:33,955 --> 00:00:36,282
- Changing position, so
just now, Bailey was running,

12
00:00:36,282 --> 00:00:37,940
was he changing position?
- Yes.

13
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,000
- Yes, all right so how do we
know that he was in motion?

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,198
Like, when he is running
toward me

15
00:00:43,198 --> 00:00:44,491
how do I know he's in motion?

16
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:46,864
[Background Chatter]

17
00:00:46,864 --> 00:00:49,708
- That stays there and
you can see him coming up.

18
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:52,105
- Nobody else was moving around.

19
00:00:52,105 --> 00:00:53,813
- So that's our frame of reference.

20
00:00:53,813 --> 00:00:55,998
He came over there so we
know he's coming toward us.

21
00:00:55,998 --> 00:00:57,189
All right so you guys did a trial.

22
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:58,501
How many times did you run, Bailey?

23
00:00:58,501 --> 00:00:59,262
- Three.

24
00:00:59,262 --> 00:01:00,920
- All right so what are
we gonna do now?

25
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,549
- We're gonna have to
add them all up

26
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:04,052
and divide them by three.

27
00:01:04,052 --> 00:01:05,088
- Why are we dividing by three?

28
00:01:05,088 --> 00:01:06,786
- Because we did it three times.

29
00:01:06,786 --> 00:01:07,681
- Okay, you did it three times.

30
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:08,780
You're finding your average.

31
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,731
What's another word for average?

32
00:01:10,731 --> 00:01:11,394
- Mean.

33
00:01:11,394 --> 00:01:13,864
- Mean, good.

34
00:01:13,864 --> 00:01:17,843
All right so let's find
his mean or his average.

35
00:01:24,311 --> 00:01:27,020
And then we'll record that
and double check to make sure

36
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:32,002
the whole group has the same
amount or the same number.

37
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,045
Okay, what did you get?

38
00:01:37,045 --> 00:01:38,967
- 5.21.

39
00:01:38,967 --> 00:01:41,690
- 5.21, is that what everybody has?

40
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,319
Nathan maybe you redo yours
and just check

41
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,489
since three people have that.

42
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:46,093
Let's name some things
that are in motion.

43
00:01:46,093 --> 00:01:47,538
What do you know that's in motion?

44
00:01:47,538 --> 00:01:48,370
- The earth.

45
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,683
- The earth is in motion, yup.

46
00:01:49,683 --> 00:01:51,514
But I don't feel the earth
move so how do I know

47
00:01:51,514 --> 00:01:53,100
it's in motion?

48
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,854
- 'Cause sun is the frame of reference.

49
00:01:55,854 --> 00:01:58,172
- Okay, so if I was thinking of the sun

50
00:01:58,172 --> 00:02:00,083
which is what they do,

51
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:03,334
and the earth we know we
could see the earth is moving

52
00:02:03,334 --> 00:02:04,958
and the sun would be
your frame of reference.

53
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,685
What else do you know that moves?

54
00:02:06,685 --> 00:02:07,347
- Animals.

55
00:02:07,347 --> 00:02:08,143
- Animals.

56
00:02:08,143 --> 00:02:08,703
- Insects.
- Cars.

57
00:02:08,703 --> 00:02:09,974
- Insects, cars.

58
00:02:09,974 --> 00:02:10,770
- Boats.
- People.

59
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,734
- People, books.
- Boats.

60
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:14,175
- Boats [laughing].

61
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,600
All right so how are
we gonna find our speed

62
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,628
because now we know how
many seconds it took him

63
00:02:18,628 --> 00:02:20,497
but what's something
else that I need to know

64
00:02:20,497 --> 00:02:22,814
besides how long it took him?

65
00:02:22,814 --> 00:02:23,893
- The distance.

66
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:24,954
[Background Chatter]

67
00:02:24,954 --> 00:02:26,759
The distance traveled
which is a hundred feet.

68
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,024
- So what difference did we do?

69
00:02:28,024 --> 00:02:29,052
- Hundred feet.
- A hundred feet.

70
00:02:29,052 --> 00:02:30,577
Okay, so what's the first
thing you have to do

71
00:02:30,577 --> 00:02:32,083
is measure out your hundred feet?

72
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:32,707
- Yes.

73
00:02:32,707 --> 00:02:33,868
- You did that and chalk-marked it?

74
00:02:33,868 --> 00:02:35,038
Good, all right so let's--

75
00:02:35,038 --> 00:02:38,576
- We're talking about
the average time taken.

76
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:41,157
- All right, so let's do that now.

77
00:02:41,157 --> 00:02:43,748
- 19.

78
00:02:46,688 --> 00:02:50,654
- So let's talk about
what that means, 19.19.

79
00:02:50,654 --> 00:02:51,401
- Feet per second.

80
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:52,569
- What's that mean? Feet per second.

81
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:53,658
- 19 feet per second.

82
00:02:53,658 --> 00:02:55,753
- So if I say "feet per second"
can you explain that to me?

83
00:02:55,753 --> 00:02:57,959
What does that mean "19 feet per second"?

84
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,791
- Every second I would go 19.19 feet.

85
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:05,098
- Good okay, so if I'm driving in my car

86
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:06,987
and my car's going 70 miles per hour

87
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:10,966
and I'm on the interstate
do I say my car's going 75?

88
00:03:10,966 --> 00:03:11,628
- No.

89
00:03:11,628 --> 00:03:15,121
- No you'd say miles per
hour, bleh, 70 miles per hour.

90
00:03:15,121 --> 00:03:17,157
- Can you tell me, Nathan, why?

91
00:03:17,157 --> 00:03:20,486
What does that mean "70 miles per hour"?

92
00:03:22,938 --> 00:03:24,576
- 70 miles per hour means you're

93
00:03:24,576 --> 00:03:26,811
going 70 miles per each hour.

94
00:03:26,811 --> 00:03:28,130
- For every hour, so that's good to know

95
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:28,797
for vacations, right?

96
00:03:28,797 --> 00:03:30,290

little kids who are saying,

00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,917
"Are we there yet?"

98
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:33,328
You gotta figure out how
long it's gonna take you.

00:03:33,328 --> 00:03:35,972
- Are we there yet?
- Right, okay.

to go into your next part

- Jordan

104
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:44,779
- It's gonna be Jordan.

105
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:46,137
All right, Miss Jordan.

106

tape and put it down

needs one more piece of tape.

- A long one.
- Okay.

- And a birthday one.

same one would be the fastest

or do you have different predictions?

what do you think?

- The Happy Birthday one.

- Long.
- Long.

- Long.
- Long.

- Can you tell me why
you think Happy Birthday

145
00:05:20,192 --> 00:05:23,279
and then you'll tell
me why you think long.

146
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,662
- At first my prediction was
the long one because it was

147
00:05:28,702 --> 00:05:31,947
not as much wind blowing against it.

148
00:05:31,947 --> 00:05:34,041
But now there's wind blowing.

149
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,762
It blew it to the sides and
putting more force against it

150
00:05:36,762 --> 00:05:39,112
which slowed it down and
made the long go faster.

151
00:05:39,112 --> 00:05:40,386
- It'd be like this wind.

152
00:05:40,386 --> 00:05:41,560
- Yes.

153
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,010
- You had this big.

154
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,268
That is a pretty good prediction.
[laughs]

155
00:05:44,268 --> 00:05:46,423
Why do you guys think it's
gonna be the long one?

156
00:05:46,423 --> 00:05:49,856
- I think it's the long one
because it's more smaller

157
00:05:49,856 --> 00:05:52,823
and the air can come off faster
and it's more stretchier.

158
00:05:52,823 --> 00:05:53,870
- Stretchier.

159
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,111
- Tight, it's more tight.

00:05:55,111 --> 00:05:56,412

so we changed it to 20.

164
00:06:09,652 --> 00:06:12,172
- It would stop about maybe
three feet away from the end.

165
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,194
- It would stop, so what
did you decide to do?

166
00:06:14,194 --> 00:06:15,656
- We changed it to 20.

167
00:06:15,656 --> 00:06:16,734
- You moved it to 20.

168
00:06:16,734 --> 00:06:18,127
Okay so...

169
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:21,692
What else could you have
done besides move it to 20?

170
00:06:21,692 --> 00:06:22,745
- Blow up the balloon more.

171
00:06:22,745 --> 00:06:23,671
- Maybe blow up the balloon more.

172
00:06:23,671 --> 00:06:25,539
Maybe the little one wouldn't
have worked though, huh?

173
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:26,954
It's not that much in there.

174
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:30,143
- We tried the big red
one putting more air

175
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,890
but it still stopped.

176
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:32,612
- The little one--

177
00:06:32,612 --> 00:06:36,595
- I think the wind kind of
changed how fast it would go

178
00:06:36,595 --> 00:06:39,309
and how far.

179
00:06:39,309 --> 00:06:42,743
- All right, so...

180
00:06:42,743 --> 00:06:45,349
All right...

181
00:06:54,722 --> 00:06:56,073
So let's come back this way.

182
00:06:56,073 --> 00:06:57,990
- Watch out behind you, Megan.

183
00:07:04,714 --> 00:07:08,701
- Dan you can go over to...

184
00:07:10,383 --> 00:07:12,299
There's motion in the wind, huh?

185
00:07:18,186 --> 00:07:21,490
- 176 and 108.

186
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,735
- All right, so here we go.

187
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,035
What are you gonna do first?

188
00:07:25,035 --> 00:07:26,832
Let's do the round balloon first.

189
00:07:26,832 --> 00:07:28,864
That was nobody's prediction, right?

190
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:29,931
- Nope.

191
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:31,029
- So let's do that one first.

192
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:32,105
What are we gonna do?

193
00:07:32,105 --> 00:07:34,333
- 20...
- Add both up.

194
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:41,934
And then what are you gonna do?

195
00:07:41,934 --> 00:07:42,882
- Divide by two.

196
00:07:42,882 --> 00:07:44,464
- Why are we dividing by two?

197
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:47,202
- To get the average.

198
00:07:47,202 --> 00:07:48,555
- To get the average.

199
00:07:48,555 --> 00:07:49,622
Why did you do it twice?

200
00:07:49,622 --> 00:07:50,740
Why didn't you just--

201
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,054
- And there's two, the two trials.

202
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,062
- Why you did two trials?

203
00:07:53,062 --> 00:07:54,625
Why wouldn't you just do one?

204
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,013
Why do you think that would've
been better to do two?

205
00:07:57,013 --> 00:07:59,512
- Divided by

206
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:00,784
[Background Chatter]

207
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:01,782
- Then we wouldn't have to divide it,

208
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:04,185
we wouldn't have to
find the average at all.

209
00:08:04,185 --> 00:08:05,749
But I guess we'd get
a better result.

210
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:06,554
What'd you get there?

211
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:07,338
- 2.35.

212
00:08:07,338 --> 00:08:08,995
- 3.73.

213
00:08:08,995 --> 00:08:10,653
- That's what I got, 2.35.

214
00:08:10,653 --> 00:08:12,846
- You add these two together
and you divide them.

215
00:08:12,846 --> 00:08:14,168
Remember this is the average.

216
00:08:14,168 --> 00:08:16,259
Can you have four?

217
00:08:18,235 --> 00:08:21,304
- I divided by two but I got 3.73.

218
00:08:21,304 --> 00:08:23,367
- Let's try again.

219
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:26,666
On the calculator I always do
things twice to double check.

220
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:34,241
- 2.35.

221
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:36,887
- 2.35.

222
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,339
Everybody's good?

223
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:41,607
Okay so let's go down to
the bottom of our sheet

224
00:08:41,607 --> 00:08:44,675
and we are going to figure
out our average speed.

225
00:08:44,675 --> 00:08:46,008
So what's our formula for that?

226
00:08:46,008 --> 00:08:47,674
How do we figure out average speed?

227
00:08:47,674 --> 00:08:50,224
- You do 20 because of the...

228
00:08:50,224 --> 00:08:52,702
- Okay, so that's when we
took 20 because, you see,

229
00:08:52,702 --> 00:08:55,141
we had 30 on our sheet
because originally

230
00:08:55,141 --> 00:08:55,864
we were doing 30.

231
00:08:55,864 --> 00:08:57,937
So let's cross out
30 since you guys said

232
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,495
you changed it to 20.

233
00:09:00,495 --> 00:09:03,168
And I think it was Dan that
said, if we were to probably,

234
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,170
no Hannah said we could
probably could put more air

235
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,360
in that balloon.

236
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,696
But changing the feet,
that'll work.

237
00:09:13,251 --> 00:09:15,361
Now how fast did the
first balloon go?

238
00:09:16,534 --> 00:09:19,581
- 19.35 by 20.

239
00:09:19,581 --> 00:09:20,984
- Look at your formula again.

240
00:09:20,984 --> 00:09:23,299
- 8.52.

241
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:26,165
- Your distance is 20 so
you're gonna do your distance

242
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:28,744
divided by your average time.

243
00:09:30,302 --> 00:09:31,709
Good?

244
00:09:32,377 --> 00:09:34,985
- 8.51.

245
00:09:40,374 --> 00:09:43,117
- Okay and I'll come back
to check on you you.

246
00:09:43,117 --> 00:09:45,724
All right, let's see how
these guys are doing.

247
00:09:46,481 --> 00:09:48,428
This one's a runner.

248
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,943
The line's over here right, Jordan?

249
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:02,086
- 16.

250
00:10:02,086 --> 00:10:03,162
- 16.

251
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,655
- We're at the end of Nathan's
so let's go ahead

252
00:10:06,655 --> 00:10:07,955
and figure out Nathan together.

253
00:10:07,955 --> 00:10:10,654
I'll come sit in your spot.

254
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,356
- They're in here.

255
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,350
- So to figure out Nathan,
let's talk about it together

256
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,123
while we're doing it.

257
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,430
We need some more calculators over here.

258
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,561
- Wait, what's this?

259
00:10:25,561 --> 00:10:27,041
- 641.

260
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:31,680
- Everybody please do catch up.

261
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,462
Got your pencils?

262
00:10:33,462 --> 00:10:34,660
- Wait, wait.

263
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,446
- 641, 575

264
00:10:38,817 --> 00:10:41,275
- Tell me again what we're doing?

265
00:10:45,705 --> 00:10:49,352
- ...average time.

266
00:10:50,562 --> 00:10:52,376
- 6.08.

267
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,255
- Does everybody have six?

268
00:11:05,203 --> 00:11:06,829
Read it back correctly.

269
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:08,080
- Six point O eight.

270
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,882
- Is that how you read
it correctly in math?

271
00:11:09,882 --> 00:11:11,141
- Six decimal.

272
00:11:11,141 --> 00:11:12,299
- Do we say decimal?

273
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:12,851
- Six--

274
00:11:12,851 --> 00:11:15,771
- Six point zero eight.

275
00:11:15,771 --> 00:11:16,431
- Do we say point?

276
00:11:16,431 --> 00:11:18,290
- Six and--
- And--

277
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,225
- Eight hundredths.

278
00:11:19,225 --> 00:11:20,566
- Six and eight hundredths.

279
00:11:20,566 --> 00:11:21,828
Ohhhh.

280
00:11:21,828 --> 00:11:23,033
- Gotta get it.

281
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,971
- So let's look just at our
average time for just a second.

282
00:11:25,971 --> 00:11:27,373
Stop for a minute and let's look at

283
00:11:27,373 --> 00:11:29,120
the top at our average time.

284
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,684
How do we know who is going the fastest

285
00:11:30,684 --> 00:11:33,613
when we're look at just the
top part, just the time?

286
00:11:33,613 --> 00:11:34,628
- Average time.

287
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:35,371
- The lowest.

288
00:11:35,371 --> 00:11:36,624
- The lowest number, right,
'cause he's getting

289
00:11:36,624 --> 00:11:38,331
in the fastest time.

290
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:39,855
So now when we go to the bottom

291
00:11:39,855 --> 00:11:43,878
and we're figuring out the
speed, how do we do speed?

292
00:11:43,878 --> 00:11:45,169
Whoever's the lowest number?

293
00:11:45,169 --> 00:11:46,583
- The highest number.

294
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:49,280
- The highest number it's going to be.

295
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,450
Let's go ahead and do Nathan
and then we'll compare

296
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,062
then we'll let Demi do hers.

297
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:04,044
- 16 point...

298
00:12:04,044 --> 00:12:05,489
- 16 point...

299
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:07,525
- 16.44, right?

300
00:12:07,525 --> 00:12:07,953
- Yep.

301
00:12:07,953 --> 00:12:09,550
- So let's look so far at the bottom.

302
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,358
Bailey, Jordan and Nathan.

303
00:12:11,358 --> 00:12:13,035
Who is the fastest?

304
00:12:13,035 --> 00:12:13,964
- So far Bailey.

305
00:12:13,964 --> 00:12:16,077
- So far Bailey, okay, so how can we,

306
00:12:16,077 --> 00:12:17,135
instead of looking at this,

307
00:12:17,135 --> 00:12:19,129
this looks like a whole
bunch of numbers to me.

308
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:21,498
What can I do visually just to
make it a little bit clearer?

309
00:12:21,498 --> 00:12:23,144
- Make a bar graph.

310
00:12:23,144 --> 00:12:25,358
- Okay, we can make a bar
graph with this.

311
00:12:25,358 --> 00:12:26,617
Anything else we can do?

312
00:12:26,617 --> 00:12:27,889
- Line graph.
- Maybe get

313
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:29,064
each person to make a line graph.

314
00:12:29,064 --> 00:12:30,285
- Take your own three times

315
00:12:30,285 --> 00:12:31,052
and make a line graph
with your own three times.

316
00:12:31,052 --> 00:12:32,688
- Because that would be
you, right, over time?

317
00:12:32,688 --> 00:12:33,785
That would be a great idea.

318
00:12:33,785 --> 00:12:35,695
So we can do the straight line graphs.

319
00:12:35,695 --> 00:12:38,244
That's a good idea with
the line graph, Bailey.

320
00:12:38,244 --> 00:12:41,292
So when we make a line graph
we'll do that at the end

321
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:43,771
using this information and
then we'll do a bar graph

322
00:12:43,771 --> 00:12:44,965
using this information.

323
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:45,872
Does that sound good?

324
00:12:45,872 --> 00:12:47,994
All right, Demi's turn's up.

325
00:12:50,286 --> 00:12:51,755
Let's go.

326
00:12:51,755 --> 00:12:54,755
- Let's see how we are doing here.

327
00:12:58,424 --> 00:13:00,821
Okay, we're at the very end.

328
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:03,300
So which one ended up being the fastest?

329
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,063
- The long one.

330
00:13:04,063 --> 00:13:05,241
- The long one.

331
00:13:05,241 --> 00:13:08,167
But I think that Devon had
a very good prediction.

332
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:09,894
I think his reasoning was good.

333
00:13:09,894 --> 00:13:11,296
See that wind blowing?

334
00:13:11,296 --> 00:13:13,689
In a race, when you're in
a race, and you're running,

335
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:15,692
or when you're in a foot ball team,

336
00:13:15,692 --> 00:13:18,333
what side do you want to
be on if you have the ball

337
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,817
and you're trying to get
that ball to the other side?

338
00:13:20,817 --> 00:13:23,074
You want the wind to be
with you, right?

339
00:13:23,074 --> 00:13:24,842
Because if you're against the wind,

340
00:13:24,842 --> 00:13:25,736
the wind is pushing on you,

341
00:13:25,736 --> 00:13:27,625
so I think Devon had an excellent...

342
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:30,103
Good job, Devon, next time.

343
00:13:30,103 --> 00:13:31,130
All right, we're at the bottom.

344
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:33,710
Why do you think that
balloon was the fastest?

345
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:37,184
- I put, "The shape of it,
the wind went right past it."

346
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:39,927
- All right, remember
there was unbalanced force.

347
00:13:39,927 --> 00:13:42,345
So the force inside the
balloon, where was the force?

348
00:13:42,345 --> 00:13:43,982
- The wind, the air.

349
00:13:43,982 --> 00:13:46,745
- The air that Devon
blew inside that balloon,

350
00:13:46,745 --> 00:13:48,544
the air inside pushed the balloon

351
00:13:48,544 --> 00:13:49,856
and that's what made it
travel and it was

352
00:13:49,856 --> 00:13:51,777
an unbalanced force
so when you let go--

353
00:13:51,777 --> 00:13:53,876
- It probably was the
fastest because even though

354
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:57,757
the wind was blowing
it's on a round part

355
00:13:57,757 --> 00:14:00,398
to where it would spin and
the wind would just roll

356
00:14:00,398 --> 00:14:02,696
off of the balloon and it would
just make the balloon roll

357
00:14:02,696 --> 00:14:06,387
but it would still go as
fast as it usually goes.

358
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,579
- That's a pretty good idea too.

359
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:10,083
It's kind of like when
you're driving a car

360
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,749
if you're on vacation
sometimes your parents,

361
00:14:11,749 --> 00:14:13,943
you may see them driving
behind a 18 wheeler.

362
00:14:13,943 --> 00:14:15,812
Why do you think they would do that?

363
00:14:15,812 --> 00:14:16,778
- Because the wind blocks the--

364
00:14:16,778 --> 00:14:17,916
- Because the wind is blocking.

365
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,141
- 18 wheel blocks it.

366
00:14:19,141 --> 00:14:20,900
The 18 wheeler's blocking the wind

367
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,313
so you can get more miles per hour,

368
00:14:22,313 --> 00:14:24,460
I mean you can get better
gas mileage doing that.

369
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,284
If you ever see your parents doing

370
00:14:25,284 --> 00:14:26,456
that...

371
00:14:26,456 --> 00:14:28,153
- Some people don't like to do
that though because of rocks.

372
00:14:28,153 --> 00:14:29,505
- Rocks, yeah it could be dangerous

373
00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:30,907
- Yeah it could be dangerous
becuase of rocks.

374
00:14:30,907 --> 00:14:32,304
Good job.
