1
00:00:00,191 --> 00:00:04,071
- So, here's the first set.

2
00:00:04,461 --> 00:00:06,831
I thought I'd start a little bit easy.

3
00:00:06,831 --> 00:00:10,232
So, go ahead and within your groups now,

4
00:00:10,232 --> 00:00:12,991
I'll give you like a minute to tell me

5
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:15,662
all the methods that you can

6
00:00:15,992 --> 00:00:19,911
of how to separate, how to
figure out which one it is.

7
00:00:19,911 --> 00:00:21,751
Okay? Go ahead.

8
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:25,221
- [Male Student] You can uh...

9
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:28,911
- [Christina] You can you use

10
00:00:28,911 --> 00:00:30,842
Beer's Law for this, right?

11
00:00:31,962 --> 00:00:33,872
- [Male Student 2] You
aren't able to taste that.

12
00:00:33,872 --> 00:00:35,671
- You aren't able to,
that's not big enough.

13
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:37,631
- Our...(mumbles)

14
00:00:37,631 --> 00:00:39,652
- Okay, so...

15
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:43,411
- [Male Student 3] Doesn't dissociate.

16
00:00:44,751 --> 00:00:46,672
- [Male Student 2] How's
the temperature? Boil it.

17
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:48,772
- Yeah, that's the only way.

18
00:00:48,772 --> 00:00:51,222
- So, the one with the highest

19
00:00:51,222 --> 00:00:52,952
concentration's going to have
the highest boiling point.

20
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:54,890
- [Male Student 2] Yeah.

21
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,304
- [Male Student 4] You could
freeze it and weigh it.

22
00:00:58,304 --> 00:00:59,652
- [Natalie] Okay, freezing it.

23
00:00:59,652 --> 00:01:01,991
- The point three would
have the most weight.

24
00:01:01,991 --> 00:01:04,020
- Weight. Yeah.

25
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,791
But which one would freeze first?

26
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:09,391
- [Female Students] Point one.

27
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:12,091
- Point one would freeze
first because there's less.

28
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:14,823
Okay. What else?

29
00:01:15,763 --> 00:01:18,610
- Point three weighs more.

30
00:01:19,231 --> 00:01:22,080
- But we would need to
freeze it first, no?

31
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,100
- [Natalie] What? We
wouldn't need to freeze it.

32
00:01:26,591 --> 00:01:28,431
- [Male Student 5] The
first one being, would
 
33
00:01:28,431 --> 00:01:30,471
be with the tasting one.

34
00:01:30,471 --> 00:01:35,252
- Or the volume one. I
don't know the tasting one.

35
00:01:35,252 --> 00:01:36,911
- Okay, you say the tasting one,

36
00:01:36,911 --> 00:01:38,185
you say the volume one.

37
00:01:38,185 --> 00:01:39,731
Whichever one comes first.

38
00:01:39,731 --> 00:01:41,762
(laughs)

39
00:01:42,232 --> 00:01:44,030
- [Male Student 6] The one
who boils fastest would

40
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,512
be the one with the
point one, right? Okay.

41
00:01:46,512 --> 00:01:50,643
- So, the one that boils the fastest.

42
00:01:51,023 --> 00:01:52,784
- [Male Student 6] Point one.

43
00:01:52,784 --> 00:01:53,872
- You could measure the vapor pressure

44
00:01:53,872 --> 00:01:55,791
by also just leaving them and adding them

45
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:57,312
and then just coming back

46
00:01:57,312 --> 00:01:59,021
after like five minutes or ten minutes.

47
00:01:59,021 --> 00:02:01,271
- Alright. So, we can have equal volumes

48
00:02:01,271 --> 00:02:02,820
of each solution, right?

49
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,791
And then, after like a certain time--

50
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,026
- [Teacher] Alright,
that's it. Everybody stop.

51
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:08,611
Stop, stop, stop. Okay.

52
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:10,921
So, who want to go first?

53
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:12,631
We'll start with with Miles,

54
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:14,822
I think you had your hand
up first, so go ahead.

55
00:02:14,822 --> 00:02:17,264
What's one way that you
can identify these things?

56
00:02:17,264 --> 00:02:20,391
- [Miles] Well, you could
boil all the solutions

57
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:22,510
until all the water vaporizes,

58
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,601
and the beaker with the most sugar in it

59
00:02:25,601 --> 00:02:27,711
would be the 0.3 molar,

60
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:29,341
0.2 would be the middle,

61
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:31,685
and 0.1 would be the least.

62
00:02:32,671 --> 00:02:33,681
- Okay.

63
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:35,464
- [Miles] If they were
all the same volume.

64
00:02:35,464 --> 00:02:37,025
- [Class] Ahh...
- [Teacher] Yeah.

65
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:38,272
You guys heard that, now?

66
00:02:38,272 --> 00:02:40,151
Good. Good listening skills on that.

67
00:02:40,151 --> 00:02:43,232
If they were the same volume
at the beginning, alright?

68
00:02:43,232 --> 00:02:45,291
Does everybody agree?

69
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:50,291
So, one method is boil away and weigh.

70
00:02:54,271 --> 00:02:55,631
Did you say weigh?

71
00:02:55,631 --> 00:02:57,231
How do you know which one has the most?

72
00:02:57,231 --> 00:02:58,710
I would imagine you
could weigh it, right?

73
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,511
- [Miles] You could weight it.

74
00:03:00,511 --> 00:03:05,321
- Start with equal volumes. Okay.

75
00:03:11,305 --> 00:03:14,354
There's several other ways.

76
00:03:14,354 --> 00:03:15,712
How about Joseph?

77
00:03:15,712 --> 00:03:18,431
- If you take equal
volumes of each solution

78
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,191
and you taste them,

79
00:03:20,191 --> 00:03:22,552
whichever one tastes more sugary

80
00:03:22,552 --> 00:03:25,161
would have the highest concentration.

81
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,912
(mumbles)

82
00:03:26,912 --> 00:03:29,030
- Okay. Anybody have comments on that?

83
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,471
Jimmy?

84
00:03:30,471 --> 00:03:31,681
- I don't think we're able to

85
00:03:31,681 --> 00:03:33,390
distinguish the taste that well.

86
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,231
Because our mouth isn't that sensitive.

87
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:36,384
- [Teacher] Okay. Miles?

88
00:03:36,384 --> 00:03:38,072
- What if someone dropped
some lead nitrate in there?

89
00:03:38,072 --> 00:03:39,830
(Students laugh)

90
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,270
- So, there's two concerns.

91
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,991
Obviously I think Miles
is the most important.

92
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:46,950
You know you guys can see

93
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,672
that I'm smart enough to
put the right substances.

94
00:03:49,672 --> 00:03:51,111
(Male Student laughs)

95
00:03:51,111 --> 00:03:52,591
I keep forgetting I'm getting old.

96
00:03:52,591 --> 00:03:54,142
And I may go in the back,

97
00:03:54,142 --> 00:03:57,350
and I reach for the lead
nitrate or something, right?

98
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,347
(mumbles)

99
00:04:00,347 --> 00:04:02,151
And then the other part,

100
00:04:02,151 --> 00:04:03,931
what do you guys think of the other part?

101
00:04:03,931 --> 00:04:05,511
Could you taste the difference

102
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:08,225
between a 0.2, 0.3, and a 0.1?

103
00:04:08,225 --> 00:04:10,994
And just say "Ah, that's
the sweetest one."

104
00:04:10,994 --> 00:04:12,424
- [Student] It's kind of hard.

105
00:04:12,424 --> 00:04:13,983
- {Miles] You'd need some salt.

106
00:04:13,983 --> 00:04:16,231
- The problem I think is

107
00:04:16,231 --> 00:04:19,150
this is something we would
actually need to try, right?

108
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,152
I don't think this is a theoretical thing

109
00:04:21,152 --> 00:04:22,601
that we're trying to,

110
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:24,631
we're practicing theory here.

111
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,911
We would actually have to
do this in a lab, right?

112
00:04:26,911 --> 00:04:28,941
I would imagine we would.

113
00:04:29,254 --> 00:04:31,032
- Wouldn't it be different
for every person?

114
00:04:31,032 --> 00:04:32,312
Because we could--

115
00:04:32,312 --> 00:04:34,221
- [Teacher] It could be different
for every person, right?

116
00:04:34,221 --> 00:04:37,891
Because I can't see as
well as you, for example maybe, right?

117
00:04:39,081 --> 00:04:43,141
So, there could be variations
in tasting of those.

118
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:44,391
Ian?

119
00:04:44,391 --> 00:04:46,320
- Given excess humans...

120
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,561
(laughs)

121
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:49,391
- [Teacher] Oh, wait.
You're on the next one?

122
00:04:49,391 --> 00:04:51,381
- [Ian] No, on this one.

123
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:55,351
- Alright. I didn't get that either.

124
00:04:55,351 --> 00:04:56,621
(laughs)

125
00:04:56,621 --> 00:05:00,071
Okay, so let's look at
another method, alright?

126
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:01,431
We're not going to list that one

127
00:05:01,431 --> 00:05:03,992
because we don't want
to be tasting things.

128
00:05:03,992 --> 00:05:06,361
Okay so Paran, your group.

129
00:05:06,361 --> 00:05:08,262
- What about at equal volumes

130
00:05:08,262 --> 00:05:10,031
you could test the vapor pressure

131
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:11,271
and the 0.1 would have the most,

132
00:05:11,271 --> 00:05:12,841
and 0.3 would have the least

133
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:16,985
because there's more sugar covering it?

134
00:05:17,034 --> 00:05:19,532
- [Teacher] What do you guys think?

135
00:05:21,452 --> 00:05:23,011
Okay, Juan?

136
00:05:23,011 --> 00:05:24,425
- He didn't say how you could measure it.

137
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:25,691
The way you could measure it is that

138
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:27,551
with equal volumes you leave them out,

139
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:29,272
and the one that evaporates the fastest

140
00:05:29,272 --> 00:05:31,831
is the one with the
highest vapor pressure.

141
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,571
(mumbles)

142
00:05:34,671 --> 00:05:36,112
- Everybody agree?

143
00:05:36,112 --> 00:05:37,211
- [Students] Yeah.

144
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,111
- Okay. So, that was my concern too, right?

145
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:40,950
How do you measure the vapor pressure?

146
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,064
You're not wrong.

147
00:05:42,064 --> 00:05:43,672
But how do measure it?

148
00:05:43,672 --> 00:05:45,991
And thank you, Juan, for bringing that up.

149
00:05:45,991 --> 00:05:47,664
- [Male Student] Could you repeat that?

150
00:05:47,664 --> 00:05:51,431
- Okay, so you would take equal
volumes and leave them out

151
00:05:51,431 --> 00:05:54,351
to evaporate because they'd
always be evaporating?

152
00:05:54,351 --> 00:05:56,071
The one with the highest vapor pressure

153
00:05:56,071 --> 00:05:58,561
which is 0.1 molar,

154
00:05:58,561 --> 00:06:01,831
would evaporate the most after
a certain amount of time.

155
00:06:07,321 --> 00:06:09,071
(mumbles)

156
00:06:10,231 --> 00:06:13,562
- So, I'm going to write
this as evaporation rate.

157
00:06:17,312 --> 00:06:19,031
Who's got another method? Different view?

158
00:06:19,031 --> 00:06:20,271
Alright, Jimmy?

159
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:22,591
- Okay, so you're gonna
put the same amount

160
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:25,906
in a sealed container
and put it into light.

161
00:06:25,906 --> 00:06:28,471
Whichever one grows
algae first is the 0.3.

162
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,002
Then the second one is
0.2, the last one 0.1.

163
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,351
- What do you guys think?

164
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,951
- [Male Student] Could you repeat that?

165
00:06:34,951 --> 00:06:37,151
- So, you're going to take equal amounts,

166
00:06:37,151 --> 00:06:39,151
take it into the light,

167
00:06:39,151 --> 00:06:42,232
make sure it's the same
conditions for each one,

168
00:06:42,232 --> 00:06:44,671
and then whichever one grows
algae first is the 0.3.

169
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:47,011
Second is 0.2, last is 0.1.

170
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:49,712
- [Teacher] What do you guys think?

171
00:06:49,712 --> 00:06:51,990
I know some of you guys
are thinking that's bio,

172
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:55,311
but you took it, most
of you at least right?

173
00:06:55,311 --> 00:06:57,511
So, we could finish
this. What do you think?

174
00:06:57,511 --> 00:06:59,153
- Wouldn't it take a long time

175
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:01,201
for the algae to start growing?

176
00:07:01,201 --> 00:07:02,712
- [Male Student] It's going to work, right?

177
00:07:02,712 --> 00:07:04,311
- [Teacher] Nobody sees--

178
00:07:04,311 --> 00:07:05,511
- [Miles] Where's the algae--

179
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:06,911
- [Teacher] You're always asking me.

180
00:07:06,911 --> 00:07:08,464
Come one, folks. You think about this.

181
00:07:08,464 --> 00:07:10,471
I'm going to say the problems.

182
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,825
But I want you to tell me first, alright?

183
00:07:13,245 --> 00:07:15,472
(mumbles)

184
00:07:15,472 --> 00:07:17,153
- [Teacher] Alright, let's go with Ivan.

185
00:07:17,153 --> 00:07:19,191
- I don't think the results
would be consistent.

186
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:23,832
Because what if some algae
cells just go in one solution

187
00:07:23,832 --> 00:07:27,160
and start going there for no reason.

188
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,451
- So, because you didn't mention
how much algae you put in,

189
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,031
there could be an issue there.

190
00:07:34,031 --> 00:07:36,101
What else, though?

191
00:07:37,352 --> 00:07:39,471
No Juan, you go alright?

192
00:07:41,021 --> 00:07:42,591
- I don't think you can assume that

193
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,632
you have all the necessary
stuff in the water

194
00:07:44,632 --> 00:07:47,340
for the algae to grow in the first place.

195
00:07:47,831 --> 00:07:50,392
- So, I think Juan is saying

196
00:07:50,392 --> 00:07:53,751
growing conditions require
lots of other things.

197
00:07:53,751 --> 00:07:56,464
Not just amount of sugar
and amount of water.

198
00:07:56,464 --> 00:07:59,391
There could be other nutrients,
is that what you're saying?

199
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:00,411
- [Juan] Yeah.

200
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:02,145
- Nutrients and other things of that sort.

201
00:08:02,145 --> 00:08:04,471
Could I just back up for a sec?

202
00:08:05,391 --> 00:08:08,264
Algae produces sugar, right?

203
00:08:11,528 --> 00:08:15,512
Assuming that you're talking
about algae that grows,

204
00:08:15,512 --> 00:08:18,230
they use carbon dioxide.

205
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,470
So my hunch is, there's several, right?

206
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,945
One, I think as Ivan pointed out,

207
00:08:22,945 --> 00:08:24,952
you've got to put in a certain amount.

208
00:08:24,952 --> 00:08:26,350
Why don't you put in something that

209
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,392
eats the sugar like yeast,

210
00:08:28,392 --> 00:08:30,911
and then we could all finish
and have a beer at the end?

211
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:33,071
(laughs)

212
00:08:34,801 --> 00:08:37,523
You picked algae so, yeah.

213
00:08:37,953 --> 00:08:41,352
Although is that a bad idea?

214
00:08:41,352 --> 00:08:45,152
It could work, but we have to
be careful with conditions.

215
00:08:45,152 --> 00:08:47,192
A lot of conditions need to be met.

216
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:49,171
Anything else?

217
00:08:51,111 --> 00:08:53,862
- [Female Student] You boil them.

218
00:08:59,092 --> 00:09:02,025
- [Teacher] Hold on. Let these guys go.

219
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:09,621
- If you have equal volumes
and you add heat to them,

220
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:14,871
0.1 should boil first.

221
00:09:14,871 --> 00:09:17,702
- Okay, so you could use boiling point.

222
00:09:21,032 --> 00:09:22,690
Elevation.

223
00:09:23,861 --> 00:09:26,991
I wrote this down before
we even discussed it.

224
00:09:26,991 --> 00:09:29,881
But everybody agrees that works, right?

225
00:09:29,981 --> 00:09:31,825
So, what's another easy one that we,

226
00:09:31,825 --> 00:09:35,031
boiling point elevation, right?

227
00:09:35,031 --> 00:09:37,146
You need me to repeat that or you got it?

228
00:09:37,146 --> 00:09:39,471
(mumbles)

229
00:09:39,471 --> 00:09:42,391
What immediately follows with that idea?

230
00:09:42,391 --> 00:09:44,031
- [Miles] Freezing point depression.

231
00:09:44,031 --> 00:09:46,281
- Freezing point depression.

232
00:09:50,031 --> 00:09:51,952
Okay, what else?

233
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,651
I have a question for you then.

234
00:09:55,651 --> 00:09:58,873
Could we use Beer's Law for this?

235
00:09:58,873 --> 00:10:01,721
No? Tell me why.

236
00:10:03,431 --> 00:10:06,151
Could we use Beer's Law for this?

237
00:10:06,151 --> 00:10:08,780
Ian, you have your hand up.

238
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,945
- At first glace I would say no because

239
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:12,641
I do not believe that stuff

240
00:10:12,641 --> 00:10:14,095
actually has a coloring solution.

241
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:15,785
- [Teacher] What do you guys think?

242
00:10:15,785 --> 00:10:17,191
- [Students] Yep.

243
00:10:17,191 --> 00:10:18,771
- [Teacher] Don't you need color?

244
00:10:18,771 --> 00:10:20,951
Unless what? Unless?

245
00:10:20,961 --> 00:10:22,866
Come on, keep going with this stuff.

246
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:24,630
Not you Ian. You spoke.

247
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:28,101
I'd like to have as many
people participate as possible.

248
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:30,452
Alright Nick, go ahead.

249
00:10:30,452 --> 00:10:34,142
- You could add food coloring possibly.

250
00:10:34,852 --> 00:10:36,892
Yeah, you could add food coloring

251
00:10:36,892 --> 00:10:38,665
and maybe the higher concentration

252
00:10:38,665 --> 00:10:41,301
would appear darker, possibly?

253
00:10:41,511 --> 00:10:42,984
- Nick, we're trying to figure out

254
00:10:42,984 --> 00:10:45,372
the difference between these, right?

255
00:10:45,372 --> 00:10:46,842
- [Nick] Yeah.

256
00:10:46,842 --> 00:10:48,762
- What do you mean "add?"

257
00:10:48,762 --> 00:10:50,383
You mean add a drop to each of these?

258
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:51,552
- [Nick] Yeah.

259
00:10:51,552 --> 00:10:53,505
- But then what would you be measuring?

260
00:10:53,505 --> 00:10:54,831
The food coloring.

261
00:10:54,831 --> 00:10:58,371
You wouldn't be measuring the sugar.

262
00:10:59,886 --> 00:11:01,111
You know what I mean?

263
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:03,671
- [Nick] Yeah, I know what you mean.

264
00:11:03,671 --> 00:11:06,322
- You're still okay with that?

265
00:11:07,572 --> 00:11:09,272
- Uh, I don't know.

266
00:11:09,272 --> 00:11:10,751
- Wait, Nick.

267
00:11:10,751 --> 00:11:12,550
If you add food coloring, how much?

268
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,743
One drop?

269
00:11:13,743 --> 00:11:14,865
- [Nick] Yeah.

270
00:11:14,865 --> 00:11:16,231
- Okay. One drop to each of these, right?

271
00:11:16,231 --> 00:11:17,712
Now they all look the same.

272
00:11:17,712 --> 00:11:19,711
(laughs)

273
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:21,042
Don't they?

274
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:22,522
- [Nick] Yeah.

275
00:11:22,522 --> 00:11:25,705
- And if I stick this in
my spectral photometer,

276
00:11:25,705 --> 00:11:27,951
they should all measure the same.

277
00:11:27,951 --> 00:11:31,584
Did I succeed in figuring
out which one is which?

278
00:11:32,724 --> 00:11:34,485
You understand that, right?

279
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,741
- [Nick] Yeah, yeah.

280
00:11:35,741 --> 00:11:37,452
- [Teacher] Okay. Nat?

281
00:11:37,452 --> 00:11:39,493
- Could you somehow measure

282
00:11:39,493 --> 00:11:42,334
how fast the food coloring spreads?

283
00:11:42,344 --> 00:11:43,786
- That's interesting.

284
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:47,451
Could you measure how fast
the food coloring spreads?

285
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:50,991
- You'd have to indicate that
high concentration would--

286
00:11:50,991 --> 00:11:52,785
- [Teacher} Hang on.

287
00:11:52,885 --> 00:11:55,912
But once again we have to be
careful of conditions, right?

288
00:11:55,912 --> 00:11:58,934
- [Miles] All the temperatures
have to be the same.

289
00:11:58,934 --> 00:12:00,871
- What do you guys think?

290
00:12:00,871 --> 00:12:02,591
- [Miles] Sure.

291
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:04,831
- Why would that work?

292
00:12:04,831 --> 00:12:07,544
- Because the sugar
molecules are getting wet

293
00:12:07,544 --> 00:12:11,672
and it's not able to spread
through the molecules.

294
00:12:11,672 --> 00:12:13,551
So, that would be in the 0.3.

295
00:12:13,551 --> 00:12:15,872
- [Teacher} Anybody else
have thoughts on that one?

296
00:12:15,872 --> 00:12:18,931
My hunch on this one is it probably works,

297
00:12:18,931 --> 00:12:22,470
but this goes into the
category of that taste one

298
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,082
where I think we really
need to expand, right?

299
00:12:25,082 --> 00:12:26,712
[Male Student] Science!

300
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:29,050
- Glad you like it. Alright.

301
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,491
How about, wait.

302
00:12:31,491 --> 00:12:33,251
Gevorg hasn't spoken.

303
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:36,231
So I'm thinking, Gevorg,
it's your turn buddy.

304
00:12:36,231 --> 00:12:38,311
What did you want to add?

305
00:12:38,311 --> 00:12:40,885
You wanted to add a new technique?

306
00:12:41,952 --> 00:12:43,971
Okay, go ahead.

307
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,071
- If we did a Benedict's Test,

308
00:12:46,071 --> 00:12:48,481
I don't know if it would
just turn the same color

309
00:12:48,481 --> 00:12:51,392
because I'm not sure how
the Benedict's reacts

310
00:12:51,392 --> 00:12:53,307
with different concentrations.

311
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:56,832
But maybe if you put the same
amount of Benedict's

312
00:12:56,832 --> 00:12:59,712
and if it gets darker or it
gets affected with the molarity

313
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,230
then you could use a color emitter

314
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,412
or a spectrometer to test.

315
00:13:04,412 --> 00:13:05,904
- [Teacher] What do you guys think?

316
00:13:05,904 --> 00:13:08,271
Benedict's is a reaction between

317
00:13:08,271 --> 00:13:09,984
this Benedict's stuff with sugar,

318
00:13:09,984 --> 00:13:12,891
to show the presence of sugar.

319
00:13:12,891 --> 00:13:15,190
- [Miles] What comes out of the reaction?

320
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,962
- [Teacher] I'm not sure
but it's a color change.

321
00:13:17,962 --> 00:13:19,983
- [Miles] Oh well, the more color change--

322
00:13:19,983 --> 00:13:23,144
- [Teacher] But if the
color change is too intense,

323
00:13:23,144 --> 00:13:24,712
it could just be like

324
00:13:24,712 --> 00:13:27,461
it's all going to change that color or not,

325
00:13:27,461 --> 00:13:29,030
see what I'm saying?

326
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,912
That's what your pointing out, right?

327
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:35,311
So again, that sounds
like an experimental one.

328
00:13:36,491 --> 00:13:38,323
Could I share one more?

329
00:13:38,323 --> 00:13:40,481
How about this.

330
00:13:40,591 --> 00:13:42,796
You know when you take your AP test,

331
00:13:42,796 --> 00:13:44,391
you just don't know what.

332
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:48,532
And we started with something
that I think is sort of easy.

333
00:13:49,072 --> 00:13:51,921
Could you use density?

334
00:13:51,921 --> 00:13:53,785
What do you guys think?

335
00:13:53,785 --> 00:13:55,911
Someone who hasn't talked yet.

336
00:13:55,911 --> 00:13:57,871
Could we use density?

337
00:13:57,871 --> 00:14:00,520
(mumbles)

338
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,181
And how do we use density?

339
00:14:07,051 --> 00:14:10,511
What do you guys think? No?

340
00:14:10,511 --> 00:14:12,841
Alright, Ian. Since nobody's going for it.

341
00:14:12,841 --> 00:14:14,451
- Do I have to say it?

342
00:14:14,451 --> 00:14:16,581
- [Teacher] Go ahead and say it.

343
00:14:16,581 --> 00:14:18,332
Tell me how. Tell us how.

344
00:14:18,332 --> 00:14:20,801
- Take equal volume of each of the three

345
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:22,174
and weigh it.

346
00:14:22,174 --> 00:14:23,751
- [Teacher] Exactly.

347
00:14:23,751 --> 00:14:25,752
Which one's going to weigh the most?

348
00:14:25,752 --> 00:14:28,992
The one that has the most sugar, okay?

349
00:14:28,992 --> 00:14:32,625
If you take equal volumes,
this one will weigh the most.

350
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,507
This will be the most dense.

351
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:37,232
The more sugar you add,
the denser it gets.

352
00:14:37,232 --> 00:14:39,511
You know this, right?

353
00:14:39,961 --> 00:14:41,631
Does anybody have any more?

354
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,992
Alright, let's move on.

355
00:14:43,992 --> 00:14:46,071
Set number two.

356
00:14:46,071 --> 00:14:48,632
Now this says "solid"
and I'm trying to get you

357
00:14:48,632 --> 00:14:51,664
to see a different range on these.

358
00:14:51,664 --> 00:14:52,991
Go ahead and talk about it.

359
00:14:52,991 --> 00:14:55,601
I'll give you a minute or so.

360
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,281
- [Student] Colors?

361
00:15:00,552 --> 00:15:03,102
(mumbles)

362
00:15:10,522 --> 00:15:11,962
- [Student] Conductivity?

363
00:15:11,962 --> 00:15:14,312
- We could root the potassium chloride

364
00:15:14,312 --> 00:15:16,195
out with conductivity.

365
00:15:16,195 --> 00:15:18,263
- Well, they're solid.
You have to remember.

366
00:15:18,263 --> 00:15:22,145
So, solid has a lot of problems with it.

367
00:15:22,145 --> 00:15:24,671
- [Miles] That's just...solving it.

368
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:27,711
- [Student 2] It's hard
to conduct a current.

369
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:29,152
- [Miles] Well you could dissolve it--

370
00:15:29,152 --> 00:15:32,741
- [Student 2] It's doable.
It's just a little difficult.

371
00:15:38,631 --> 00:15:41,511
[Melissa] Potassium.

372
00:15:41,511 --> 00:15:42,992
- Then um...

373
00:15:42,992 --> 00:15:45,922
- [Female Student] Wait, calcium.

374
00:15:45,972 --> 00:15:49,231
- What about pH sensing?

375
00:15:49,231 --> 00:15:51,043
So CACL2.

376
00:15:51,043 --> 00:15:53,532
- Well they're solids.

377
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:57,912
- Oh, if you put them into a solvent?

378
00:15:57,912 --> 00:16:00,551
- Yeah.

379
00:16:00,551 --> 00:16:02,231
Can we put them into solvents?

380
00:16:02,231 --> 00:16:04,032
Can we make it into--

381
00:16:04,032 --> 00:16:06,700
- So, lead can't dissolve in water, right?

382
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,591
- Lead?

383
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,152
- [Female Student] I mean lead chloride.

384
00:16:09,152 --> 00:16:10,947
- [Ian] No, lead chloride
will not dissolve in water.

385
00:16:10,947 --> 00:16:12,952
- [Female Student] But
then KCL and CACL2 would?

386
00:16:12,952 --> 00:16:14,272
- They would.

387
00:16:14,272 --> 00:16:16,071
- So, you can rule that
out. That's one way.

388
00:16:16,071 --> 00:16:18,590
But then how do you figure out

389
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:21,051
between the other solution?

390
00:16:22,651 --> 00:16:25,591
- Couldn't there be a bigger
concentration of chloride

391
00:16:25,591 --> 00:16:28,694
and then you could form a precipitate?

392
00:16:28,694 --> 00:16:30,511
- I wouldn't say form a precipitate,

393
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:32,261
I would say...

394
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:34,732
(mumbles)

395
00:16:34,732 --> 00:16:38,521
Actually, I'm thinking you can hybridize

396
00:16:38,521 --> 00:16:42,512
the fact the lead chloride
doesn't dissolve at all

397
00:16:42,512 --> 00:16:46,432
with boiling point elevation,

398
00:16:46,432 --> 00:16:48,951
freezing point depression
because you're going to

399
00:16:48,951 --> 00:16:52,742
have more little bits in
the CACL2 than the KCL.

400
00:16:53,895 --> 00:16:55,711
- As an end result,

401
00:16:55,711 --> 00:16:59,041
calcium chloride, potassium
chloride get what?

402
00:17:00,151 --> 00:17:02,871
PBCL2 does nothing.

403
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:06,621
So, after that if you boil it, right?

404
00:17:07,981 --> 00:17:11,073
Calcium chloride,
potassium, the higher value.

405
00:17:12,673 --> 00:17:15,145
- [Teacher] Alright you guys. That's it.

406
00:17:15,145 --> 00:17:17,792
Let's gather up. Okay.

407
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:19,931
Some of you guys just got back,

408
00:17:19,931 --> 00:17:21,751
so you guys know what we're doing, right?

409
00:17:21,751 --> 00:17:23,031
- [Student] Yes.

410
00:17:23,031 --> 00:17:24,511
- [Teacher] Okay.

411
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:26,871
Let's get it together.

412
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:29,790
Alright, everybody stop now.

413
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,672
Christina, you had your hand up first.

414
00:17:34,672 --> 00:17:36,151
Take the easiest one.

415
00:17:36,151 --> 00:17:38,311
What's the easiest way
to distinguish these?

416
00:17:38,311 --> 00:17:41,151
- You could take equal
amounts of each of them and weigh them,

417
00:17:41,151 --> 00:17:43,752
and then PBCL2 would be the heaviest,

418
00:17:43,752 --> 00:17:47,471
and the KCL would be the lightest.

419
00:17:47,911 --> 00:17:49,550
- [Teacher] Equal volumes?

420
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,072
- I mean equal amounts.

421
00:17:51,072 --> 00:17:52,591
- [Teacher] What's an amount, though?

422
00:17:52,591 --> 00:17:54,272
- Like grams.

423
00:17:54,272 --> 00:17:56,352
(class moans)

424
00:17:56,352 --> 00:17:57,833
- [Teacher] But if I take equal grams,

425
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,745
then I could have ten grams of this,

426
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,711
ten grams of this, ten grams of that.

427
00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:03,552
- No, I didn't say that.

428
00:18:03,552 --> 00:18:06,151
(laughs)

429
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:10,391
- [Teacher] Alright,
what did you say then?

430
00:18:10,391 --> 00:18:13,312
- I meant like equal--

431
00:18:13,312 --> 00:18:14,562
- [Teacher] Equal what?

432
00:18:14,562 --> 00:18:15,616
- Volume.

433
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:17,341
- [Teacher] Volume, okay.

434
00:18:17,341 --> 00:18:18,671
Now let's answer that one.

435
00:18:18,671 --> 00:18:20,222
What do you guys think?

436
00:18:20,222 --> 00:18:21,569
She's saying take,

437
00:18:21,569 --> 00:18:24,031
let's say 10 milliliters, 10
milliliters, 10 milliliters.

438
00:18:24,031 --> 00:18:27,531
And this one's going to weigh the most.

439
00:18:28,501 --> 00:18:31,734
This one would weigh, which one's second?

440
00:18:32,984 --> 00:18:35,471
- [Christina] Oh, sorry.
Second would be CACL2.

441
00:18:35,471 --> 00:18:36,951
- Okay, so this one would be second.

442
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:39,294
What do you guys think?

443
00:18:43,984 --> 00:18:46,092
Someone other than Ian?

444
00:18:46,432 --> 00:18:47,991
(mumbles)

445
00:18:47,991 --> 00:18:50,551
Okay Ian, go ahead.

446
00:18:50,551 --> 00:18:54,471
- Does atomic weight, atomic
mass directly influence--

447
00:18:54,471 --> 00:18:56,191
- [Teacher] Listen to this, Miles.

448
00:18:56,191 --> 00:18:58,591
- Does atomic mass
directly influence density?

449
00:18:58,591 --> 00:19:00,325
- [Teacher] That's the question.

450
00:19:02,555 --> 00:19:05,151
Does the formula mass have anything to do

451
00:19:05,151 --> 00:19:07,750
with the density of these solids?

452
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,381
They're all ionic compounds.

453
00:19:11,701 --> 00:19:14,262
And the answer to that is no.

454
00:19:14,262 --> 00:19:15,910
You cannot assume that because

455
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,944
this has the highest formula mass,

456
00:19:17,944 --> 00:19:21,351
that this is the most dense. Okay?

457
00:19:21,351 --> 00:19:23,630
Where, just to follow that up,

458
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:27,311
where could you use formula mass

459
00:19:27,311 --> 00:19:31,845
in relationship to density
in a pattern that works?

460
00:19:34,385 --> 00:19:36,791
- Ivan? Oh wait, let's give it to him.

461
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,264
Just, he's just walked in. Niresh?

462
00:19:38,264 --> 00:19:39,431
- Is it in gases?

463
00:19:39,431 --> 00:19:41,952
- [Teacher] Gases, right?
Does everybody agree?

464
00:19:41,952 --> 00:19:43,464
Gases, you could do that.

465
00:19:43,464 --> 00:19:45,664
If the formula mass is high on a gas,

466
00:19:45,664 --> 00:19:48,192
then it's going to have more density.

467
00:19:48,192 --> 00:19:50,780
Could you do that for liquids, now?

468
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,192
Could you do that for liquids?

469
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:55,474
Ivan?

470
00:19:55,474 --> 00:19:57,191
- You could do it if
it's all the same subsets

471
00:19:57,191 --> 00:19:59,960
for different concentrations.
