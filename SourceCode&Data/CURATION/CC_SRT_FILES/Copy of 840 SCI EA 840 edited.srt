1
00:00:00,017 --> 00:00:01,619
- Tell them what you wrote.

2
00:00:01,619 --> 00:00:03,697
Describe your three
pictures, and then they're

3
00:00:03,697 --> 00:00:06,333
going to share what they
saw, and the three pictures

4
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:07,616
they picked.

5
00:00:08,701 --> 00:00:11,947
- (background chatter)

6
00:00:13,206 --> 00:00:14,280
- The cat.

7
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:16,091
- I picked the roller coaster.

8
00:00:16,608 --> 00:00:17,624
- Man.

9
00:00:21,025 --> 00:00:23,290
- What did you get for what (inaudible)?

10
00:00:23,946 --> 00:00:25,102
- I only did two.

11
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:33,203
- (background chatter)

12
00:00:35,855 --> 00:00:37,056
- I think the Earth (inaudible).

13
00:00:37,056 --> 00:00:39,512
- (background chatter)

14
00:00:41,825 --> 00:00:43,747
- Y'all did the roller coaster?

15
00:00:46,655 --> 00:00:48,414
- [Instructor] Max, is that possible?

16
00:00:49,209 --> 00:00:50,877
Why not, what did you write?

17
00:00:50,877 --> 00:00:52,048
- [Max] There's no gravity.

18
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,003
- [Instructor] So, in that
picture he's weightless,

19
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:56,332
but where is he?

20
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:59,182
- [Max] In front of a building.

21
00:00:59,182 --> 00:01:00,645
- [Instructor] So, he's on a planet, right?

22
00:01:00,645 --> 00:01:01,179
- [Max] Yeah.

23
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:02,143
- [Instructor] So, what should happen,

24
00:01:02,143 --> 00:01:04,151
if this was a video and we
saw the next two seconds

25
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:05,344
of that video?

26
00:01:05,344 --> 00:01:05,957
- [Max] He's falling?

27
00:01:05,957 --> 00:01:07,323
- [Instructor] He should fall, right?

28
00:01:07,323 --> 00:01:09,494
All right, write that down
next to that picture.

29
00:01:09,494 --> 00:01:12,206
- (background chatter)

30
00:01:13,555 --> 00:01:14,365
- I don't mean to do that.

31
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,450
- [Instructor] All right, so let's
look at the roller coaster.

32
00:01:17,499 --> 00:01:19,571
- He couldn't even fall like that because

33
00:01:19,571 --> 00:01:22,129
you got the gravity pushing down,

34
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:23,870
so that's why why he
wouldn't fall like that.

35
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,670
And that's either like, strange stuff.

36
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,429
But I don't think he could fall like that.

37
00:01:28,607 --> 00:01:30,691
- Unless he... (inaudible).

38
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:32,043
- He can't fall like that.

39
00:01:32,043 --> 00:01:33,576
That's impossible. Get his weight,

40
00:01:33,576 --> 00:01:35,335
and (inaudible).

41
00:01:37,547 --> 00:01:39,538
Yeah, exactly, 'cause he can't do that.

42
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:43,131
Yeah, 'cause you can see
his shadow under that.

43
00:01:43,131 --> 00:01:45,592
And don't think he, I think he
got like a hoop or something.

44
00:01:45,592 --> 00:01:47,712
So, like a little string or something.

45
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:50,451
- Or like, he fall?

46
00:01:52,059 --> 00:01:52,999
- Yeah, 'cause he can't do that.

47
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:54,759
They must have took that while he was.

48
00:01:56,204 --> 00:01:57,597
'Cause that's impossible.

49
00:01:57,597 --> 00:01:59,554
Earth's gravity pulling him like that.

50
00:02:00,136 --> 00:02:01,642
Unless he in space or something.

51
00:02:01,642 --> 00:02:03,993
- (background chatter)

52
00:02:06,216 --> 00:02:07,964
- [Instructor] All right,
so why would he fall?

53
00:02:09,281 --> 00:02:11,185
- Because the force of gravity pushing down.

54
00:02:11,185 --> 00:02:13,055
- [Instructor] So, why
would he fall that way

55
00:02:13,055 --> 00:02:14,851
and not fall that way?

56
00:02:14,851 --> 00:02:17,893
- The gravity would push him down,

57
00:02:17,893 --> 00:02:20,140
and not up, so (inaudible).

58
00:02:20,517 --> 00:02:22,363
There's like, there's gravity on Earth,

59
00:02:22,363 --> 00:02:25,497
so like if you consider, like how Newton

60
00:02:25,497 --> 00:02:28,917
found the apple when it fell
to the ground.

61
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:30,499
- [Instructor] Okay, so
you know there's something

62
00:02:30,499 --> 00:02:32,327
going on that's pulling you down.

63
00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:34,539
And you say, "What if you were on the

64
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:35,410
"other side of the Earth?"

65
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,523
Would it be pulling you up then?

66
00:02:37,746 --> 00:02:39,581
If you were on the other side?

67
00:02:39,581 --> 00:02:42,002
Or, would it still pull
you down to the ground?

68
00:02:42,414 --> 00:02:44,515
- It would still pull you down 
to the ground.

69
00:02:44,515 --> 00:02:46,860
- [Instructor] All right, so
on the planet, what can we say

70
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,364
about gravity?

71
00:02:49,194 --> 00:02:50,622
Where is it trying to pull you?

72
00:02:50,622 --> 00:02:51,493
- To the center.

73
00:02:51,493 --> 00:02:52,793
- Ah, to the center, so
it doesn't matter where

74
00:02:52,793 --> 00:02:54,163
you stand, it's not pulling you down,

75
00:02:54,163 --> 00:02:55,765
it's just trying to pull you where?

76
00:02:55,765 --> 00:02:57,170
- To the center.

77
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,807
- To the center, okay.

78
00:02:58,807 --> 00:03:00,258
All right, one more minute for sharing.

79
00:03:00,258 --> 00:03:02,406
Make sure you have
three pictures described

80
00:03:02,406 --> 00:03:03,887
on your T-chart.

81
00:03:04,577 --> 00:03:06,806
If you need to borrow an
idea from your neighbor,

82
00:03:06,806 --> 00:03:07,979
do that now.

83
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,597
- (background chatter)

84
00:03:11,613 --> 00:03:12,646
And you got the Solar System?

85
00:03:12,646 --> 00:03:15,049
Okay so, it says planets can move

86
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:15,815
because of gravity.

87
00:03:15,815 --> 00:03:17,185
Where are they moving?

88
00:03:17,185 --> 00:03:19,676
- (background chatter)

89
00:03:19,853 --> 00:03:20,979
- [Instructor] (inaudible) around the sun.

90
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:22,651
And what has them go in a circle and not

91
00:03:22,651 --> 00:03:23,940
flying away?

92
00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:29,564
All right, who would like to share

93
00:03:29,564 --> 00:03:31,261
what they wrote with their group?

94
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:33,236
Their favorite one,
their favorite picture?

95
00:03:33,236 --> 00:03:35,671
All right, Arquel, which one
was your favorite picture?

96
00:03:35,671 --> 00:03:36,565
- [Arquel] The roller coaster.

97
00:03:36,565 --> 00:03:38,522
- Roller coaster, who
picked roller coaster?

98
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,924
All right, so let's all look
at the roller coaster.

99
00:03:42,115 --> 00:03:44,112
And Arquel, tell us what
your team wrote down

100
00:03:44,112 --> 00:03:46,069
and Sarah will add it to our list.

101
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:48,640
- [Arquel] We had put that

102
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,363
the gravity brings the speed to the...

103
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,959
to the roller coaster.

104
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,257
So, if you wanted to
make the speed increase,

105
00:03:55,257 --> 00:03:57,425
you would want to bring your hill higher.

106
00:03:57,425 --> 00:03:59,417
So, therefore the...

107
00:04:00,235 --> 00:04:02,527
the speed will increase
and it'll go faster.

108
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:05,139
- [Instructor] All right, so
Arquel says that gravity

109
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:07,206
makes roller coasters go faster?

110
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:08,808
So, if you want a faster roller coaster,

111
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:11,055
you need to build a higher roller coaster.

112
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:12,477
Did anybody write anything different

113
00:04:12,477 --> 00:04:14,172
for roller coaster?

114
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:15,826
Carlos, what did you write?

115
00:04:16,447 --> 00:04:17,341
- [Carlos] Oh, the same thing,

116
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,315
but the steepness of the
hill when it's going down

117
00:04:19,315 --> 00:04:22,200
it increases its velocity,
and it's more G's.

118
00:04:22,316 --> 00:04:24,951
- [Instructor] All right, so
he says the steeper the hill,

119
00:04:24,951 --> 00:04:26,020
more velocity, more G's.

120
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,547
What's a G?

121
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,289
Let's have Carlos try
first, then we can help

122
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:31,566
him out if he needs help.

123
00:04:31,566 --> 00:04:32,216
What's a G?

124
00:04:32,216 --> 00:04:33,296
You said G.

125
00:04:33,296 --> 00:04:34,475
- [Carlos] Yeah.

126
00:04:35,003 --> 00:04:36,837
A G is a pull.

127
00:04:36,837 --> 00:04:37,929
- Okay, so it's a pull.

128
00:04:37,929 --> 00:04:39,159
Adriana, you want to add to it?

129
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:41,365
- It's a force pushing against you.

130
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:42,967
- All right, pushing against you.

131
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:44,906
Anybody else want to add to that?

132
00:04:44,906 --> 00:04:47,611
It's a pull, its a force,
it's pushing against you.

133
00:04:47,611 --> 00:04:49,553
How do we get a G force?

134
00:04:52,554 --> 00:04:53,877
What do you think, Austin?

135
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:54,911
- [Austin] You have a push or pull,

136
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,349
you have excess friction, air accelerates.

137
00:04:57,349 --> 00:04:59,375
- Push or pull, excess friction.

138
00:04:59,787 --> 00:05:00,615
Arquel?

139
00:05:00,615 --> 00:05:02,318
- All the forces together.

140
00:05:02,318 --> 00:05:04,988
- All the forces put
together on you? Okay.

141
00:05:04,988 --> 00:05:06,767
So, let's write "G force"
down and put a question.

142
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:08,183
'Cause we're still not sure what that is,

143
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,884
maybe we can get there.

144
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:13,164
So, we're not sure quite what a G is.

145
00:05:13,164 --> 00:05:15,492
But we know it has something
to do with gravity.

146
00:05:15,974 --> 00:05:17,861
All right, let's pick another picture.

147
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,340
Who had a favorite picture that we haven't

148
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,355
talked about that wasn't a roller coaster?

149
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,915
What was your favorite picture, Greg?

150
00:05:23,915 --> 00:05:24,681
- [Greg] The dude.

151
00:05:24,681 --> 00:05:26,550
- The dude, who is the dude?

152
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,118
- (laughing)

153
00:05:28,118 --> 00:05:29,116
- He has a name.

154
00:05:29,116 --> 00:05:30,666
We know who that is.

155
00:05:31,183 --> 00:05:32,251
Who is that, Enrique?

156
00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:33,725
- [Enrique] Johnson.

157
00:05:33,725 --> 00:05:34,956
- [Instructor] It was Newton, right?

158
00:05:34,956 --> 00:05:36,163
What was Newton's first name?

159
00:05:36,163 --> 00:05:37,092
Not John.

160
00:05:37,092 --> 00:05:37,766
- [Students] Isaac?

161
00:05:37,766 --> 00:05:39,031
- [Instructor] Issac, there we go.

162
00:05:39,031 --> 00:05:40,424
Issac Newton, all right.

163
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:42,235
And what does the dude say?

164
00:05:42,235 --> 00:05:43,716
Isaac Newton?

165
00:05:44,871 --> 00:05:46,247
What's he saying?

166
00:05:47,065 --> 00:05:48,685
What's his quote?

167
00:05:48,841 --> 00:05:50,821
- [Greg] Not that dude, this one.

168
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:52,406
- Oh, the floating dude.

169
00:05:52,406 --> 00:05:53,741
Okay, the floating dude.

170
00:05:53,741 --> 00:05:55,076
He'd rather talk about the floating dude

171
00:05:55,076 --> 00:05:56,516
above Isaac Newton.

172
00:05:56,516 --> 00:05:58,780
Okay, so let's look at the guy floating

173
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,615
in the middle of the air.

174
00:05:59,615 --> 00:06:01,415
He looks like he's planking.

175
00:06:01,415 --> 00:06:04,782
Is this a possible picture
if you just saw the picture?

176
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:07,185
- [Students] No.
- Greg, why do you say this is impossible?

177
00:06:07,185 --> 00:06:10,605
Because the Earth's
gravitational pull, right?

178
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:13,698
- Okay, so he says the Earth's
gravitational pull, what?

179
00:06:13,698 --> 00:06:15,533
- Like, this wouldn't work because

180
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:19,881
when you pull... (inaudible).

181
00:06:20,641 --> 00:06:22,577
- Okay, he should be being pulled down to

182
00:06:22,577 --> 00:06:23,506
the center of the Earth.

183
00:06:23,506 --> 00:06:25,219
Why do you say the center?

184
00:06:25,944 --> 00:06:28,335
- 'Cause that's where
the gravitational pull's

185
00:06:28,335 --> 00:06:29,148
coming from.

186
00:06:29,148 --> 00:06:30,646
- 'Cause that's where
all the gravity wants

187
00:06:30,646 --> 00:06:31,876
to take you and that's
where all the gravity's

188
00:06:31,876 --> 00:06:32,968
coming from, I like that answer.

189
00:06:32,968 --> 00:06:33,920
Anybody want to add to it?

190
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,883
Vanessa.

191
00:06:34,883 --> 00:06:36,149
- [Vanessa] But if you
have pressure against both forces,

192
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:38,587
you could possibly stay up longer?

193
00:06:38,587 --> 00:06:40,479
- Okay, so how could you get pressure

194
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:41,521
to make you stay up longer? Chloe?

195
00:06:41,521 --> 00:06:42,427
- [Chloe] Force?

196
00:06:42,427 --> 00:06:44,337
- [Instructor] Where would
that force come from?

197
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,216
- Your body?

198
00:06:47,268 --> 00:06:48,696
- [Instructor] So, how
could he, if he's not

199
00:06:48,696 --> 00:06:51,222
touching the ground, make himself float?

200
00:06:54,698 --> 00:06:56,777
What's underneath you that you don't see?

201
00:06:56,777 --> 00:06:58,060
- [Chloe] Gravity?

202
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,180
- Well, we don't see gravity, but what's

203
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,695
underneath him?

204
00:07:01,572 --> 00:07:02,814
It's around us right now.

205
00:07:02,814 --> 00:07:03,780
- [Students] Air?

206
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,487
- The air, right?

207
00:07:05,487 --> 00:07:07,060
So, let's think about the air.

208
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:10,015
If we could make the air thicker,

209
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:11,902
what would we also increase?

210
00:07:13,742 --> 00:07:15,077
- [Student] The gravity?
- [Instructor] Not the gravity, we're trying 

211
00:07:15,077 --> 00:07:16,528
to go against the force of gravity.

212
00:07:16,528 --> 00:07:18,577
- [Student] The weight?
The force against our weight.

213
00:07:18,931 --> 00:07:21,149
What's that called,
let's think about a boat.

214
00:07:21,665 --> 00:07:23,378
Floating in the water.

215
00:07:23,465 --> 00:07:24,486
- [Student] Bouyance?
Bouyant force, right?

216
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:27,208
So, if you could increase the
bouyant force of the air,

217
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:30,169
and Vanessa said if you could
make that strong enough,

218
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:31,875
you should be able to float.

219
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,268
Does anyone know a planet where there's

220
00:07:33,268 --> 00:07:36,200
more thick clouds than we have here?

221
00:07:37,947 --> 00:07:39,196
It's our neighbor.

222
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:40,873
- [Students] Mars.

223
00:07:40,873 --> 00:07:42,487
- He has clouds?

224
00:07:42,487 --> 00:07:44,217
Who has clouds, who has thick clouds?

225
00:07:44,217 --> 00:07:45,668
Jarissa?

226
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:46,718
- Venus?

227
00:07:46,718 --> 00:07:47,891
- Venus.

228
00:07:47,891 --> 00:07:49,261
Yeah, is that what you were going to say?

229
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:51,861
Venus has super thick clouds, right?

230
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:53,696
And if we could go there,

231
00:07:53,696 --> 00:07:56,099
maybe there'd be
enough air underneath you,

232
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:58,009
that you could float in the air.

233
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,698
If they was pushing enough bouyant force

234
00:07:59,698 --> 00:08:01,620
on your body, okay?

235
00:08:02,032 --> 00:08:04,005
All right, anymore for the floating guy?

236
00:08:04,005 --> 00:08:05,909
Did anybody write anything different

237
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:08,191
for the guy who looked like
he was floating in the air?

238
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,936
I know that Karima and
Anthony had a good answer.

239
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:15,339
What did you guys write down Anthony?

240
00:08:15,623 --> 00:08:19,930
- Put that...

241
00:08:21,092 --> 00:08:25,991
I put that the gravity
will pull you to the center

242
00:08:25,991 --> 00:08:28,017
of the Earth, and it will like...

243
00:08:30,298 --> 00:08:32,046
Like it would...

244
00:08:32,597 --> 00:08:33,793
- [Instructor] It pulls you
to the center of the Earth,

245
00:08:33,793 --> 00:08:35,558
and what did we decide about where you

246
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:37,120
stand on Earth?

247
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,442
- Like on the other side?

248
00:08:40,442 --> 00:08:41,371
- [Instructor] So, what would happen if you

249
00:08:41,371 --> 00:08:43,205
went to the other side of the Earth?

250
00:08:43,205 --> 00:08:45,951
Would it still pull you the same way?

251
00:08:46,143 --> 00:08:48,668
Or is it going to pull
you an opposite way?

252
00:08:49,219 --> 00:08:50,055
- The same way.

253
00:08:50,055 --> 00:08:51,181
- [Instructor] The same way,
where is it always going

254
00:08:51,181 --> 00:08:51,948
to pull you?

255
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:52,800
- Down.

256
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,943
- [Student] Towards the center?

257
00:08:54,523 --> 00:08:55,878
- [Instructor] To the
center, to the middle, okay?

258
00:08:55,878 --> 00:08:57,155
It doesn't matter what
planet you stand on,

259
00:08:57,155 --> 00:08:58,455
doesn't matter where
you are, it's trying to

260
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,626
take you to the center
of the object, okay?

261
00:09:00,626 --> 00:09:02,798
So, why do we get stuck to the Earth,

262
00:09:02,798 --> 00:09:05,569
and that the Earth's stuck
to us in this picture?

263
00:09:05,569 --> 00:09:08,649
- 'Cause the Earth's solid and

264
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:13,069
it doesn't let us go out into the (inaudible).

265
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:14,671
- Okay, so he said the Earth is solid.

266
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:16,047
Are we solid?
- [Students] Yes.

267
00:09:16,749 --> 00:09:19,582
Hmm, okay, so maybe it's
not that we're solid,

268
00:09:19,582 --> 00:09:21,579
'cause maybe there's
something else going on.

269
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:23,251
What do you think, Carlos?

270
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:25,011
- [Carlos] The Earth
has more mass than us.

271
00:09:25,011 --> 00:09:27,027
- [Instructor] The Earth
has more mass than us.

272
00:09:27,027 --> 00:09:28,577
Jenny, what's mass?

273
00:09:30,254 --> 00:09:33,900
- [Jenny] Mass is, well, all of us then?

274
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,130
- [Instructor] We all have it.

275
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,535
How would you give a definition of mass,

276
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:38,238
what is it about us?

277
00:09:38,238 --> 00:09:39,736
- [Jenny] The type of weight?

278
00:09:39,736 --> 00:09:40,839
- [Instructor] It's the type of weight.

279
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:41,930
Okay, we're on the right track.

280
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:42,836
Who wants to help her out?

281
00:09:42,836 --> 00:09:43,811
What's mass?

282
00:09:43,811 --> 00:09:45,471
- [Student] The amount of density?

283
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,981
- [Instructor] Amount of density.

284
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:48,366
Okay, we're getting better.

285
00:09:49,114 --> 00:09:49,881
Jarissa?

286
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,843
- The amount of space that it takes.

287
00:09:51,843 --> 00:09:53,974
- [Instructor] Well, what would
that be, what's your space?

288
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,082
Volume, okay?

289
00:09:55,082 --> 00:09:57,223
So, space is volume. We're
still trying to figure out

290
00:09:57,223 --> 00:09:58,141
what's mass?

291
00:09:58,141 --> 00:09:59,685
We've heard some density
words, we've heard

292
00:09:59,685 --> 00:10:01,658
volume words, what do you think, Ky?

293
00:10:01,658 --> 00:10:04,189
- The amount of electrons?

294
00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:05,350
- [Instructor] Oh, we're getting closer.

295
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,334
So, it's your electrons, your...?
- [Student] Atoms?

296
00:10:08,334 --> 00:10:09,925
- [Instructor] Ah, your atoms.

297
00:10:09,925 --> 00:10:12,258
So, it's how many atoms
you have inside your body.

298
00:10:12,258 --> 00:10:13,338
That's your mass.

299
00:10:13,338 --> 00:10:14,534
So, now someone else said weight,

300
00:10:14,534 --> 00:10:15,532
so let's go back to that.

301
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,272
How do you get weight?

302
00:10:17,272 --> 00:10:18,824
So, you stand on the scale.

303
00:10:18,968 --> 00:10:20,106
How do you know your weight?

304
00:10:20,106 --> 00:10:21,761
What is going on?

305
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:23,949
What do you think Hakeem?

306
00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:24,611
- [Hakeem] Pounds?

307
00:10:24,611 --> 00:10:26,266
- [Instructor] We measure it in pounds?

308
00:10:26,503 --> 00:10:27,745
Okay, so how do me measure it?

309
00:10:27,745 --> 00:10:29,290
How do you get pounds?

310
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,124
What's happening to your mass?

311
00:10:33,644 --> 00:10:35,822
What happens when you stand on the scale?

312
00:10:35,822 --> 00:10:37,065
What is it measuring?

313
00:10:37,065 --> 00:10:38,086
- [Students] Your weight.

314
00:10:38,086 --> 00:10:38,992
- [Instructor] Your weight.

315
00:10:38,992 --> 00:10:41,181
So, then how do we figure that out?

316
00:10:41,302 --> 00:10:42,034
What's going on?

317
00:10:42,034 --> 00:10:44,455
What's going on on a scale?

318
00:10:45,064 --> 00:10:45,795
Carlos.

319
00:10:45,795 --> 00:10:47,537
- [Carlos] The gravity
is pushing you down?

320
00:10:47,537 --> 00:10:49,209
- [Instructor] Gravity
is pushing you down.

321
00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:52,454
So, what happens to your
weight, if you have more mass?

322
00:10:52,738 --> 00:10:53,539
- [Student] You're heavier?

323
00:10:53,539 --> 00:10:54,607
- You're heavier.

324
00:10:54,607 --> 00:10:57,011
So, your weight, how would
we give a description

325
00:10:57,011 --> 00:10:57,881
of weight now?

326
00:10:57,881 --> 00:11:00,807
We know mass is how many atoms you have.

327
00:11:00,807 --> 00:11:03,919
We know volume is how
much space you take up.

328
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,736
So, now what's weight?

329
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,226
Carlos has kind of said it for us.

330
00:11:08,226 --> 00:11:10,008
How would we put it as a definition?

331
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:14,228
It's the pull of what on your mass?

332
00:11:14,228 --> 00:11:14,762
- [Students] Gravity?

333
00:11:14,762 --> 00:11:15,668
- Pull of gravity.

334
00:11:15,668 --> 00:11:18,054
So, let's look at the guy
in the picture again.

335
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:21,368
If this was going to be true,

336
00:11:21,368 --> 00:11:23,969
what would we have to say about his mass

337
00:11:23,969 --> 00:11:25,107
to be able to float?

338
00:11:25,107 --> 00:11:28,561
Would he be allowed to
have a mass on Earth?

339
00:11:29,635 --> 00:11:32,265
Hakeem says "no," Vanessa says "yes."

340
00:11:32,781 --> 00:11:35,718
If you're going to float,
and there's gravity,

341
00:11:35,718 --> 00:11:37,695
always trying to pull you down,

342
00:11:38,548 --> 00:11:40,435
in order to float, what do we have to do?

343
00:11:40,592 --> 00:11:42,003
With our mass?

344
00:11:42,054 --> 00:11:44,226
Decrease our mass, okay?

345
00:11:44,226 --> 00:11:46,164
So, let's think about if
we go to another planet

346
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,558
with our weight.

347
00:11:47,558 --> 00:11:50,064
Does your mass change if 
you go to another planet?

348
00:11:50,065 --> 00:11:52,399
- [Students] Yes, no.
- Do all of a sudden, you have more atoms in you?

349
00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:54,852
- [Students] No.
- [Student] Depending on the gravity.

350
00:11:55,031 --> 00:11:56,169
- What did you say?

351
00:11:56,169 --> 00:11:57,562
- [Student] You have the same atoms, but

352
00:11:57,562 --> 00:11:59,710
your weight and mass changes.

353
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,031
- You said the same
amount of atoms, so your

354
00:12:01,031 --> 00:12:03,307
weight and mass changes.

355
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:04,839
But if you have the same amount of atoms,

356
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:06,244
isn't your mass the same?

357
00:12:06,244 --> 00:12:07,518
- [Student] Yeah.

358
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,869
- Okay, so what's the only
thing that would change, Jarissa?

359
00:12:10,353 --> 00:12:11,340
- [Jarissa] The gravity.

360
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,753
- The gravity, so then
what would that change

361
00:12:12,753 --> 00:12:14,593
about your weight?

362
00:12:15,353 --> 00:12:17,054
Would it change, or
would it stay the same?

363
00:12:17,054 --> 00:12:17,692
- [Student] It would change.

364
00:12:17,692 --> 00:12:18,691
- [Instructor] It will change.

365
00:12:18,691 --> 00:12:21,222
So, what can we say if we
went to a smaller planet?

366
00:12:21,222 --> 00:12:21,988
- [Student] You'll become lighter.

367
00:12:21,988 --> 00:12:22,960
- [Student] You'll become lighter.

368
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,901
Why?

369
00:12:23,901 --> 00:12:25,770
- [Student] Because it has less gravity.

370
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,999
- Has less gravity, so less pull.

371
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:29,944
You weight less, okay?

372
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:34,106
So, let's put "weightless"
next to "G force" as

373
00:12:34,106 --> 00:12:44,958
another word we should look up.

374
00:12:46,088 --> 00:12:46,976
Ready?

375
00:12:49,524 --> 00:12:51,486
All right, so, what I want you to do now,

376
00:12:51,486 --> 00:12:53,193
using all your notes that we just took

377
00:12:53,193 --> 00:12:54,783
and what we just talked about,

378
00:12:54,783 --> 00:12:57,112
I want you to flip your paper over.

379
00:12:57,338 --> 00:12:59,938
And in the circle, I would like you to try

380
00:12:59,938 --> 00:13:02,365
with your partner, to write a definition

381
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,088
for what you think gravity is.

382
00:13:05,232 --> 00:13:06,579
I'll give you one minute.

383
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:07,775
You and your partner try to figure out

384
00:13:07,775 --> 00:13:10,979
what you think the
definition of gravity is,

385
00:13:10,979 --> 00:13:12,855
and write that in your circle back.

386
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:23,139
- (background chatter)

387
00:13:25,561 --> 00:13:26,990
Make sure you guys share that, okay?

388
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,144
- (background chatter)

389
00:13:32,736 --> 00:13:34,519
A lot of weight, or...

390
00:13:35,534 --> 00:13:37,845
What's the other word of
how many atoms you have?

391
00:13:37,845 --> 00:13:39,430
What's it pulling on?

392
00:13:39,502 --> 00:13:42,225
Very good, so it pulls on your mass.

393
00:13:45,017 --> 00:13:47,171
And think about where it's trying to pull.

394
00:13:50,892 --> 00:13:52,424
Oh, that's a good definition.

395
00:13:52,424 --> 00:13:55,205
- (background chatter)

396
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:01,526
30 seconds, start putting in your description

397
00:14:01,526 --> 00:14:03,361
of gravity, try to write your definition

398
00:14:03,361 --> 00:14:04,661
on your paper.

399
00:14:04,661 --> 00:14:07,122
Make sure your neighbor
also has a definition

400
00:14:07,122 --> 00:14:08,237
on their paper.

401
00:14:08,237 --> 00:14:14,960
- (background chatter)

402
00:14:16,979 --> 00:14:18,332
Pulls what?

403
00:14:18,512 --> 00:14:19,679
Pulls the...

404
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:20,962
- [Student] Weight?

405
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,005
- [Instructor] You almost said it.

406
00:14:23,347 --> 00:14:24,793
- [Student] Mass?

407
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:26,802
- [Instructor] Mass. 
Make sure you guys share that, okay?

408
00:14:28,061 --> 00:14:29,435
You guys done?

409
00:14:30,696 --> 00:14:32,191
Okay, so what is gravity?

410
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,310
It's a force, so that means it's a what?

411
00:14:36,301 --> 00:14:37,515
- [Student] A...

412
00:14:37,903 --> 00:14:39,314
- [Instructor] A short pull?

413
00:14:40,888 --> 00:14:42,585
Gravity's pulling us, right?

414
00:14:42,974 --> 00:14:44,454
Okay, so what's,

415
00:14:45,098 --> 00:14:47,322
so what do you think, is
it pushing or pulling?

416
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:48,959
- [Student] Pushing.
- [Student] Pulling.

417
00:14:48,976 --> 00:14:50,044
- [Instructor] Ooh, we have a disagreement.

418
00:14:50,044 --> 00:14:51,879
Better figure out which ones right.

419
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:54,323
- (background chatter)

420
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,314
Okay, so it's a pull.
So, where is it trying to take you to?

421
00:14:56,314 --> 00:14:58,027
- (background chatter)

422
00:14:58,955 --> 00:15:00,633
And what is it trying to take about?

423
00:15:01,184 --> 00:15:02,375
Your...

424
00:15:03,228 --> 00:15:04,546
Your definition.

425
00:15:05,793 --> 00:15:07,471
All right, what are you having?

426
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:11,169
- I wrote that gravity
is an invisible force

427
00:15:11,169 --> 00:15:13,735
that pushes or pulls
you towards the center.

428
00:15:13,735 --> 00:15:14,768
- [Instructor] Okay, so
the word I want you to

429
00:15:14,768 --> 00:15:16,637
make sure we say is "invisible."

430
00:15:16,637 --> 00:15:18,153
'Cause we'll talk about that, okay?

431
00:15:18,611 --> 00:15:21,211
All right, so let's share our definitions.

432
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,598
Who would like to share
their definition first?

433
00:15:23,975 --> 00:15:25,362
All right, Ky.

434
00:15:25,751 --> 00:15:28,212
- [Ky] We put gravity is a force
that always brings you

435
00:15:28,212 --> 00:15:29,246
to the middle.

436
00:15:29,246 --> 00:15:30,418
- [Instructor] All right,
Gravity is a force that

437
00:15:30,418 --> 00:15:32,020
always brings you to the middle.

438
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,070
So Sarah, can you add that to the circle?

439
00:15:34,122 --> 00:15:36,130
Arquel, what did you guys write?

440
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,628
- [Arquel] Gravity is a pulling force that

441
00:15:37,628 --> 00:15:40,414
brings you to the center of the Earth,

442
00:15:40,414 --> 00:15:43,862
and it wants to (inaudible) the mass.

443
00:15:43,862 --> 00:15:45,697
- [Instructor] Okay, so
you added "mass" to that.

444
00:15:45,697 --> 00:15:47,938
Okay, so it's pulling on mass.

445
00:15:47,938 --> 00:15:48,936
What do you want to add Angel?

446
00:15:48,936 --> 00:15:51,641
- I want to add to Kyle's
answer that it's invisible.

447
00:15:51,641 --> 00:15:52,477
- [Instructor] Invisible.

448
00:15:52,477 --> 00:15:54,596
So, let's think about what
we learned about forces.

449
00:15:54,741 --> 00:15:57,824
If it's invisible, you can't see it.

450
00:15:57,911 --> 00:15:59,246
Is it touching you?

451
00:15:59,246 --> 00:15:59,815
- [Students] Yes.

452
00:15:59,815 --> 00:16:01,010
- Or is it everywhere?

453
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,409
- [Students] It's everywhere.

454
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:03,774
- Everywhere.

455
00:16:03,954 --> 00:16:07,228
So, is it a contact force,
or a non-contact force?

456
00:16:07,228 --> 00:16:08,354
- [Students] Non-contact.

457
00:16:08,354 --> 00:16:09,829
- Why do you say that, Israel?

458
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:11,257
- [Israel] Because it's not touching you.

459
00:16:11,257 --> 00:16:12,220
- It's not touching you.

460
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,031
So, even if you're floating in outer space,

461
00:16:14,031 --> 00:16:15,738
will gravity still be there?

462
00:16:15,738 --> 00:16:17,045
- [Student] Yes.

463
00:16:17,062 --> 00:16:18,647
- What do you think, Carlos?

464
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:20,069
- [Carlos] Yes.
You say "yes."

465
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:22,634
So, those astronauts, will
they still feel some gravity?

466
00:16:22,634 --> 00:16:24,684
Even though they're out
at the space station?

467
00:16:25,676 --> 00:16:27,192
What do you think, Angel?

468
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:29,240
- Outer space has some
gravity, but greater

469
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,731
than, that's why they wouldn't feel it.

470
00:16:32,514 --> 00:16:33,850
- What do you think it depends on?

471
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,649
We have mass so far.

472
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:39,051
But the strength of
gravity also depends on

473
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:39,759
something else.

474
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,675
We have mass, but what could it also

475
00:16:41,675 --> 00:16:43,056
depend on, Vanessa?

476
00:16:43,056 --> 00:16:43,997
- [Vanessa] Force?

477
00:16:43,997 --> 00:16:46,116
- Okay, gravity is a force.

478
00:16:46,493 --> 00:16:49,198
Angel was getting there,
he was saying that

479
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:52,211
it's still pulling on you,
it's just not as strong.

480
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:53,874
- [Student] The weight?

481
00:16:53,874 --> 00:16:55,285
- That's mass.

482
00:16:55,336 --> 00:16:57,031
We talked about mass and weight.

483
00:16:57,031 --> 00:16:58,309
Trying to get the other thing that's

484
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,441
going to control gravity.

485
00:17:00,441 --> 00:17:02,276
- [Student] How big the planet is?

486
00:17:02,276 --> 00:17:04,023
- Okay, so that's mass.

487
00:17:04,876 --> 00:17:06,072
Let's think about the astronauts who are

488
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:07,686
not as close to the Earth.

489
00:17:07,686 --> 00:17:08,670
Are they weightless?

490
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,585
They have the same amount of mass,

491
00:17:10,585 --> 00:17:12,240
their mass didn't change.

492
00:17:12,826 --> 00:17:15,252
But they went farther away from the Earth.

493
00:17:15,252 --> 00:17:16,529
So, why are they weightless?

494
00:17:16,529 --> 00:17:17,906
Why do they float?

495
00:17:17,992 --> 00:17:20,930
What's the other factor
going on with gravity?

496
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,326
Moving away from the center of the Earth.

497
00:17:24,326 --> 00:17:30,713
So, what do we call that?

498
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,078
Has to do with how the gravitational pull

499
00:17:34,078 --> 00:17:36,000
depends on...

500
00:17:36,644 --> 00:17:39,140
We have mass, and we're
looking for the other factor

501
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,097
we could change to change gravity.

502
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,319
What do you guys think?

503
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:46,512
If I'm really far away
from Jarissa, am I able to

504
00:17:46,512 --> 00:17:47,789
grab her

505
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:49,932
as much as if I was closer?

506
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:51,847
- [Students] No.

507
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:53,722
- If I go real close to
her, is it easier for me

508
00:17:53,722 --> 00:17:54,732
to pull on her?

509
00:17:54,732 --> 00:17:55,963
- [Students] Yes.

510
00:17:55,963 --> 00:17:58,203
- But what happens if I go far away?

511
00:17:58,203 --> 00:18:00,923
I have the same mass,
my mass doesn't change,

512
00:18:01,764 --> 00:18:03,436
can I reach her as easily now?

513
00:18:03,436 --> 00:18:04,377
- [Students] No.

514
00:18:04,377 --> 00:18:06,780
- So, what's the other thing
going on with gravity?

515
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,836
- [Student] Distance?

516
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,329
- Distance.

517
00:18:09,543 --> 00:18:12,283
So, if you're far away from the Earth,

518
00:18:12,283 --> 00:18:14,454
can gravity pull on you as hard?

519
00:18:14,454 --> 00:18:15,081
- [Students] No.

520
00:18:15,081 --> 00:18:16,019
- No.

521
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:17,484
But the closer you get,

522
00:18:17,484 --> 00:18:19,966
the little bit stronger,
little bit stronger.

523
00:18:20,378 --> 00:18:22,456
So, then why do we feel the pull

524
00:18:22,456 --> 00:18:24,221
of gravity here on Earth, but I don't feel

525
00:18:24,221 --> 00:18:25,574
the Sun?

526
00:18:26,462 --> 00:18:28,546
- (background chatter)

527
00:18:28,586 --> 00:18:30,560
We're closer to the Earth
than we are the Sun.

528
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,632
So, we're going to feel the Earth before

529
00:18:32,632 --> 00:18:33,933
we would feel the Sun.

530
00:18:33,933 --> 00:18:35,338
But now if we left the planet, we started

531
00:18:35,338 --> 00:18:38,745
going somewhere else,
say I was going to Mars.

532
00:18:38,971 --> 00:18:40,434
What would happen the
closer I got to Mars?

533
00:18:40,434 --> 00:18:41,839
Who would start pulling me now?

534
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:42,907
- [Students] Mars.

535
00:18:42,907 --> 00:18:45,735
- The Mars center of its
planet would start to pull me.

536
00:18:46,216 --> 00:18:46,843
Okay?

537
00:18:46,843 --> 00:18:48,939
So let's look at the
picture of the planets.

538
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:51,536
Thinking about pulling to the center,

539
00:18:52,285 --> 00:18:54,723
why in the picture of
the planets is the Sun

540
00:18:54,723 --> 00:18:56,487
in the middle of all the planets?

541
00:18:56,487 --> 00:18:58,595
- [Student] Because it's the biggest.

542
00:18:59,262 --> 00:19:00,417
- [Student] Oh, it's the biggest one.

543
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:01,758
- We got a couple of different answers, so

544
00:19:01,758 --> 00:19:03,819
let's share with our neighbor first.

545
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,790
See if you know why the
sun is in the center.

546
00:19:08,028 --> 00:19:09,462
You got 30 seconds.

547
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,390
- It's got the biggest mass.

548
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,043
- It got the biggest mass,
and it's the biggest.

549
00:19:16,043 --> 00:19:18,180
So like, it got the
most gravitational pull.

550
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,445
That's why it's in the middle.

551
00:19:19,445 --> 00:19:22,796
- (background chatter)

552
00:19:24,252 --> 00:19:25,906
- [Instructor] All right, Marco.

553
00:19:27,085 --> 00:19:28,896
Why do you think the Sun is in the center

554
00:19:28,896 --> 00:19:30,289
of our solar system?

555
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:32,013
- Because... I don't know.

556
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:33,493
- [Instructor] You don't know.

557
00:19:33,493 --> 00:19:34,735
Okay, Javier, what do you think?

558
00:19:34,735 --> 00:19:36,628
You're his partner, what
did you guys talk about?

559
00:19:37,018 --> 00:19:38,323
Based on what we just talked about,

560
00:19:38,323 --> 00:19:40,547
why would the Sun go in the center?

561
00:19:42,235 --> 00:19:43,106
- It has more mass?

562
00:19:43,106 --> 00:19:44,552
- [Instructor] It has more mass.

563
00:19:44,825 --> 00:19:46,630
So, what does it also have more?

564
00:19:47,112 --> 00:19:48,465
- [Student] Gravity.

565
00:19:48,946 --> 00:19:51,390
So, he's always going to
be in the middle, right?

566
00:19:52,139 --> 00:19:56,086
What if we had a bigger star come our way?

567
00:19:56,086 --> 00:19:57,224
Like what about a black hole?

568
00:19:57,224 --> 00:19:59,616
Say one of our neighbors blew up.

569
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:00,128
One of our...
