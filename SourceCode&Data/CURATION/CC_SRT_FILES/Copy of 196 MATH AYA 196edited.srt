1
00:00:00,233 --> 00:00:18,054
(background chatter)

2
00:00:18,054 --> 00:00:22,930
- Think out loud, what are we doing?

3
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,251
- OK, you know the area
of the square is 196

4
00:00:25,251 --> 00:00:27,248
so you want to

5
00:00:27,248 --> 00:00:31,892
(background chatter)

6
00:00:31,892 --> 00:00:35,076
- How do we do that?

7
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:37,942
- Take 196, divide it by four.

8
00:00:37,942 --> 00:00:41,582
(background chatter)

9
00:00:41,582 --> 00:00:42,951
- Hold on, let me hear from somebody

10
00:00:42,951 --> 00:00:48,053
that I haven't heard from.

11
00:00:48,053 --> 00:00:50,165
- Need to find the square root of 196.

12
00:00:50,165 --> 00:00:52,033
- OK, why are we taking the square root

13
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:54,710
instead of dividing by four?

14
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,356
- Because all sides are equal?

15
00:00:58,356 --> 00:00:59,516
- Well, if all sides were equal,

16
00:00:59,516 --> 00:01:02,058
that's why we would divide by four.

17
00:01:02,058 --> 00:01:13,308
(background chatter)

18
00:01:13,308 --> 00:01:17,871
- Because to find the area of the square

19
00:01:17,871 --> 00:01:20,296
you have to square it.

20
00:01:20,296 --> 00:01:22,828
- So the opposite of
squaring is square root.

21
00:01:22,828 --> 00:01:29,839
- So, we would divide by
four if we were given the...

22
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,138
perimeter.

23
00:01:31,138 --> 00:01:32,475
If we were given the
perimeter of the square

24
00:01:32,475 --> 00:01:33,380
we would divide by four.

25
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,060
But we were given the area,
so we need to square root.

26
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,685
- [Several] 14.

27
00:01:38,685 --> 00:01:41,351
- OK, so the side lengths are 14.

28
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:44,736
- Multiply times 4.

29
00:01:44,746 --> 00:01:53,605
- It's 56.

30
00:01:53,605 --> 00:01:56,520
- Anybody see a problem with this?

31
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,739
(background chatter)

32
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:07,328
OK, so this side is on
the inside of the figure.

33
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:11,192
So it doesn't count, so
instead of doing 14 times 4,

34
00:02:11,192 --> 00:02:22,188
- [Several] We do 14 times 3.

35
00:02:22,188 --> 00:02:26,920
(background chatter)

36
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,402
- How do we find the
perimeter of a semi-circle?

37
00:02:30,402 --> 00:02:35,301
(background chatter)

38
00:02:35,301 --> 00:02:37,693
- 2 pi R divided by 2 .

39
00:02:37,693 --> 00:02:40,142
- 2 pi R divided by 2?

40
00:02:40,142 --> 00:02:52,188
(background chatter)

41
00:02:52,188 --> 00:02:54,661
- How do you find the
perimeter of a semi-circle?

42
00:02:54,661 --> 00:03:04,817
- 2 pi R divided by 2.

43
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:08,433
- So the radius, that means 7, 7 is 14.

44
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:14,967
2 times pi times 7.

45
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:19,436
So that should be 2 times 3.14...

46
00:03:19,436 --> 00:03:24,436
(background chatter)

47
00:03:29,513 --> 00:03:32,927
So the whole thing is 53.38.

48
00:03:32,927 --> 00:03:48,367
(background chatter)

49
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:50,608
- So then, 2 pi R divided by 2?

50
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:53,173
- I got 2 times pi times 7 divided by two

51
00:03:53,173 --> 00:03:54,776
cause the radius is only 7

52
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,828
cause that line was supposed to be 14.

53
00:03:57,828 --> 00:04:00,986
So 14 divided by 2 is 7.

54
00:04:00,986 --> 00:04:11,736
(background chatter)

55
00:04:11,736 --> 00:04:14,661
- Here, Skye, can you take this?

56
00:04:14,661 --> 00:04:18,702
Thank you.

57
00:04:18,702 --> 00:04:20,128
Put the final answer on there

58
00:04:20,128 --> 00:04:23,960
and then quick to the next problem.

59
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:38,344
(background chatter)

60
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:54,940
- C squared.

61
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,602
- OK, all of the line
segments in the diagram

62
00:04:58,602 --> 00:05:00,539
of the bathroom floor shown below

63
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:02,792
are either vertical or horizontal.

64
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:05,533
How many one inch square
tiles would it take

65
00:05:05,533 --> 00:05:10,478
to cover the figure?

66
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:15,535
(background chatter)

67
00:05:15,535 --> 00:05:25,146
- Don't you got to work
it into two rectangles?

68
00:05:25,146 --> 00:05:28,662
- I think it'd be easier
of you did it the long way.

69
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:44,253
(background chatter)

70
00:05:44,253 --> 00:05:46,355
- Does it matter which way you split it?

71
00:05:46,355 --> 00:05:56,233
(background chatter)

72
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:59,844
Either way you're going to
have to split something, right?

73
00:05:59,844 --> 00:06:06,659
(background chatter)

74
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:16,956
You can determine either
of the missing sides.

75
00:06:16,956 --> 00:06:19,116
- In order to find the area of a rectangle

76
00:06:19,116 --> 00:06:37,480
you must apply (inaudible).

77
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,377
7 times 6 is 42.

78
00:06:41,377 --> 00:06:44,266
- Where is...I don't
see a 7 in my problem.

79
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:48,424
(background chatter)

80
00:06:48,424 --> 00:06:50,304
OK, but what does 7 represent?

81
00:06:50,304 --> 00:06:51,639
I don't see a 7, what is...?

82
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,601
- It represents the length of this.

83
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:54,831
- What length?

84
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,782
- From the line on down to 6.

85
00:06:56,782 --> 00:06:58,302
- OK.

86
00:06:58,302 --> 00:06:59,742
Could you label that with a 7?

87
00:06:59,742 --> 00:07:07,787
Cause I still don't see 7.

88
00:07:07,787 --> 00:07:31,818
(background chatter)

89
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:36,164
- It said, how many one
inch squares (inaudible).

90
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,532
- OK, so you want to multiply what by 12?

91
00:07:38,532 --> 00:07:39,786
- 87.

92
00:07:39,786 --> 00:07:41,203
- 87 times 12?

93
00:07:41,203 --> 00:07:43,012
- [Several] Why?

94
00:07:43,012 --> 00:07:47,865
- But you made the 12 into a 7.

95
00:07:47,865 --> 00:07:50,084
- OK, so you want to do
85 and divide it by 12?

96
00:07:50,084 --> 00:07:51,730
- Where are you all getting 12 from?

97
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,030
- A foot is 12 inches.

98
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:58,511
- There's one inch, not twelve.

99
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:04,570
- Oh, because I found the 87 feet squared.

100
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,463
I found the area of it,
but then you've got to find

101
00:08:06,463 --> 00:08:08,506
how many 1 inch, so you
multiply it times 12

102
00:08:08,506 --> 00:08:21,008
because there's 12 inches in a foot.

103
00:08:21,008 --> 00:08:23,169
- So what are we multiplying with?

104
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,246
- [Several] 12.

105
00:08:25,246 --> 00:08:28,868
- So we're doing 87 times 12?

106
00:08:28,868 --> 00:08:33,846
(background chatter)

107
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,743
- Shouldn't you divide though?

108
00:08:36,743 --> 00:08:38,276
- Try dividing.

109
00:08:38,276 --> 00:08:40,377
What do you get when you divide?

110
00:08:40,377 --> 00:08:59,937
(background chatter)

111
00:08:59,937 --> 00:09:01,180
- Say that again.

112
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,153
- In one square foot,
there are 144 inches.

113
00:09:03,153 --> 00:09:06,880
Instead of going by 12
which I said originally,

114
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,900
shouldn't we be doing it by 144?

115
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,557
Since one square foot is
how many inches it is?

116
00:09:12,557 --> 00:09:16,016
- But I've got 87 square foot.

117
00:09:16,016 --> 00:09:20,763
- But I'm saying in each
foot, there's 144 inches.

118
00:09:20,763 --> 00:09:26,162
So instead of 12, there
are 144 square inches.

119
00:09:26,162 --> 00:09:29,018
So instead of multiplying by
12 cause that would be wrong

120
00:09:29,018 --> 00:09:36,656
now that I think about it,
we should multiply it by 144.

121
00:09:36,656 --> 00:09:40,777
(background chatter)

122
00:09:40,777 --> 00:09:42,298
- OK, let me ask you guys this:

123
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:46,140
what if we converted all
of the feet to inches

124
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,137
before we found our area?

125
00:09:49,137 --> 00:09:52,434
- Could we do it that way?

126
00:09:52,434 --> 00:09:54,442
- [Several] Yeah.

127
00:09:54,442 --> 00:09:59,258
OK, let's try it that way.

128
00:09:59,258 --> 00:10:01,872
What would 9 be in inches?

129
00:10:01,872 --> 00:10:03,554
9 feet in inches?

130
00:10:03,554 --> 00:10:05,540
- [Several] 108.

131
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:09,116
- 108? What would 5 be in inches?

132
00:10:09,116 --> 00:10:11,693
60, thank you LaDarius.

133
00:10:11,693 --> 00:10:15,977
7 in inches, 7 feet?

134
00:10:15,977 --> 00:10:17,300
- 84.

135
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,948
- 84, thank you Kashmir.

136
00:10:18,948 --> 00:10:20,817
And 6?

137
00:10:20,817 --> 00:10:22,268
- 72.

138
00:10:22,268 --> 00:10:24,666
- 72, thank you Sierra.

139
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,639
OK, we know what all
our units are in inches.

140
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,065
Now when we find the area,

141
00:10:29,065 --> 00:10:34,883
we're going to be finding square inches.

142
00:10:34,883 --> 00:10:39,223
Somebody want to take over from here?

143
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:41,465
Skye, do you mind if you continue writing?

144
00:10:41,465 --> 00:10:43,287
- Uhm yeah. No, I don't mind.

145
00:10:43,287 --> 00:10:48,999
- Thank you.

146
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:53,855
You can erase all of it.

147
00:10:53,855 --> 00:11:02,571
My eraser got stolen.

148
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:08,212
- So, do we do this the same way

149
00:11:08,212 --> 00:11:10,929
but multiply the length
and the width, right?

150
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:12,890
- Yeah.

151
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:21,064
(background chatter)

152
00:11:21,064 --> 00:11:22,142
- It's what?

153
00:11:22,142 --> 00:11:27,448
- 6,480.

154
00:11:27,448 --> 00:11:34,808
(background chatter)

155
00:11:34,808 --> 00:11:36,183
- It's multiplying.

156
00:11:36,183 --> 00:11:37,599
- But that's wrong though.

157
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:42,053
Don't you still have to subtract...

158
00:11:42,053 --> 00:11:46,417
I mean, like 84 minus 60
because they're part of the...

159
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:48,472
- No, we didn't convert the 12.

160
00:11:48,472 --> 00:11:49,970
We converted the 7.

161
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,269
- Oh, OK.

162
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:53,395
- So it's still already changed.

163
00:11:53,395 --> 00:11:55,854
Good question though.

164
00:11:55,854 --> 00:12:08,928
(background chatter)

165
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,006
What's the total?

166
00:12:10,006 --> 00:12:11,806
- 12,528.

167
00:12:11,806 --> 00:12:14,686
I just checked it originally
with the 87 times 144

168
00:12:14,686 --> 00:12:15,789
and that was correct.

169
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:17,587
You are supposed to multiply by 144.

170
00:12:17,587 --> 00:12:18,726
- Good job.

171
00:12:18,726 --> 00:12:19,990
- What did you say it was?

172
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:24,010
- 12,528.

173
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,418
- How'd you get that?

174
00:12:26,418 --> 00:12:39,989
(background chatter)

175
00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:43,201
- OK. Next problem.

176
00:12:43,201 --> 00:12:46,947
No? You have a question?

177
00:12:46,947 --> 00:12:48,410
Yes.

178
00:12:48,410 --> 00:13:00,647
(inaudible)

179
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:04,941
- When you get 1000?

180
00:13:04,941 --> 00:13:08,900
When did you have 1,044?

181
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:13,509
(background chatter)

182
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:15,541
Oh, and then you multiply by 12 again.

183
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:17,491
Because guess what 12 times 12 is.

184
00:13:17,491 --> 00:13:20,061
- [Several] 144.

185
00:13:20,061 --> 00:13:22,280
- So that's what you're doing.

186
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,032
You're multiplying by
144, you just broke 144 up

187
00:13:25,032 --> 00:13:27,412
into 12 and 12, right?

188
00:13:27,412 --> 00:13:34,040
(background chatter)

189
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,350
- They way you get 15 from
when the outside is 10

190
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:40,612
before the 15....(inaudible).

191
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:43,015
- From the very, very
top to the very bottom.

192
00:13:43,015 --> 00:13:45,278
- Thank you, because now
we know that that's 1 inch.

193
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:47,310
- Can't you break it up?

194
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:51,739
- Now that we know the
basic triangle in the back.

195
00:13:51,739 --> 00:13:54,517
- That means you're breaking it up into...

196
00:13:54,517 --> 00:13:57,990
a triangle and a square?

197
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:02,819
- Yes.

198
00:14:02,819 --> 00:14:04,630
The square on the bottom.

199
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:10,514
- I'm sorry, Jacob?

200
00:14:10,514 --> 00:14:13,281
The base of what?

201
00:14:13,281 --> 00:14:15,926
- The base of the triangle in the back.

202
00:14:15,926 --> 00:14:24,040
(background chatter)

203
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,976
- But what's the base?

204
00:14:27,976 --> 00:14:30,658
- 5.

205
00:14:30,658 --> 00:14:34,232
- The height is 5 and the base is 15.

206
00:14:34,232 --> 00:14:34,315
(background chatter)

207
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:43,056
- Well yeah, but I was
asking Jacob what the base

208
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:47,259
of the triangle was.

209
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:50,938
Can you explain why the
base of the triangle is 18?

210
00:14:50,938 --> 00:14:56,255
- Because the width of the rectangle is 10

211
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,930
and I have to add the
sides of the triangle.
