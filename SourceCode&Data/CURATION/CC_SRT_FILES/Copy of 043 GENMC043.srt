1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,240
- Okay. So, what's going on with this
group? You go ahead since you did it.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,910
- We made like a T chart.

3
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:15,240
- Oh, fantastic. Graphic organizing. Love
it.

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,530
- We put the ones that we're going to
delete over here and then keep over here.

5
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,970
- Now we're discussing why we deleted these
or chose them.

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,840
- Was it pretty easy to choose the
keepers?

7
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:27,570
- It was.

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,890
- Yeah, we agreed on most of them.

9
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,260
- What about the delete? Have there been
some discussions?

10
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:37,280
- We had to think about the smart and the
healthy and religious.

11
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,750
- Yeah.
- Okay. Good.

12
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,820
- Oh and stay in school. They don't have
to stay in school.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,330
- So, there were some that you had to
discuss a little more?

14
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:44,820
- Yeah.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,140
- Tell me some of your thoughts. Which was
the most difficult?

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,440
- Probably the religious.

17
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,980
- And also smart.

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,620
- Tell me a little bit about the
discussion you had with religion.

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,620
- Well, first of all we thought that it
wouldn't be, but then we thought some

20
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,380
people had different religions and other
people...

21
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:16,350
- My dad has a friend--my dad has a friend
that isn't a Christian, but he's still a

22
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,688
really good person.

23
00:01:17,688 --> 00:01:22,400
- It's just like as you grow up being a
Christian, that's just what you think. But

24
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:28,270
then as you think about it, that's not how
you're a good person.

25
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:34,850
- Okay. So, you stepped back from what you
knew and you looked around. Were you able

26
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,460
to come up with some examples, like was it
your uncle?

27
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,930
- No, it was just a friend.

28
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:43,420
- A friend. So, were you able to come up
with some examples of people that were not

29
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,480
religious people.
- Yeah.

30
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:51,770
- Can you tell me some qualities on the
list that they have even though they are

31
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,180
not the Christian?

32
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,380
- My uncle, he's not religious, but he's a
teacher. So, he's helping kids and stuff

33
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,910
and he's really nice.

34
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:07,180
- My neighbor, she's really nice. You
can't even tell that she's not religious.

35
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:14,050
You always think she is. She's kind and
friendly. She's respectful. I don't know,

36
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:14,880
just really nice.

37
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,750
- Okay. So, when we first put up our list,
that was one of the qualities that were on

38
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:35,390
lots of list--boom, boom, boom, then just
religious. So, we had to step back from it

39
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,810
to really stop and think about that.

40
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:42,070
- Or they could be not doing their best in
school but they could be a really great

41
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:42,730
friend or person.

42
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,750
- Very good. There's more than one kind of
smart.

43
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:47,650
- Yeah.

44
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:53,450
- Do you think that having good qualities
and keeping yourself with those qualities

45
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,280
is another kind of smart?
- Yes.

46
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,730
- And you're right. I know some mentally
challenged friends, people, that are some

47
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:12,470
of the most kind-hearted people. Good
discussion. Good going. Okay. Why 

48
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,240
did you do happy?

49
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:18,510
- Because whenever you're sad then you
just have that gloomy feeling hanging over

50
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,100
you all the time.

51
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:27,960
- Yeah. And also if you're not happy all
the time, you don't have it all the time,

52
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:33,330
every minute--you can't just be depressed
all the time. And then...

53
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,150
- Stay in school.

54
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:39,580
- Yeah. Why did we go into stay in school?

55
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:50,378
- Thank you, Lexi. Come on over here,
Veronica. Okay, ladies, what is your

56
00:03:50,378 --> 00:03:51,562
question?

57
00:03:52,305 --> 00:03:59,910
- We're going two ways. I kind of think
that you need to be religious.

58
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,800
Because if you go to church it helps you
become a good person. But then at the same

59
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:09,870
time, there's like people in the world
that are really great people but they're

60
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,620
un-relgious.
- They can't be religious.

61
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,740
- Like countries?

62
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,280
- And they're still a good person even
though they can't.

63
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:22,020
- Also, we were thinking people that do go
to church aren't always taking what they

64
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,690
learn and using it in their lives.

65
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:34,040
- So, you have found some examples of
religious that are not exhibiting other

66
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,340
qualities and then people who are not
religious who show a lot of these

67
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,480
qualities.
- Yeah.

68
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:45,310
- Okay. So, that kind of goes both ways.

69
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,930
- I think we should delete.

70
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,220
- I don't know. I can go both ways.

71
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,740
- So, you can see both sides.
- Yeah.

72
00:04:53,920 --> 00:05:05,990
- You don't have to be religious to be a
good person.

73
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:11,090
- Okay. So, can you set aside what your
own religious beliefs are that if you

74
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,140
believe this way, if you don't believe
this way, something bad will happen to

75
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:21,420
you? Can you set that aside and just look
at the person's qualities?

76
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:29,565
- My sister has a friend that goes to
college with her and she doesn't hang out

77
00:05:29,565 --> 00:05:38,620
with her that much, but she doesn't
believe in God. And that's her religion.

78
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,390
But I guess that would be their religion.
So, really, everybody has a religion kind

79
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:50,260
of, but they can't express their religion
or go to church and stuff like that.

80
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,420
- Okay. So, which one's our leader?
Jordan, you're our leader. So, do you want

81
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,990
to take another vote and see where it
stands? Okay.

82
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,500
You're changing in a way? Okay. So, where
do you stand now?

83
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:22,610
- Those are all qualities that make up a
good person, but again, we all had to make

84 
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:29,990
a decision on it. But again, other groups
can have different opinions about that or

85
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:33,960
different opinions on how to make a good
person. So, we can think that you need to

86
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:38,380
be religious but then another group can
say you don't have to be religious.

87
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,360
- Right. It's all about what this group
decides.

88
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:54,840
- I was also thinking about the Ten
Commandments, that it has a choice. If you

89
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,050
want to be religious, that's also putting
that in mind.

90
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,920
- Okay. So, are you leaning towards
deleting or keeping?

91
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,050
- We're just talking
[inaudible].

92
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,638
- How about you, Grace?

93
00:07:06,638 --> 00:07:13,700
- I kind of think it's... I don't know.
I think we should keep and then I think

94
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:20,290
that we maybe should delete because you
don't have to go to church to be a good

95
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:20,600
person.

96
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:26,050
- Does anybody have a personal experience
in their own family of somebody who's not

97
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:29,100
religious that is a really great person?

98
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:35,220
- Well, like they don't go to church or
they're just not like... ?

99
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,370
- Okay. That is a great statement that
Jordan made that will give us pause to

100
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:46,680
think. What does "religious" mean to each
one of you? So maybe that's another place

101
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:52,460
to start. What does that word mean? And
then that might help you decide whether to

102
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,980
delete it or keep it.

103
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,060
- Because going to church doesn't
necessarily make you religious.

104
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,550
- You can just walk into the church and
listen to your pastor's sermon.

105
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,260
It doesn't mean that you're a good person.

106
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,870
- So discuss that for just a moment. Okay.

107
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:14,570
- What does religious mean to you?

108
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:19,780
- I think it means being saved and saying
sorry for our sins and asking for

109
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,060
forgiveness. So, that's like the main
writing.

110
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:36,350
- In my opinion of being religious, I
think that you take what you learn in a

111
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:42,640
church's sermon and you use it in your
world. You know what I mean?

112
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,100
- Yes.

113
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:49,570
- If it's a very touching sermon and it's
what you believe, you can take it back and

114
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:56,480
you can use it to help you go through
problems or whatever and then I think also

115
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:02,010
religious is that you're willing to share
with other people.

116
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,620
- Yeah. You're not embarrassed.

117
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,330
- You're not just holding back and keeping
it to yourself.

118
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,210
- No matter if people aren't religious and
they'll come up to you and make fun of you

119
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:16,820
here at school. You're just willing to put
it aside. I used to go to a different

120
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:26,750
school. I don't remember now. But he was a
very, very, very good student. And for

121
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:33,750
some reason, they did want to
[inaudible].

122
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:42,650
I don't know why. I didn't figure it out.
The pastor got fired because it was just a

123
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:48,460
job to him. He did something very, very
inappropriate that a pastor could do with

124
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,040
another person within church. And he left
because he was so embarrassed.

125
00:09:54,220 --> 00:10:00,000
- Why would he have been embarrassed? I
would have felt bad, not just embarrassed.

126
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:12,000
- And he was married. You know what I said
about you have to be willing to share?

127
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,924
Well, there was this one pastor...

128
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:24,724
- Let me turn the camera on you. Hold on.

129
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:29,580
- So, there would kind of be a way of
saying that it doesn't really work out.

130
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,940
So, if both sides are
[inaudible].

131
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:41,620
- Okay. All right. Regan, let's hear again
what you said about the deleting, why

132
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,620
would you thought you would delete it.

133
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,375
- Oh, I'm not the one who said delete.
- Oh, okay.

134
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:51,275
- I said delete it because I know people
that are not atheist who are not--

135
00:10:51,275 --> 00:11:00,270
- Yes ma'am. I will tell her. Thank you.
Scarlet, Vicki is not here today. Thank

136
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:05,500
you, ladies, for getting quiet when the
intercom rang. Now, discuss, continue.

137
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,470
- They're still Christian but they're
still just as good as any other person

138
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:13,050
would be. That's why I think we should
delete it. But I don't know.

139
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:13,530
- Okay.

140
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:18,720
- Maybe it's the way she put it because
she said it changes you inside, but being

141
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:26,780
Christian, it does kind of change you
inside.

142
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:32,880
- Okay. So, you have a person in your life
that you consider to have some qualities

143
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,240
that make them a really great person but
they are not religious?

144
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,450
- Yeah. They're not atheist but they're
not Christian.

145
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:43,610
- Okay Do you have anybody in your life
that's not religious that you find a lot

146
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,520
of good qualities?

147
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,760
- My grandpa. He's not saved, but he still
believes.

148
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,870
- I guess it just depends on how the
person acts.

149
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:59,990
- Okay? How about you? Do you have anybody
in your life?

150
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,150
- Yeah.
[Inaudible]

151
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,850
named Delaney, she's an older person. But
she really, really likes

152
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,570
[inaudible]
her house and stuff.

153
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,080
- And would you consider her to have
qualities that make a really great person?

154
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:11,800
- Yes.

155
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,140
- But you would not consider her
religious?

156
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:20,930
- Oh no. But she is not really atheist,
but she doesn't believe in anything. But

157
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:26,258
she doesn't believe in being atheist.

158
00:12:26,258 --> 00:12:33,520
- So, we're kind of on the fence on this
one in that some people think it needs to

159
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:39,710
be deleted and others think no, it makes a
difference. Do you know anybody who says

160
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:44,420
that they are religious and they don't
have qualities of a great person?

161
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:52,230
- Yes. Some people, as soon as they get
out of church, they'll go out and do stuff

162
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:53,990
that wouldn't be religious.

163
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:57,750
- Yeah. It's kind of like they don't have
a Christian background.

164
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:03,450
- They'll sit in the church room and they
say, "I'm a Christian because I'm here at

165
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:08,350
church," but really you go do this at
other places.

166
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:13,940
- So, then I guess it all boils down to
what do you believe or what do you think

167
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,640
that religious means. A lot of people
would say, "Oh, I'm religious," but then

168
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,030
like you said, spend the rest of the week
doing things.

169
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:26,280
- Yes. But they're kind of being truthful
if they say they're not religious and

170
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:30,640
they're not really religious. So, it's
kind of two things--so truthful, but

171
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,160
they're not religious.

172
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:42,910
- Or maybe being a fake Christian, like
sitting in church. They'll watch a

173
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:47,920
football game just waiting for church to
end.

174
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:54,430
- But maybe that's kind of worse than
saying, "I'm not a Christian," but also

175
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:55,170
be a good person.

176
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:59,990
- Okay. So, you're the leader in this
group.

177
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:04,000
Why don't you poll each other again and
see if they want to now delete other

178
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,450
people.
- Okay.

179
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:09,920
- So, go ahead and ask.

180
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:16,270
- Okay. So, I put I'm not sure yet.

181
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:21,970
- We're still not sure. That's fine.
That's fine. If we're not sure yet, we

182
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,810
don't have to put it in one side or the
other yet if we're not done discussing it.

183
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,580
This may be one that the group can't agree
on.

184
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:34,500
- I think it's a good thing to have, but
you don't have to have it to be a good

185
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,957
person.
- Yeah.

186
00:14:36,957 --> 00:14:42,490
- I think we can just delete it. It is
good to have, but people can be really

187
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:48,080
good people and not be religious.

188
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:53,210
- Everybody agree with that? If you're
still thinking, "No, I don't want to say

189
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:57,020
that," this is the safe place to say
that. Nobody's going to kick you.

190
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,000
- Because even religious people
can also be...
