1
00:00:00,417 --> 00:00:02,185
- That's what I want
you to do to prove to me

2
00:00:02,185 --> 00:00:05,984
that you understand that
beyond just telling me what,

3
00:00:05,984 --> 00:00:08,084
you know, maybe the book would say.

4
00:00:08,084 --> 00:00:11,318
Beyond just a definition, right?

5
00:00:11,318 --> 00:00:12,917
If you're going down the right path here

6
00:00:12,917 --> 00:00:13,885
and you know what that is,

7
00:00:13,885 --> 00:00:16,017
I see you're making a
nice Venn diagram here,

8
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:19,085
comparing and contrasting, that's great.

9
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:22,051
What I want you to do
is on this sheet here,

10
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:23,384
cause this is what you're
going to need to present

11
00:00:23,384 --> 00:00:24,951
to the class in a couple minutes.

12
00:00:24,951 --> 00:00:28,084
Put down these thoughts,
these words that you've got.

13
00:00:28,084 --> 00:00:30,051
You can even draw your
Venn diagram on here.

14
00:00:30,051 --> 00:00:32,785
But, explain what that means.

15
00:00:32,785 --> 00:00:35,251
What does that mean, bubbles
floating inside the lagoon?

16
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:36,717
What does that mean?

17
00:00:36,717 --> 00:00:38,985
It's escaping off the top.

18
00:00:38,985 --> 00:00:41,184
When we think of matter,

19
00:00:41,184 --> 00:00:44,284
what do we actually think of in our heads?

20
00:00:44,284 --> 00:00:47,251
Conceptually we're thinking
of a chunk of matter,

21
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:51,384
a beaker of liquid, so there's
some space and what else?

22
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,418
(students chattering)

23
00:00:52,418 --> 00:00:53,984
And what?

24
00:00:53,984 --> 00:00:55,651
(students chattering)

25
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:57,084
So matter has mass and volume.

26
00:00:57,084 --> 00:00:58,784
What's matter made up of?

27
00:00:58,784 --> 00:01:00,382
(students chattering)

28
00:01:00,382 --> 00:01:02,285
Okay. Atoms, molecules.

29
00:01:02,285 --> 00:01:04,017
If it helps you, you can decide

30
00:01:04,017 --> 00:01:06,684
okay let's think of
this in terms of water.

31
00:01:06,684 --> 00:01:09,117
Just so it's a known right?

32
00:01:09,117 --> 00:01:12,017
Okay, good. Yeah that's
a good way to do that.

33
00:01:12,017 --> 00:01:14,951
So, draw some pictures.

34
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:17,617
When you say it's escaping off the top,

35
00:01:17,617 --> 00:01:19,117
what does that look like?

36
00:01:19,117 --> 00:01:22,251
Okay, so try to get it into some visuals.

37
00:01:22,251 --> 00:01:23,284
- [girl student] Okay.

38
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:26,801
- I'll come back.

39
00:01:27,151 --> 00:01:31,968
(students chattering)

40
00:01:40,085 --> 00:01:44,717
- Matter, like I don't really understand.

41
00:01:44,717 --> 00:01:47,017
- [Teacher] The definition of heat?

42
00:01:47,017 --> 00:01:47,784
- Yeah.

43
00:01:47,784 --> 00:01:50,517
- [Teacher] Okay, so what is heat?

44
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:54,385
(student's chatter drowning out boy)

45
00:01:54,385 --> 00:01:55,018
- [Teacher] It's what?

46
00:01:55,018 --> 00:01:57,548
(students chattering)

47
00:02:01,684 --> 00:02:04,952
- Heat is like the transferring of energy

48
00:02:04,952 --> 00:02:09,417
from a warmer thing to
a colder thing, right?

49
00:02:09,417 --> 00:02:11,751
- [Teacher] So you want to
separate what something is

50
00:02:11,751 --> 00:02:13,652
from how it behaves?

51
00:02:13,652 --> 00:02:17,984
So you're saying heat
is the transfer of energy.

52
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:21,152
Transfer is how it behaves, right?

53
00:02:21,152 --> 00:02:24,284
What is it?

54
00:02:24,284 --> 00:02:25,817
- [girl student] It's just energy.

55
00:02:25,817 --> 00:02:28,317
- It's energy, right?

56
00:02:28,317 --> 00:02:31,684
So heat is a form of energy,

57
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:34,185
and you're absolutely
right. It can move around

58
00:02:34,185 --> 00:02:38,351
in the environment, between
systems, in and out of the system
 (inaudible).

59
00:02:38,351 --> 00:02:42,717
So let's say you've got a beaker of water

60
00:02:42,717 --> 00:02:44,717
sitting on the counter and it's hot, right?

61
00:02:44,717 --> 00:02:47,417
It's sitting in a cold room.

62
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,242
What do you expect to happen?

63
00:02:51,618 --> 00:02:52,885
What will happen to the temperature

64
00:02:52,885 --> 00:02:54,285
of the water, for example?

65
00:02:54,285 --> 00:02:57,217
- It will (inaudible).

66
00:02:57,217 --> 00:03:00,618
- Okay, so the water will get colder

67
00:03:00,618 --> 00:03:02,784
and the air right around
the beaker will get warmer

68
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,051
til they level out?

69
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:04,718
- Yeah.

70
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:06,818
- [Teacher] Okay, equilibrium, good.

71
00:03:06,818 --> 00:03:11,818
So, you understand that heat is energy.

72
00:03:12,751 --> 00:03:14,618
And you understand that it can move around.

73
00:03:14,618 --> 00:03:18,551
So the question here is
how does adding heat energy,

74
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:20,585
for example, matter cause changes

75
00:03:20,585 --> 00:03:23,685
to temperature and changes of state?

76
00:03:23,685 --> 00:03:26,484
So not that it does, but how?

77
00:03:26,484 --> 00:03:29,417
So, what you need to do
is think about your ideas

78
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:32,284
about matter. What is matter?

79
00:03:32,284 --> 00:03:35,517
- Something with a mass or volume?

80
00:03:35,517 --> 00:03:38,517
- [Teacher] Occupies
space, has mass or volume. You know.

81
00:03:39,907 --> 00:03:40,651
You just said it.

82
00:03:40,651 --> 00:03:41,285
- Okay.

83
00:03:41,285 --> 00:03:42,617
- [Teacher] Yeah, see you know.

84
00:03:42,617 --> 00:03:44,917
Okay, matter has volume,
it takes up space, right?

85
00:03:44,917 --> 00:03:47,349
And it also has what?
- [Student] Mass.

86
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:48,752
The property of mass.

87
00:03:48,752 --> 00:03:52,152
Do you guys have any kind of
a conceptual model of matter,

88
00:03:52,152 --> 00:03:53,485
like if you think of it...

89
00:03:53,485 --> 00:03:55,518
Obviously this is matter right,

90
00:03:55,518 --> 00:03:57,385
but if you zoom in on that is there a way

91
00:03:57,385 --> 00:04:01,718
that you think about what matter is?

92
00:04:01,718 --> 00:04:02,750
Do you guys think of matter as being

93
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,283
made up of smaller things?

94
00:04:05,283 --> 00:04:05,918
- [students] Yes.

95
00:04:05,918 --> 00:04:08,483
- Okay, atoms, molecules.

96
00:04:08,483 --> 00:04:12,784
What would happen if you had one atom

97
00:04:12,784 --> 00:04:15,184
and you add some energy to it?

98
00:04:15,184 --> 00:04:19,834
(students chattering)

99
00:04:26,718 --> 00:04:28,218
- Remember this isn't rights or wrongs,

100
00:04:28,218 --> 00:04:29,851
this is what are you thinking right now

101
00:04:29,851 --> 00:04:31,683
so that you can make sense of this.

102
00:04:31,683 --> 00:04:36,501
So what if I have two atoms
and I add more energy to them?

103
00:04:37,784 --> 00:04:39,584
What if I have hundreds of atoms

104
00:04:39,584 --> 00:04:42,519
and I make them all move faster?

105
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:45,284
(students chattering)

106
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:46,618
Well, I mean that's what I'm asking you guys

107
00:04:46,618 --> 00:04:49,418
to think about as best you can.

108
00:04:49,418 --> 00:04:50,851
How would that occur?

109
00:04:50,851 --> 00:04:53,051
- We said if the
molecules have more energy

110
00:04:53,051 --> 00:04:55,318
and they move faster then that leads to...

111
00:04:55,318 --> 00:04:56,551
- And they get warmer.

112
00:04:56,551 --> 00:04:59,384
Oh, that's the same thing
as adding more energy right?

113
00:04:59,384 --> 00:05:04,034
- Then they move faster and that
leads to changes from liquid.

114
00:05:05,616 --> 00:05:07,184
- [Teacher] I would say add some pictures.

115
00:05:07,184 --> 00:05:09,018
I think you guys are thinking
some good thoughts here

116
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:11,751
about the structure of
matter, what it's made of.

117
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:13,484
So why don't you draw me some pictures

118
00:05:13,484 --> 00:05:15,017
of what that would look like

119
00:05:15,017 --> 00:05:18,317
in, say something that is changing state.

120
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:20,018
Maybe take a chunk of something solid

121
00:05:20,018 --> 00:05:22,917
and then draw what you guys see,

122
00:05:22,917 --> 00:05:24,551
as being a series of steps,

123
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:28,085
getting it from here to here.

124
00:05:28,085 --> 00:05:30,785
So start with a lump

125
00:05:30,785 --> 00:05:35,184
of solid matter, okay something like that.

126
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:37,950
Take it all the way to a gas.
- [Students] Okay.

127
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,850
- How do you see that matter.
- [Students] Okay.

128
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,551
- Okay, alright, let me give you guys

129
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:43,950
a couple minutes to do that.

130
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,051
- Start with an atom,
and build like a box...

131
00:05:46,051 --> 00:05:47,685
- [Teacher] So folks, I want to take

132
00:05:47,685 --> 00:05:49,050
a couple more minutes

133
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,850
and then have you guys share
your thoughts with each other.

134
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:56,850
(students chattering)

135
00:06:01,617 --> 00:06:03,250
- [Teacher] Theorizing is good.

136
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,918
Why don't you draw me some pictures

137
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:10,351
of what might be happening here?

138
00:06:10,351 --> 00:06:12,984
Yep? Did I take your pencil?

139
00:06:12,984 --> 00:06:16,517
I'm sorry (laughter).

140
00:06:16,517 --> 00:06:18,185
Okay we have a pencil thief.

141
00:06:18,185 --> 00:06:21,185
So, you're saying there's
some specific temperature

142
00:06:21,185 --> 00:06:24,417
in which all phases can
exist at the same time?

143
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,517
Water would be evaporating,
ice would be melting,

144
00:06:26,517 --> 00:06:27,818
and vapor would be condensing.

145
00:06:27,818 --> 00:06:31,085
So, I just want you to
tell me a little bit more

146
00:06:31,085 --> 00:06:32,350
about your theory.

147
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,718
How would that work in the environment

148
00:06:34,718 --> 00:06:37,150
in terms of the physical conditions

149
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,784
that the ice and the water
and the vapor would be under?

150
00:06:39,784 --> 00:06:42,284
Yesterday, we talked about
some things that affect phase,

151
00:06:42,284 --> 00:06:44,685
what were they?

152
00:06:44,685 --> 00:06:46,218
What was one thing that we said affects

153
00:06:46,218 --> 00:06:48,650
what phase of matter something is in?

154
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,951
Okay, temperature. Anything else?

155
00:06:50,951 --> 00:06:53,250
- [Male student] Pressure.

156
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,584
- Pressure maybe so is there a way

157
00:06:55,584 --> 00:06:57,818
that you can describe to
me in terms of pressure

158
00:06:57,818 --> 00:07:02,818
and temperature, and the matter
itself, how that would work?

159
00:07:03,517 --> 00:07:07,750
Okay, you may need to
mentally zoom in on matter.

160
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,117
What is it, what is ice,
what is water, what is gas?

161
00:07:11,117 --> 00:07:15,285
If you zoom in and we look
at it beyond just a chunk,

162
00:07:15,285 --> 00:07:17,484
what do we see on the "inside"?

163
00:07:17,484 --> 00:07:20,684
What's it made up of
at a very small level?

164
00:07:20,684 --> 00:07:25,684
(students chattering)

165
00:07:29,717 --> 00:07:31,717
Does everybody here see
matter as a collection

166
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:33,351
of atoms or molecules?

167
00:07:33,351 --> 00:07:35,017
Like you can visualize that?

168
00:07:35,017 --> 00:07:37,184
So bring that in here.

169
00:07:37,184 --> 00:07:40,517
If you do that then
show me how your theory

170
00:07:40,517 --> 00:07:43,517
would apply to that.

171
00:07:43,517 --> 00:07:45,217
Try.

172
00:07:45,217 --> 00:07:46,884
Okay?
- [Male student] Okay.

173
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:48,618
How's that sound?

174
00:07:48,618 --> 00:07:50,351
Okay a couple more minutes.

175
00:07:50,351 --> 00:07:55,351
(students chattering)

176
00:08:10,185 --> 00:08:11,317
Seems like you guys have gotten

177
00:08:11,317 --> 00:08:13,185
your thoughts wrapped around this,

178
00:08:13,185 --> 00:08:14,685
and you're working on presenting it?

179
00:08:14,685 --> 00:08:17,802
Okay.

180
00:08:18,884 --> 00:08:23,884
(students chattering)

181
00:08:24,383 --> 00:08:25,984
- [Student] How am I supposed to do this?

182
00:08:25,984 --> 00:08:29,867
- Oh god, I can't draw cups.

183
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:32,650
- [Teacher] Remember you
have to explain to everyone

184
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,683
what you're drawing's showing,

185
00:08:33,683 --> 00:08:35,050
so it doesn't have to be perfect.

186
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:35,951
- Oh, okay.

187
00:08:35,951 --> 00:08:37,618
- Don't worry about perfection.

188
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:39,017
You're gonna get to stand up there

189
00:08:39,017 --> 00:08:40,285
and say this is what I drew.

190
00:08:40,285 --> 00:08:41,718
And they just have to believe you.

191
00:08:41,718 --> 00:08:44,718
- [Student] Okay, that's
how bad it's gonna be.

192
00:08:44,718 --> 00:08:48,291
- [Female student] Okay,
so there's like the water.

193
00:08:50,217 --> 00:08:51,685
- [Female student] I think
I have the difference

194
00:08:51,685 --> 00:08:54,384
between the molecules.

195
00:08:54,384 --> 00:08:59,384
(students chattering)

196
00:09:06,984 --> 00:09:11,984
- Okay, so that shows that,
that's gas and liquid.

197
00:09:13,118 --> 00:09:17,955
(students chattering)

198
00:09:22,185 --> 00:09:23,751
- What is the big red arrow?

199
00:09:23,751 --> 00:09:26,585
- [Female student] It's like
going up out of the liquid--

200
00:09:26,585 --> 00:09:28,218
- What's it?

201
00:09:28,218 --> 00:09:29,484
- [Female student] The molecules.

202
00:09:29,484 --> 00:09:30,585
- Okay, molecules.

203
00:09:30,585 --> 00:09:34,868
- [Female student] Yeah, that's
what this is supposed to be.

204
00:09:36,384 --> 00:09:37,651
- So the only thing I
would like for you guys

205
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:39,984
to add to your explanation here

206
00:09:39,984 --> 00:09:44,317
is something about why, like why or how.

207
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,952
What are the factors in
the physical environment

208
00:09:47,952 --> 00:09:49,985
that are allowing or
not allowing the things

209
00:09:49,985 --> 00:09:51,784
that you're drawing to happen?

210
00:09:51,784 --> 00:09:55,117
(students chattering)

211
00:09:55,117 --> 00:09:59,152
That's up to you, what
you think is making...

212
00:09:59,152 --> 00:10:00,152
I think that's quite good actually.

213
00:10:00,152 --> 00:10:02,119
That explains it to me really well.

214
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:04,419
The things that you think
are having an effect

215
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:08,184
on what's actually going
to or not going to happen.

216
00:10:08,184 --> 00:10:09,518
- [Female student] Like
this amazing flame?

217
00:10:09,518 --> 00:10:10,918
- Like that amazing flame.

218
00:10:10,918 --> 00:10:12,118
So you might want to label that

219
00:10:12,118 --> 00:10:13,684
or make sure that you explain that.

220
00:10:13,684 --> 00:10:16,784
- [Female student] Label it F-L-A-M-E.

221
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:21,784
(students chattering)

222
00:10:27,674 --> 00:10:32,674
- You've vibrated, those are
actually quite good vibrations.

223
00:10:37,018 --> 00:10:40,181
- [Female student] That's our gas.

224
00:10:43,318 --> 00:10:45,752
- They're awfully close together.

225
00:10:45,752 --> 00:10:49,884
These are closer together
here than they are here.

226
00:10:49,884 --> 00:10:52,351
Is that something that you intended?

227
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:53,384
- [Students] No.

228
00:10:53,384 --> 00:10:55,518
- [Male student] There
supposed to be really spread out.

229
00:10:55,518 --> 00:11:00,518
(students chattering over each other)

230
00:11:03,152 --> 00:11:04,717
- It's up to you what
you're going to write.

231
00:11:04,717 --> 00:11:06,017
I'm simply asking you a question

232
00:11:06,017 --> 00:11:09,851
because it seems like
between liquid and gas

233
00:11:09,851 --> 00:11:12,517
they got closer together.

234
00:11:12,517 --> 00:11:13,218
- [Female student] We
didn't mean to do that.

235
00:11:13,218 --> 00:11:15,084
I can draw more.

236
00:11:15,084 --> 00:11:16,817
- What do you think?

237
00:11:16,817 --> 00:11:21,817
(students chattering)

238
00:11:23,384 --> 00:11:25,718
So, we've shown them closer together.

239
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,517
Do we want to revise this

240
00:11:27,517 --> 00:11:29,585
or do you think it doesn't matter?

241
00:11:29,585 --> 00:11:32,351
(students chattering)

242
00:11:32,351 --> 00:11:35,268
So they could be closer together?

243
00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:37,251
- [Female student] They
could be closer together

244
00:11:37,251 --> 00:11:38,885
as long as they're moving more.

245
00:11:38,885 --> 00:11:40,218
- Okay.

246
00:11:40,218 --> 00:11:42,352
- [Female student] So I think
being like spreading out

247
00:11:42,352 --> 00:11:45,278
and occupying all space available.

248
00:11:46,185 --> 00:11:48,318
- So if you're thinking that,

249
00:11:48,318 --> 00:11:50,283
you should include that somehow,

250
00:11:50,283 --> 00:11:52,985
and it seems like then you
and Katelyn, and Ignesia's

251
00:11:52,985 --> 00:11:55,284
have different ideas about this.

252
00:11:55,284 --> 00:11:57,051
And that's important to acknowledge

253
00:11:57,051 --> 00:11:59,252
because those are two different things

254
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,517
so we want to think about...

255
00:12:01,517 --> 00:12:03,784
What are you doing?

256
00:12:03,784 --> 00:12:04,784
Oh, you're adding to it.

257
00:12:04,784 --> 00:12:08,618
So, I hear Lindsey's
saying that you thought

258
00:12:08,618 --> 00:12:11,917
they'd be more spread
out, occupying more space

259
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:14,017
and I hear you guys saying the spacing

260
00:12:14,017 --> 00:12:17,184
of them doesn't really matter.

261
00:12:17,184 --> 00:12:18,685
So that's worth thinking about,

262
00:12:18,685 --> 00:12:22,785
because that's two different
ways of looking at this.

263
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:25,618
That's two different
ways of looking at this.

264
00:12:25,618 --> 00:12:27,885
Anyway, we don't need
perfection right now.

265
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:29,218
We need your initial thoughts,

266
00:12:29,218 --> 00:12:31,685
but somewhere I'd record that discrepancy.

267
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:34,485
I would record here that you're still

268
00:12:34,485 --> 00:12:36,217
thinking about that issue.

269
00:12:36,217 --> 00:12:40,552
You think one thing,
you guys think another.

270
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:42,218
That's important.

271
00:12:42,218 --> 00:12:44,383
So you guys, I think I'd
like to have groups...

272
00:12:44,383 --> 00:12:47,885
Don't worry if you're not totally done.

273
00:12:47,885 --> 00:12:50,419
I would just like groups
to kind of explain

274
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:53,183
what they've got so far.

275
00:12:53,183 --> 00:12:56,618
And we're going to go in numerical order.

276
00:12:56,618 --> 00:12:59,951
So I am going to ask everybody

277
00:12:59,951 --> 00:13:01,984
to come back to the tables though,

278
00:13:01,984 --> 00:13:06,050
and give your poster to one group member.

279
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,852
Let's do that now.

280
00:13:08,852 --> 00:13:10,784
Don't worry if it's incomplete.

281
00:13:10,784 --> 00:13:14,902
This is a work in progress.

282
00:13:15,184 --> 00:13:17,617
Come on back to the tables.

283
00:13:17,617 --> 00:13:20,584
Don't worry if it's not
finished. You get to explain it.

284
00:13:20,584 --> 00:13:24,017
And we're gonna keep these
around so you can add to them.

285
00:13:24,017 --> 00:13:27,868
Come on back to the tables.

286
00:13:29,384 --> 00:13:32,702
- I count two.

287
00:13:32,952 --> 00:13:37,451
- Alright, so group one, I'm
gonna have you guys come on up

288
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:41,134
and hang up your poster.

289
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,917
You guys let's load
towards the front of the room

290
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:50,884
so that we're all closer.

291
00:13:50,884 --> 00:13:52,350
You don't need all your stuff,

292
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,951
just come on up and sit a little closer.

293
00:13:54,951 --> 00:13:58,518
Let's squeeze in, in all these front tables.

294
00:13:58,518 --> 00:14:03,148
(students chattering)

295
00:14:06,385 --> 00:14:08,784
Yeah, you guys are gonna
explain a little bit to us

296
00:14:08,784 --> 00:14:10,384
of what you're thinking was.

297
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:14,852
So, everybody come on
up as close as you can.

298
00:14:14,852 --> 00:14:18,184
Let's squeeze in at these tables.

299
00:14:18,184 --> 00:14:19,718
Let's get a couple people here,

300
00:14:19,718 --> 00:14:21,818
let's get a couple people here.

301
00:14:21,818 --> 00:14:23,385
Pull a chair on up.

302
00:14:23,385 --> 00:14:27,968
(students chattering)

303
00:14:31,085 --> 00:14:34,219
- [Teacher] Come on up.

304
00:14:40,219 --> 00:14:44,178
Somebody come sit here, somebody sit here.

305
00:14:46,668 --> 00:14:48,851
So, we've only got a
little bit of time left

306
00:14:48,851 --> 00:14:50,651
and I want every group to have a chance

307
00:14:50,651 --> 00:14:52,684
to tell us a little bit
about their thoughts.

308
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:56,785
You guys may, on your pre-think
sheets, take some notes.

309
00:14:56,785 --> 00:14:58,751
Remember this isn't about right or wrong.

310
00:14:58,751 --> 00:15:01,085
This is about how do
we think we understand

311
00:15:01,085 --> 00:15:03,617
this system right now.

312
00:15:03,617 --> 00:15:06,084
And this is all leading
towards trying to understand it

313
00:15:06,084 --> 00:15:08,085
more thoroughly and better and correctly

314
00:15:08,085 --> 00:15:09,518
by the end of the unit.

315
00:15:09,518 --> 00:15:12,517
So, their question, the first one

316
00:15:12,517 --> 00:15:14,817
is how does adding heat
energy to a sample of matter

317
00:15:14,817 --> 00:15:17,784
cause changes of temperature
and changes of state?

318
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:22,784
So, you guys tell us a little
bit about your thinking here?

319
00:15:23,817 --> 00:15:25,817
- Okay, so we were thinking that

320
00:15:25,817 --> 00:15:27,184
something about adding heat

321
00:15:27,184 --> 00:15:28,852
would have to do with the boiling point

322
00:15:28,852 --> 00:15:30,251
and the freezing point.

323
00:15:30,251 --> 00:15:32,117
And we were also just
listing facts that we knew

324
00:15:32,117 --> 00:15:36,418
that would probably help us
determine about our question.

325
00:15:36,418 --> 00:15:39,551
We were thinking about specific heat.

326
00:15:39,551 --> 00:15:42,785
The equation for specific heat.

327
00:15:42,785 --> 00:15:45,951
Also, we said based on the
specific heat of the substance,

328
00:15:45,951 --> 00:15:48,217
an amount of energy will
raise the temperature

329
00:15:48,217 --> 00:15:50,984
by a certain amount, and we
thought that was important.

330
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,484
- And it varies for the substance

331
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,918
because each substance
is like a difference

332
00:15:54,918 --> 00:15:55,651
between the heat.

333
00:15:55,651 --> 00:15:58,150
So if you add one it will raise one gram

334
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:01,817
of a different substance
by a certain degree,

335
00:16:01,817 --> 00:16:04,851
and then a different substance
by a different amount.

336
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:09,751
- And we also thought about
how solid, liquid, and gas,

337
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:13,651
that it has to do with
the change of space.

338
00:16:13,651 --> 00:16:15,584
- And the solid, they're
like locked in place

339
00:16:15,584 --> 00:16:17,917
but they're still vibrating a little bit.

340
00:16:17,917 --> 00:16:20,417
Then, if you add more energy
we think it goes to a liquid,

341
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:23,185
where there's more freedom of movement,

342
00:16:23,185 --> 00:16:24,984
but they're still sort of contained,

343
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,351
and then in a gas.

344
00:16:27,351 --> 00:16:31,350
- And in a gas the molecules

345
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,950
will be occupying all space
available and moving faster.

346
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:39,052
And they're not like moving
in a certain direction.

347
00:16:39,052 --> 00:16:41,650
- What questions do
you guys have for them,

348
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:45,900
or comments about what they're thinking?

349
00:16:48,351 --> 00:16:49,217
- Why would different materials

350
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:52,934
have different specific heats?

351
00:16:54,951 --> 00:16:57,050
- You don't have to know the answer.

352
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:01,451
Does anyone have thoughts on that?

353
00:17:01,451 --> 00:17:02,684
Guesses?

354
00:17:02,684 --> 00:17:04,451
Maybe they're different what?

355
00:17:04,451 --> 00:17:06,118
- [Male student] Different
types of material,

356
00:17:06,118 --> 00:17:06,817
I mean substance.

357
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:11,817
(students mumbling)

358
00:17:14,277 --> 00:17:19,211
(student chatter)

359
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:24,284
- So I think that maybe they
have different specific heats

360
00:17:24,284 --> 00:17:27,850
because the atomic structure is different.

361
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:32,768
So they can kind of
collect heat differently.

362
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,484
- How does that sound
to folks, reasonable?

363
00:17:38,484 --> 00:17:41,250
Is it true that atoms
bond in different ways

364
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,784
for different substances?

365
00:17:44,784 --> 00:17:46,784
Okay, so maybe that's
something worth looking into

366
00:17:46,784 --> 00:17:49,282
as we study this and see why that,

367
00:17:49,282 --> 00:17:51,952
why that physical
property of specific heat,

368
00:17:51,952 --> 00:17:54,284
why isn't it the same for everything?

369
00:17:54,284 --> 00:17:55,885
- [Female student] And so we
were actually still thinking

370
00:17:55,885 --> 00:17:59,619
in our gas drawing here, because
you can see that we drew

371
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:02,084
all the molecules, really close together

372
00:18:02,084 --> 00:18:04,318
compared to the solid and liquid I guess.

373
00:18:04,318 --> 00:18:07,585
And we weren't sure
whether or not in a gas

374
00:18:07,585 --> 00:18:09,984
they could move freely.
And it doesn't matter

375
00:18:09,984 --> 00:18:11,852
how spaced out they are
as long as they can,

376
00:18:11,852 --> 00:18:15,951
they're not stuck in one
space like solids are.

377
00:18:15,951 --> 00:18:17,584
They can just move wherever.

378
00:18:17,584 --> 00:18:21,251
Or whether they have to be
more spaced out and so...

379
00:18:21,251 --> 00:18:22,784
- [Female student] Didn't
occupy the whole space.

380
00:18:22,784 --> 00:18:27,152
- Do you guys have thoughts about that?

381
00:18:27,152 --> 00:18:28,351
What they're saying?

382
00:18:28,351 --> 00:18:30,884
Do you guys understand the
point Katelyn's making?

383
00:18:30,884 --> 00:18:34,118
How far do they have to be to be a gas?

384
00:18:34,118 --> 00:18:36,918
- Well I think that that's
actually a lot like ours

385
00:18:36,918 --> 00:18:39,433
because we were thinking about pressure...
