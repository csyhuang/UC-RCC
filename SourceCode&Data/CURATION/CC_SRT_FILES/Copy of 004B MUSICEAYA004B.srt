- Keep the rhythm sync. Soft. As we do our
solos, here if you would take your

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:13,601
pencils, and when you hear the soloists
play, on these notes on the side of this

00:00:13,755 --> 00:00:20,035
changing. I want you to put a mark beside
that change where you are. Put a count on

00:00:20,035 --> 00:00:23,960
it. Each rotation will be different.
Sometimes they may play from the middle

00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,640
scale to the middle or the whole thing.
Wherever you think that happens. I will be

00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:42,138
saxes and those others who are assigned to
play today. Here we go everybody got

00:00:42,138 --> 00:00:46,854
pencils ready?
And one, one, two, three, four.
