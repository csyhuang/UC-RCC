1
00:00:02,896 --> 00:00:04,432
- [Teacher] Okay.

2
00:00:04,432 --> 00:00:09,382
- [Boy in orange] What's
the next one, Zach?

3
00:00:09,382 --> 00:00:10,078
- [Teacher] (speaking inaudibly)

4
00:00:10,078 --> 00:00:11,239
- [Girl in blue] Jen, you can put

5
00:00:11,239 --> 00:00:12,806
on a 50-line poem on that one here

6
00:00:12,806 --> 00:00:16,765
if you wanted to.

7
00:00:16,765 --> 00:00:18,855
- [Boy in orange] I got that.

8
00:00:18,855 --> 00:00:31,734
- [Teacher] You have (inaudible)

9
00:00:31,734 --> 00:00:34,005
- [Boy in orange] Okay what was the main?

10
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:35,524
What was the summary?

11
00:00:35,524 --> 00:00:37,321
- [Teacher] What would be
a good summary sentence?

12
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:39,667
- [Girl in gray] (speaking inaudibly)

13
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:43,095
- [Zach] Well, they competed in a game

14
00:00:43,095 --> 00:00:53,318
known as the Memoriad.

15
00:00:53,318 --> 00:00:54,351
- Uh huh.

16
00:00:54,351 --> 00:00:56,138
You guys had that one, don't you?

17
00:00:56,138 --> 00:00:57,555
You have the names and faces there.

18
00:00:57,555 --> 00:00:59,314
That was great.

19
00:00:59,314 --> 00:01:01,555
- [Zach] The game.

20
00:01:01,555 --> 00:01:07,850
(inaudible)

21
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:08,719
- [Girl in blue] Are you
doing the vocab though?

22
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:09,276
- [Girl in gray] No.

23
00:01:09,276 --> 00:01:11,016
- [Girl in blue] Okay.

24
00:01:11,016 --> 00:01:12,656
- [Blonde girl] So wait, hang on.

25
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:18,317
Should we do the pictures
or the vocabulary words?

26
00:01:18,317 --> 00:01:21,196
- [Teacher] You can just do
anything from that article.

27
00:01:21,196 --> 00:01:23,089
The pictures were just to
get you thinking about it.

28
00:01:23,089 --> 00:01:25,214
That's why we did the words.

29
00:01:25,214 --> 00:01:28,348
And the vocab was just
to help us understand.

30
00:01:28,348 --> 00:01:31,494
So it doesn't have to go off the vocab.

31
00:01:31,494 --> 00:01:33,572
But the vocab kind of
connects with an idea.

32
00:01:33,572 --> 00:01:40,955
So it may kind of work out that way.

33
00:01:40,955 --> 00:01:41,814
You'll have to let Zach see,

34
00:01:41,814 --> 00:01:43,010
because you took what he had,

35
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:55,269
which is great, and you added to it.

36
00:01:55,269 --> 00:01:58,067
- [Girl in blue] Do we
put the name of the movie?

37
00:01:58,067 --> 00:02:00,691
- [Girl in gray] I'm doing (inaudible).

38
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:01,852
It's a song.

39
00:02:01,852 --> 00:02:03,848
The croak part is a song.

40
00:02:03,848 --> 00:02:04,928
- Mm-hmm, that was part of the.

41
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:08,895
- [Girl in blue] Okay, I was getting.

42
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,284
- [Girl in gray] There, there's the song.

43
00:02:10,284 --> 00:02:11,060
- [Girl in blue] (laughs)

44
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:17,480
- [Girl in gray] I was stuck
on the reading one too.

45
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,870
- [Teacher] Got one left.

46
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,707
- Zach, what's the text structure?

47
00:02:23,707 --> 00:02:24,841
- Sharpening his pencil.

48
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:29,055
(pencil sharpener grinding)

49
00:02:29,055 --> 00:02:40,965
Just go like that.

50
00:02:40,965 --> 00:02:45,804
- [Girl in blue] So
was the Puppet in 1970?

51
00:02:45,804 --> 00:02:46,478
Or was it?

52
00:02:46,478 --> 00:02:47,743
- Yep, 1970.

53
00:02:47,743 --> 00:02:49,322
- [Boy in orange] That must have been old.

54
00:02:49,322 --> 00:02:53,118
- 1968 is when the Yellow
Submarine came out.

55
00:02:53,118 --> 00:02:54,167
Yep.

56
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:56,048
- [Boy in blue] (inaudible)

57
00:02:56,048 --> 00:02:56,570
- All right.

58
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,311
Do you guys want to put
your pyramid up there?

59
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,566
Zach, do you want to help do that?

60
00:02:59,566 --> 00:03:01,132
Do you agree that he was
right on the text structure?

61
00:03:01,132 --> 00:03:04,790
- [Zach] Yeah.

62
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:05,811
- See if you can build it.

63
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,645
I tried to size it just about right,

64
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:10,664
as close as I could get.

65
00:03:10,664 --> 00:03:12,289
So it should fit in there pretty good.

66
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:14,146
- [Zach] I don't think
it's sized up very well.

67
00:03:14,146 --> 00:03:14,750
- [Teacher] What?

68
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,189
I just got it as close as I could, Zach.

69
00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:24,780
It may not be 100% perfect.

70
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,009
And then the person that
didn't read the story

71
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:31,386
can read us what you guys
put for your answers.

72
00:03:31,386 --> 00:03:32,790
- [Girl in blue] That means
we got to do another one.

73
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,058
- You each got a chance to read.

74
00:03:34,058 --> 00:03:35,786
- [Girl in gray] Yeah,
that's the tone one.

75
00:03:35,786 --> 00:03:40,162
- We need one more detail.

76
00:03:40,162 --> 00:03:41,288
Did I make it a little too big,

77
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:42,484
or is it pretty close?

78
00:03:42,484 --> 00:03:43,250
- [Boy in orange] It's a little long.

79
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,527
- [Teacher] Could be a little long, huh?

80
00:03:44,527 --> 00:03:45,526
Had a little extra at the bottom.

81
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:46,988
Next time I'll shrink
it up just a little bit.

82
00:03:46,988 --> 00:03:48,161
- [Zach] We still have one more.

83
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,645
- That's fine.

84
00:03:50,645 --> 00:03:51,103
And who read it?

85
00:03:51,103 --> 00:03:51,881
Was it Zach?

86
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:53,785
- [Boy in orange] (inaudible)

87
00:03:53,785 --> 00:03:56,141
- We'll let Zach read those
when the girls get done.

88
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:56,780
- [Zach] Okay.

89
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,905
Do I read the summary?

90
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:58,820
- [Boy in orange] Do you
just want me to read?

91
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,957
I don't know if he knows.

92
00:03:59,957 --> 00:04:01,002
- [Teacher] Start with the details.

93
00:04:01,002 --> 00:04:03,498
- [Zach] Memoriad is an
unforgettable competition.

94
00:04:03,498 --> 00:04:07,747
Memoriad games is memorize 50-line poems.

95
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:11,670
People compete in the
games called Memoriad.

96
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,547
The game is to memorize it.

97
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,787
(inaudible)

98
00:04:18,787 --> 00:04:23,961
Memorize names and faces and memorize

99
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:28,945
a 50-line poem.

100
00:04:28,945 --> 00:04:29,502
- Very good.

101
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:30,697
And what was your text structure?

102
00:04:30,697 --> 00:04:31,151
- [Zach] Description.

103
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:32,172
- Description, because they were

104
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:36,177
describing all about (inaudible)

105
00:04:36,177 --> 00:04:38,742
- [Boy in orange]
(inaudible) He just talked.

106
00:04:38,742 --> 00:04:39,996
- He did the talking, you did the writing.

107
00:04:39,996 --> 00:04:41,158
Somebody gave you ideas.

108
00:04:41,158 --> 00:04:41,773
- Kinda maybe.

109
00:04:41,773 --> 00:04:43,955
- It was a good partnership.

110
00:04:43,955 --> 00:04:44,838
The girls are just about done.

111
00:04:44,838 --> 00:04:47,519
We'll let them read theirs.

112
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:54,982
And then we'll do our Jeopardy.

113
00:04:54,982 --> 00:04:56,899
- [Boy in orange] Can we
tape the Jeopardy game?

114
00:04:56,899 --> 00:04:59,774
- Mm-hmm, yep.

115
00:04:59,774 --> 00:05:02,222
- [Girl in blue] We have
the same people in Jeopardy

116
00:05:02,222 --> 00:05:02,772
that were in here.

117
00:05:02,772 --> 00:05:06,135
- Yes, it is the same group.

118
00:05:06,135 --> 00:05:11,371
Okay, let's not have a
sword fight right now.

119
00:05:11,371 --> 00:05:12,973
She has one more task there.

120
00:05:12,973 --> 00:05:14,656
She's got it all grammatically correct.

121
00:05:14,656 --> 00:05:16,072
- [Girl in gray] Okay. (inaudible)

122
00:05:16,072 --> 00:05:17,512
- Let's just, Judy over here.

123
00:05:17,512 --> 00:05:19,253
- [Girl in gray] Do you mind
if it's off to the side?

124
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:20,355
- [Boy in orange] There's another one.

125
00:05:20,355 --> 00:05:21,053
- There's two of them.

126
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:22,852
Oh, did it fall off?

127
00:05:22,852 --> 00:05:25,313
Well, we can put a little
piece of tape over it.

128
00:05:25,313 --> 00:05:29,697
Oh, here it is.

129
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:31,931
There you go, that should hold it up good.

130
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:32,858
All right, see if you agree

131
00:05:32,858 --> 00:05:33,973
with what the girls have here.

132
00:05:33,973 --> 00:05:35,633
Are you listening, Zach?

133
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:38,117
Got a pyramid all set up.

134
00:05:38,117 --> 00:05:39,452
- [Girl in blue] Our text structure is,

135
00:05:39,452 --> 00:05:41,495
wait, do I start at the bottom?

136
00:05:41,495 --> 00:05:42,714
- Start at the bottom,

137
00:05:42,714 --> 00:05:45,140
and the details kind
of add to the summary.

138
00:05:45,140 --> 00:06:02,902
- [Girl in blue] (inaudible)

139
00:06:02,902 --> 00:06:04,759
The movie they were talking about

140
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:09,043
was the Yellow Submarine, starring.

141
00:06:09,043 --> 00:06:11,499
Is it starring or staring?

142
00:06:11,499 --> 00:06:12,845
- Starring, I bet.

143
00:06:12,845 --> 00:06:14,077
- [Girl in gray] Starring the Beatles.

144
00:06:14,077 --> 00:06:15,283
- [Girl in blue] The Beatles, okay.

145
00:06:15,283 --> 00:06:17,420
Their song called Being Green

146
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,529
was made in 1970.

147
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:25,384
Summary, the television was made in 1953.

148
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:30,202
Kermit was in 1970.

149
00:06:30,202 --> 00:06:37,341
Stoplight was made in 1920.

150
00:06:37,341 --> 00:06:40,278
They all had one thing in common.

151
00:06:40,278 --> 00:06:41,694
They were in a color.

152
00:06:41,694 --> 00:06:42,414
- Very good.

153
00:06:42,414 --> 00:06:43,656
I love that last sentence.

154
00:06:43,656 --> 00:06:46,256
They all have that in
common, they're in color.

155
00:06:46,256 --> 00:06:47,753
- [Girl in blue] Text
structure is sequence.

156
00:06:47,753 --> 00:06:49,379
- Sequence because?

157
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:50,702
- It tells the order of them.

158
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:51,759
- All the years, very good.

159
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,478
Okay, one of you guys
go grab a marker board,

160
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:54,474
one from each team.

161
00:06:54,474 --> 00:06:55,474
And I'll go get Jeopardy.

162
00:06:55,474 --> 00:07:04,471
And you'll need a marker to
write on the marker board.

163
00:07:04,471 --> 00:07:05,713
I will pull the screen down.

164
00:07:05,713 --> 00:07:07,617
All right, Zach, Zach.

165
00:07:07,617 --> 00:07:09,218
- [Boy in orange] Where are the markers?

166
00:07:09,218 --> 00:07:10,752
- [Teacher] You can grab one back there.

167
00:07:10,752 --> 00:07:12,588
There's one up here.

168
00:07:12,588 --> 00:07:13,886
As long as you got one
or two for your group,

169
00:07:13,886 --> 00:07:15,719
you can take turns.

170
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:26,148
Now, these questions I think
will flow pretty well today.

171
00:07:26,148 --> 00:07:28,505
- [Boy in orange] Whoa,
I can't even see it.

172
00:07:28,505 --> 00:07:29,744
I think the yellow is better.

173
00:07:29,744 --> 00:07:31,709
I know with the lights
on, it's a little harder,

174
00:07:31,709 --> 00:07:34,178
but it helps to have the lights on.

175
00:07:34,178 --> 00:07:36,046
- [Boy in orange] Did we run review?

176
00:07:36,046 --> 00:07:36,581
- [Girl in gray] What?

177
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,066
- [Boy in orange] Did we run review?

178
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:40,168
- [Girl in gray] (inaudible)

179
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,085
- [Zach] Text structure!

180
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,292
- [Teacher] My music didn't come on.

181
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:44,359
- [Zach] Confucius says!

182
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:46,181
Vocab.

183
00:07:46,181 --> 00:07:47,795
Text features.

184
00:07:47,795 --> 00:07:49,386
- [Teacher] Features.

185
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,047
Thank you, Zach.

186
00:07:50,047 --> 00:07:51,083
Yes, they're different.

187
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,302
- [Zach] Confucius says?

188
00:07:52,302 --> 00:07:53,521
- [Teacher] Yeah.

189
00:07:53,521 --> 00:07:55,054
Okay who started first last time?

190
00:07:55,054 --> 00:07:55,716
Was it the guys?

191
00:07:55,716 --> 00:07:56,400
- [Girl in gray] Yeah.

192
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,154
- [Teacher] Okay, we'll
let the gals start today.

193
00:07:58,154 --> 00:07:59,651
- [Girl in blue] So do
I do text structure?

194
00:07:59,651 --> 00:08:01,357
- [Zach] Oh, you're gonna win.

195
00:08:01,357 --> 00:08:02,690
- [Girl in gray] Text structure 500.

196
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,223
- [Teacher] Text structure 500.

197
00:08:04,223 --> 00:08:08,263
- [Girl in gray] Yeah,
what's the "Confucius Says"?

198
00:08:08,263 --> 00:08:11,920
- [Teacher] We had done
these little matching things

199
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,464
way back at the beginning of the year

200
00:08:13,464 --> 00:08:15,345
when we did this unit,
they were little sayings,

201
00:08:15,345 --> 00:08:17,661
and you decide just which
text structure they go with.

202
00:08:17,661 --> 00:08:19,924
- [Girl in gray] So that
might go with text structure.

203
00:08:19,924 --> 00:08:22,061
- [Teacher] Yes, it'll be a
text structure question, yeah.

204
00:08:22,061 --> 00:08:23,163
- [Zach] (humming)

205
00:08:23,163 --> 00:08:24,197
- [Teacher] Is that what you guys wanted

206
00:08:24,197 --> 00:08:24,870
was text structure, right?

207
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,868
- [Girl in gray] Yeah.

208
00:08:25,868 --> 00:08:27,488
- [Teacher] Okay.

209
00:08:27,488 --> 00:08:30,830
- [Girl in blue] In our
state, dams have been built

210
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,654
- [Teacher] Zach.

211
00:08:31,654 --> 00:08:32,908
- [Girl in blue] on many rivers.

212
00:08:32,908 --> 00:08:37,552
These dams are used to product

213
00:08:37,552 --> 00:08:39,166
electricity we need.

214
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,766
But they also create problems.

215
00:08:41,766 --> 00:08:43,279
- [Teacher] Scoot your chair
closer to your partner.

216
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,167
Scoot your chair back.

217
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:50,054
- [Girl in blue] Prevents
the other wildlife

218
00:08:50,054 --> 00:08:51,355
near the rivers.

219
00:08:51,355 --> 00:08:55,209
Therefore, we should
not build any more dams.

220
00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:57,752
Instead, we should use solar energy,

221
00:08:57,752 --> 00:09:02,105
or energy from the sun,
to produce electricity.

222
00:09:02,105 --> 00:09:05,031
This will help us protect our wildlife

223
00:09:05,031 --> 00:09:07,213
and enjoy the natural beauty around us.

224
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,391
- [Teacher] Hmm, which of
the five text structures?

225
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:10,866
- [Girl in blue] We think
it's problem solution.

226
00:09:10,866 --> 00:09:12,271
- [Teacher] Problem solution, correct.

227
00:09:12,271 --> 00:09:13,872
Give yourself 500 points

228
00:09:13,872 --> 00:09:15,951
- [Girl in blue] Because
it said problem in there.

229
00:09:15,951 --> 00:09:17,971
- [Teacher] All right,
what would the guys like?

230
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:19,213
Hey.

231
00:09:19,213 --> 00:09:20,141
- [Boy in orange] Sorry.

232
00:09:20,141 --> 00:09:22,660
Zach, what do you want?

233
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,159
- [Teacher] They did text structure 500.

234
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:26,213
It'll pop up yellow after
I click on the next one.

235
00:09:26,213 --> 00:09:27,710
- [Zach] Vocab for 500.

236
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,323
- [Teacher] Vocab for 500.

237
00:09:30,323 --> 00:09:33,806
Want to read that one, Zach?

238
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:36,847
- You should take some
time to ponder the question

239
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:38,670
before writing your response.

240
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,411
- [Teacher] Hmm, what does ponder mean?

241
00:09:40,411 --> 00:09:41,746
- [Boy in orange] You think.

242
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:43,267
- [Teacher] Ahh, perfect.

243
00:09:43,267 --> 00:09:44,509
To think about.

244
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:46,610
Give yourself 500 points.

245
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,723
All right, what would the gals like?

246
00:09:48,723 --> 00:09:50,383
- [Girl in blue] Should we
try the Confucius question?

247
00:09:50,383 --> 00:09:51,312
- [Girl in gray] Yeah.

248
00:09:51,312 --> 00:09:52,508
- [Girl in blue] For 500.

249
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,063
- [Teacher] Okay, Confucius says for 500.

250
00:09:54,063 --> 00:09:56,060
And Marissa can read this one.

251
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,707
- [Marissa] Confucius
says, "A beautiful sunset

252
00:09:58,707 --> 00:10:00,686
is treasure for the eyes."

253
00:10:00,686 --> 00:10:07,967
- [Teacher] This is one of
the five text structures.

254
00:10:07,967 --> 00:10:08,649
- [Girl in blue] Description?

255
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,895
- [Marissa] Yeah, description.

256
00:10:09,895 --> 00:10:12,019
- [Teacher] Description, very good.

257
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:13,575
And I'll just set these out.

258
00:10:13,575 --> 00:10:14,956
I got something that might help you guys,

259
00:10:14,956 --> 00:10:16,442
since a lot of these have them,

260
00:10:16,442 --> 00:10:18,253
you just kind of have
your choices right there.

261
00:10:18,253 --> 00:10:19,402
What would the guys like?

262
00:10:19,402 --> 00:10:21,632
Very good.

263
00:10:21,632 --> 00:10:23,388
- [Zach] Text features.

264
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:24,884
- Text features 500.

265
00:10:24,884 --> 00:10:27,322
- [Teacher] Text features 500.

266
00:10:27,322 --> 00:10:30,422
- Which text feature is an alphabetical

267
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:34,322
listing of subjects, people,
and places you find in a book?

268
00:10:34,322 --> 00:10:37,143
Index, table of contents, title.

269
00:10:37,143 --> 00:10:38,780
- [Teacher] What do you guys think?

270
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,241
Alphabetical listing.

271
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:42,065
- What do you think, Zach?

272
00:10:42,065 --> 00:10:43,145
- Index.

273
00:10:43,145 --> 00:10:44,619
- (laughs) Index.

274
00:10:44,619 --> 00:10:45,687
- [Teacher] Index would be correct.

275
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,934
Good job, guys.

276
00:10:47,934 --> 00:10:50,737
What would the gals like?

277
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:52,177
- [Girl in blue] Oh, 500.

278
00:10:52,177 --> 00:10:53,582
- [Teacher] Yeah, I just did that 500.

279
00:10:53,582 --> 00:10:57,725
500s are gone.

280
00:10:57,725 --> 00:10:59,642
- [Marissa] Should we
text features for 400?

281
00:10:59,642 --> 00:11:02,044
- [Teacher] 400, okay.

282
00:11:02,044 --> 00:11:03,843
All right, Judy can read this one.

283
00:11:03,843 --> 00:11:06,474
- [Judy] What text
feature gives definition

284
00:11:06,474 --> 00:11:09,045
for vocabulary words?

285
00:11:09,045 --> 00:11:10,124
- [Marissa] Wait, what is it?

286
00:11:10,124 --> 00:11:11,169
Wait.

287
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:12,550
- [Judy] Yeah, what do you mean for that?

288
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,268
- [Teacher] Oh, I didn't,
that one doesn't have

289
00:11:14,268 --> 00:11:15,383
the choices like the other one did.

290
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:19,005
It would be an index,
a glossary, or a title.

291
00:11:19,005 --> 00:11:20,306
- [Judy] Glossary.

292
00:11:20,306 --> 00:11:21,826
- [Teacher] Glossary is correct.

293
00:11:21,826 --> 00:11:22,708
I put the choices on the other ones.

294
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,368
I just must have missed that one.

295
00:11:24,368 --> 00:11:26,028
Very good.

296
00:11:26,028 --> 00:11:26,783
All right

297
00:11:26,783 --> 00:11:27,990
- [Zach] Confucius says for 400.

298
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,950
- [Teacher] Confucius says for 400.

299
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,087
Could you go for Mrs. Lloyd's
for just a couple minutes?

300
00:11:33,087 --> 00:11:34,062
Okay.

301
00:11:34,062 --> 00:11:35,943
- [Boy in orange] I
wanna go tell Mr. Debush.

302
00:11:35,943 --> 00:11:36,581
- [Teacher] That's all right.

303
00:11:36,581 --> 00:11:38,589
I'll just get you guys a
pass here in just a second.

304
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:39,646
We'll do a couple more questions here.

305
00:11:39,646 --> 00:11:41,643
All right, whose turn to read?

306
00:11:41,643 --> 00:11:42,421
- [Boy in orange] It's Zach's.

307
00:11:42,421 --> 00:11:42,989
- [Teacher] Zach's turn?

308
00:11:42,989 --> 00:11:43,488
Okay.

309
00:11:43,488 --> 00:11:45,462
- [Zach] Confucius say,
"First feed the lion,

310
00:11:45,462 --> 00:11:47,099
"then enter cage."

311
00:11:47,099 --> 00:11:48,283
- [Teacher] Hmm.

312
00:11:48,283 --> 00:11:49,455
- Sequence.

313
00:11:49,455 --> 00:11:49,908
- [Teacher] Sequence?

314
00:11:49,908 --> 00:11:50,907
Do you agree with him?

315
00:11:50,907 --> 00:11:51,487
- Yeah.

316
00:11:51,487 --> 00:11:52,857
- [Teacher] Yes, very good.

317
00:11:52,857 --> 00:11:54,134
Sequence.

318
00:11:54,134 --> 00:11:56,928
All right, what would the gals like?

319
00:11:56,928 --> 00:11:58,081
- [Marissa] What one did they do?

320
00:11:58,081 --> 00:12:00,542
- [Teacher] They just did
the Confucius says for 400.

321
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:01,959
- [Marissa] I want to do that one for 400

322
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:03,178
or for 300, right?

323
00:12:03,178 --> 00:12:04,605
- [Judy] I think, yeah.

324
00:12:04,605 --> 00:12:05,986
- Confucius says 300?

325
00:12:05,986 --> 00:12:06,746
Okay.

326
00:12:06,746 --> 00:12:07,253
- [Marissa] Yeah.

327
00:12:07,253 --> 00:12:09,679
- [Teacher] Okay, all right.

328
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:10,434
- Oh man, basketball.

329
00:12:10,434 --> 00:12:11,177
- [Teacher] Whose turn to read?

330
00:12:11,177 --> 00:12:14,230
- [Marissa] Confucius says, "Net in soccer

331
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:19,663
"is much larger than net in basketball."

332
00:12:19,663 --> 00:12:21,346
- [Judy] Compare and.

333
00:12:21,346 --> 00:12:22,821
- [Marissa] Yeah, compare and contrast.

334
00:12:22,821 --> 00:12:25,003
- [Teacher] Very good.

335
00:12:25,003 --> 00:12:27,128
300 points for the gals.

336
00:12:27,128 --> 00:12:28,950
All right, so they did this one, Zach.

337
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,552
What would you guys like?

338
00:12:30,552 --> 00:12:31,527
- [Boy in orange] You
want to do vocab for 400?

339
00:12:31,527 --> 00:12:32,607
- [Zach] Vocab for 400.

340
00:12:32,607 --> 00:12:33,930
- Yeah, vocab.

341
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:34,848
- [Teacher] Vocab for 400?

342
00:12:34,848 --> 00:12:37,749
Okay.

343
00:12:37,749 --> 00:12:39,409
- [Boy in orange] Many
professional golfers

344
00:12:39,409 --> 00:12:43,508
first began playing as amateurs.

345
00:12:43,508 --> 00:12:48,375
- [Teacher] Very good.

346
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:51,614
Just a second.

347
00:12:51,614 --> 00:12:54,273
What do you think?

348
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,434
- [Zach] First players.

349
00:12:55,434 --> 00:12:56,223
- [Teacher] Okay, the first players.

350
00:12:56,223 --> 00:12:57,442
You're exactly right.

351
00:12:57,442 --> 00:12:58,162
- Oh, my gosh.

352
00:12:58,162 --> 00:12:59,242
- People who have done something

353
00:12:59,242 --> 00:13:01,181
for the first time and
they don't get paid.

354
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:02,435
They're amateurs.

355
00:13:02,435 --> 00:13:04,153
All right, what would the gals like?

356
00:13:04,153 --> 00:13:05,314
They did vocab.

357
00:13:05,314 --> 00:13:06,300
- [Judy] Structure.

358
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,055
- [Marissa] Yeah.

359
00:13:07,055 --> 00:13:07,995
- [Teacher] Structure 400?

360
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:08,622
- [Marissa] Yeah.

361
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:12,639
- [Teacher] They want the big point ones.

362
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:13,196
- [Judy] Is it my turn?

363
00:13:13,196 --> 00:13:14,461
- [Marissa] Yeah, I think so.

364
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,296
- [Judy] Living in the
country is very different

365
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,118
than living in the city.

366
00:13:18,118 --> 00:13:22,715
A city dweller need to
be careful of traffic

367
00:13:22,715 --> 00:13:23,980
and other people.

368
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,175
In the country, there are
fewer cars and people.

369
00:13:26,175 --> 00:13:29,472
In the city, many people
can walk to the movies,

370
00:13:29,472 --> 00:13:31,259
stores, and other activities.

371
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:34,475
In the country, people must
drive to get to places.

372
00:13:34,475 --> 00:13:35,532
- [Marissa] Compare and contrast.

373
00:13:35,532 --> 00:13:36,275
- [Judy] Yeah.

374
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:36,959
- [Teacher] Compare and contrast?

375
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:37,796
And she agrees.

376
00:13:37,796 --> 00:13:38,399
Very good.

377
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,198
All right, what would the guys like?

378
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:43,194
- What do you want, Zach?

379
00:13:43,194 --> 00:13:44,610
Vocab for 300.

380
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,257
- [Teacher] Vocab for 300.

381
00:13:47,257 --> 00:13:50,856
- Oh, it's your turn, Zach.

382
00:13:50,856 --> 00:13:52,516
- I depleted my savings when I bought

383
00:13:52,516 --> 00:13:55,476
my new basketball shoes.

384
00:13:55,476 --> 00:13:56,497
- What do you think?

385
00:13:56,497 --> 00:13:58,413
- [Teacher] Hmm, what do you think?

386
00:13:58,413 --> 00:13:59,539
One for depleted.

387
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,292
- [Judy] Oh, I know this one.

388
00:14:01,292 --> 00:14:02,116
- Drained?

389
00:14:02,116 --> 00:14:03,730
- [Teacher] Drained, yep.

390
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,458
Empty, gone, you used all your savings.

391
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,956
And basketball shoes
can cost a lot of money,

392
00:14:07,956 --> 00:14:09,639
so I can see that happening.

393
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:10,893
What would the gals like?

394
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:13,992
- [Marissa] Confucius,
oh wait, no, no, no.

395
00:14:13,992 --> 00:14:15,975
Did they do text structure 300?

396
00:14:15,975 --> 00:14:16,915
- [Teacher] Nope, he just did the vocab.

397
00:14:16,915 --> 00:14:18,540
- [Marissa] Okay, I want to
do text structure for 300.

398
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,539
- [Teacher] Features for 300?

399
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:20,530
- [Marissa] No, text structure.

400
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,435
- [Teacher] Oh, text structure.

401
00:14:21,435 --> 00:14:22,155
I can go back.

402
00:14:22,155 --> 00:14:24,466
Structure for 300.

403
00:14:24,466 --> 00:14:27,333
- [Marissa] The eye is
made up of many parts.

404
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,107
The white part of the eye is called the

405
00:14:30,107 --> 00:14:31,535
- [Teacher] Sclera.

406
00:14:31,535 --> 00:14:34,832
- [Marissa] sclera, and the
colored part is called the iris.

407
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,351
The iris comes in many colors,

408
00:14:37,351 --> 00:14:40,706
including brown, blue, green, and hazel.

409
00:14:40,706 --> 00:14:44,410
The iris is covered with the cornea,

410
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,973
which is clear and round.

411
00:14:47,973 --> 00:14:49,192
Description.

412
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:50,191
- [Teacher] Do you agree?

413
00:14:50,191 --> 00:14:51,108
- [Judy] Yeah.

414
00:14:51,108 --> 00:14:52,548
- I should know about the eye,

415
00:14:52,548 --> 00:14:55,752
because my stepmom's a, she
works at the eye company.

416
00:14:55,752 --> 00:14:58,867
- [Marissa] Wait, did we
just pass text features?

417
00:14:58,867 --> 00:14:59,469
- [Teacher] Oh she does?

418
00:14:59,469 --> 00:15:00,417
They just.
