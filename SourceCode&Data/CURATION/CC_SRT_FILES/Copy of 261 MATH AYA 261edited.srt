1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,031
[Background chatter]

2
00:00:02,031 --> 00:00:03,903
- Oh, water, or more?

3
00:00:04,709 --> 00:00:06,015
- [Voiceover] I guess.

4
00:00:06,623 --> 00:00:08,660
- [Voiceover] And what
gets thrown into the pond?

5
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:09,284
- [Voiceover] The pebble.

6
00:00:09,284 --> 00:00:09,986
- [Voiceover] Is there a pebble?

7
00:00:09,986 --> 00:00:13,032
Oh, that's so cute, okay.

8
00:00:13,032 --> 00:00:15,712
So, wait, what order these,
do these rings show up?

9
00:00:17,099 --> 00:00:17,895
- What order?

10
00:00:17,895 --> 00:00:19,361
- Yeah, like, what's the procedure

11
00:00:19,361 --> 00:00:23,386
when this was like, like
this, and then this one,

12
00:00:23,386 --> 00:00:24,695
or then this one?

13
00:00:24,695 --> 00:00:26,497
- They start small,
and bigger, and bigger.

14
00:00:27,047 --> 00:00:29,075
- So, drop your pebble in
the pond, there you go.

15
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,889
- And it gets bigger as it goes up.

16
00:00:31,889 --> 00:00:33,940
- [Voiceover] Okay, and so
now, maybe talk through...

17
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:38,112
(bell ringing)

18
00:00:38,556 --> 00:00:43,305
Maybe talk through what is the given,

19
00:00:43,305 --> 00:00:44,913
what's the constant rate of change,

20
00:00:44,913 --> 00:00:46,765
where you're looking for
it, and how would that

21
00:00:46,765 --> 00:00:48,370
be seen, visually?

22
00:00:50,326 --> 00:00:52,831
- So, the rate is increasing constantly

23
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:54,360
at one foot per second.

24
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,648
- Per second.

25
00:00:56,926 --> 00:01:01,538
The ADT is two pi R, BR, the first.

26
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:04,536
- [Voiceover] Which one are you guys on?

27
00:01:06,495 --> 00:01:08,042
Number one, okay, good.

28
00:01:08,855 --> 00:01:13,540
- In order for you to find
for QR, may define the ADT.

29
00:01:13,965 --> 00:01:16,246
We need to find the ADT of different orbs.

30
00:01:16,817 --> 00:01:17,489
- [Voiceover] What?

31
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:19,360
- [Voiceover] The ADT
concentrating with them.

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,995
- [Voiceover] So, it's like, four for DR.

33
00:01:20,995 --> 00:01:22,581
- Okay, so.

34
00:01:23,057 --> 00:01:24,746
- What did you do with your sand?

35
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:27,211
Show me what happened here.

36
00:01:27,525 --> 00:01:30,529
- [Voiceover] Okay, air is
gonna come into the clear hole,

37
00:01:30,529 --> 00:01:31,958
and then right into...

38
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:32,863
- You picked the sand problem,

39
00:01:32,863 --> 00:01:34,406
tell me about your sand problem.

40
00:01:36,621 --> 00:01:40,162
- It's talking about sand quality to a,

41
00:01:40,162 --> 00:01:43,318
how to apply it at a rate to be permanent.

42
00:01:43,318 --> 00:01:44,582
- Okay.

43
00:01:45,361 --> 00:01:49,152
- And out of the following,
the diameter of the base in it.

44
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:53,271
Is...

45
00:01:54,655 --> 00:01:56,017
- [Voiceover] It's going
to make the shape of a cone

46
00:01:56,017 --> 00:01:58,637
when you pour it in one
spot, that's the idea.

47
00:02:01,193 --> 00:02:02,597
- [Voiceover] And the shape of the cone

48
00:02:02,597 --> 00:02:06,357
will be approximately
three times however high

49
00:02:06,357 --> 00:02:08,118
the sand is being poured from.

50
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:10,758
- Okay, so, our cone has been smooshed,

51
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:11,987
but you see how it's still kinda narrow,

52
00:02:11,987 --> 00:02:14,264
a little mountain in sort
of the shape of a cone?

53
00:02:14,264 --> 00:02:15,404
- Right.

54
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:18,483
- And what's the unknown,
what are we looking for here?

55
00:02:20,031 --> 00:02:23,079
- We're trying to find the
rate of the height of the pile.

56
00:02:23,454 --> 00:02:24,164
- [Voiceover] Oh, you can do it.

57
00:02:24,164 --> 00:02:25,756
- We said that's possible.

58
00:02:25,756 --> 00:02:29,810
- Okay, so, Kathy, you're
able, would that be

59
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:34,810
DVDT, DHDT, DRDT, all these DTs,

60
00:02:34,857 --> 00:02:36,297
we can kinda run together?

61
00:02:36,297 --> 00:02:37,714
- [Voiceover] Just blow it up?

62
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:38,883
- Can we do AHDT?

63
00:02:38,883 --> 00:02:40,633
- Sure, AHDT because you're looking for

64
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:42,758
a rate of change for the height.

65
00:02:42,758 --> 00:02:44,997
Now, you're actually
on the hardest problem.

66
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:48,492
This is the trickiest problem,
and you have correctly

67
00:02:48,492 --> 00:02:50,577
chosen the cards for these.

68
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,930
But, here's what makes it tricky.

69
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,827
I want you to read through this slowly,

70
00:02:55,827 --> 00:02:59,565
and let's figure out the unknown,

71
00:02:59,565 --> 00:03:03,429
and if they give us, what
other rates they give us.

72
00:03:03,429 --> 00:03:06,436
Now, you actually just told
me what the unknown is, right?

73
00:03:07,995 --> 00:03:09,196
- DHDT?
- DHDT.

74
00:03:09,196 --> 00:03:11,697
Okay, what other variables
do we have on this card

75
00:03:11,697 --> 00:03:14,290
besides DHDT and the rate of change?

76
00:03:14,925 --> 00:03:16,217
- AR, ARDT.

77
00:03:16,217 --> 00:03:18,580
- ARDT, and DVDT.

78
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,060
Okay, now, you read it again
while y'all are listening

79
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:27,060
and see if you can pick out, maybe do DVDT

80
00:03:28,063 --> 00:03:29,199
or DRDT.

81
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,894
- What was that?
- For both.

82
00:03:32,526 --> 00:03:34,693
- At a sand and gravel
plant, sand is falling

83
00:03:34,693 --> 00:03:37,330
off the conveyor and onto
a conical pile at a rate of

84
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,653
10 feet per minute.

85
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:40,061
- Plus?

86
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:43,706
What information did you just get?

87
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,012
You can say it again if you need to.

88
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,696
- Sand is falling off a conveyor and onto

89
00:03:50,696 --> 00:03:55,103
the conical pile at a rate
of 10 cubic feet per minute.

90
00:03:55,465 --> 00:03:56,838
- Okay.

91
00:03:56,838 --> 00:03:58,752
Good, that's DVDT 'cause it's the amount

92
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:00,920
the volume changes, and
the label kinda gets

93
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,484
screwy, too, right?

94
00:04:02,484 --> 00:04:04,552
Okay, so now, we're listening for DRDT.

95
00:04:04,552 --> 00:04:07,548
We hope we hear DRDT because
we need that also, right?

96
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,593
- The diameter of the base of the cone

97
00:04:09,593 --> 00:04:12,444
is approximately three times the altitude.

98
00:04:14,518 --> 00:04:15,579
So...

99
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:20,157
(mumbling)

100
00:04:20,157 --> 00:04:21,531
- Okay, so it's giving us information

101
00:04:21,531 --> 00:04:23,961
about radius compared to altitude,

102
00:04:23,961 --> 00:04:28,406
but it doesn't seem to
be giving us DRDT, right?

103
00:04:29,428 --> 00:04:32,025
Which means we don't have DRDT.

104
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:33,550
- [Voiceover] And the radius is two feet.

105
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,924
- And the radius is two feet.

106
00:04:34,924 --> 00:04:38,058
- [Voiceover] So, what's the height again?

107
00:04:38,058 --> 00:04:41,279
- It's the height of DT.

108
00:04:47,048 --> 00:04:49,310
So, we need to find how fast
the radius is changing...

109
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,636
- So, this right here is the decision.

110
00:04:56,915 --> 00:04:58,266
- Nice.

111
00:04:58,266 --> 00:05:01,924
The DVDT equals four pi R squared

112
00:05:01,924 --> 00:05:04,396
to the DRDT.

113
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,153
- [Voiceover] So, this is the hardest

114
00:05:06,153 --> 00:05:07,018
when you get to the math.

115
00:05:07,018 --> 00:05:11,338
- [Voiceover] What we need to find is DRDT

116
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,717
when the radius equals two feet.

117
00:05:12,717 --> 00:05:13,870
- [Voiceover] Okay.

118
00:05:15,353 --> 00:05:16,870
- [Voiceover] All right.

119
00:05:20,356 --> 00:05:21,445
- [Voiceover] Okay.

120
00:05:21,997 --> 00:05:24,729
I guess the next one we
can figure out right now...

121
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:25,859
- How many cubes we got?

122
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:26,960
- Three.

123
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,608
- Three, okay.

124
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:31,396
All the edges of the cube are expanding

125
00:05:31,396 --> 00:05:33,679
at a rate of three centimeters per second.

126
00:05:34,393 --> 00:05:37,060
How fast is the volume
changing if each edge

127
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,614
is one centimeter?

128
00:05:39,657 --> 00:05:43,526
- [Voiceover] We have you
doing the edges of a cube,

129
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:45,400
the radius of an aired balloon.

130
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,400
(mixed chatter)

131
00:05:52,154 --> 00:05:54,281
- So, the radius, one...

132
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,226
- 370
- 370?

133
00:05:56,226 --> 00:05:57,470
- 370.

134
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,098
- So, D, DS over DT is three?

135
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:02,893
- Right.

136
00:06:02,893 --> 00:06:04,022
- Plug that, we can just plug that in

137
00:06:04,022 --> 00:06:05,566
'cause it's not a constant.

138
00:06:08,064 --> 00:06:09,723
- Tell me a little bit
about the problem you're on.

139
00:06:09,723 --> 00:06:12,336
Does it have three cubes in your problem?

140
00:06:16,546 --> 00:06:19,700
Like, why does it have
three cubes in the box?

141
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:22,278
- We started with that, this other one.

142
00:06:22,278 --> 00:06:23,025
- [Voiceover] Okay.

143
00:06:23,025 --> 00:06:27,150
- And it shows after a
second, it would be that big.

144
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,224
And then after another
second, it would be that big.

145
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,797
- Oh, good, okay, so, it's
showing that it's the same cube,

146
00:06:32,797 --> 00:06:33,828
and it's getting bigger.

147
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:35,623
It's like three stages in an environment.

148
00:06:35,623 --> 00:06:36,853
Very good, very good.

149
00:06:36,853 --> 00:06:38,489
Correct interpretation.

150
00:06:38,489 --> 00:06:39,299
Yes.

151
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:40,538
- And...

152
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,849
It also shows the volume of the...

153
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:48,661
(mumbling)

154
00:06:48,661 --> 00:06:51,544
- Now, what does this question ask you for

155
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:52,129
at the very end?

156
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:53,773
What are you gonna be trying to find?

157
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:58,602
- How fast the volume changes
when it enters from...

158
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:01,261
- Yes.

159
00:07:01,261 --> 00:07:03,570
I have a question for you,
here's a think about it question.

160
00:07:04,723 --> 00:07:09,261
Cause you're finding DVDT when
it is exactly one centimeter,

161
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:11,164
right, that's what the question's asking?

162
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:14,754
Do you think DVDT would
be greater or smaller

163
00:07:14,754 --> 00:07:17,015
when it's past one centimeter?

164
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,464
Do you think the rate of change of volume

165
00:07:20,464 --> 00:07:23,660
will be getting bigger
faster, or will it slow down?

166
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,428
- Slow down.

167
00:07:24,428 --> 00:07:25,940
- Slow down.
- Slow down.

168
00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:29,197
- My challenge to you is
after you do the math problem

169
00:07:29,197 --> 00:07:31,615
and you have your equation to work with,

170
00:07:31,615 --> 00:07:34,245
try two centimeters and
see if you were right.

171
00:07:34,761 --> 00:07:37,025
Yeah, so, go above and
beyond the question.

172
00:07:37,025 --> 00:07:39,496
Was your conjecture right,
or were you like, oh, no,

173
00:07:39,496 --> 00:07:40,961
we were backwards?

174
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:41,843
Kay?
- Okay.

175
00:07:41,843 --> 00:07:43,085
- [Voiceover] The base is
gonna be point oh eight

176
00:07:43,085 --> 00:07:45,414
with the ball, at a descending rate.

177
00:07:45,752 --> 00:07:49,763
And it is asking how fast the
pouch is moving to the wall

178
00:07:49,763 --> 00:07:51,244
in the last part.

179
00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:54,399
- [Voiceover] Oh, you look great.

180
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,647
- [Voiceover] D two?

181
00:07:56,428 --> 00:07:59,772
So, okay, let's pour the sand again.

182
00:08:00,193 --> 00:08:01,649
So, what, five?

183
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:06,514
So, it's pouring at 10
cubic feet per minute.

184
00:08:07,294 --> 00:08:09,258
- [Voiceover] Talking
about the change in output.

185
00:08:09,258 --> 00:08:12,582
(mumbling)

186
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:15,199
- So, what's constant?

187
00:08:16,994 --> 00:08:18,958
- Its cubic feet per minute.

188
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,324
- So, that's the...

189
00:08:20,324 --> 00:08:22,445
- The sand being poured in it.

190
00:08:23,191 --> 00:08:25,005
- So, that's the volume?

191
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:27,407
I don't know.

192
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:29,714
Okay.

193
00:08:30,954 --> 00:08:33,248
We have choices as to who can't...

194
00:08:36,077 --> 00:08:37,368
- I have four.

195
00:08:38,231 --> 00:08:39,597
And zero to bring it down.

196
00:08:39,597 --> 00:08:41,546
Yeah, I'm just gonna bring it down.

197
00:08:43,352 --> 00:08:44,598
- [Voiceover] Problem number what?

198
00:08:44,598 --> 00:08:45,599
Problem one?

199
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:47,381
- [Voiceover] Okay, next problem.

200
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:49,613
Are we agreed?

201
00:08:52,123 --> 00:08:55,150
- A ladder 25 feet long is leaning against

202
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,553
the wall of a house.

203
00:08:56,553 --> 00:08:58,228
The base of the ladder is
pulled away from the wall

204
00:08:58,228 --> 00:09:01,017
at a rate of two feet per second.

205
00:09:01,017 --> 00:09:02,803
How fast is the top moving down the wall

206
00:09:02,803 --> 00:09:05,138
when the base of the ladder
is 24 feet from the wall?

207
00:09:05,857 --> 00:09:07,244
- So, then...

208
00:09:07,697 --> 00:09:10,024
- [Voiceover] You definitely
got the demonstration item

209
00:09:10,024 --> 00:09:12,081
perfect, that's right, that's
exactly what's happening.

210
00:09:12,454 --> 00:09:13,981
- All right.

211
00:09:14,727 --> 00:09:16,148
Okay.

212
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,656
You guys are gonna get this one.

213
00:09:18,656 --> 00:09:20,813
It's what's supposed to be a...

214
00:09:22,524 --> 00:09:23,426
Length.

215
00:09:23,426 --> 00:09:25,189
- [Voiceover] And what
made you pick that one?

216
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,921
- [Voiceover] It's the
Pythagorean theorem.

217
00:09:26,921 --> 00:09:28,189
- [Voiceover] And then why would you wanna

218
00:09:28,189 --> 00:09:29,559
use the Pythagorean theorem?

219
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:31,259
- [Voiceover] Because it's a three sided,

220
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:34,730
it's equal to the right triangle.

221
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,171
- [Voiceover] Yeah, exactly, uh huh.

222
00:09:36,957 --> 00:09:37,982
- [Voiceover] All right.

223
00:09:38,765 --> 00:09:41,136
(mumbling)

224
00:09:43,289 --> 00:09:45,737
- Okay, now I've got a question for ya.

225
00:09:46,092 --> 00:09:47,997
Is there any part of that equation

226
00:09:47,997 --> 00:09:51,289
that will always give
confirmation we want to,

227
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:53,254
that you would actually be
able to substitute a number in

228
00:09:53,254 --> 00:09:54,439
at the very beginning?

229
00:09:55,822 --> 00:09:57,326
Okay, good, good.

230
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,292
- All right.

231
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:02,509
- What would that mean
about your derivative card?

232
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:04,059
What would you know for sure?

233
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:05,690
If you put 25 right there.

234
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,092
- [Voiceover] Get a constant
rate of one foot per second.

235
00:10:08,092 --> 00:10:10,515
- Anything special for
this derivative card?

236
00:10:12,585 --> 00:10:15,235
- DZ over DT equals...

237
00:10:15,764 --> 00:10:17,390
- [Voiceover] Well, if the original,

238
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,591
if your ladder is 25 right here,

239
00:10:20,591 --> 00:10:23,004
where would the 25 originally be put?

240
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,441
- [Voiceover] In the Z.

241
00:10:24,441 --> 00:10:25,296
- [Voiceover] In the Z, okay.

242
00:10:25,296 --> 00:10:27,814
I that would say that X squared
plus Y squared equals 25.

243
00:10:28,157 --> 00:10:31,326
Now, take the derivative of
this with respect to time.

244
00:10:31,326 --> 00:10:33,480
Would it look exactly like
this or a little bit different?

245
00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:36,393
- [Voiceover] One, we're
at a constant rate.

246
00:10:36,393 --> 00:10:37,229
- Right.

247
00:10:37,229 --> 00:10:39,186
And so, when you do your
math, you can go ahead

248
00:10:39,186 --> 00:10:42,980
and put that as zero, and
then just work with those.

249
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:45,706
Good.

250
00:10:46,658 --> 00:10:48,078
That's good.

251
00:10:51,254 --> 00:10:52,635
- [Voiceover] So...

252
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:57,532
- [Voiceover] What's the...

253
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:58,954
- The balloon's increasing.

254
00:10:58,954 --> 00:11:00,029
- Yeah.

255
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:01,994
- [Voiceover] Following the radius.

256
00:11:02,391 --> 00:11:04,575
- It's the, what's the
radius, it's four feet.

257
00:11:05,393 --> 00:11:08,729
The radius, yeah, you have to find

258
00:11:08,729 --> 00:11:11,357
what the radius is at four feet, and...

259
00:11:11,357 --> 00:11:13,343
- [Voiceover] Find the radius
when it's at four feet.

260
00:11:13,955 --> 00:11:15,746
- [Voiceover] Which one are you on?

261
00:11:15,746 --> 00:11:17,302
P two?

262
00:11:17,756 --> 00:11:19,262
- When the radius is four feet,

263
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:20,678
at what rate is the total area

264
00:11:20,678 --> 00:11:22,405
of the disturbed water treatment area?

265
00:11:24,394 --> 00:11:27,443
So, you would define the area.

266
00:11:28,631 --> 00:11:30,504
- [Voiceover] Wait, which, are you on...

267
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:35,414
Okay, so you have three balloons.

268
00:11:35,414 --> 00:11:36,266
- [Voiceover] Right.

269
00:11:36,266 --> 00:11:39,127
- [Voiceover] And you could
use those three balloons

270
00:11:39,127 --> 00:11:41,467
if they are different sizes to show what?

271
00:11:42,361 --> 00:11:43,814
- [Voiceover] Okay.
- [Voiceover] Okay.

272
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:45,646
- [Voiceover] The rate of change.

273
00:11:45,646 --> 00:11:47,896
So, if you have one balloon
and put one back into it,

274
00:11:47,896 --> 00:11:50,007
and then that's when you have...

275
00:11:50,225 --> 00:11:51,598
- Okay, let's see what they look like.

276
00:11:51,598 --> 00:11:52,783
So, let's see if we can
have different stages

277
00:11:52,783 --> 00:11:54,005
of our balloon here.

278
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:56,451
You look like you must
be at the last stage

279
00:11:56,451 --> 00:11:57,647
'cause that looks pretty big.

280
00:11:58,028 --> 00:11:59,479
Okay, that must be the beginning.

281
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:03,661
That looks like the beginning, too.

282
00:12:03,661 --> 00:12:05,075
(laughing)

283
00:12:06,231 --> 00:12:08,254
Can one of 'em get middle stage?

284
00:12:09,288 --> 00:12:10,628
I think you've got the
baby balloon, though,

285
00:12:10,628 --> 00:12:12,516
I think that's the biggest
that guy's getting.

286
00:12:12,988 --> 00:12:15,130
- I didn't know they were different sizes.

287
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:17,342
- Yeah, they are actually different sizes.

288
00:12:18,061 --> 00:12:19,490
One more.

289
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,226
Do it!

290
00:12:20,226 --> 00:12:22,081
And you let some out, maybe you got it.

291
00:12:22,427 --> 00:12:23,828
Oh, perfect, okay.

292
00:12:23,828 --> 00:12:26,277
Tell me about what's going
on with this balloon.

293
00:12:28,393 --> 00:12:30,206
What's goin' on?

294
00:12:31,857 --> 00:12:33,538
- Oh, increase...

295
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,844
- Four cubic feet, and they...

296
00:12:42,985 --> 00:12:44,842
- [Voiceover] Oh, what are they?

297
00:12:45,192 --> 00:12:46,252
- I think I'm thinking of the wrong one.

298
00:12:46,252 --> 00:12:47,555
Like, it's not...

299
00:12:47,555 --> 00:12:49,896
(mumbling)

300
00:12:49,896 --> 00:12:52,265
Like, it's not measuring each breath,

301
00:12:52,265 --> 00:12:53,263
it's something...

302
00:12:53,263 --> 00:12:55,057
- No, you are thinking right.

303
00:12:55,057 --> 00:12:57,149
This is, is this like what we had?

304
00:12:58,016 --> 00:12:59,094
- Two days ago?

305
00:12:59,094 --> 00:13:00,093
- Yeah, a couple days ago.

306
00:13:00,093 --> 00:13:02,419
Like, is, what was
constant a couple days ago

307
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:03,695
in our activity?

308
00:13:04,305 --> 00:13:06,418
- Air is being continuous air pulled away

309
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:07,526
by the rate of...
- Yes.

310
00:13:07,526 --> 00:13:08,422
So, like, the volume, the rate of change

311
00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:09,260
of volume is constant.

312
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,616
Is that true on this or is
that a different problem?

313
00:13:13,997 --> 00:13:16,624
Okay, and so, what is the unknown

314
00:13:16,624 --> 00:13:18,068
that you are trying to figure out?

315
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,487
- The change of the radius.

316
00:13:20,487 --> 00:13:22,294
How the radius is...

317
00:13:22,294 --> 00:13:24,087
- And what do you predict will happen

318
00:13:24,087 --> 00:13:25,342
with the rate of change of radius

319
00:13:25,342 --> 00:13:27,312
with the larger the radius gets?

320
00:13:28,154 --> 00:13:30,102
- It'll stretch out.

321
00:13:30,449 --> 00:13:31,262
- That, I'm sorry?

322
00:13:31,262 --> 00:13:32,286
- It'll slow down.

323
00:13:32,286 --> 00:13:34,723
- Yeah, I think that's a good conjecture.

324
00:13:34,723 --> 00:13:36,064
That would be like what
happened the other day

325
00:13:36,064 --> 00:13:37,531
when we looked at it, slowed down quite a bit

326
00:13:37,531 --> 00:13:38,901
the bigger the radius got.

327
00:13:39,727 --> 00:13:41,256
Sounds good.

328
00:13:41,256 --> 00:13:44,045
And it is because it was what?

329
00:13:44,045 --> 00:13:45,481
- [Voiceover] The volume...

330
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,280
- [Voiceover] 'Cause the volume...

331
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,772
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

332
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,479
(mixed chatter)

333
00:13:58,785 --> 00:14:01,767
- F four for that, that'll go on the left.

334
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:07,276
F four and D six.

335
00:14:07,276 --> 00:14:09,211
- [Voiceover] Have you gotten
to the balloon part yet?

336
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,665
Let's talk about the other one, okay?

337
00:14:11,665 --> 00:14:12,696
One.

338
00:14:12,696 --> 00:14:16,254
Okay, the other balloon
problem was about surface area?

339
00:14:16,254 --> 00:14:17,142
Is that right?

340
00:14:17,142 --> 00:14:18,363
Have you done this one yet?

341
00:14:18,363 --> 00:14:19,092
- Yes.

342
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,715
- Okay, how many, blow up the balloon

343
00:14:20,715 --> 00:14:22,664
and let's see what's
happening in that balloon.

344
00:14:25,845 --> 00:14:28,208
Kevin, what was happening on this balloon?

345
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,996
- [Voiceover] It's the rate of the...

346
00:14:29,996 --> 00:14:31,401
- [Voiceover] The puddle?

347
00:14:32,928 --> 00:14:35,270
- B, a formula problem.

348
00:14:35,863 --> 00:14:39,150
- Okay, so, how is Jesse gonna show us

349
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,477
the surface area of DVDT?

350
00:14:42,801 --> 00:14:45,067
Okay, so let's demo that.

351
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:47,267
Causing ripples.

352
00:14:47,864 --> 00:14:49,424
Thank you, nice demonstration.

353
00:14:49,424 --> 00:14:51,378
(laughing)

354
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,934
What is constant on this problem?

355
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,239
- [Voiceover] The area and then...

356
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,961
Yeah, the radius?
