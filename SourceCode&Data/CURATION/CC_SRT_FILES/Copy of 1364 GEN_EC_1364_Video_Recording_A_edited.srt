1
00:00:00,313 --> 00:00:03,595
- So can you record two on that?

2
00:00:03,595 --> 00:00:06,845
(indistinct crosstalk)

3
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:11,749
- It's harder to write two.

4
00:00:11,749 --> 00:00:13,565
- Remember, here, you
can use your number line

5
00:00:13,565 --> 00:00:15,999
if you need it to help you.

6
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:16,904
Do you want me to turn it?

7
00:00:16,904 --> 00:00:18,487
So there's the two.

8
00:00:19,585 --> 00:00:22,001
Can you try to write it?

9
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:23,501
- [Girl] I did it.

10
00:00:27,682 --> 00:00:30,932
(indistinct crosstalk)

11
00:00:33,581 --> 00:00:34,770
- Awesome.

12
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,408
That looks like a two.

13
00:00:36,408 --> 00:00:39,307
So was this awesome, all
right, or super bad?

14
00:00:39,307 --> 00:00:40,409
- [Girl] Super bad.
- Super bad.

15
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:43,041
Why do you think it was super bad?

16
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:46,391
- [Girl] Because it's not heavy.

17
00:00:46,391 --> 00:00:48,168
- Because it's not heavy.

18
00:00:48,168 --> 00:00:51,603
(speaking indistinctly)

19
00:00:51,603 --> 00:00:55,343
Okay, Julia, what's our second problem?

20
00:00:55,343 --> 00:00:56,413
- Ow.

21
00:00:56,413 --> 00:00:57,916
- [Julia] The styrofoam ball.

22
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,175
- The styrofoam ball.

23
00:00:59,175 --> 00:01:01,673
Can you find the styrofoam ball?

24
00:01:01,673 --> 00:01:04,500
(indistinct crosstalk)

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,527
Yes, that one.

26
00:01:05,527 --> 00:01:07,121
We can, first we're gonna make--

27
00:01:07,121 --> 00:01:09,340
(indistinct crosstalk)

28
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,923
This one is bigger.

29
00:01:12,212 --> 00:01:14,295
How does it feel, though?

30
00:01:15,392 --> 00:01:16,373
Is it round?

31
00:01:16,373 --> 00:01:17,499
(indistinct crosstalk)

32
00:01:17,499 --> 00:01:18,852
It does?

33
00:01:18,852 --> 00:01:20,591
We're gonna be answering
questions over here.

34
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:24,997
Julia, can you let (mumbles)
make his prediction?

35
00:01:24,997 --> 00:01:26,805
(indistinct crosstalk)

36
00:01:26,805 --> 00:01:28,128
Which one did you pick?

37
00:01:28,128 --> 00:01:28,961
- That one.

38
00:01:28,961 --> 00:01:29,794
- You picked all right.

39
00:01:29,794 --> 00:01:30,959
Why did you pick all right?

40
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:33,191
(indistinct crosstalk)

41
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:34,826
Because it's little.

42
00:01:34,826 --> 00:01:36,648
How does it feel?

43
00:01:36,648 --> 00:01:37,481
Feel it.

44
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:39,560
No, it's not heavy.

45
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,902
(indistinct crosstalk)

46
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:43,402
What do you think?

47
00:01:45,153 --> 00:01:47,630
Is there anything that you're wondering about that?

48
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,601
(indistinct crosstalk)

49
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:53,314
What's next?

50
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:56,029
(indistinct crosstalk)

51
00:01:56,029 --> 00:01:57,792
What do you think?

52
00:01:57,792 --> 00:01:59,248
- All right again?

53
00:01:59,248 --> 00:02:00,669
- You think all right, too?

54
00:02:00,669 --> 00:02:03,905
(indistinct crosstalk)

55
00:02:03,905 --> 00:02:05,803
Mark them all right.

56
00:02:05,803 --> 00:02:09,724
(indistinct crosstalk)

57
00:02:09,724 --> 00:02:11,622
You think awesome?

58
00:02:11,622 --> 00:02:14,586
You think it's gonna go 15 or more?

59
00:02:14,586 --> 00:02:15,778
Okay, let's see.

60
00:02:15,778 --> 00:02:17,634
(speaking indistinctly)

61
00:02:17,634 --> 00:02:18,762
Are you ready?

62
00:02:18,762 --> 00:02:22,997
Can you pick up the tape and do it again?

63
00:02:22,997 --> 00:02:25,239
Gonna get the tape.

64
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:28,489
(indistinct crosstalk)

65
00:02:30,135 --> 00:02:33,450
- You're supposed to do it again.

66
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,618
- Because there's another space?

67
00:02:35,618 --> 00:02:37,903
Yep, we're gonna actually do it again

68
00:02:37,903 --> 00:02:40,695
after we do all of them one time.

69
00:02:40,695 --> 00:02:42,280
Okay.

70
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,225
(speaking indistinctly)

71
00:02:46,225 --> 00:02:48,122
(indistinct crosstalk)

72
00:02:48,122 --> 00:02:52,442
Put it this way. Ivan's gonna put it in, is everyone ready?

73
00:02:52,442 --> 00:02:55,748
Oh wait, you have to keep it
upside down so it can push.

74
00:02:55,748 --> 00:02:56,768
Okay?

75
00:02:56,768 --> 00:02:58,738
Can you try it over?

76
00:02:58,738 --> 00:03:00,405
Ivan, are you ready?

77
00:03:05,176 --> 00:03:07,176
Let's try one more time.

78
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,232
I'm gonna put this cup right in front.

79
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:11,089
One more time.

80
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:14,339
(indistinct crosstalk)

81
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:20,988
(speaking indistinctly)

82
00:03:23,426 --> 00:03:26,676
(indistinct crosstalk)

83
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,215
Well, feel it.

84
00:03:29,215 --> 00:03:36,465
(indistinct crosstalk)

85
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,250
Is it heavy?

86
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,500
(indistinct crosstalk)

87
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That's okay. I'm gonna be right back.

88
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:24,000
(indistinct crosstalk)

89
00:04:25,921 --> 00:04:28,877
Has anything surprised you so far?

90
00:04:28,877 --> 00:04:31,822
(speaking indistinctly)

91
00:04:31,822 --> 00:04:33,013
What happened?

92
00:04:33,013 --> 00:04:34,703
(speaking indistinctly)

93
00:04:34,703 --> 00:04:36,036
The orange ball?

94
00:04:37,549 --> 00:04:39,236
So what kind of push was it?

95
00:04:39,236 --> 00:04:40,943
- An awesome.

96
00:04:40,943 --> 00:04:42,336
- [Woman] An awesome push.

97
00:04:42,336 --> 00:04:44,248
So did that surprise you?

98
00:04:44,248 --> 00:04:46,897
You didn't think it was gonna go so far?

99
00:04:46,897 --> 00:04:51,635
- I though it was gonna
go like (whirring noise).

100
00:04:51,635 --> 00:04:52,803
- Is that where the tape went?

101
00:04:52,803 --> 00:04:54,680
So you guys can pick up the tape.

102
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,013
Should we do the green ball?
- The green ball.

103
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,383
Which ball so far...

104
00:05:03,117 --> 00:05:04,756
- [Girl] A zero.

105
00:05:04,756 --> 00:05:05,589
- A zero?

106
00:05:05,589 --> 00:05:08,847
(indistinct crosstalk)

107
00:05:08,847 --> 00:05:10,324
And it didn't move at all?

108
00:05:10,324 --> 00:05:11,157
- Yes.

109
00:05:11,157 --> 00:05:12,279
- Why do you think it didn't move?

110
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,203
- Because it's so tiny.

111
00:05:14,203 --> 00:05:15,036
- It's so tiny.

112
00:05:15,036 --> 00:05:16,520
But does it weigh a lot?

113
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,370
- No.

114
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,420
- No, it didn't.

115
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,056
Do you think that's why it didn't go far?

116
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:23,948
- And it's so tiny.

117
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,414
And it doesn't have more mass.

118
00:05:26,414 --> 00:05:27,982
- Ahh, I see.

119
00:05:27,982 --> 00:05:29,953
So, should we do this again?

120
00:05:29,953 --> 00:05:30,953
- Yeah.

121
00:05:30,953 --> 00:05:31,866
- The super bad is

122
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:33,199
actually this one right here.

123
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,794
- Oh, it's so tiny.

124
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,013
- So feel it.

125
00:05:37,013 --> 00:05:38,389
How does it feel?

126
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:41,927
(indistinct crosstalk)

127
00:05:41,927 --> 00:05:43,344
Let Luka feel it.

128
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:46,752
How does it feel?

129
00:05:46,752 --> 00:05:49,044
(indistinct crosstalk)

130
00:05:49,044 --> 00:05:50,632
So Jacob, why don't you
make your prediction?

131
00:05:50,632 --> 00:05:53,049
From all right to super bad.

132
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,891
What do you think, Sofia?

133
00:05:56,891 --> 00:05:58,169
What did you put?

134
00:05:58,169 --> 00:05:59,840
Why did you put all right?

135
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,090
(indistinct crosstalk)

136
00:06:06,953 --> 00:06:07,874
So right there.

137
00:06:07,874 --> 00:06:09,037
How far do you think it's gonna go?

138
00:06:09,037 --> 00:06:12,287
(indistinct crosstalk)

139
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:16,781
What did you put, Sofia?

140
00:06:16,781 --> 00:06:18,489
Sofia picked...

141
00:06:18,489 --> 00:06:20,489
Luka, what do you think?

142
00:06:22,527 --> 00:06:24,792
Which one do you think?

143
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:26,051
What's it gonna be?

144
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:29,215
Awesome, all right, or super bad?

145
00:06:29,215 --> 00:06:30,510
Good pick, all right.

146
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,202
So we're gonna do it
down here on this one.

147
00:06:32,202 --> 00:06:33,035
All right.

148
00:06:34,452 --> 00:06:35,695
Are you ready?

149
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:36,533
Make your prediction.

150
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:38,529
And then we're gonna put it on the ground.

151
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:39,362
What do you think?

152
00:06:39,362 --> 00:06:41,514
Awesome, all right, or super bad?

153
00:06:41,514 --> 00:06:43,582
(indistinct crosstalk)

154
00:06:43,582 --> 00:06:45,084
Who picked awesome?

155
00:06:45,084 --> 00:06:46,389
Sofia, right?

156
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:49,731
(indistinct crosstalk)

157
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:50,631
Do you guys have anything that you're--

158
00:06:50,631 --> 00:06:52,474
- Remember when we were...

159
00:06:52,474 --> 00:06:56,160
(indistinct crosstalk)

160
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,315
- I do remember when we

161
00:06:57,315 --> 00:06:59,178
were trying to (speaking indistinctly).

162
00:06:59,178 --> 00:07:00,015
What did we find out?

163
00:07:00,015 --> 00:07:00,938
What is it?

164
00:07:00,938 --> 00:07:05,006
(indistinct crosstalk)

165
00:07:05,006 --> 00:07:07,403
What do you think for the second ball?

166
00:07:07,403 --> 00:07:10,621
(indistinct crosstalk)

167
00:07:10,621 --> 00:07:12,144
(speaking indistinctly)

168
00:07:12,144 --> 00:07:13,693
You think a rock is inside?

169
00:07:13,693 --> 00:07:15,057
Maybe.

170
00:07:15,057 --> 00:07:17,044
- If they were rocks, then
they would be so hard.

171
00:07:17,044 --> 00:07:20,295
- That's true, is it really hard?
- A little.

172
00:07:20,295 --> 00:07:21,720
- A little bit hard?

173
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,584
What do you think is inside?

174
00:07:23,584 --> 00:07:24,917
Can we find out?

175
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:28,197
We can open one of these, probably.

176
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,081
Let's put it down first.

177
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:31,225
Everybody write it.

178
00:07:31,225 --> 00:07:35,469
Jacob, are you the recorder?

179
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:37,020
What are you?

180
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,672
The counselor?

181
00:07:38,672 --> 00:07:40,339
Are you the starter?

182
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:43,760
Okay guys, is everyone ready?

183
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,975
(indistinct crosstalk)

184
00:07:46,975 --> 00:07:48,423
You know what? We're gonna do it one more time

185
00:07:48,423 --> 00:07:50,383
so that it knocks over the cup.

186
00:07:50,383 --> 00:07:53,633
(indistinct crosstalk)

187
00:07:59,048 --> 00:08:01,390
We can move the tape now.

188
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,640
(indistinct crosstalk)

189
00:08:08,773 --> 00:08:10,675
Sofia, we need you to count.

190
00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:12,928
Move the cup over.

191
00:08:12,928 --> 00:08:14,180
How far did it go?

192
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,250
- One, two, three, four, five,

193
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,583
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

194
00:08:22,275 --> 00:08:23,611
- Will you count again with me?

195
00:08:23,611 --> 00:08:24,823
Ready?

196
00:08:24,823 --> 00:08:27,425
- [Both] One, two, three,

197
00:08:27,425 --> 00:08:30,758
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

198
00:08:36,613 --> 00:08:38,635
Jacob, this went 10.

199
00:08:38,635 --> 00:08:40,548
Can you write 10 down?
- No!

200
00:08:40,548 --> 00:08:44,509
(indistinct crosstalk)

201
00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:45,708
- For the super bad, it went 10.

202
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,340
Yep.

203
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,367
- It's super awesome.

204
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:50,200
- So what do you think?

205
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,033
Where did it go?

206
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:54,329
Was it awesome, all right, or super bad?

207
00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:55,162
- Awesome.

208
00:08:55,162 --> 00:08:55,995
- All right.

209
00:08:55,995 --> 00:08:56,828
- It was all right.

210
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:57,661
Why was it all right?

211
00:08:57,661 --> 00:09:01,081
(indistinct crosstalk)

212
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:03,664
And is 10 more or less than 15?

213
00:09:05,491 --> 00:09:06,574
Less than 15.

214
00:09:07,499 --> 00:09:09,489
So that's why it's all right.

215
00:09:09,489 --> 00:09:11,352
Okay guys, I'm gonna go to the next group.

216
00:09:11,352 --> 00:09:13,676
Now what you're gonna do is trial two.

217
00:09:13,676 --> 00:09:16,224
You're gonna do every ball one more time.

218
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:17,057
Okay? Yep.

219
00:09:17,908 --> 00:09:21,158
(indistinct crosstalk)

220
00:09:23,048 --> 00:09:24,808
We're gonna do it one more time.

221
00:09:24,808 --> 00:09:26,844
Okay, I will be right back.

222
00:09:26,844 --> 00:09:30,094
(indistinct crosstalk)

223
00:09:32,592 --> 00:09:34,759
(yelling)

224
00:09:36,281 --> 00:09:39,531
(indistinct crosstalk)

225
00:09:41,524 --> 00:09:44,397
How's it going over here?

226
00:09:44,397 --> 00:09:46,315
Has anything surprised you?

227
00:09:46,315 --> 00:09:49,565
(indistinct crosstalk)

228
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,200
What surprised you?

229
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,450
(indistinct crosstalk)

230
00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:59,471
Which ball didn't push it very far?

231
00:09:59,471 --> 00:10:02,013
(indistinct crosstalk)

232
00:10:02,013 --> 00:10:04,733
Wait, how far did it actually push?

233
00:10:04,733 --> 00:10:07,144
So that means that the
cup didn't move at all?

234
00:10:07,144 --> 00:10:07,977
(indistinct crosstalk)

235
00:10:07,977 --> 00:10:09,991
Why do you think the cup didn't move?

236
00:10:09,991 --> 00:10:12,177
(indistinct crosstalk)

237
00:10:12,177 --> 00:10:14,010
Because it's so light?

238
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:18,081
Which one moved the farthest so far?

239
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,777
Which ball?

240
00:10:19,777 --> 00:10:20,709
(indistinct crosstalk)

241
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:22,157
The orange one?

242
00:10:22,157 --> 00:10:24,385
Is the orange ball really light?

243
00:10:24,385 --> 00:10:25,870
(indistinct crosstalk)

244
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,169
How does the orange one feel?

245
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:29,511
(indistinct crosstalk)

246
00:10:29,511 --> 00:10:31,344
Like it has more mass?

247
00:10:32,727 --> 00:10:34,140
Is there anything you guys

248
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,027
are wondering about?

249
00:10:36,027 --> 00:10:39,094
(indistinct crosstalk)

250
00:10:39,094 --> 00:10:40,583
If they're bouncy?

251
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,800
Let's put this ball back.

252
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,986
Does that one bounce?

253
00:10:44,986 --> 00:10:46,727
(indistinct crosstalk)

254
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:48,377
I wonder why not.

255
00:10:48,377 --> 00:10:52,170
(indistinct crosstalk)

256
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,898
Okay, so what are we
putting next on your sheet?

257
00:10:54,898 --> 00:10:56,353
What should you do?

258
00:10:56,353 --> 00:10:57,832
(indistinct crosstalk)

259
00:10:57,832 --> 00:10:59,238
Are you putting the rubber ball?

260
00:10:59,238 --> 00:11:00,087
(indistinct crosstalk)

261
00:11:00,087 --> 00:11:00,920
Yeah.

262
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,335
Are you guys all putting

263
00:11:02,335 --> 00:11:05,035
that you think it's
gonna be an awesome push?

264
00:11:05,035 --> 00:11:05,868
(indistinct crosstalk)

265
00:11:05,868 --> 00:11:06,701
Ready?

266
00:11:06,701 --> 00:11:10,477
(indistinct crosstalk)

267
00:11:10,477 --> 00:11:11,310
Put tape here.

268
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,641
Alexandra, are you the taper?

269
00:11:12,641 --> 00:11:15,891
(indistinct crosstalk)

270
00:11:18,313 --> 00:11:20,480
(yelling)

271
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:24,887
(indistinct crosstalk)

272
00:11:30,021 --> 00:11:31,517
- It's on the wrong side.

273
00:11:31,517 --> 00:11:33,850
- No, she got it, she did it.

274
00:11:35,176 --> 00:11:36,315
So move the cup over.

275
00:11:36,315 --> 00:11:37,208
Now Nicholas is gonna count.

276
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,708
- One, two, three, four, five,

277
00:11:43,423 --> 00:11:46,090
six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11.

278
00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:52,569
(indistinct crosstalk)

279
00:11:59,787 --> 00:12:02,125
- Can you help write in 13?

280
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:05,375
(indistinct crosstalk)

281
00:12:07,925 --> 00:12:11,104
Yeah, this one right here
has a one and a three.

282
00:12:11,104 --> 00:12:13,494
Can you try writing that?

283
00:12:13,494 --> 00:12:14,838
- It's gonna have one more.

284
00:12:14,838 --> 00:12:17,228
- [Woman] It's gonna have one more?

285
00:12:17,228 --> 00:12:20,864
So if the styrofoam ball went zero,

286
00:12:20,864 --> 00:12:23,197
and the orange ball went 13,

287
00:12:24,632 --> 00:12:26,508
which one is more?

288
00:12:26,508 --> 00:12:27,341
- 13.

289
00:12:27,341 --> 00:12:29,132
- How do you know that?

290
00:12:29,132 --> 00:12:30,775
You just know that?

291
00:12:30,775 --> 00:12:32,472
(indistinct crosstalk)

292
00:12:32,472 --> 00:12:33,873
When you count, does it come higher?

293
00:12:33,873 --> 00:12:35,700
Yes, it does?

294
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,037
Okay, Ivan's ball is next.

295
00:12:37,037 --> 00:12:39,894
We need to do a trial shoot of which one?

296
00:12:39,894 --> 00:12:43,099
(indistinct crosstalk)

297
00:12:43,099 --> 00:12:43,937
Okay.

298
00:12:43,937 --> 00:12:47,187
(indistinct crosstalk)

299
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:51,285
- You have a red...

300
00:12:51,285 --> 00:12:52,342
- Yeah, mine.

301
00:12:52,342 --> 00:12:54,101
- What do you guys think about this ball?

302
00:12:54,101 --> 00:12:55,539
- It's awesome.

303
00:12:55,539 --> 00:12:56,372
- It's awesome?

304
00:12:56,372 --> 00:12:57,872
Why is it awesome?

305
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:01,057
- It's awesome because it's red

306
00:13:01,057 --> 00:13:03,857
and it's the Cardinals' color.

307
00:13:03,857 --> 00:13:06,821
(indistinct crosstalk)

308
00:13:06,821 --> 00:13:09,811
(yelling)

309
00:13:09,811 --> 00:13:13,061
(indistinct crosstalk)

310
00:13:17,698 --> 00:13:19,198
- Well, I would love for you to come.

311
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:20,676
Should we see how far it goes?

312
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:22,740
All right, let's check it.

313
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,482
(indistinct crosstalk)

314
00:13:26,482 --> 00:13:28,136
(yelling)

315
00:13:28,136 --> 00:13:28,969
It knocked the cup over.

316
00:13:28,969 --> 00:13:30,515
Let's try one more time.

317
00:13:30,515 --> 00:13:33,765
(indistinct crosstalk)

318
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,701
(yelling)

319
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:40,534
It knocked it over again.

320
00:13:40,534 --> 00:13:42,571
We're gonna put the tape here.

321
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,821
(indistinct crosstalk)

322
00:13:47,506 --> 00:13:49,500
Do you think that was
farther than the rubber ball?

323
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,750
(indistinct crosstalk)

324
00:13:54,121 --> 00:13:57,123
But when the ball goes farther.

325
00:13:57,123 --> 00:14:00,373
(indistinct crosstalk)

326
00:14:09,844 --> 00:14:12,094
Seven, eight, nine, 10, 11.

327
00:14:14,825 --> 00:14:18,075
(indistinct crosstalk)

328
00:14:26,704 --> 00:14:27,537
What?

329
00:14:27,537 --> 00:14:28,766
- Can you find it on the number line?

330
00:14:28,766 --> 00:14:29,859
Where's 11?

331
00:14:29,859 --> 00:14:32,852
Uh huh, that's what it looks like.

332
00:14:32,852 --> 00:14:35,102
Is 11 more or less than 13?

333
00:14:36,365 --> 00:14:40,114
(indistinct crosstalk)

334
00:14:40,114 --> 00:14:42,561
Is it more than 13 or less?

335
00:14:42,561 --> 00:14:43,913
Which one?

336
00:14:43,913 --> 00:14:45,198
(speaking indistinctly)

337
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:46,031
Is what?

338
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:48,492
- More than.

339
00:14:48,492 --> 00:14:49,796
- Is more than 11?

340
00:14:49,796 --> 00:14:51,222
If you look on the number line.

341
00:14:51,222 --> 00:14:54,639
