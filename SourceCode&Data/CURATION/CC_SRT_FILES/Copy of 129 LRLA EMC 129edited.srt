1
00:00:00,117 --> 00:00:01,383
- ... and your ideas, and we're

2
00:00:01,383 --> 00:00:03,063
learning from each other, right?

3
00:00:03,063 --> 00:00:06,104
Because a lot of times,
who do we learn from?

4
00:00:06,104 --> 00:00:06,891
- You.

5
00:00:06,891 --> 00:00:07,701
- Each other.

6
00:00:07,701 --> 00:00:09,268
- You learn from me but
who else do you learn from?

7
00:00:09,268 --> 00:00:11,171
- Us. - You learn from each other.

8
00:00:11,171 --> 00:00:13,450
Okay, Kelly if you would move the book

9
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,360
away from the projector
so we can see the screen.

10
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,002
We're going to watch
another weather forecast,

11
00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:20,115
and as you're viewing this,

12
00:00:20,115 --> 00:00:23,504
I want you to pay really
close attention to how she...

13
00:00:23,504 --> 00:00:24,211
- Talks.

14
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:26,102
- How she speaks. Okay.

15
00:00:26,102 --> 00:00:28,720
As a good listener and a viewer,

16
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,737
what are some things that
we need to concentrate on

17
00:00:30,737 --> 00:00:32,094
while we're watching this?

18
00:00:32,094 --> 00:00:35,904
- How she, her face, her expression
and how she moves and looks.

19
00:00:35,904 --> 00:00:38,423
- Okay, and how are you going to find out

20
00:00:38,423 --> 00:00:39,745
if she does those things?

21
00:00:39,745 --> 00:00:40,297
- By watching her?

22
00:00:40,297 --> 00:00:41,902
- You're going to be watching her, okay...

23
00:00:41,902 --> 00:00:42,734
Sarah?

24
00:00:42,734 --> 00:00:51,231
- Watch how her body is
moving because... (inaudible)

25
00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:52,189
Watch her eyes.

26
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:53,099
- Okay, catch your eye.

27
00:00:53,099 --> 00:00:54,501
And I like that you said watching.

28
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:55,934
What are you doing while you're watching?

29
00:00:55,934 --> 00:00:57,837
Are you just staring at the screen?

30
00:00:57,837 --> 00:01:01,636
- No. You are looking at them

31
00:01:01,636 --> 00:01:05,639
and you're making eye
contact, and you're looking;

32
00:01:05,639 --> 00:01:09,898
you're watching their mouths
because there are people

33
00:01:09,898 --> 00:01:14,143
who can't really hear, so they
would read people's mouths,

34
00:01:14,143 --> 00:01:17,385
and that's really important to do.

35
00:01:17,385 --> 00:01:20,777
- Anything else that you can
do while you're viewing this?

36
00:01:20,777 --> 00:01:22,541
- Listening.

37
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,365
- Okay, and how are you
going to be listening?

38
00:01:24,365 --> 00:01:26,206
We talked about this a lot.
How are we going to listen?

39
00:01:26,206 --> 00:01:28,867
- With our ears and with
our whole entire bodies.

40
00:01:28,867 --> 00:01:30,451
- With our whole entire bodies.

41
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:32,341
Why are we going to listen
with our whole entire body?

42
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:33,437
Naomi.

43
00:01:33,437 --> 00:01:39,370
- Because if we're listening with our ears,

44
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,504
then our hands are up here saying,

45
00:01:41,504 --> 00:01:43,413
"Oh, I've got something to say,"

46
00:01:43,413 --> 00:01:46,603
then you're not really listening,

47
00:01:46,603 --> 00:01:51,715
you're not really listening competently.

48
00:01:51,715 --> 00:02:04,524
- All right, can you go ahead
and hit play for us, please?

49
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:14,374
Yup, just like you did yesterday.

50
00:02:14,374 --> 00:02:16,362
- Good afternoon, I'm Julie
Wunder with your forecast.

51
00:02:16,362 --> 00:02:18,617
47 today with mostly sunny skies.

52
00:02:18,617 --> 00:02:21,177
A north wind, five to ten miles per hour.

53
00:02:21,177 --> 00:02:23,940
Tonight 28, it's going
to be partly cloudy out,

54
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,013
and we can head to a 7-day forecast.

55
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:28,532
About a 50 percent chance
of rain transitioning over

56
00:02:28,532 --> 00:02:32,047
to some snow overnight
Saturday and into Sunday.

57
00:02:32,047 --> 00:02:35,094
Temperatures fall next week,
what a cold forecast we have.

58
00:02:35,094 --> 00:02:37,715
Coming up at 5 o'clock,
we'll have the latest on that

59
00:02:37,715 --> 00:02:40,615
possibility of snow.

60
00:02:40,615 --> 00:02:42,814
- Turn and talk to your buddy. We're going

61
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:48,431
to do two right here, two, two, two...

62
00:02:48,431 --> 00:02:51,288
- I noticed that under one of the clouds

63
00:02:51,288 --> 00:02:55,048
we had snow instead of rain.

64
00:02:55,048 --> 00:03:23,251
(inaudible)

65
00:03:23,251 --> 00:04:51,160
- Turn your face...

66
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,563
- Okay and what kind of
body language did she use?

67
00:04:54,563 --> 00:04:55,911
- She was pointing and ...

68
00:04:55,911 --> 00:05:07,931
(Inaudible)

69
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:10,372
- So why do you think she
was pointing like that?

70
00:05:10,372 --> 00:05:24,772
(inaudible)

71
00:05:24,772 --> 00:05:34,453
- Okay.

72
00:05:34,453 --> 00:05:36,021
- And because you saw her looking at you,

73
00:05:36,021 --> 00:05:37,762
did that make you listen any differently?

74
00:05:37,762 --> 00:05:40,006
(inaudible)

75
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,857
- Did it help you listen more or less?

76
00:05:41,857 --> 00:05:50,805
(inaudible)

77
00:05:50,805 --> 00:05:53,950
- When she looked away,
what was she doing?

78
00:05:53,950 --> 00:06:20,008
(inaudible)

79
00:06:20,008 --> 00:06:22,114
- Alright, so why do you
think she wasn't doing this?

80
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:24,520
Okay like you say, she
was like. Why is that?

81
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:31,880
(Inaudible)

82
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,785
- Would you be listening as well

83
00:06:33,785 --> 00:06:35,646
if she were making those faces?

84
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:39,004
Or would you (inaudible) her face?

85
00:06:39,004 --> 00:06:41,382
- Right, not necessarily
what she was saying

86
00:06:41,382 --> 00:06:43,501
but you were focusing on her expressions.

87
00:06:43,501 --> 00:07:21,689
(inaudible)

88
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:26,238
- Alright guys let's come
back in three, two, and one.

89
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:29,286
Okay, you guys had some amazing things

90
00:07:29,286 --> 00:07:31,798
that you saw when you
watched this little clip.

91
00:07:31,798 --> 00:07:33,761
- What kind of things did you notice?

92
00:07:33,761 --> 00:07:35,539
Tell me what you and your
buddy were talking about.

93
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:39,785
- We used this chart.

94
00:07:39,785 --> 00:07:51,609
If she was just like there...

95
00:07:51,609 --> 00:07:53,120
she was pointing at it

96
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,862
so then it made me understand more

97
00:07:55,862 --> 00:07:58,503
but if she was just like there...
?
98
00:07:58,503 --> 00:08:00,051
- [Teacher] When you
did your presentation,

99
00:08:00,051 --> 00:08:01,581
what did you feel like
you were looking at?

100
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:02,628
- My poster.

101
00:08:02,628 --> 00:08:04,897
- [Teacher] You looked at
your poster the whole time?

102
00:08:04,897 --> 00:08:06,421
Okay, and the second time

103
00:08:06,421 --> 00:08:08,270
when you did your presentation again,

104
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,236
you said you were really
focusing on your eye contact,

105
00:08:11,236 --> 00:08:12,970
were you able to achieve that goal?

106
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,018
- No - [Teacher] No? Why not?

107
00:08:15,018 --> 00:08:17,624
- Because I was looking
at my poster again.

108
00:08:17,624 --> 00:08:19,733
- [Teacher] You say you were
looking at your poster again.

109
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:25,148
Okay, why do you think you did that?

110
00:08:25,148 --> 00:08:26,857
Were you nervous?

111
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:28,909
What do you think you could've done

112
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:34,173
to ease that nervousness?

113
00:08:34,173 --> 00:08:35,727
- Take a breath. - [Teacher]
Going to take a breath?

114
00:08:35,727 --> 00:08:37,065
What do you guys think?
What could Adrian have done

115
00:08:37,065 --> 00:08:39,402
to maybe be a little less nervous

116
00:08:39,402 --> 00:08:41,620
when he was doing his presentation?

117
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,008
- He could think about
somewhere he was comfortable.

118
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:47,154
- Okay, think about somewhere
where's he's comfortable.

119
00:08:47,154 --> 00:08:49,165
- Picture everyone else
in their underwear.

120
00:08:49,165 --> 00:08:51,767
- Oh, underwear. Sarah.

121
00:08:51,767 --> 00:08:56,228
- Be himself and just act
like it's just any other day.

122
00:08:56,228 --> 00:09:01,128
(inaudible)

123
00:09:01,128 --> 00:09:04,469
- The information we were presenting

124
00:09:04,469 --> 00:09:05,941
was it a little bit more in depth

125
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:09,082
than what we usually talk about?

126
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,467
What do you think?

127
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,478
Was the topic you were
sharing a little bit,

128
00:09:12,478 --> 00:09:14,124
you have a little bit
more information than

129
00:09:14,124 --> 00:09:16,209
if you were just sitting
here having a conversation?

130
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:16,973
- Yeah.

131
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,408
- So that make some of us nervous

132
00:09:18,408 --> 00:09:20,796
that we have a lot of
information trying to remember?

133
00:09:20,796 --> 00:09:22,936
- Yes.

134
00:09:22,936 --> 00:09:27,510
- And then, was anyone able
to get over that nervousness?

135
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,670
- Okay. Sarah, how were you guys able

136
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,002
to get over that nervousness?

137
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:33,963
- I followed my goals and
I just tried to be myself.

138
00:09:33,963 --> 00:09:40,674
I just followed my goals
and I just had fun.

139
00:09:40,674 --> 00:09:41,748
- Okay, do you want to show us part

140
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,341
of your presentation where you did that?

141
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:45,580
- Mhmm.

142
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,998
- Avril, will you move the
book away from the projector

143
00:09:47,998 --> 00:09:52,901
while she gets the computer ready?

144
00:09:52,901 --> 00:10:07,888
Alright, make sure you get
to a spot where you can see.

145
00:10:07,888 --> 00:10:30,676
Got it?

146
00:10:30,676 --> 00:10:34,463
- My project is about
Legends of the (inaudible)

147
00:10:34,463 --> 00:10:38,566
I'm going to start over with Werewolves

148
00:10:38,566 --> 00:10:42,642
people think that ...

149
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:48,336
I don't know why because
wolves howl at the moon

150
00:10:48,336 --> 00:10:52,095
This is a werewolf, a full moon

151
00:10:52,095 --> 00:10:56,750
is sometimes called a Wolf's Moon...

152
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:03,575
since its yellow (inaudible).

153
00:11:03,575 --> 00:11:06,631
This one is my favorite.

154
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:09,001
It's about (inaudible)

155
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,072
... she calls her brother
Helius to find her sister Herse.

156
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:14,822
(inaudible)

157
00:11:14,822 --> 00:11:20,095
The study of geography to the
moon is called Selenology.

158
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:24,675
Okay this is ... (inaudible)

159
00:11:24,675 --> 00:11:29,201
This is vampires, vampires
are said to come out

160
00:11:29,201 --> 00:11:30,563
on every moon except for new moon

161
00:11:30,563 --> 00:11:33,021
I guess because they can see better.

162
00:11:33,021 --> 00:11:37,927
This is a vampire person
trying to get his girlfriend

163
00:11:37,927 --> 00:11:41,211
to become a vampire.

164
00:11:41,211 --> 00:11:43,692
This is people, people
think (inaudible) to people

165
00:11:43,692 --> 00:11:52,201
that are aggressive and
violent... (inaudible)

166
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:54,770
This is a witch from... (inaudible)

167
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:57,200
- Okay turn to your buddy for a second.

168
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,866
Do you think she was able; she said

169
00:11:58,866 --> 00:12:01,568
she acted like she was comfortable.

170
00:12:01,568 --> 00:12:03,722
Like it was just any other day.

171
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:04,234
- Yeah.

172
00:12:04,234 --> 00:12:05,649
- Talk to your buddy about that.

173
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:07,965
Do you think that she
accomplished that goal?

174
00:12:07,965 --> 00:12:40,998
- Yes. (inaudible)

175
00:12:40,998 --> 00:12:46,252
- Because she's a pretty
funny girl, right?

176
00:12:46,252 --> 00:12:50,990
Alright. Let's come back together.

177
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,278
Let's come back together please.

178
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:55,940
Alright. So her goal,
she said that she wanted

179
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,549
to be more comfortable.

180
00:12:57,549 --> 00:12:59,665
And she was just going to
act like it was any other ...

181
00:12:59,665 --> 00:13:00,762
- Day.

182
00:13:00,762 --> 00:13:02,156
- Did she accomplish that?

183
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:02,997
- Yes.

184
00:13:02,997 --> 00:13:04,802
- Okay. How do we know
that she accomplished that?

185
00:13:04,802 --> 00:13:06,269
What do you think Arizona?

186
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:08,321
- [Arizona] Because she
was really comfortable

187
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:11,206
with her surroundings and
those people just wanted

188
00:13:11,206 --> 00:13:14,396
to get their talking over with and done

189
00:13:14,396 --> 00:13:17,281
but Sarah actually
talked like we were just

190
00:13:17,281 --> 00:13:18,926
talking face to face

191
00:13:18,926 --> 00:13:21,093
acting like the camera wasn't even there.

192
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:23,104
- Okay. And as a listener,

193
00:13:23,104 --> 00:13:27,147
how did Sarah's confidence

194
00:13:27,147 --> 00:13:29,098
make you listen better?

195
00:13:29,098 --> 00:13:30,235
Did it make you listen better

196
00:13:30,235 --> 00:13:32,217
or did it not make you
listen better? It did?

197
00:13:32,217 --> 00:13:34,451
Okay. Why did it make
you listen better, Levin?

198
00:13:34,451 --> 00:13:35,061
- Because it was fun.

199
00:13:35,061 --> 00:13:36,758
- Because it was fun? Okay.

200
00:13:36,758 --> 00:13:38,810
And what made it fun?

201
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:42,732
- She was acting like,
the way she was acting

202
00:13:42,732 --> 00:13:44,214
- The way she was acting? Okay.

203
00:13:44,214 --> 00:13:46,022
What did you think, Dillon?

204
00:13:46,022 --> 00:13:47,505
- Because she's usually funny

205
00:13:47,505 --> 00:13:49,558
and she was being quite funny on this.

206
00:13:49,558 --> 00:13:50,707
- Okay.

207
00:13:50,707 --> 00:13:53,519
- And I like to... (inaudible)

208
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,694
- Yup. Alright, anybody else?

209
00:13:58,694 --> 00:14:00,615
- What were some other
goal that you guys created?

210
00:14:00,615 --> 00:14:05,762
Sit up and join the circle please.

211
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:09,539
Alright, let's see. Someone
I haven't heard from yet.

212
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:11,584
Isabelle, what was one of your goals?

213
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:14,603
- One of my goals was

214
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:17,210
to stop making really
distracting movements

215
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,525
because I was like
twisting it and twirling it

216
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,354
and I was really nervous.

217
00:14:21,354 --> 00:14:22,584
- Alright so that was the first time

218
00:14:22,584 --> 00:14:23,493
you did your presentation,

219
00:14:23,493 --> 00:14:25,504
you felt you were doing
too many movements.

220
00:14:25,504 --> 00:14:26,004
- Yeah.

221
00:14:26,004 --> 00:14:28,962
- And so your goal was to cut down on that

222
00:14:28,962 --> 00:14:32,740
and why did you choose that as a goal?

223
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:36,668
- Really, when we watched my first video,

224
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:43,919
we decided that, (inaudible) she said that

225
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:48,582
she was kind of watching
that and she couldn't really

226
00:14:48,582 --> 00:14:52,498
have her attention stay
on what I was saying.

227
00:14:52,498 --> 00:14:53,615
- And did you agree with her?

228
00:14:53,615 --> 00:14:54,117
- Mhmm.

229
00:14:54,117 --> 00:14:56,268
- Okay, so what did you do
with your second presentation?

230
00:14:56,268 --> 00:14:59,658
- I really was concentr...
