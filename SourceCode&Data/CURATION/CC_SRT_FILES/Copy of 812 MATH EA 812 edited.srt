1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,070
[Background Chatter]

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,127
- So, you're saying here,
why did you pick it,

3
00:00:06,127 --> 00:00:08,297
why did you pick the
two points that you did.

4
00:00:08,297 --> 00:00:10,619
[Inaudible]
Okay, why.

5
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:13,545
[Inaudible]
Are they random?

6
00:00:13,545 --> 00:00:16,146
[inaudible]

7
00:00:16,146 --> 00:00:18,375
No, you just tell me
why you think those two.

8
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:19,605
What?
[inaudible]

9
00:00:19,605 --> 00:00:23,613
Okay, average? Okay.

10
00:00:25,446 --> 00:00:26,285
So I'll come back here in a minute,

11
00:00:26,285 --> 00:00:28,279
I'm gonna tend to this table.

12
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:32,277
[Background Chatter]

13
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:35,468
What, okay, what is?

14
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:37,474
I don't know what I would there.

15
00:00:38,804 --> 00:00:40,144
'Cause they have the, what is the

16
00:00:40,144 --> 00:00:44,149
all right, what is, and what is.

17
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:46,587
[Inaudible]

18
00:00:48,977 --> 00:00:52,531
You guys, it should say
what is the slope, okay.

19
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:54,702
It should say what is the slope.

20
00:00:55,942 --> 00:00:58,855
- It represents the y-intercept.

21
00:01:00,445 --> 00:01:05,157
Yeah, it said what is the
[Inaudible].

22
00:01:05,157 --> 00:01:17,493
[Background Chatter]

23
00:01:18,071 --> 00:01:19,265
- That's what I'm saying.

24
00:01:19,265 --> 00:01:22,479
[inaudible] people.

25
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,677
- All right, I'm just sayin'

26
00:01:23,677 --> 00:01:26,021
it would [inaudible].
- Okay, three.

27
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:28,077
Can I have your attention
real quick please.

28
00:01:28,077 --> 00:01:31,572
All right, once you find,
I see most of you have

29
00:01:31,572 --> 00:01:33,029
yours in point slope

30
00:01:33,029 --> 00:01:38,029
would you also put it in
slope intercept, okay?

31
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:41,770
Because that'll help you
with question number three,

32
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,771
okay then I've got through
question number three.

33
00:01:47,013 --> 00:01:51,204
Go 'head and find your
answer and [inaudible].

34
00:01:53,025 --> 00:01:56,025
[Background Chatter]

35
00:01:57,533 --> 00:01:59,451
Here we have,

36
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:06,161
what is this?

37
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:09,453
- Linear.
- Okay, is that a line?

38
00:02:09,453 --> 00:02:10,977
- No.
- Okay.

39
00:02:11,677 --> 00:02:13,510
Were you supposed to
draw a line through it?

40
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,786
[inaudible]
- Okay,

41
00:02:15,786 --> 00:02:18,467
what does it say down there?
[inaudible]

42
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:21,272
Okay, why you did number five
before you did number one,

43
00:02:21,272 --> 00:02:24,235
it said draw a line through, right?

44
00:02:24,235 --> 00:02:26,205
This is like a,

45
00:02:26,205 --> 00:02:27,336
not a line, okay?

46
00:02:27,336 --> 00:02:30,463
A line is straight, so
you wanna draw a line

47
00:02:30,793 --> 00:02:32,095
straight through there.

48
00:02:32,095 --> 00:02:34,277
But, before you do that,
I want you to answer

49
00:02:34,277 --> 00:02:37,273
and do one, two, three and four first.

50
00:02:37,273 --> 00:02:38,259
- Should we erase this?

51
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:41,718
- Uh yeah, but don't worry about
it right now, I want you to

52
00:02:41,718 --> 00:02:46,627
work on finding a, what
two points did you have?

53
00:02:46,627 --> 00:02:48,731
- Um, [inaudible].

54
00:02:48,731 --> 00:02:49,694
- Okay, and why did you get that?

55
00:02:49,694 --> 00:02:52,497
- Because [inaudible].
- What's easy mean?

56
00:02:53,237 --> 00:02:54,536
- Like one plus one.

57
00:02:54,536 --> 00:02:58,891
[inaudible]

58
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:04,658
- And what kind of slope did you get?

59
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:07,478
Oh, you haven't done it yet?

60
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,614
Okay, I'll get back to you, all right?

61
00:03:10,234 --> 00:03:12,410
- But 72's [inaudible].

62
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,455
- What's number two?

63
00:03:13,455 --> 00:03:14,627
What is the slope.
- What is

64
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:15,225
the slope value.

65
00:03:15,225 --> 00:03:17,448
- What is the slope.

66
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:18,841
What is the slope.

67
00:03:18,841 --> 00:03:20,685
And then I was gonna, I
actually had started out

68
00:03:20,685 --> 00:03:24,843
with what doesn't, mean in
a situation, [inaudible].

69
00:03:27,743 --> 00:03:30,284
[inaudible]

70
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:39,862
- But when you [inaudible].

71
00:03:43,195 --> 00:03:47,497
- Y equals one and x, yep, okay y = 1x.

72
00:03:47,497 --> 00:03:49,881
Now, how do we find,

73
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,880
what's the ordered pair here?

74
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,013
[inaudible]

75
00:03:56,013 --> 00:03:58,184
- Okay, that's the slope intercept form.

76
00:03:58,184 --> 00:04:02,005
- Oh, that's what, got 'em mixed up.

77
00:04:02,985 --> 00:04:04,395
- So what is it though?

78
00:04:04,395 --> 00:04:05,799
And you don't have point slope.

79
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:08,678
What is the ordered pair for y-intercept?

80
00:04:08,678 --> 00:04:10,954
- Is that the one where you
have parentheses with two n

81
00:04:10,954 --> 00:04:12,926
and then another one that's like--

82
00:04:12,926 --> 00:04:14,283
- No, that's point slope.

83
00:04:14,283 --> 00:04:16,144
Okay, I just want the y-intercept.

84
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:21,368
Okay, .2 is the y-intercept
in this equation.

85
00:04:21,368 --> 00:04:23,085
y = mx+b.

86
00:04:23,085 --> 00:04:26,296
[inaudible]

87
00:04:29,188 --> 00:04:31,035
Right, it's two.

88
00:04:31,035 --> 00:04:34,786
What did that tell me?
[inaudible]

89
00:04:37,776 --> 00:04:39,130
That's what the y-intercept is.

90
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,846
What does it represent,
the situation [inaudible].

91
00:04:42,846 --> 00:04:46,950
[Inaudible]

92
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,466
Okay, now wait, it's--
[inaudible]

93
00:05:08,806 --> 00:05:11,110
- Okay, is it for two people?

94
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,640
So [inaudible] is for people?

95
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,449
Okay, now if you were
to look at your graph,

96
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:17,796
which we haven't done yet.

97
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:21,667
And where would negative two cross?

98
00:05:23,187 --> 00:05:26,171
Though I'm not sure that's
[inaudible].

99
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:30,078
[Background Chatter]

100
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,804
- Now I'm also seeing
something here about,

101
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:42,000
[inaudible].

102
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:45,592
Why do you have a two here?

103
00:05:45,592 --> 00:05:46,693
- Hello!

104
00:05:46,693 --> 00:05:55,219
[Background Chatter]

105
00:05:56,841 --> 00:05:58,409
- So 30, 32.

106
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:05,457
- I know, right?
- Making me erase!

107
00:06:05,457 --> 00:06:09,561
[Background Chatter]

108
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,333
- That's okay.

109
00:06:12,408 --> 00:06:14,888
- So it's three, six, nine, 12,

110
00:06:14,888 --> 00:06:16,028
then all this other junk?

111
00:06:17,508 --> 00:06:19,383
- So you can get up there and get 33.

112
00:06:19,383 --> 00:06:22,297
[inaudible]

113
00:06:23,137 --> 00:06:24,516
Always thinkin'.

114
00:06:32,145 --> 00:06:35,579
- Six is six, eight is eight.

115
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:39,003
10 is 11.

116
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:46,171
14 is 18.

117
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:52,945
- I'm sorry.

118
00:06:54,054 --> 00:07:06,448
[Background Chatter]

119
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,031
- Three seconds.

120
00:07:09,825 --> 00:07:12,019
For every, how many people?

121
00:07:12,019 --> 00:07:14,315
For each person, three seconds a person.

122
00:07:14,315 --> 00:07:18,326
Okay, no that's [inaudible]
person, according to...

123
00:07:19,346 --> 00:07:20,272
your data.

124
00:07:21,952 --> 00:07:25,966
So it took three seconds to
pass from the church, right?

125
00:07:25,966 --> 00:07:30,473
Now, what is minus 24 [inaudible]?

126
00:07:30,473 --> 00:07:32,410
[Background Chatter]

127
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,551
- Okay, that's a year, you
have y-intercept is negative 24,

128
00:07:35,551 --> 00:07:37,746
and it represents?

129
00:07:37,746 --> 00:07:41,565
[Background Chatter]

130
00:07:42,435 --> 00:07:46,790
Okay, I want you to do
one [inaudible] graph.

131
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:50,002
[inaudible]
- Okay yeah, whatever your

132
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:51,515
Y is starting at.

133
00:07:51,515 --> 00:07:53,117
By the way, this is a [inaudible].

134
00:07:53,117 --> 00:07:56,797
They want you to draw a line
[Inaudible].

135
00:08:00,977 --> 00:08:05,377
Okay so, what is [inaudible]?

136
00:08:05,377 --> 00:08:10,377
[inaudible]
Time in seconds, right?

137
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:13,007
Where does the y intercept?

138
00:08:13,007 --> 00:08:17,069
(muffled speech)

139
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:25,556
It crosses x, okay?

140
00:08:26,126 --> 00:08:27,924
It crosses x.

141
00:08:31,174 --> 00:08:33,136
The y-intercept crosses.

142
00:08:33,136 --> 00:08:35,922
[Background Chatter]

143
00:08:37,912 --> 00:08:42,120
The y-intercept crosses y.

144
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,555
Okay, the y-intercept crosses the y.

145
00:08:45,555 --> 00:08:49,739
[Background Chatter]

146
00:08:53,411 --> 00:08:57,535
- Okay, so y is gonna cross
the axes that is

147
00:08:57,535 --> 00:08:59,543
talking about what?

148
00:08:59,543 --> 00:09:01,921
[Background Chatter]

149
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:04,558
Okay? All right?

150
00:09:05,358 --> 00:09:10,352
[inaudible] It's crossing,
talking about time, okay?

151
00:09:10,352 --> 00:09:14,468
[Background Chatter]

152
00:09:15,577 --> 00:09:16,727
- It's supposed to say what is the slope,

153
00:09:16,727 --> 00:09:19,017
the slope is wards for s.

154
00:09:21,297 --> 00:09:22,581
- You should move your line

155
00:09:22,581 --> 00:09:24,944
so that it follows the dots.

156
00:09:27,894 --> 00:09:30,342
Okay, I'm gonna come back here.

157
00:09:33,662 --> 00:09:34,535
What's the problem?

158
00:09:34,535 --> 00:09:37,797
- Time, [inaudible].

159
00:09:38,937 --> 00:09:40,258
- They're confusing me.

160
00:09:43,898 --> 00:09:47,282
- All right, so number three, you said

161
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:50,683
the y-intercept is
six-elevenths of a second,

162
00:09:50,683 --> 00:09:51,670
is that what you're saying?

163
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,143
Six-elevenths seconds?

164
00:09:53,143 --> 00:09:56,127
Okay, and you said that was what?

165
00:09:56,127 --> 00:10:00,048
[inaudible]

166
00:10:00,048 --> 00:10:01,198
Okay.

167
00:10:01,749 --> 00:10:05,348
[Background Chatter]

168
00:10:07,438 --> 00:10:11,200
All right, what were the people doing?

169
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,752
People were passing books.

170
00:10:14,752 --> 00:10:19,152
So six-elevenths, okay, means that it took

171
00:10:20,262 --> 00:10:24,118
six-elevenths, were no people [inaudible]?

172
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:28,220
What was happening during--

173
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,581
- Each person to pass [inaudible].

174
00:10:33,141 --> 00:10:36,248
- So was each person passing
the book at six-elevenths?

175
00:10:38,048 --> 00:10:40,426
- That's how long it took for them

176
00:10:40,426 --> 00:10:42,087
to start passing.

177
00:10:42,087 --> 00:10:44,084
[inaudible]

178
00:10:44,084 --> 00:10:45,884
Six elevenths of a second.
- Okay.

179
00:10:45,884 --> 00:10:48,310
So, who passed the first globe.

180
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,051
I mean, who's was that?
- Angela.

181
00:10:50,051 --> 00:10:51,885
- Okay, so he did what?

182
00:10:52,325 --> 00:10:55,254
- He had to run around,
and then to come back.

183
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:57,472
And here and turn, a person.
- Right.

184
00:10:57,472 --> 00:11:02,116
He had to leave his desk [inaudible].

185
00:11:02,116 --> 00:11:05,147
Okay now, is that an average throw?

186
00:11:05,927 --> 00:11:08,433
Okay, what's your average
that you're talking about?

187
00:11:09,473 --> 00:11:11,365
- 14 seconds for every 11 men.

188
00:11:12,015 --> 00:11:13,628
- Okay, so we might wanna just

189
00:11:13,628 --> 00:11:15,625
change that to a decimal, okay?

190
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,748
So, just find out how
many for one person.

191
00:11:18,748 --> 00:11:20,767
Just change it to a decimal.

192
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:22,368
And you might wanna change
six-elevenths to a decimal

193
00:11:22,368 --> 00:11:26,363
so you can have an actual
[Inaudible]

194
00:11:26,363 --> 00:11:27,129
Okay?

195
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:28,465
That's great, all right.

196
00:11:28,465 --> 00:11:29,799
That's okay, does everybody understand

197
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:32,609
what Jade was saying?

198
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:33,885
- I think the reason why she did that

199
00:11:33,885 --> 00:11:36,742
was because [inaudible].

200
00:11:38,602 --> 00:11:39,794
- We had to make a line.

201
00:11:39,794 --> 00:11:43,149
- Okay now, [Inaudible].

202
00:11:44,969 --> 00:11:48,171
Okay, that doesn't mean make
a line graph, [inaudible].

203
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:49,914
- Oh!
- Okay.

204
00:11:49,914 --> 00:11:51,516
Are you [inaudible]?

205
00:11:51,516 --> 00:11:54,686
[inaudible]

206
00:11:55,536 --> 00:11:58,626
Drawing a straight line, a straight line.

207
00:11:58,626 --> 00:12:01,371
Now we just wanna look
at what you got here.

208
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:06,653
Okay, what did you put [inaudible].

209
00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:07,675
- One.
- One?

210
00:12:07,675 --> 00:12:08,859
And what does it mean?

211
00:12:08,859 --> 00:12:12,038
- I got 1.27672767.

212
00:12:12,038 --> 00:12:14,404
- Okay, and what does the
slope on the line?

213
00:12:15,524 --> 00:12:16,916
Now don't worry about
your line right now,

214
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,715
just answer these questions.

215
00:12:18,715 --> 00:12:20,456
What does the slope on the line,

216
00:12:20,456 --> 00:12:23,556
your slope of one,
represent in this situation?

217
00:12:23,556 --> 00:12:25,414
- One second per pass?

218
00:12:25,414 --> 00:12:26,749
- Okay, all right, you're gonna do

219
00:12:26,749 --> 00:12:28,397
one second per pass.

220
00:12:28,397 --> 00:12:30,487
- Averaged--
- Per--

221
00:12:30,487 --> 00:12:31,392
- Person.

222
00:12:31,922 --> 00:12:35,939
- One second per person to pass the book.

223
00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:37,506
Get back, right?

224
00:12:39,066 --> 00:12:40,183
Okay.

225
00:12:41,436 --> 00:12:44,409
So what does your y-intercept represent?

226
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:48,249
- If it's at zero with no
passage, that's what the seconds

227
00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:50,652
are, that's what the point is.

228
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:53,380
- Okay, say that again?

229
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:57,420
- If there's no passes,
like the time starts

230
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,728
at negative two seconds, I guess.

231
00:13:00,728 --> 00:13:04,169
I don't know how to explain.
- Did you get a negative?

232
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:05,291
- Yeah.

233
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,730
- Now, is that possible?

234
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,355
- No.
- No? Okay.

235
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:10,770
Why might you have a negative?

236
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:14,979
[Background Chatter]

237
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,480
- Sometimes it drops.
- Okay, but,

238
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,685
if you have negative time,

239
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,493
okay, can you?

240
00:13:23,493 --> 00:13:25,424
[Background Chatter]

241
00:13:25,424 --> 00:13:26,860
- [inaudible] She'd be
like, oh yeah that was

242
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,925
negative three seconds ago.

243
00:13:27,925 --> 00:13:30,165
- Yeah, negative no, that
was three seconds ago,

244
00:13:30,165 --> 00:13:32,706
but it wasn't, so you got
a [inaudible] point two,

245
00:13:32,706 --> 00:13:33,822
right, seconds.

246
00:13:33,822 --> 00:13:34,945
All right?

247
00:13:34,945 --> 00:13:38,925
Now, let's just think about,
and you said it was what,

248
00:13:40,665 --> 00:13:44,143
negative two seconds,
but [inaudible].

249
00:13:44,143 --> 00:13:46,139
He wrote people.

250
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:49,982
Okay, when was there a time
when there was zero people?

251
00:13:49,982 --> 00:13:53,406
[inaudible]

252
00:13:53,406 --> 00:13:56,323
[laughing]

253
00:13:57,463 --> 00:14:01,996
- [laughing] I mean in this
situation during the book pass!

254
00:14:01,996 --> 00:14:04,515
When was there zero time?
- Never.

255
00:14:04,515 --> 00:14:06,719
- When it's [inaudible].

256
00:14:06,719 --> 00:14:07,881
- When, okay.

257
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:11,370
When they start moving,
but somebody was moving.

258
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,696
- I think it's zero passes.

259
00:14:14,696 --> 00:14:18,489
- No, all right, what does
your y line represent?

260
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:19,480
- Time in seconds.

261
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,383
- Time in seconds.  So the
y-intercept rounded out,

262
00:14:22,383 --> 00:14:23,741
that's what?

263
00:14:23,741 --> 00:14:25,240
Time in seconds, right?

264
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,240
So it's a time, when was time

265
00:14:30,866 --> 00:14:34,791
when the books were not being passed?

266
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:38,842
[inaudible]

267
00:14:39,572 --> 00:14:42,121
Somebody had to

268
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:44,984
all right, walk over and,

269
00:14:45,964 --> 00:14:48,117
pick 'em up, and

270
00:14:48,117 --> 00:14:50,462
then somebody had to
walk over and put them.
