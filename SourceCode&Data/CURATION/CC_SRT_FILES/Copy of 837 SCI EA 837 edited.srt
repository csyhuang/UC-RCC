1
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:15,970
-(background chatter)

2
00:00:17,675 --> 00:00:19,624
- What if it comes from like
a polluted creek or something,

3
00:00:19,624 --> 00:00:23,635
or some kind of bad water system
in the ground?

4
00:00:26,346 --> 00:00:30,005
- Number three... (inaudible).

5
00:00:31,524 --> 00:00:33,884
- I say crystal clear and filtered.

6
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:38,172
- I said how dirty the water gets.

7
00:00:43,307 --> 00:00:46,315
- How good the water is for you?

8
00:00:46,315 --> 00:00:56,315
-(background chatter)

9
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:00,798
- It doesn't have stuff dying in it,

10
00:01:00,798 --> 00:01:03,609
it's crystal clear and it doesn't smell.

11
00:01:05,271 --> 00:01:07,886
- [Teacher] Okay, class, if we can
pull back together please,

12
00:01:07,886 --> 00:01:09,966
as a group, I was hearing
excellent discussions

13
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:11,563
between each of the three questions,

14
00:01:11,563 --> 00:01:13,798
and I think we have some
very valuable points

15
00:01:13,798 --> 00:01:15,358
to go ahead and talk about.

16
00:01:15,358 --> 00:01:16,908
So, what we're gonna do is kind of create

17
00:01:16,908 --> 00:01:19,547
a little bit of a list up here,
to help us remind later

18
00:01:19,547 --> 00:01:21,272
when I go to show you something.

19
00:01:21,272 --> 00:01:23,362
So, we're gonna start again
with that first question,

20
00:01:23,362 --> 00:01:25,242
and I'm looking for you
to participate and share

21
00:01:25,242 --> 00:01:26,844
some of those questions together.

22
00:01:26,844 --> 00:01:29,537
So, it says again, how do you
know if water is safe or not?

23
00:01:29,537 --> 00:01:30,962
And I heard wonderful responses,

24
00:01:30,962 --> 00:01:32,827
so can I hear some of those please?

25
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:34,195
Brandon, please start us.

26
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:35,709
- Color and odor.

27
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:37,684
- [Teacher] Okay, so you
know if water is safe or not

28
00:01:37,684 --> 00:01:41,835
depending on again, the color and the odor.

29
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:44,912
Good, what are some other responses?

30
00:01:44,912 --> 00:01:45,905
Brandon?

31
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:47,314
- Remember where you got it from.

32
00:01:47,314 --> 00:01:50,274
Like, if it was in a
creek that looks fine,

33
00:01:50,274 --> 00:01:52,353
it's probably safe to drink,

34
00:01:52,353 --> 00:01:54,314
but if it's from a polluted creek that has

35
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:57,184
a really weird color to it,
or it's in a weird location,

36
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:58,605
don't drink it.

37
00:01:58,605 --> 00:02:01,960
- Okay, so I'm commenting here, I have, it

38
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,115
depends on the source
you're getting it from,

39
00:02:04,115 --> 00:02:07,114
and so if it's a creek that
looks to be clean or clear,

40
00:02:07,114 --> 00:02:08,354
then you know it's probably okay?

41
00:02:08,354 --> 00:02:10,909
And if it looks to have like a weird color,

42
00:02:10,909 --> 00:02:12,551
I think you mentioned again to it,

43
00:02:12,551 --> 00:02:14,278
or polluted or in a weird location,

44
00:02:14,278 --> 00:02:15,841
then maybe it's not safe.

45
00:02:15,841 --> 00:02:18,365
All right, what were some
of your other responses?

46
00:02:18,365 --> 00:02:20,440
Jack.

47
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,131
- Um, if it goes through a quality filter?

48
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:26,108
- Okay, if it goes
through a quality filter.

49
00:02:26,108 --> 00:02:28,037
And Jack, can you maybe
think of an example

50
00:02:28,037 --> 00:02:30,402
of a quality filter?

51
00:02:30,402 --> 00:02:32,644
- A Culligan filter
for the drinking water?

52
00:02:32,644 --> 00:02:37,644
- Okay, so a Culligan
filter that you can use

53
00:02:37,922 --> 00:02:39,398
to filter out the water.

54
00:02:39,398 --> 00:02:41,319
Okay, good. Madeline?

55
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,437
- There's no large pieces of
trash or anything in the water?

56
00:02:44,437 --> 00:02:46,712
- [Teacher] Okay, so you
can look for visible signs

57
00:02:46,712 --> 00:02:50,004
of large trash, and
Madeline, what was the second

58
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:51,111
part of that?

59
00:02:51,111 --> 00:02:53,721
- Nothing that looks unnatural in it.

60
00:02:53,721 --> 00:02:56,940
- [Teacher] Okay, so nothing
that looks unnatural. Great.

61
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,918
Anybody else, any answers for number one?

62
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:03,267
Again, how do you know
if it's safe or not?

63
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:06,200
Lexi, I think you had another answer that

64
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,479
may have been covered up here.

65
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,366
What did you say when I
was talking with your group

66
00:03:09,366 --> 00:03:10,553
about... ?

67
00:03:10,553 --> 00:03:11,318
- The smell?

68
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:13,520
- [Teacher] Okay, the smell,
again, the odor of it.

69
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,719
Okay, great.

70
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,332
Brandon, you thought of another one?

71
00:03:16,332 --> 00:03:18,226
- If there's something dead in it.

72
00:03:18,226 --> 00:03:19,394
- [Teacher] If there's
something dead in it,

73
00:03:19,394 --> 00:03:21,558
so again, we're going
based on those visual

74
00:03:21,558 --> 00:03:23,161
aspects of it. Good.

75
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,189
Well, we're gonna come back
to that here in just a moment,

76
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:27,075
so we'll move on to number two.

77
00:03:27,075 --> 00:03:30,694
When are times when the
water might not be safe?

78
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,082
Walker?

79
00:03:34,082 --> 00:03:36,841
- After an earthquake or another disaster?

80
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:40,449
- [Teacher] Okay, so after an earthquake.

81
00:03:42,427 --> 00:03:44,711
And Walker, can I have
you expand a little bit?

82
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:47,755
What would be so significant
after an earthquake

83
00:03:47,755 --> 00:03:49,387
or another disaster that
would make the water

84
00:03:49,387 --> 00:03:50,319
not safe?

85
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,362
- Because maybe something fell in the water,

86
00:03:52,362 --> 00:03:55,081
or, I don't know, I
just heard that before.

87
00:03:55,081 --> 00:03:56,593
- [Teacher] Okay, so you heard it before,

88
00:03:56,593 --> 00:03:58,884
and if something fell in the water.

89
00:03:58,884 --> 00:04:02,204
Did you happen to see at all, in Japan

90
00:04:02,204 --> 00:04:03,906
after the tsunami came through there?

91
00:04:03,906 --> 00:04:06,394
Do you remember any of those images?

92
00:04:06,394 --> 00:04:08,884
- Yeah kinda, they were different colors

93
00:04:08,884 --> 00:04:10,885
and yeah...

94
00:04:10,885 --> 00:04:12,442
- [Teacher] Okay, and I
think I heard somebody else

95
00:04:12,442 --> 00:04:14,118
say that they remembered seeing a point

96
00:04:14,118 --> 00:04:17,190
that maybe we can add onto. Elvis?

97
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:17,918
- [Elvis] At the beach.

98
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,525
- [Teacher] At the beach?

99
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,402
What do you mean by "at the beach?"

100
00:04:21,402 --> 00:04:22,766
- There's different times where the water

101
00:04:22,766 --> 00:04:25,686
might not be safe.

102
00:04:25,686 --> 00:04:27,683
- [Teacher] Okay, can you
think of a specific example,

103
00:04:27,683 --> 00:04:29,554
like have you experienced
a time when you weren't

104
00:04:29,554 --> 00:04:32,083
allowed to be at the beach?

105
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,713
- When somethings dangerous in the water.

106
00:04:33,713 --> 00:04:35,484
- [Teacher] Okay, if something's
dangerous in the water.

107
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,762
Sometimes they might tell
you that it's not safe

108
00:04:37,762 --> 00:04:39,285
to be there. Okay.

109
00:04:39,285 --> 00:04:43,410
Any other times that might
make the water not safe?

110
00:04:45,156 --> 00:04:47,148
Amelia, can you think of
any times where the water

111
00:04:47,148 --> 00:04:48,912
might not be safe?

112
00:04:48,912 --> 00:04:53,391
- I have, after storms, like um, Walker did.

113
00:04:53,391 --> 00:04:55,462
- [Teacher] Okay, what
are some things then,

114
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,508
because this is something
I'm hearing so far.

115
00:04:56,508 --> 00:04:59,000
What are some things
after the storm that might

116
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,208
be in the water besides, I
think you said some stuff

117
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,632
can fall in the water.

118
00:05:03,632 --> 00:05:05,397
What are some of the things
that might be in the water

119
00:05:05,397 --> 00:05:07,201
that would make it not safe?

120
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:12,367
Aashi, can you think
of something that might

121
00:05:12,367 --> 00:05:13,882
get in the water?

122
00:05:13,882 --> 00:05:18,157
- Um, like tree branches or animals?

123
00:05:18,157 --> 00:05:19,917
- [Teacher] Okay, so tree
branches and animals,

124
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:20,676
that's good.

125
00:05:20,676 --> 00:05:22,063
Can you think of anything else that might

126
00:05:22,063 --> 00:05:25,044
get in the water that maybe
wouldn't normally be there?

127
00:05:25,044 --> 00:05:26,155
Kris?

128
00:05:26,155 --> 00:05:28,321
- Trash?
- [Teacher] Trash, okay.

129
00:05:28,321 --> 00:05:31,229
Can you think of a specific kind of trash?

130
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:32,542
Lexi?
- Glass?

131
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:35,044
- [Teacher] Glass. And
what would be the danger

132
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:36,841
of glass getting in the water?

133
00:05:36,841 --> 00:05:39,277
- It's sharp and can cut yourself.

134
00:05:39,277 --> 00:05:41,340
- [Teacher] Okay, so there's
a chance of getting injured

135
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,485
if you cut yourself.

136
00:05:42,485 --> 00:05:44,482
What else... think outside
the box a little bit more.

137
00:05:44,482 --> 00:05:47,073
What else could get in the
water that you would not

138
00:05:47,073 --> 00:05:48,893
normally want in your water?

139
00:05:52,664 --> 00:05:53,716
Madeline?

140
00:05:53,716 --> 00:05:57,946
- Plastic bags and then
you can suffocate animals.

141
00:05:57,946 --> 00:05:59,558
- [Teacher] Okay, so
plastic bags that they

142
00:05:59,558 --> 00:06:01,926
suffocate animals,
something along those lines.

143
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:02,963
Elvis?

144
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,037
- Oil and gasoline?

145
00:06:04,037 --> 00:06:05,596
- [Teacher] Oil and gasoline, good.

146
00:06:05,596 --> 00:06:06,799
Brandon?
- Toxins.

147
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:08,433
- [Teacher] Toxins, okay. Jack?

148
00:06:08,433 --> 00:06:10,556
- Plastic six-pack holders?

149
00:06:10,556 --> 00:06:13,441
Because it strangles
the fish and everything.

150
00:06:13,441 --> 00:06:14,721
- [Teacher] Okay, now lets think...

151
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:16,766
I'm glad you guys are all concerned

152
00:06:16,766 --> 00:06:18,640
about the fish and the
animals and all of that,

153
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,156
but what about we as
humans, can you think of

154
00:06:21,156 --> 00:06:23,960
anything that would get
in the water that would be

155
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,671
potentially harmful to us afterward?

156
00:06:26,671 --> 00:06:28,187
Go ahead.

157
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:31,557
- Pesticides?
- Pesticides, okay. Brandon?

158
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,354
- Fertilizer?

159
00:06:32,354 --> 00:06:35,472
- [Teacher] Fertilizers. Elvis?

160
00:06:35,472 --> 00:06:37,125
- A car?
What is it again?

161
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,184
- A car.
- [Teacher] A car, okay.

162
00:06:39,184 --> 00:06:41,883
All right, well we'll come back
to those in just a minute.

163
00:06:41,883 --> 00:06:45,125
So, looking at... we've kind of
come up with a list here

164
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:48,874
of how you would determine
if things are safe or not.

165
00:06:48,874 --> 00:06:51,038
So, then I guess my question would become,

166
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,080
if you look at it's color
and you look at if it's in

167
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,764
a source that looks safe or
not, how would you be able

168
00:06:57,764 --> 00:07:01,285
to determine if something
is safe to drink?

169
00:07:01,285 --> 00:07:02,755
So, maybe that might
change your perspective

170
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:03,599
a little bit.

171
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,321
So, is there a difference
between being able to drink

172
00:07:06,321 --> 00:07:11,120
something, and maybe being
able to swim in something?

173
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,398
In fact, let me give you just
a minute to talk about that

174
00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:14,806
with your partner for a minute.

175
00:07:14,806 --> 00:07:19,503
so, my question to you again,
is it... are there different things

176
00:07:19,503 --> 00:07:22,759
we should look for in water
that we drink, versus maybe

177
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:25,320
water that we swim in or take a shower in?

178
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,642
And I want you to talk
about that with your partner

179
00:07:27,642 --> 00:07:29,517
and jot down a couple notes
about that, so go ahead.

180
00:07:30,897 --> 00:07:38,751
- (students talking with each other)

181
00:07:40,551 --> 00:08:24,405
-(background chatter)

182
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,511
- [Student] That's
interesting to hear you saying

183
00:08:27,511 --> 00:08:38,044
shower water isn't as filtered
as your drinking water.

184
00:08:40,188 --> 00:08:44,445
- Our pool is safe, they
put a water cover over

185
00:08:44,445 --> 00:08:45,833
our pool so it was different.

186
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,071
At our pool they changed from...

187
00:08:48,071 --> 00:08:50,516
too much chlorine can burn people's eyes,

188
00:08:50,516 --> 00:08:52,297
so they changed it.

189
00:08:57,991 --> 00:08:59,475
Yeah, definitely a bigger job,

190
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:01,280
but they put a small
amount of chlorine in it,

191
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,684
so all the bacteria that's on us,

192
00:09:03,684 --> 00:09:06,605
if you go swim in the
pool it wouldn't matter,

193
00:09:06,605 --> 00:09:11,126
as opposed to in the shower
because it's different.

194
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,309
- Even if you do have a water cover,

195
00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:17,801
still it could seep through,
and that's how they clean it.

196
00:09:17,801 --> 00:09:20,511
- When they open the
pool it takes like a month,

197
00:09:20,511 --> 00:09:23,225
because they have to go
through the water thing,

198
00:09:23,225 --> 00:09:24,861
and all the filters.

199
00:09:24,861 --> 00:09:26,834
- [Teacher] Okay, we'll come
back together as a group

200
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:28,083
one more time.

201
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,674
Thank you all, again I hear
great discussions going on.

202
00:09:30,674 --> 00:09:32,343
So, let's talk about this.

203
00:09:32,343 --> 00:09:34,724
There's some very neat
ideas of whether you think

204
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:36,994
something is safe to drink
versus whether or not

205
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,828
it's okay to shower or to swim in.

206
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,718
So, what were some comments
you were talking about

207
00:09:40,718 --> 00:09:42,524
in your smaller groups?

208
00:09:44,231 --> 00:09:46,681
Again, I heard some great
discussions going on.

209
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:49,116
Mikenna, what did your group talk about?

210
00:09:49,116 --> 00:09:52,103
- Shower water isn't as
filtered as drinking water.

211
00:09:52,103 --> 00:09:53,780
- [Teacher] Okay, so in
their group they believe

212
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,354
that shower water was
not as filtered as what

213
00:09:56,354 --> 00:10:00,041
the water is that you drink
in, so if it's not as filtered,

214
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,284
where would your drinking
water be coming from

215
00:10:02,284 --> 00:10:05,050
that maybe your shower
water isn't coming from?

216
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,836
Okay, is there a reason
that maybe you thought

217
00:10:10,836 --> 00:10:13,920
along sometime where the
shower water is not as

218
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,510
filtered as your drinking water?

219
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:18,928
- No.
- [Teacher] No, okay.

220
00:10:18,928 --> 00:10:20,898
It just makes sense to
you that maybe the stuff

221
00:10:20,898 --> 00:10:22,643
that comes out of the tap
to drink, is not necessarily

222
00:10:22,643 --> 00:10:25,084
the same thing coming out of
your pipes for the shower?

223
00:10:25,084 --> 00:10:27,960
Okay, what were some
other comments about that?

224
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,153
Larry, what did you guys talk about?

225
00:10:31,153 --> 00:10:36,153
- (inaudible)

226
00:10:42,962 --> 00:10:44,421
- (beeping)

227
00:10:44,421 --> 00:10:48,721
- [Announcer on loud speaker] May I have
your attention please?

228
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:50,695
- Would all Spelling Bee winners

229
00:10:50,695 --> 00:10:53,313
please report to the
auditorium at this time

230
00:10:53,313 --> 00:10:55,244
for the Spelling Bee.

231
00:10:55,244 --> 00:10:59,862
Again, all Spelling Bee
winners please report

232
00:10:59,862 --> 00:11:03,242
to the auditorium at this
time for the Spelling Bee.

233
00:11:03,242 --> 00:11:04,610
Thank you.

234
00:11:06,391 --> 00:11:08,041
- [Teacher] Okay, so Larry,
to expand upon that,

235
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,842
and I think he brought
up a really good point.

236
00:11:09,842 --> 00:11:12,082
He said that maybe the water that you...

237
00:11:12,082 --> 00:11:14,745
were you saying, Larry,
swimming or showering?

238
00:11:14,745 --> 00:11:16,784
- [Isaiah] He was saying
that the water we drink...

239
00:11:16,784 --> 00:11:19,041
- Hold on just one second,
Isaiah, just one second.

240
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:24,041
- (inaudible)

241
00:11:26,282 --> 00:11:27,590
- Okay good, I wanted to
make sure I wasn't saying it

242
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,711
incorrectly.

243
00:11:28,711 --> 00:11:30,563
So, what he was saying is, in other words,

244
00:11:30,563 --> 00:11:33,285
when you shower or when
you are going swimming,

245
00:11:33,285 --> 00:11:35,485
that water is not necessarily
going in your body,

246
00:11:35,485 --> 00:11:37,256
you're not consuming that water,

247
00:11:37,256 --> 00:11:39,000
so there would be a difference possibly,

248
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,282
between the water you're swimming in

249
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:43,075
versus the water that
you're drinking. Walker?

250
00:11:43,075 --> 00:11:45,167
- I said that you would
swim in darker water

251
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:48,351
than you drink or shower in.

252
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,521
- Okay, so sometimes you
think that the water you've

253
00:11:50,521 --> 00:11:53,511
been in when you swim is darker.

254
00:11:53,511 --> 00:11:55,356
So, going back to the
color difference that

255
00:11:55,356 --> 00:11:58,877
talked about here.
Okay, interesting. Lexi?

256
00:11:58,877 --> 00:12:01,484
- The shower water and
the water that we drink

257
00:12:01,484 --> 00:12:03,347
I think is sort of the
same, but they go through a

258
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:07,961
different process, but
if we go swimming at our

259
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:11,483
community pool, it's
different because there's more

260
00:12:11,483 --> 00:12:15,278
chlorine and stuff, so
you have bacteria on you

261
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:17,871
and you're just swimming,
you not really intaking it.

262
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:20,481
But at your house when you
drink or take a shower,

263
00:12:20,481 --> 00:12:21,388
it's different.

264
00:12:21,388 --> 00:12:23,117
- [Teacher] Okay. Would you say that...

265
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,587
Because I think it's
probably safe to say you guys

266
00:12:25,587 --> 00:12:27,676
mostly agree that there
is a difference between

267
00:12:27,676 --> 00:12:29,801
drinking water and water
you would shower in

268
00:12:29,801 --> 00:12:32,322
versus water that maybe
you would go swimming in.

269
00:12:32,322 --> 00:12:34,704
So, what are some of those differences?

270
00:12:34,704 --> 00:12:37,795
What might be... what might
they have to do to that water?

271
00:12:37,795 --> 00:12:39,401
Lexi was talking about
maybe it would have to be

272
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:42,203
treated differently, or that
there would be chemicals

273
00:12:42,203 --> 00:12:43,390
added to it.

274
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,843
So, can you think of what
they would do to the water

275
00:12:45,843 --> 00:12:49,005
in a swimming pool, versus
water that you drink

276
00:12:49,005 --> 00:12:51,956
to make it different?

277
00:12:51,956 --> 00:12:54,063
I think Jack mentioned about filtering,

278
00:12:54,063 --> 00:12:55,828
and Mikenna also brought
up the point about

279
00:12:55,828 --> 00:12:58,367
it being filtered different.

280
00:12:58,367 --> 00:12:59,115
Brandon?

281
00:12:59,115 --> 00:13:01,003
- Well, they put more
chemicals in the swimming pool,

282
00:13:01,003 --> 00:13:03,561
because there's gonna be more germs

283
00:13:03,561 --> 00:13:07,280
and when people swim in it, so
that will kill off the germs.

284
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,704
As in drinking water is
not as much chemicals

285
00:13:09,704 --> 00:13:11,361
because there's not really any germs,

286
00:13:11,361 --> 00:13:13,264
you're just drinking it, so...

287
00:13:13,264 --> 00:13:15,917
- Okay, good. So, what I'm hearing
is the amount of something...,

288
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:17,871
so would you all agree, as a class,

289
00:13:17,871 --> 00:13:21,643
if we were to drink swimming
water, would you die?

290
00:13:21,643 --> 00:13:24,346
- [All] No.
- No, probably not, right?

291
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:27,561
But the amount of the
chemical that is in the water

292
00:13:27,561 --> 00:13:29,960
might be something that
would cause some effects

293
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,363
or cause some harm to you.

294
00:13:31,363 --> 00:13:33,472
So, do you think that there is chlorine

295
00:13:33,472 --> 00:13:34,952
in your drinking water?

296
00:13:34,952 --> 00:13:36,515
Because we said it's in
the swimming pool probably

297
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:38,149
to help kill off bacteria.

298
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:39,990
Do you think that... and
I'm hearing a little bit

299
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,161
of a disagreeance here,
so I'd love to hear

300
00:13:42,161 --> 00:13:43,720
your conversation in just a minute.

301
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,112
Elvis, what do you think?

302
00:13:45,112 --> 00:13:47,044
- There is chlorine in the drinking water,

303
00:13:47,044 --> 00:13:48,796
but then they purify it, so...

304
00:13:48,796 --> 00:13:50,159
- [Teacher] So they
purify out the chlorine

305
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,158
after they put the chlorine
into the drinking water?

306
00:13:53,158 --> 00:13:54,079
- Yeah.
- [Teacher] Okay, good.

307
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,695
And Isaiah, what were you thinking about?

308
00:13:55,695 --> 00:13:57,479
I think you were saying no,
that there isn't the chlorine.

309
00:13:57,479 --> 00:14:02,479
- My question is, if there was
chlorine in drinking water,

310
00:14:02,723 --> 00:14:05,673
I mean, you can purify it,
but it may still stay around

311
00:14:05,673 --> 00:14:08,185
that water, then why would you drink it?

312
00:14:08,185 --> 00:14:12,279
I mean, sure, it can knock out
the bacteria and germs,

313
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:15,823
but why drink it if it has chlorine in it?

314
00:14:15,823 --> 00:14:17,107
Because that's not good for you.

315
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:19,074
- [Teacher] Okay, and going
back to the amounts of it,

316
00:14:19,074 --> 00:14:20,758
and you're thinking that
even the smallest amount

317
00:14:20,758 --> 00:14:22,921
might not be healthy for
you to put in your system.

318
00:14:22,921 --> 00:14:24,077
Okay, Jack?

319
00:14:24,077 --> 00:14:26,271
- Well, for a normal tap system,

320
00:14:26,271 --> 00:14:29,951
I think it's the last, or
second last step they do,

321
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:32,520
is they insert really
small amount of chlorine

322
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,875
into all tap water,
usually in a normal town.

323
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:40,292
And, so then a lot of people have chlorine
in their drinking water,

324
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:43,483
but for some people who
have specialized filters

325
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:46,758
for drinking water, they're
designed to filter out

326
00:14:46,758 --> 00:14:50,799
all of the chlorine so
that it's mostly just water

327
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:51,719
that they're getting.

328
00:14:51,719 --> 00:14:54,078
So, some people have a filter installed.

329
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:56,718
- Okay, and would you be able
to tell based on the color,

330
00:14:56,718 --> 00:14:58,624
because that seems to be what
a lot of people are using

331
00:14:58,624 --> 00:15:00,510
as their indicator of good water.

332
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,038
Would you be able to
tell just by the color

333
00:15:02,038 --> 00:15:04,520
whether or not there's
a lot of chlorine in it?

334
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,959
- [Elvis] Maybe, maybe not.

335
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:07,920
I don't know if this contributes to it,

336
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,637
but sometimes I look at
my drinking water compared

337
00:15:10,637 --> 00:15:14,675
to the tap water, and the tap
water is a lot more foggy,

338
00:15:14,675 --> 00:15:16,755
so I don't know if that's
because the chlorine

339
00:15:16,755 --> 00:15:19,917
or because it's aerated or
something, but I don't know.

340
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:21,585
- [Teacher] Okay good,
thank you for sharing that.

341
00:15:21,585 --> 00:15:22,632
Elvis.

342
00:15:22,632 --> 00:15:24,745
- You can buy those little
filters that you can

343
00:15:24,745 --> 00:15:27,002
screw onto your taps
so that way it filters

344
00:15:27,002 --> 00:15:28,435
down the water.

345
00:15:28,435 --> 00:15:33,435
I have one and it filters out tap water.

346
00:15:33,882 --> 00:15:36,016
- [Teacher] Okay, and it's
filtering out more of the

347
00:15:36,016 --> 00:15:37,959
amount, or maybe none of it at all. Okay.

348
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:40,163
Let's go back... oh, go ahead Madeline.

349
00:15:40,163 --> 00:15:44,592
- I would just like to
say to Isaiah's comment,

350
00:15:44,592 --> 00:15:47,179
we sort of have to have
chlorine in our water

351
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:50,163
because there would be
more bacteria if we didn't,

352
00:15:50,163 --> 00:15:52,723
so there's a reason for
it, and it's not that much.

353
00:15:52,723 --> 00:15:56,845
So, it would do you less harm to have
the chlorine in the water

354
00:15:56,845 --> 00:15:58,026
than to not have it.

355
00:15:58,026 --> 00:16:00,362
- [Teacher] Okay, so the
benefits of what you're saying

356
00:16:00,362 --> 00:16:02,004
is that you would at least
have to have a little bit

357
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:05,124
to kill off the bacteria, and
that would outweigh the fact

358
00:16:05,124 --> 00:16:07,483
of you not having anything at
all, and then being exposed

359
00:16:07,483 --> 00:16:09,435
to maybe whatever is in the
water that the chlorine

360
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:12,957
is not killing off,
right? Okay, very good.

361
00:16:12,957 --> 00:16:13,763
Let's look at...

362
00:16:13,763 --> 00:16:15,991
We've used, again, some
criteria, and let's look at

363
00:16:15,991 --> 00:16:18,542
that final question of,
what is your definition

364
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:19,845
of water quality?

365
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,952
So, in other words, I think Jordan,

366
00:16:21,952 --> 00:16:23,841
I heard in your discussion,
could you read your answer

367
00:16:23,841 --> 00:16:25,794
for us one more time
about what you think water

368
00:16:25,794 --> 00:16:28,154
quality is to you?

369
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,754
- Water quality is how
good the water is for you

370
00:16:30,754 --> 00:16:32,190
to drink.

371
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,323
- [Teacher] Good, how good
the water is for you to drink.

372
00:16:34,323 --> 00:16:36,523
Can I hear another
definition of water quality?

373
00:16:36,523 --> 00:16:38,796
Kris, what did you decide?

374
00:16:38,796 --> 00:16:41,162
- [Kris] How clean the water was?

375
00:16:41,162 --> 00:16:43,020
- [Teacher] How clean the water was, okay.

376
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,660
And how would you determine
if the water is clean or not?

377
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,016
What was your number one indicator?

378
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,878
- [Kris] When you drink it.

379
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:53,034
- [Teacher] When you drink it, okay.

380
00:16:53,034 --> 00:16:54,798
So, if you drink it and you
know that it's clean,

381
00:16:54,798 --> 00:16:57,122
then it has good water
quality to it. All right.

382
00:16:57,122 --> 00:16:58,797
Isaiah?

383
00:16:58,797 --> 00:17:01,393
- My definition of water
quality is how much of the water

384
00:17:01,393 --> 00:17:04,163
is polluted, and how much
of the water is pure.

385
00:17:04,163 --> 00:17:06,004
- [Teacher] So, polluted versus pure

386
00:17:06,004 --> 00:17:10,231
and then kind of a ratio of if
it's polluted and more pure

387
00:17:10,231 --> 00:17:12,363
then it's better water quality. Okay.

388
00:17:12,363 --> 00:17:15,913
Rachel, how about your
definition of water quality?

389
00:17:15,913 --> 00:17:19,438
- We said that water quality
was how much of the water

390
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:22,194
is pure water, and how
much of it's polluted.

391
00:17:22,194 --> 00:17:24,060
- [Teacher] Okay, so going
back to that same definition

392
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,281
together as you all talked.

393
00:17:25,281 --> 00:17:28,200
And Ashani, what did you
think water quality would be?

394
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,914
- How good the water
is because some water,

395
00:17:30,914 --> 00:17:33,667
it like tastes different, you can tell.

396
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:35,149
- [Teacher] Okay, so the taste.

397
00:17:35,149 --> 00:17:36,563
Have you ever experienced
where water might

398
00:17:36,563 --> 00:17:39,232
taste a little different,
can you think of an example?

399
00:17:39,232 --> 00:17:41,555
- My aunt's house, when we go to her house

400
00:17:41,555 --> 00:17:43,946
it's always different from our house.

401
00:17:43,946 --> 00:17:45,961
- [Teacher] And what kind
of taste would you say?

402
00:17:45,961 --> 00:17:47,191
- It's gross.

403
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,829
- (laughing) It's gross water.

404
00:17:48,829 --> 00:17:50,744
Maybe back to when we were
talking about well water

405
00:17:50,744 --> 00:17:53,245
in here versus the regular city water,

406
00:17:53,245 --> 00:17:54,837
and it has a different taste to it.

407
00:17:54,837 --> 00:17:57,799
So, what we're gonna do,
is using your ideas so far,

408
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:00,244
you guys have told me
again based on color,

409
00:18:00,244 --> 00:18:02,154
and you mentioned about the smell of it,

410
00:18:02,154 --> 00:18:04,597
and you've mentioned
about tasting the water.

411
00:18:04,597 --> 00:18:07,952
So, I have here three different
liquids that I'm going

412
00:18:07,952 --> 00:18:10,434
to go around and show
you, and on your paper,

413
00:18:10,434 --> 00:18:13,236
you're going to determine
if these liquids are safe

414
00:18:13,236 --> 00:18:15,004
or if these liquids are not.

415
00:18:15,004 --> 00:18:17,751
And since we have already
discussed that there's

416
00:18:17,751 --> 00:18:20,323
probably different qualities
for your water versus

417
00:18:20,323 --> 00:18:23,241
the water you drink versus
the water that you swim in

418
00:18:23,241 --> 00:18:25,924
or the water that you are
going to take a shower in,

419
00:18:25,924 --> 00:18:28,828
so when you comment upon
whether those liquids are safe

420
00:18:28,828 --> 00:18:31,590
or not, I think it would
probably be a wise decision

421
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,116
to comment if you think
they're safe to drink versus

422
00:18:34,116 --> 00:18:35,940
safe to shower or to swim.

423
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,765
So, I'll start here with cup letter A.

424
00:18:39,765 --> 00:18:43,497
So, you can go ahead and
mark "A" on your paper,

425
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,755
and then I will walk around
so you can just take an

426
00:18:46,755 --> 00:18:49,124
observation of the liquid.

427
00:18:52,869 --> 00:19:42,893
And you determine, again,
if you think that it is safe.

428
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:47,190
- [Teacher] All right, so what do
you all think? Logan?

429
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,794
Do you think that this is safe to drink?

430
00:19:53,121 --> 00:19:54,726
So, if I gave this to you right now,

431
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:58,690
you'd go ahead and drink it
because it would be safe?

432
00:20:01,073 --> 00:20:04,493
- [Logan] No.
- [Teacher] No? What would make you change your answer then?
