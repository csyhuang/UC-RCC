1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,672
- Yeah?

2
00:00:01,672 --> 00:00:03,260
- I have a question. It says how does the

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,170
[Inaudible]?

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:16,788
- Skip predictions. Move on. Yeah. Olympic
athletes--how does your data compare to

5
00:00:16,788 --> 00:00:20,596
Olympic athletes? How does your data
compare to the class average?

6
00:00:20,596 --> 00:00:23,452
[cross talk]

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,200
Yeah?

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,970
- Do we do the predictions?

9
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,000
[cross talk]

10
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,083
- It does help to have somebody look at it
with you. Sometimes it's not as obvious as

11
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:59,413
you think. Scott, we're going to stay on
task, right? Good.

12
00:00:59,413 --> 00:01:02,316
[cross talk]

13
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,910
We're not doing predictions, right?

14
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,878
- No.

15
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,310
- So, take a look at patterns. What you
want to do for this question is look at

16
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:40,620
patterns. Do you see any patterns there?
Okay, good. It's not necessarily worse, by

17
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:47,970
the way. It's definitely different. It's
worse, Skye, if you're like dead. If we're

18
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:52,815
talking about heart rate and yours is
worse...

19
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:04,491
So, we still have a little bit to learn
how that affects you if you are inactive

20
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:05,931
or not.

21
00:02:05,931 --> 00:02:07,045
- [inaudible]

22
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:29,058
- So, let's look at the pattern, there.
You see that? That's kind of what I was

23
00:02:29,058 --> 00:02:39,090
thinking. You just missed that one. Again,
one of the things we can talk about then

24
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:47,448
is data collection. Exactly. Come on,
let's go.

25
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,060
- It's not the same numbers. It's the same
pattern.

26
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,230
- Right.

27
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,200
Good. Any patterns that you guys are
seeing back there?

28
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,890
- Yeah.

29
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:10,160
- A little bit? What might that be? This
is science, be more specific. Are there

30
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:16,340
any patterns for number four? You guys
skipped it? It's okay. Yeah. Four. You

31
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:21,450
don't have to do predictions. You compare
to athletes. Don't do it for predictions,

32
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:26,018
but do it for your class data and
athletes.

33
00:03:26,344 --> 00:03:28,735
[cross talk]

34
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,750
Okay. Now, that's a perfect, simple
question. Now we take that information and

35
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:13,030
put it into number six. Hopefully you're
going to make the mental jump that we need

36
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:20,920
here. What does heart rate have to do with
homeostasis? If we challenged our body

37
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:27,780
with a little bit of exercise, you know
how heart rates work, now the question is

38
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,050
why. How does that keep us alive? There
you go. Good.

39
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,690
How much more time do we need?

40
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,433
[cross talk]

41
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:53,662
Did you get this one right? If you guys
did then you understand the process, hands

42
00:04:53,662 --> 00:05:02,091
down congratulations. Make sure you share
your answers. Make it quick, I don't want

43
00:05:02,091 --> 00:05:15,001
people in and out. We good? How about a
drink? Here you go. We got it. It's good.

44
00:05:15,001 --> 00:05:20,552
No, I've got it covered, okay?

45
00:05:30,884 --> 00:05:38,501
Two more minutes remain in your seats. Number

46
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:45,970
six--there you go. You're good. Good job,
Scott. You're very subtle and very

47
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:53,315
helpful. Thank you. Remember, we've got a
mic that's on there. All right, got two

48
00:05:53,315 --> 00:06:00,560
more. Thirty more seconds, right? Then
you're back in your own seats.

49
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,825
If you can do six, you're the best.

50
00:06:28,797 --> 00:06:31,491
Ten seconds or so.
Get in your own seats for

51
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,953
the next ten seconds.

52
00:06:33,905 --> 00:06:36,506
[cross talk]

53
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,760
Two things are going to happen--we're
going to start off with simple answers,

54
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,780
then we're going build upon them and then
hopefully we'll get to the more creative

55
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,410
ones at the end. This class, we have
enough time to do that. So, let's do that

56
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,520
right off the bat.
Question one. Daryl, can you read it or

57
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,160
would you prefer to have somebody else
read it?

58
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,540
- I can read it.
- Okay. Good.

59
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,450
- "What is the hypothesis being tested?"

60
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:16,700
- Okay. So, let's talk about it. In our
experiment, we were looking to get

61
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,560
something measured. What is a valid
hypothesis for this experiment? Scott

62
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,540
we've got and then Alicia. Alicia, let's
go.

63
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,690
- How does exercise affect your heart
rate?

64
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:32,500
- Good. Now, that's a step in the right
direction. The hypothesis has got to

65
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,300
include the concept-- Alicia and anybody
in her group want to help her out--it's

66
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:41,180
got to include the concept of homeostasis.
So, can we do that? Can we tale a look at

67
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,230
our aim, a look at our model
hypothesis--how does exercise affect heart

68
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:52,120
rate? That's a good start. Anybody else
have something else different that would

69
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:58,650
support our understanding of homeostasis?
You're yawning. You okay? All right. Let's

70
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,200
sit up. Thank you.
Little bit more. Good. Good. Like you're

71
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,830
playing third base, okay Matt? Good. Let's
sit back now. There you go. Got it.

72
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,390
Anybody else? Go ahead.

73
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,940
- If we do exercise then our heart rate
will change.

74
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,670
- Okay. So, that's kind of what Alicia
said. Go ahead.

75
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,780
- It should keep going up and then when
you're not, it goes down.

76
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:25,010
- Again, a great, great hypothesis if we
were at a third or fourth grade level,

77
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,980
that's something we want to do. But we're
not at third or fourth grade. It's a tenth

78
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,920
grade class here. I want you to get out of
your seventh grade minds and add this

79
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,130
concept of regulation. You want to try?

80
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,870
- How does homeostasis affect your heart
rate?

81
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,610
- "How does homeostasis affect your heart
rate?" Think about that, okay? You want to

82
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:45,050
reword that? Which causes which?

83
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,320
- Oh, how does your heart rate affect
homeostasis?

84
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,070
- Good. But now we've got to remember. We
combined exercise in this. Kevin?

85
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:59,330
- How does your heart rate change to meet
the needs of your muscles and cells in the

86
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,500
body?

87
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:04,900
- You didn't use the word "homeostasis,"
but, "How does your heart change to meet

88
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,820
the needs of your cells and your heart in
your body?" Excellent. I don't need you to

89
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,560
write that. I just need you to understand
that's the direction we're going. You want

90
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,600
to try now?

91
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,790
- I had almost the same thing. I put,
"Heart rate changing throughout exercise

92
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,480
to the needs of homeostasis."

93
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:26,090
- Homeostasis. Now you guys are closer on
it. So, this is about how does your body

94
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:31,200
adapt itself, even when stress with
exercise to maintain balance, to maintain

95
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,960
homeostasis. In the beginning of this
unit, you guys remember I had the balance

96
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:39,460
board up here? How many of you got on it?
I forget. One person? Two people? That's

97
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,520
it? Three people? Do you remember how hard
that was to do? Did we throw things at the

98
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,910
people?
- Yeah.

99
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,930
- Was that easier or harder to stay
balanced when that was happening?

100
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:48,880
- Harder.

101
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,000
- No, I thought it was like easier.

102
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:56,010
- What's the room for error? How easy is
it for one of the sides to touch or how

103
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:59,910
not easy is it?
- It's very easy.

104
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:04,760
- Same with homeostasis. That margin of
error--we're in a small range here. If I

105
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:12,348
take your temperature, Dustin, and it's
98.6, does that mean you're healthy or not

106
00:10:12,348 --> 00:10:14,206
healthy?
- Not healthy?

107
00:10:14,206 --> 00:10:15,854
- Okay. 98.6?
- No.

108
00:10:15,854 --> 00:10:22,356
- But what if you're 102? What if you're
101? What if you're just 100? What does

109
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:32,000
that tell you? You want to try? So, 98.6
is normal. But what if somebody takes your

110
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:37,313
temperature and you're at 100 degrees or
101 or 102? What does that tell you?

111
00:10:37,313 --> 00:10:38,775
- It's not normal.

112
00:10:41,353 --> 00:10:42,978
- You want to give me a word for that?

113
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,043
- Sick?

114
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,400
- You would be sick. You'd have a fever.
Something would be wrong with you. You

115
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:53,420
would be not normal, right? Good. That's a
small number. 98.6 and if you have 101,

116
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:00,120
you've got to see a doctor or something.
You've got to get rest. You've got to get

117
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,720
medicine. You've got to do something to
help your body heal. All right. Number

118
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,066
one, done.
Number two and three--Daryl, you did a

119
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:10,270
good job reading the first one. Richie,
can I ask you to read the second one?

120
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:14,030
- Sure. What are the controls in the
experiment?

121
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:17,795
- Okay. So, controls--another word for
controls anybody, real quick?

122
00:11:17,795 --> 00:11:19,530
- Independent variables?

123
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:24,600
- No. Not at all. Constants. Things that
don't change. So, above the word

124
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:32,620
"controls, " can you guys write the word
"constants?" Things that stay the same.

125
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,690
So, Savannah, good, good opportunity for
you to learn, okay? So, when we say

126
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:39,810
controls, we're talking about the exact
opposite of a variable, which is a thing

127
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,670
that changes. Everything stays the same or
constant. What are some the examples of

128
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:47,720
the constants that you have in this
experiment, the controls? Go ahead.

129
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,470
- The three categories?

130
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:54,170
- The three categories. We mentioned
everybody in the same three categories.

131
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,090
Okay. Go ahead.

132
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,600
- The amount of time you're giving us.

133
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,080
- And how much time was that? Do you
remember?

134
00:11:59,260 --> 00:11:59,910
- Two minutes?

135
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,300
- Two minutes, two minutes, two minutes.
The amount of time was the same.

136
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,460
- The temperature?

137
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,710
- Temperature in the... ?
- Stairway.

138
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:09,850
- Good. Because if you were going to talk
about your own temperature, actually that

139
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:15,568
changes. Again, that's a whole other topic
about homeostasis, that when we exercise,

140
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:19,900
we start sweating, right? So, you're
talking about the temperature in the exact

141
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,680
place. Okay. Anybody else? Go ahead.

142
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,737
- Where we exercise and then the height of
the stairs, like if one stair was higher

143
00:12:30,737 --> 00:12:32,339
than the other, then it would be harder.

144
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:36,210
- Right. All the steps are the same. Now,
here's a control one kid said in my last

145
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:41,220
class and the other kids disagreed with
him. He said the exercise was the control,

146
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,880
that we all did the same thing.

147
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,800
- No.

148
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:48,850
- Do you remember what we did? We walked
the stairs. Did we all walk the stairs the

149
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,080
same way?

150
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:49,830
- No.

151
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:54,070
- Well, some of you kids hustled, right?
Like two minutes, you were like bunnies,

152
00:12:54,250 --> 00:13:03,740
like gerbils on the stairway. You were
just going crazy. Others were just walking

153
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:10,620
and it was okay. Good. Let's move on.
Three, independent and dependent

154
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,320
variables. That would be helpful. Thank
you for your hand up. We only need one

155
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,700
answer of the two and somebody else will
give the other one. So, dependent or

156
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,080
independent, whatever you want.

157
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:22,170
- Heart rate is the dependent variable
upstairs.

158
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:27,120
- Okay, one second. One second. So, tell
me a little bit more, though, Daryl. Is it

159
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,050
heart rate and how do we measure the heart
rate? Take a look at your graph. Your

160
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,960
dependent variable is going to be very
well described on your graph. Help me out.

161
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:42,330
Go ahead. Okay. You're looking at it.
Somebody want to help him out? What is the

162
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:46,890
dependent variable of this? He's close,
but he's not close enough to be right.

163
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,770
Savannah?
- Number of heart beats per minute?

164
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:52,410
- Per minute. You had to have the per
minute on that, okay? That's the standard

165
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:57,533
that we use in science. Independent
variable--Kelsey, would you like to try?

166
00:13:57,533 --> 00:13:58,972
- I'm not sure I know it.

167
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:02,000
- Okay. That's okay.
What did we introduce in this experiment

168
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:08,771
to affect our heart rate to see if we
could stay balanced?

169
00:14:08,771 --> 00:14:09,300
- Exercise?

170
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,417
- Bingo. So, your independent
variable?

171
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:13,044
- Exercise.

172
00:14:13,044 --> 00:14:19,990
- Exercise. Two minutes of exercise is
what we did. Very good. Your back group,

173
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:27,850
you have another one or it's all up here?
Okay. Four, how does your data compare to

174
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:35,320
the Olympic athletes? How does your
personal data compare to the class? Now,

175
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,810
remember, we're scientists. So, you just
can't say, "It went up and then it went

176
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:44,090
down," or whatever. You can say that, but
it's got to be justified with some sort of

177
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:47,892
specific numbers. Richie had his hand up
first, okay Justine? Okay. Go ahead.

178
00:14:47,892 --> 00:14:54,460
- My heart rate predictions were very low
because I didn't have any idea and then my

179
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,070
actual heart rate was higher than the
Olympic athletes because they're used to

180
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,040
running a lot.

181
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,850
- Okay. Here's a good example of what I'm
talking about. First of all, what you did

182
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,710
with predictions is great. We didn't
actually have to even do that one for this

183
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:11,720
question, but that's great. Richie, when
you say they were higher, what do you

184
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,380
mean? Your resting rate was higher? Your
post exercise rate was higher? Your

185
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,640
recovery rate was higher?

186
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,600
- All of them.

187
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,820
- Okay. You've got to include them in your
answer. You have to include that in your

188
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,340
answer. You've got to be specific. Go
ahead, Matt. Margaret, you're next, okay?

189
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,492
Yeah. Go ahead.

190
00:15:30,492 --> 00:15:37,040
- My prediction, I had low numbers, but
after doing the experiment, only one of my

191
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,540
numbers was lower than the Olympic
athletes.

192
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,270
- Okay. So, again, what was that one
number?

193
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,160
- Post-exercise.

194
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:52,240
- Post-exercise was lower. Wow. That's
rare, by the way. Did you see the class

195
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:57,793
data compared to you, then? We weren't
supposed to do the prediction, but I'm

196
00:15:57,793 --> 00:16:00,880
getting so many hits here. How many of you
to a look at your prediction compared to

197
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,160
other people?
Quite a few people. You guys when you were

198
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:09,310
doing this, you asked me, "What's the
normal range?" And I didn't tell you. I

199
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:14,270
wonder what you would say your prediction
is after I gave you a range. I

200
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:17,670
purposely didn't just to let you see,
just like you said, "Mine was off because

201
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:24,350
I didn't know any better." Good. All
right. Five--super important question

202
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:27,880
here--oh, I'm so sorry, does anyone else
want to contribute to the Olympic

203
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:32,330
athletes? I'm so sorry. Go ahead.

204
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:39,270
- My actual heart rate was higher than the
Olympic athletes, but for the exercise

205
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:42,050
one, it was only seven heart beats lower.

206
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:49,460
- Okay. So, what does that mean to you?
How close to an Olympic athlete are you is

207
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,230
what I'm asking.

208
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,760
- I guess it could be exercise. Like with
the Olympic athletes, I know it wouldn't

209
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:59,920
be like anything for them. For me to be
like that far off is kind of like

210
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,285
impressive.

211
00:17:01,285 --> 00:17:04,130
- Right. And how would you know that?
Didn't you say you had like a cousin

212
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,040
who...
- Does crew.

213
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,460
- Does crew at the Olympic level or just
does crew?

214
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,800
- She does crew at an Olympic level.

215
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,690
- Wow, a premiere athlete, then.
Fantastic.

216
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,240
- What's crew?

217
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:19,840
- Crew is when you row a shell or row a
boat. There's singles, doubles and quads.

218
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:20,980
- Oh yeah.

219
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,410
- Fantastic. Anybody else before we move
on? Christina and then Scott.

220
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:32,560
- I noticed that we're just like, like I
realized we're all, like, the same because

221
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:37,090
when the Olympic athletes went up, class
average went up and ours went up, so I

222
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:41,400
noticed it was the same pattern, just like
depending on what we were doing it was

223
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,540
different than the Olympics and all that
stuff.

224
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,420
- That's the big picture I want everybody
to see here. Take a look at your graphs

225
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,330
one more time. Do you agree with what
Christina just said? Forget about your

226
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:58,910
prediction number. Did you see that
there's a pattern here?

227
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:02,470
No matter who you are as an individual in
this class or as a class average or as

228
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:09,215
Olympic athletes, when we exposed our body
to exercise, what happened in all cases?

229
00:18:09,215 --> 00:18:10,730
- It went up.

230
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:15,600
- So, we would say it increased. Okay.
What happened when we rested,

231
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,680
post-exercise? Yes?
- It decreased.

232
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,370
- It decreased. Right. So, there is a
general pattern. Excellent job, Christina.

233
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,210
Go ahead, Scott. Make it quick.

234
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,910
- I had the same thing as her.

235
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:33,830
- Okay. Good. All right. Key question--if
we can answer six, we've got this lesson

236
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:39,760
down pat. When muscles are active, cells
use nutrients and oxygen at a higher rate

237
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:44,810
and produce waste, chemicals and heat more
rapidly. What does heart rate, how does

238
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,420
heart rate demonstrate
regulation/homeostasis in the body? I've

239
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,800
got three hands up. I didn't see the
order. I'm sorry. So, I'm going to go four

240
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:58,043
or five hands up. I got one, maybe two, I
don't know, Gabby, three, go ahead.

241
00:18:58,043 --> 00:19:00,202
Richie, if someone leaves something out,
it's yours.

242
00:19:00,202 --> 00:19:07,700
- When you're exercising, like, you're
using more nutrients and oxygen so the

243
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,160
blood has to carry more nutrients at a
faster rate so your muscles get it. It

244
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:17,870
does that to maintain homeostasis. So,
it's, like, using it constantly.

245
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:24,450
- Okay. Daryl? She did a good job. I'm
going to change the question for you. What

246
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:28,370
if your body didn't do that? What if
you're running up and down the stairs,

247
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:31,500
Daryl, and your heart rate didn't
increase?

248
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,685
- It would have a hard time maintaining
homeostasis.

249
00:19:35,685 --> 00:19:37,970
- Okay. Excellent. And what would happen?
What do you think?

250
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:41,510
- You'd be dehydrated and wouldn't sweat
or anything.

251
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,690
- Well, I don't know if you'd be
dehydrated.

252
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:51,310
- You wouldn't get as much oxygen because
it wouldn't be working as fast and you

253
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:59,035
wouldn't be like... So, it might get
stuck in there while you're running up and

254
00:19:59,035 --> 00:20:00,000
down...
