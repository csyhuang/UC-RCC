1
00:00:01,039 --> 00:00:01,959
- Glue.

2
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:02,928
Here we are.

3
00:00:02,928 --> 00:00:05,960
- [Boy on left] Compression
is really (background chatter)

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,758
Compression is really getting it.

5
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:10,081
- [Teacher] Hey guys, what ya doin?

6
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:11,390
- Adding our stuff to this.

7
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:12,598
- Oh, I've been trying to tell you

8
00:00:12,598 --> 00:00:16,151
that this bridge holds one
kilogram without breaking.

9
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:18,797
- [Teacher] A thousand grams?

10
00:00:18,797 --> 00:00:20,354
Wow!

11
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,037
That's really good.

12
00:00:22,037 --> 00:00:26,600
- That's probably why you
want us to have a railing.

13
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,796
- [Teacher] Uh huh.

14
00:00:27,796 --> 00:00:29,908
- So it doesn't just slide off.

15
00:00:29,908 --> 00:00:32,753
- That's true, you do want to
keep something on the bridge.

16
00:00:32,753 --> 00:00:34,272
Well, that's very good.

17
00:00:34,272 --> 00:00:35,867
- And we're thinking about,

18
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:38,302
it bends a lot, so we could do this.

19
00:00:38,302 --> 00:00:39,942
- It's really bendy bendy.

20
00:00:39,942 --> 00:00:43,106
- And you just broke it.

21
00:00:43,106 --> 00:00:44,708
Don't break it.

22
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:49,113
The last time she just dropped it

23
00:00:49,113 --> 00:00:51,192
and it splattered all over the place.

24
00:00:51,192 --> 00:00:52,480
- [Teacher] Okay, so this is the roadway?

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,200
- Yes.

26
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,474
- Okay, and then what's
going to hold this up?

27
00:00:56,474 --> 00:01:00,663
- We're trying to figure out everything.

28
00:01:00,663 --> 00:01:02,558
If we get all the pieces,
and then trying to see

29
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:04,311
what we can do to add it all together.

30
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:06,598
- Do we have, um, wait a minute,

31
00:01:06,598 --> 00:01:10,870
guys, we could have one of
the railings on the front

32
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,078
and the bottom.

33
00:01:12,078 --> 00:01:14,040
The top and bottom.

34
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,961
- Stick? Cause I was thinking we could

35
00:01:14,961 --> 00:01:18,630
put this on the bottom.

36
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,997
- Guys, like if we had
one on the top and bottom,

37
00:01:21,997 --> 00:01:24,958
like on the movie, it
would hold it down and up

38
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:28,104
at the same time, keeping it flat.

39
00:01:28,104 --> 00:01:29,544
- Hey, you know what we could do?

40
00:01:29,544 --> 00:01:30,914
We could make kind of like a T shape

41
00:01:30,914 --> 00:01:32,156
and then bend the top of the stick,

42
00:01:32,156 --> 00:01:35,795
and then glue it on that way.

43
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:37,679
- What would you glue that to?

44
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:39,154
You say you're bending it into a T shape,

45
00:01:39,154 --> 00:01:40,464
okay so you'd have a T shape.

46
00:01:40,464 --> 00:01:41,719
- Go like--
- [Teacher] Okay.

47
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:42,950
- Try to bend that.

48
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,952
- [Boy on left] Hand me a book,

49
00:01:45,952 --> 00:01:51,199
we need to put more compression.

50
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:56,238
- I learned by that idea,
if I put a book on it,

51
00:01:56,238 --> 00:01:58,792
it would keep the glue down,

52
00:01:58,792 --> 00:02:00,870
and it would keep it compressed.

53
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,148
- [Boy on left] We need more compression

54
00:02:02,148 --> 00:02:03,401
let's get a couple of books.

55
00:02:03,401 --> 00:02:04,516
- Here's another one.

56
00:02:04,516 --> 00:02:05,921
Also, put a kilogram on it.

57
00:02:05,921 --> 00:02:08,231
- Yes, you did put a
kilogram on it, that's true.

58
00:02:08,231 --> 00:02:09,473
- [Boy on right] I mean, like, on there.

59
00:02:09,473 --> 00:02:10,356
- Oh, okay.

60
00:02:10,356 --> 00:02:12,724
So this rail that you have over here,

61
00:02:12,724 --> 00:02:14,753
that's a truss?

62
00:02:14,753 --> 00:02:17,040
- And as soon as we add this.

63
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,397
- Is that going to be
under or above the railway?

64
00:02:19,397 --> 00:02:21,312
- We were deciding to go above.

65
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,681
- Cause it has to have a railing,

66
00:02:23,681 --> 00:02:30,271
and then below is optional.

67
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:32,790
- Okay, but how is it
going to get attached?

68
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,473
- We were trying to figure out that.

69
00:02:34,473 --> 00:02:35,681
- Okay.

70
00:02:35,681 --> 00:02:48,513
(background chatter)

71
00:02:48,513 --> 00:02:50,298
- Now we just keep going.

72
00:02:50,298 --> 00:02:51,023
- [Teacher] Okay.

73
00:02:51,023 --> 00:02:55,013
(background chatter)

74
00:02:55,013 --> 00:02:57,233
I will come back and
check on you, all right?

75
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:59,032
- Okay, give me a couple Popsicle sticks,

76
00:02:59,032 --> 00:03:03,154
so I can put it underneath.

77
00:03:03,154 --> 00:03:05,345
- Will we put them underneath the thing?

78
00:03:05,345 --> 00:03:08,476
- [Boy on left] Oh, dang, dang, dang.

79
00:03:08,476 --> 00:03:21,636
(background chatter)

80
00:03:21,636 --> 00:03:23,516
- [Girl in pink] It's hard,
because these right here,

81
00:03:23,516 --> 00:03:24,956
but only two places are touching.

82
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:26,558
- Oh, I see what you mean.

83
00:03:26,558 --> 00:03:28,520
I don't think it's overlapping,

84
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,877
because there's the one in between

85
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,595
- [Girl in white] I was
just making sure, okay.

86
00:03:32,595 --> 00:03:33,791
- Yeah, I see what you're saying,

87
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,951
but I kinda think they work,

88
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:38,876
because this is really only touching this,

89
00:03:38,876 --> 00:03:40,595
and here it touches this one,

90
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,441
but it's not like it's
continuously touching

91
00:03:42,441 --> 00:03:43,462
from here to here.

92
00:03:43,462 --> 00:03:46,632
- [Girl in white] I was just making sure,

93
00:03:46,632 --> 00:03:48,070
sheesh you guys.

94
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,439
- [Teacher] Why don't you all tell me

95
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,635
more about your bridge?

96
00:03:50,635 --> 00:03:53,154
- [Boy in white shirt] Well,
it's kinda a mix between

97
00:03:53,154 --> 00:03:56,440
an arch bridge and just a regular bridge,

98
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,136
I mean beam bridge.

99
00:03:57,136 --> 00:04:00,435
- Okay, can you sit up?

100
00:04:00,435 --> 00:04:03,801
- We're continuing to make our arch,

101
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:06,031
but we have run into a problem.

102
00:04:06,031 --> 00:04:06,785
- Okay.

103
00:04:06,785 --> 00:04:09,906
- We decided we're going
to put glue on top of here,

104
00:04:09,906 --> 00:04:12,184
to fill in some of the cracks that we had.

105
00:04:12,184 --> 00:04:13,914
- It would act like cement,

106
00:04:13,914 --> 00:04:16,712
but we forgot that when
glue dries, it contracts.

107
00:04:16,712 --> 00:04:19,916
- So, the bridge has kind of curled.

108
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,784
- [Logan] Guys, guys.

109
00:04:21,784 --> 00:04:24,200
- Logan, we're not in
your group, we're okay.

110
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,838
- Also, I was thinking,
when we did the arch,

111
00:04:26,838 --> 00:04:29,195
it might need support under the bottom,

112
00:04:29,195 --> 00:04:31,401
but the triangle might be a little odd,

113
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:34,233
cause it would stand on this end part.

114
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:36,915
- [Boy in white] We could
do what we did here.

115
00:04:36,915 --> 00:04:39,359
- Can you get the popsicle stick

116
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:40,996
to be the shape you want it to be?

117
00:04:40,996 --> 00:04:43,191
- Well, I was thinking
we could just, like,

118
00:04:43,191 --> 00:04:45,559
bend it, and put it on that.

119
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:48,195
- I'm going to test this on the weights

120
00:04:48,195 --> 00:04:52,178
- We need two kilograms,
if you can get it.

121
00:04:52,178 --> 00:04:53,627
- [Teacher] Now, how long is your bridge?

122
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:57,603
Have you measured your bridge?

123
00:04:57,603 --> 00:04:58,758
- Our bridge is--

124
00:04:58,758 --> 00:04:59,789
- [Teacher] Are you doing it in metric,

125
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:00,627
or in customary?

126
00:05:00,627 --> 00:05:01,638
- We're doing it in customary.

127
00:05:01,638 --> 00:05:02,717
- [Teacher] Customary, okay.

128
00:05:02,717 --> 00:05:08,233
- It's 55 cm, or 22
inches and 2 cm. (laughs)

129
00:05:08,233 --> 00:05:12,390
- [Teacher] Okay, we're not
going to mix measurements.

130
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,360
- It's like, 22 and a half inches.

131
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,156
- [Teacher] Okay.

132
00:05:18,156 --> 00:05:22,868
So if you had 12, is that 12 plus 9?

133
00:05:22,868 --> 00:05:26,631
- Yeah.

134
00:05:26,631 --> 00:05:29,951
- So 21 and a half maybe?

135
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:30,672
- Yes.

136
00:05:30,672 --> 00:05:31,554
- Okay.

137
00:05:31,554 --> 00:05:34,720
- You guys, I got the two 200
kilogram things, so we could--

138
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,384
- Gram?

139
00:05:36,384 --> 00:05:37,791
- I said gram.

140
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,196
- [Teacher] 200 grams.

141
00:05:39,196 --> 00:05:40,670
- It will be heavier than the glue bottle.

142
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,271
- And that way we can use the glue.

143
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:45,230
- Okay, so this is the bridgeway

144
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,348
where the cars are going to go?

145
00:05:46,348 --> 00:05:48,751
The arch is going to be above the roadway.

146
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:51,073
- No, because, here
you can't fit two cars,

147
00:05:51,073 --> 00:05:53,436
but it will go smoothly
for the rest of it.

148
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,794
Like, we made it so two cars would go

149
00:05:54,794 --> 00:05:56,396
right next to each other,

150
00:05:56,396 --> 00:05:58,718
like we didn't think we
could leave the extra space.

151
00:05:58,718 --> 00:06:00,042
- Right, but they might take off

152
00:06:00,042 --> 00:06:01,876
each other's rear-view mirrors.

153
00:06:01,876 --> 00:06:06,950
(background chatter)

154
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,157
- Right.

155
00:06:08,157 --> 00:06:09,631
- We ran into that, though.

156
00:06:09,631 --> 00:06:11,036
- What could you do about that?

157
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:14,914
- We don't really know, because
all of this stuff is dry,

158
00:06:14,914 --> 00:06:17,236
so far it's holding up quite well.

159
00:06:17,236 --> 00:06:19,069
- Well, what if this was only one lane?

160
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:20,429
What if you made another one just like it

161
00:06:20,429 --> 00:06:21,462
to be the other lane?

162
00:06:21,462 --> 00:06:22,878
- [Boy in white] That would be perfect.

163
00:06:22,878 --> 00:06:24,156
- But it would take a good long while.

164
00:06:24,156 --> 00:06:25,235
- [Boy in white] No it wouldn't.

165
00:06:25,235 --> 00:06:26,987
We built this in a couple of days.

166
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:31,223
Yeah, we could glue it
together with like these.

167
00:06:31,223 --> 00:06:32,201
- Yeah, okay.

168
00:06:32,201 --> 00:06:32,875
- Perfect.

169
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,117
- Thanks Miss Hoyle.

170
00:06:34,117 --> 00:06:36,439
All right guys, let's
start working on that one.

171
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,913
So are these the same size as these?

172
00:06:37,913 --> 00:06:39,516
Let's try to make it more even this time.

173
00:06:39,516 --> 00:06:41,791
- Making that is going
to take, like 50 days.

174
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,475
- We need 50 of these guys, right?

175
00:06:43,475 --> 00:06:45,112
- [Teacher] Tell me a
little bit about this arch

176
00:06:45,112 --> 00:06:46,238
and what it's going to do.

177
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:47,596
As you build the arch,

178
00:06:47,596 --> 00:06:50,197
how is that going to
keep your bridge steady?

179
00:06:50,197 --> 00:06:53,517
- Well, it's like, when
the arch gets pulled on,

180
00:06:53,517 --> 00:06:55,560
it's gonna be secured here,

181
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,440
so instead of the bridge
itself getting the tension,

182
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,749
it's going to go a little
bit like it is now.

183
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:03,223
- Okay, it's going to pull it away?

184
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:04,431
- A little bit.

185
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:11,037
Which means I've got to
get the weight on it.

186
00:07:11,037 --> 00:07:13,196
- So it's going to create
the outward thrust?

187
00:07:13,196 --> 00:07:14,508
- Yeah.

188
00:07:14,508 --> 00:07:16,435
- Which with an outward thrust,

189
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:18,641
what do you need to have
on the sides of the bridge,

190
00:07:18,641 --> 00:07:19,999
if you have an outward thrust?

191
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:21,160
Remember?

192
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,517
- Oh, it's, uh

193
00:07:23,517 --> 00:07:27,184
- Abutments, do you remember that?

194
00:07:27,184 --> 00:07:28,231
- Yeah.

195
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:30,832
- You need that, something
over here to take the force,

196
00:07:30,832 --> 00:07:34,953
the pressure that's being
exerted from the center outward.

197
00:07:34,953 --> 00:07:36,984
(background chatter) the outward thrust.

198
00:07:36,984 --> 00:07:41,478
- I have a thing with that
one, it hates me, I hate it.

199
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:45,681
- So have you tried laying

200
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:47,631
your bridge across a 20-inch span?

201
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:49,593
- Yeah, we did it on a desk

202
00:07:49,593 --> 00:07:52,078
(background chatter)

203
00:07:52,078 --> 00:07:54,713
- It caved in a little in the middle,

204
00:07:54,713 --> 00:07:55,944
but when our arched is finished,

205
00:07:55,944 --> 00:07:56,954
it'll actually help.

206
00:07:56,954 --> 00:07:59,880
- Tell me why you feel like
it caves in in the middle?

207
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,200
- The important thing is, what we did was,

208
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,360
we put glue in between
in to act like cement,

209
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,277
to keep it together.

210
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,308
- Uh huh.

211
00:08:07,308 --> 00:08:08,796
- Well, that made it curl a little bit,

212
00:08:08,796 --> 00:08:10,120
and so it was a little
weaker in the middle,

213
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,233
because that's where it
was starting to bend.

214
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:14,195
- And also partially because it's, it's--

215
00:08:14,195 --> 00:08:15,518
- We don't have a lot of
support on the bottom,

216
00:08:15,518 --> 00:08:19,512
which makes the, um, its tension affected.

217
00:08:19,512 --> 00:08:22,751
- I kind of suggested
triangles at the bottom,

218
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:24,957
but we haven't really done that yet.

219
00:08:24,957 --> 00:08:26,757
- Yeah, that's because we
haven't got the arch up yet.

220
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:28,835
Oh, you mean on the bottom of the bridge.

221
00:08:28,835 --> 00:08:29,671
- Yeah.

222
00:08:29,671 --> 00:08:32,990
- That's a good idea.

223
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,360
Well, we need to start working on it.

224
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,707
- All right, well I'll leave you alone,

225
00:08:35,707 --> 00:08:38,748
and I'll come back and
check on you later, okay?

226
00:08:38,748 --> 00:08:40,464
- Guys, we've got four of these.

227
00:08:40,464 --> 00:08:41,675
We need a lot more.

228
00:08:41,675 --> 00:08:43,149
- All right then, well let's get going.

229
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:44,914
I'm going to keep working
on the arch, okay?

230
00:08:44,914 --> 00:08:50,263
- Wait, wait, wait, that was
part of the arch support.

231
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,760
- The first arch needs to get worked on.

232
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,513
Could you guys make the second road,

233
00:08:54,513 --> 00:08:56,463
and I'll continue on the arch.

234
00:08:56,463 --> 00:09:02,674
It needs to get to get
built (background chatter)

235
00:09:02,674 --> 00:09:18,064
(background chatter)

236
00:09:18,064 --> 00:09:19,794
- This idea isn't working.

237
00:09:19,794 --> 00:09:22,712
- Maybe we should try to
like add this on here,

238
00:09:22,712 --> 00:09:25,152
so that it doesn't like fall.
- Oh, okay.

239
00:09:25,152 --> 00:09:27,161
- And that way the arch
will stick to the top,

240
00:09:27,161 --> 00:09:28,670
and this arch will stick to the bottom.

241
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,680
- Do you girls want to try that?

242
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,271
- Sure, sure

243
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:35,671
- Also, I think it will hold
maybe a little better because--

244
00:09:35,671 --> 00:09:37,714
- [Girl in pink] Nicky,
it's not all like--

245
00:09:37,714 --> 00:09:39,711
- This is just like that,
it's still gonna kind of,

246
00:09:39,711 --> 00:09:43,833
it's still going to kind of stick to this,

247
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,841
even if we had this idea,

248
00:09:45,841 --> 00:09:48,793
it'd be like that, it won't
exactly hold that very well.

249
00:09:48,793 --> 00:09:50,198
- Show me how it's going to be touching,

250
00:09:50,198 --> 00:09:51,998
like this, onto there?

251
00:09:51,998 --> 00:09:54,401
- I think, yeah, well like,

252
00:09:54,401 --> 00:09:56,107
- Like that, this way?

253
00:09:56,107 --> 00:09:57,919
- Yeah, but like with this on top,

254
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:00,357
so like that, and then this at the bottom.

255
00:10:00,357 --> 00:10:01,274
- Okay.

256
00:10:01,274 --> 00:10:03,039
- It will hold better now.

257
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:05,314
- Actually this is the
right way here, right?

258
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:06,278
- Yes.

259
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:07,717
- It's like that, okay.

260
00:10:07,717 --> 00:10:11,793
- Yes, and then, we also figured out, um

261
00:10:11,793 --> 00:10:13,998
when there's going to
be 1000 grams on there,

262
00:10:13,998 --> 00:10:16,030
it broke in half.

263
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,959
- Oh no!

264
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,420
- This part, it kinda snapped.

265
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,751
- [Girl in blue] It can hold 500.

266
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:22,145
- Yeah, it can hold 500

267
00:10:22,145 --> 00:10:23,317
- It can hold 500 grams

268
00:10:23,317 --> 00:10:25,198
- Yes, and 200.
- And 200 grams.

269
00:10:25,198 --> 00:10:26,672
- Yes, so I don't--

270
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:29,470
- Oh you tried 700 grams also?

271
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,550
- Yes.
- Okay.

272
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,627
- So that's not bad.

273
00:10:31,627 --> 00:10:35,995
- It kinda snapped here, but, yeah so, um

274
00:10:35,995 --> 00:10:38,712
it might be a little more sturdy

275
00:10:38,712 --> 00:10:42,066
once we add the, like, underneath.

276
00:10:42,066 --> 00:10:43,356
- Okay, the piers?

277
00:10:43,356 --> 00:10:46,758
- We should add the piers
in the middle, seriously.

278
00:10:46,758 --> 00:10:50,078
- Well yeah, we can add it,
like, side, middle, and side.

279
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:51,839
- I feel like we should do it, like,

280
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,312
bang one on that side and one on the other

281
00:10:54,312 --> 00:10:57,911
- Yeah, but it's still with
the one on top (laughs)

282
00:10:57,911 --> 00:11:01,055
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

283
00:11:01,055 --> 00:11:02,671
- We definitely want it--

284
00:11:02,671 --> 00:11:04,192
- Want it to hold.

285
00:11:04,192 --> 00:11:05,516
- Yeah, definitely.

286
00:11:05,516 --> 00:11:06,398
- Yes.

287
00:11:06,398 --> 00:11:07,722
- [Teacher] All right,
I want to see what's

288
00:11:07,722 --> 00:11:08,917
going on over here.

289
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:16,677
(background chatter)

290
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:17,954
- Right now working on the railing.

291
00:11:17,954 --> 00:11:18,707
- [Teacher] Okay.

292
00:11:18,707 --> 00:11:21,554
- And Molly's doing that by, she gluing,

293
00:11:21,554 --> 00:11:23,516
she's working on the sidewalk right now,

294
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,791
we're almost done with the railing.

295
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:26,801
- [Teacher] Okay.

296
00:11:26,801 --> 00:11:29,306
- And what Molly's doing
right now, is she is,

297
00:11:29,306 --> 00:11:32,281
we're gluing two popsicle
sticks together like this.

298
00:11:32,281 --> 00:11:33,001
- [Teacher] Okay.

299
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:37,517
- And, uh, we're going to
glue them against here.

300
00:11:37,517 --> 00:11:39,187
- [Teacher] Okay.

301
00:11:39,187 --> 00:11:41,639
- So they can, we're probably going to put

302
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:45,157
another popsicle stick
like this in the middle,

303
00:11:45,157 --> 00:11:50,436
so they glue together easily.

304
00:11:50,436 --> 00:11:51,992
Glue them right here to the side.

305
00:11:51,992 --> 00:11:52,631
- Okay.

306
00:11:52,631 --> 00:11:53,919
- And then we're going to

307
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:56,473
put the railing on the side
of this, so like on this side,

308
00:11:56,473 --> 00:11:58,319
like this and then the
railing will be on this side,

309
00:11:58,319 --> 00:12:00,560
so that'll, the railing is
three inches, Brooke said.

310
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,477
- Right

311
00:12:01,477 --> 00:12:05,355
- So, we're almost done with
our bridge stuff at this--

312
00:12:05,355 --> 00:12:08,432
- Would it be helpful
to work from the bottom,

313
00:12:08,432 --> 00:12:12,356
to glue the pedestrian bridge,

314
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,991
would it be helpful to
work on it from the bottom.

315
00:12:14,991 --> 00:12:18,381
- Yeah, probably would.

316
00:12:18,381 --> 00:12:20,471
- And even though it bends, it's bent,

317
00:12:20,471 --> 00:12:21,841
it's really, really strong.

318
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:22,677
- Uh huh.

319
00:12:22,677 --> 00:12:24,477
- It can hold more than a kilogram.

320
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:25,835
- Oh that's wonderful.

321
00:12:25,835 --> 00:12:27,716
Now did you, um, what kind of force,

322
00:12:27,716 --> 00:12:28,958
what do we call it when the bridge is

323
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,514
bending like that in the middle?

324
00:12:30,514 --> 00:12:32,639
- Um, it's compression and tension.

325
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,388
Tension is pushing it out, like this,

326
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:37,039
making the sides curl up,

327
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:39,040
and then the compression is

328
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,826
what makes the bridge (inaudible)

329
00:12:43,826 --> 00:12:47,713
- Okay, so you're going to
compensate for that like this.

330
00:12:47,713 --> 00:12:49,199
So are these your trusses?

331
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:51,395
- No, these are the railings.

332
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:54,193
We thought that it would act like a truss.

333
00:12:54,193 --> 00:12:55,468
- Okay.

334
00:12:55,468 --> 00:12:57,281
- Even though we're not going

335
00:12:57,281 --> 00:12:59,475
to have one going on the bottom

336
00:12:59,475 --> 00:13:01,159
- They're going to be on the top?

337
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:02,552
It's all going to be on top.

338
00:13:02,552 --> 00:13:06,801
- And you did try laying
it across a 20-inch gap?

339
00:13:06,801 --> 00:13:09,355
(background chatter)

340
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,944
- We measured it to make
sure it's 20 inches.

341
00:13:10,944 --> 00:13:14,197
- Okay, good, well do want to
try measuring a 20-inch gap

342
00:13:14,197 --> 00:13:15,868
between a couple of desks
and just seeing what it,

343
00:13:15,868 --> 00:13:17,749
not while it's wet, but when it's dry?

344
00:13:17,749 --> 00:13:21,736
See what it's like.

345
00:13:21,736 --> 00:13:22,961
What are you doing Molly?

346
00:13:22,961 --> 00:13:25,201
- I'm gluing the popsicle sticks together

347
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:28,359
for the start of the sidewalk,

348
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:29,947
and then when it's dry,

349
00:13:29,947 --> 00:13:33,073
I'm going to get them to
go together like that.

350
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:34,315
- Okay.

351
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:46,082
and then I'm going to take my railing.

352
00:13:46,082 --> 00:13:51,248
How's that going to attach?

353
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:53,626
- With another popsicle
straight up and down

354
00:13:53,626 --> 00:13:58,186
attaching the railing to the sidewalk.

355
00:13:58,186 --> 00:14:02,473
And then just attach the
whole thing to the bridge,

356
00:14:02,473 --> 00:14:03,599
as one piece.

357
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:04,783
- Okay.

358
00:14:04,783 --> 00:14:09,783
(background chatter)

359
00:14:10,077 --> 00:14:12,121
I was thinking that you guys should take

360
00:14:12,121 --> 00:14:15,232
popsicle sticks and put
them across the top,

361
00:14:15,232 --> 00:14:18,390
connecting the two railings together,

362
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,432
with popsicle sticks at the top.

363
00:14:21,432 --> 00:14:22,790
- [Boy with dark hair]
Like a covered bridge?

364
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,719
- [Molly] Yeah.

365
00:14:28,463 --> 00:14:30,000
- So this is for a crab run bridge,

366
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,755
is that what it's called?

367
00:14:30,755 --> 00:14:33,838
- [All] Yes.

368
00:14:33,838 --> 00:14:36,194
- That's a real bridge that
needs to be replaced, isn't it?

369
00:14:36,194 --> 00:14:36,879
- Yes.

370
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,679
- And we've actually figured out

371
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,432
what's it's going to be replaced by.

372
00:14:40,432 --> 00:14:42,673
- [Teacher] Oh, okay, you
found it on the internet?

373
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:46,028
- It's actually, it's um, a beam bridge.

374
00:14:46,028 --> 00:14:49,151
But it's not over water,
it's over rough terrain.

375
00:14:49,151 --> 00:14:50,265
- [Teacher] Okay.

376
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:54,480
And it's in Highland
County, it's way to the--

377
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,406
- [Molly] It's northwest.
