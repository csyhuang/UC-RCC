1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,080
- [teacher] Plug in two. You got it?

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:02,930
- [together] We got it.

3
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:12,559
- All right. First question is... Once
energy is used up, it's gone for good.

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:18,180
Talk to your partner, no! Let's try that
one more time folks, eyes up here. What

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:18,980
was the rule on the darts?

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,250
- The rule is don't do anything until you
say so.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,022
- Thank you. Don't act until I say so. Go!

8
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:41,090
[Background Chatter]

9
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,680
- Yeah.
- There could be a little bit left of

10
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,430
potential. Is that what you mean?

11
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,240
- Yeah. Well, [Background Chatter].

12
00:00:47,240 --> 00:01:05,000
[Background Chatter]

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,870
- All right. On three. I'm going to need
eyes up here, please. One, two, th-- Don't

14
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,240
flip your card until I tell you to. I
shouldn't be able to tell what your card

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,570
is. It should be much more secret. They're
colored, guys, I can tell what they are.

16
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:23,720
Okay! Here we go, on three, hold up your
card please. One, two, three! Okay. We've

17
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,590
got mostly disagrees. And then we have
very one confident... Oh, we disagree. So

18
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,980
here's what we're going to do. Put your
cards down. I'm calling on Mark first. So

19
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,980
where should we be looking?

20
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,630
- [together] Mark.
- At Mark.

21
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:40,530
- Okay. Okay. So I strongly disagree,
because say... So you know you... when

22
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,257
you... You know how you eat food, you get
fuel in your body and you have energy and

23
00:01:45,257 --> 00:01:50,113
you go out running. And then you're out of
energy, you're tired, you go to bed, you

24
00:01:50,113 --> 00:01:54,670
wake up the next morning, it comes back.
You eat more food and it comes back.

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,570
- Okay. So you're getting it from a
different source.

26
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:57,910
- Yeah.

27
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,830
- Okay, but that energy you have
originally. So that initial energy that

28
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:06,340
you have, and then you ran. Does it go
away? Yeah, you have plenty more, but does

29
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,370
that original energy go away?
- No.

30
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:15,010
- Where does it go? Because you still
don't have it, right? You have to eat more

31
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,330
food. This is supposed to be challenging.
Great job. Who has another idea? Or who

32
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:25,663
can tell me where does it go? It's awfully
quiet. Awfully quiet. What do you got?

33
00:02:25,663 --> 00:02:32,204
- I don't think it literally... Well, I
don't think it goes anywhere. You just...

34
00:02:32,204 --> 00:02:35,290
It just keeps making more.

35
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,040
- It makes more. So the energy I burnt,
right? So I'm running, and I'm running,

36
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,670
and I'm running. Where does it go?

37
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,150
- Out.
- Out where?

38
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,230
- To the air.

39
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,880
- To the air, in what form?

40
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,570
- Breath.

41
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,610
- Now this is tricky. This is where it
gets tricky. Breath is made of what?

42
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,880
- Vapor.
- Carbon dioxide.

43
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,850
- Water and carbon dioxide. And we call
that matter. We call that stuff. Is stuff

44
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,670
and energy the same thing?
- [together] No.

45
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,760
- No, and this is really a tricky idea in
Science. So we're going to keep working with

46
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,180
you on that. So where does the energy go?

47
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,161
- Out into sweat.

48
00:03:11,161 --> 00:03:12,830
- Out into... Now, okay, sweat is?

49
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,870
- Stuff.

50
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:19,490
- It's stuff, right? But where... So where
does the energy go? Does anybody want to

51
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,650
change their answer? And say, once it's
used up, it's used up for good? Anybody?

52
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,850
Some people I think... Now Tatum what do
you think?

53
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:30,620
- I think that when you run, it's... Some
of the energy go into the ground.

54
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,540
- How many people agree with Tatum? That
some of that energy is going to go to the

55
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,920
ground?
- Oh yeah.

56
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,720
- [together] Yeah.

57
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,010
- Okay. In what form does it go to the
ground?

58
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:39,800
- In static stuff.

59
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:45,050
- What's that?
I think you said static stuff. Is that

60
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,300
what you say?
- Yeah.

61
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,860
- Okay, so static stuff is... Now this
gets really tricky because now we're

62
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,090
getting into electrons. But you're
thinking about the rubbing, kind of

63
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,710
thinking. Is that what you're thinking?
How it rubs? And then you shock people?

64
00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:00,110
Okay. So that can happen. That's a little
more complicated so I'm going to put that

65
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:05,200
on hold for now. But what... So if I'm
running, and that energy's going into the

66
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,000
ground, somebody said that. Who said that?

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,930
- [together] Tatum.

68
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,169
- Tatum. Okay. So Tatum said the energy is
going into the ground. In what form is it

69
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:12,888
going into the ground? Yeah.
- Energy transfer.

70
00:04:12,888 --> 00:04:17,990
- It is an energy transfer, right? This is
going from my foot to the ground. What

71
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,640
form is it in? Do you guys know what I
mean when I say form?

72
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,350
- [together] Yeah.

73
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:27,560
- Yeah. We talked about kinetic, and
potential, and heat, and what else we

74
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,300
talked about? Elastic, and--
- Light.

75
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,370
- Gravitational, and light, and chemical.

76
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:32,790
- Sound.

77
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:38,080
- Heat, sound. Ooh, there's just hey, is
any of that sound energy?

78
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,850
- No.
- No?

79
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,590
- Maybe it could be sound energy.

80
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:46,747
- Yes! Sound! Because you're... You're
stepping hard. You're...

81
00:04:46,747 --> 00:04:49,690
- Okay, so if I'm running, I'm probably
going to produce some sound. Anything else

82
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,938
that could go in there? Jason?

83
00:04:50,938 --> 00:04:52,378
- Huh?

84
00:04:52,378 --> 00:04:59,152
- Okay, I think that as you step on...
You'll actually transform some potential

85
00:04:59,152 --> 00:05:04,400
energy to the ground because once you step
on, you all react to gravity to the

86
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,360
ground.

87
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,660
- So gravity's pushing down--, now remember
what gravitational energy is, is how far

88
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:16,460
it is away from the ground, right? So how
much room it has to fall basically. So

89
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:20,340
would there be... If I go like this, would
there be any gravitational energy there?

90
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,198
- Wouldn't there be if you raise your
foot?

91
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,000
- Now it's got gravitational.

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,324
- Here's what we need, I'm really doing
something to say... But here's what I want

93
00:05:29,324 --> 00:05:34,631
you to think about this one... Actually,
let's do this one more time. I want you to

94
00:05:34,631 --> 00:05:39,462
re-vote on this. Once energy is used
up, it's gone for good. Talk to each other

95
00:05:39,462 --> 00:05:40,614
for 10 seconds.

96
00:05:40,614 --> 00:06:05,885
[Background Chatter]

97
00:06:05,885 --> 00:06:07,390
- You're thinking it's
going someplace else.

98
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:10,950
- I don't know where but I don't think it
just disappears for good. I think it's

99
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,130
going somewhere.

100
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,880
- That it's somewhere but just not sure
where.

101
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,160
- Yeah.

102
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:22,396
- All right folks, we're going to re-vote
on three. One, two, three. All right, put

103
00:06:22,396 --> 00:06:26,403
your cards down for just a second. Here's
what Henry just said, and I want you to

104
00:06:26,403 --> 00:06:29,890
raise your hand if you agree with Henry.
And we're going to talk about, again guys,

105
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,360
we're not getting answers to all these
questions today, we will at some point. I

106
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,360
promise. We're going to do it in the
formal labs but not before I'm through

107
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,670
telling you. Henry, tell me what you just
said.

108
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:44,098
- I think that it's not gone for good. I'm
not sure where it goes but I think it

109
00:06:44,098 --> 00:06:48,740
doesn't just leave. It's still somewhere
but I don't know where.

110
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,870
- How many of you agree with Henry? That
you think that it's somewhere but you're

111
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,140
just not sure where?

112
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,470
- I don't know where though.

113
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,660
- All right. Do you know what form?
- No.

114
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,030
- No. Anybody else? Know where?

115
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,592
- But wait. Doesn't it just transform?

116
00:07:02,592 --> 00:07:05,960
- It can transform into something else but
then my question for you would be...

117
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,660
- [together] What?

118
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,800
- What kind of energy is it? All right,
but here's what we're going to do, we're

119
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,330
going to move on to the next one. If a
person is pushing a box, the person has

120
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:20,486
energy, but the box does not otherwise it
would help out. Ready, set, go.

121
00:07:20,486 --> 00:07:37,080
[Background Chatter]

122
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:42,748
- What's the evidence that the box has
energy? What form of energy is that,

123
00:07:42,748 --> 00:07:44,988
that's moving?
- I don't know.

124
00:07:44,988 --> 00:07:46,556
- Well, it's kineck, kineck...
- One more try.

125
00:07:46,556 --> 00:07:51,800
- Kinetic.
- Okay. [Background Chatter]

126
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,876
- Because it's currently in motion.
- Yeah.

127
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,972
- Okay. All right. So now here's what I
want... We're going do a challenge

128
00:07:58,972 --> 00:08:02,460
question. What about the person? What kind
of energy does the person have, who's

129
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,000
pushing it?

130
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,450
- That... I don't know.

131
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:12,920
- You guys all have it? Okay, here we go!
Eyes over here please. Are we a little bit

132
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:18,910
on balancing in agreement? All right, here
we go. A person is pushing a box, the

133
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,970
person has energy but the box does not,
otherwise, it would help out. On three,

134
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:29,180
hold up your cards, please. One, two,
three. So what you're saying then is you

135
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,840
all think the box does have energy, am I
correct?

136
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,360
- [together] Yeah.

137
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,828
- Okay. Chloe tell me why... What is your
evidence, that the box has energy?

138
00:08:35,828 --> 00:08:39,833
- I think it has energy because when
you're pushing it, it has a friction with

139
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,704
whatever you're pushing it.

140
00:08:41,704 --> 00:08:45,064
- How many of you agree that there's
friction there? Because it's rubbing

141
00:08:45,064 --> 00:08:47,144
against what?
- [together] The ground.

142
00:08:47,144 --> 00:08:49,770
- It's rubbing against the ground. There
could be some rubbing against you, but most likely

143
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,740
it's going to be rubbing against ground.
But here's my question, what is your

144
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:58,440
evidence that it has energy? It does have
friction, and now it gives you some sort

145
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,180
of indication that it's doing what?

146
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,250
- [together] Moving.

147
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:05,990
- It's moving. What do we call that,
something's moving? What kind of energy

148
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,390
does that? Just shout it.
- [together] Kinetic.

149
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,990
- Kinetic. So it has kinetic energy. So
here's my next question, so does anybody

150
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:16,990
disagree? The box does not have kinetic
energy? Tate?

151
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:22,210
- I didn't believe it. I thought it was
transferred. I thought that it was energy

152
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:22,760
transfer.
- [together] Yeah.

153
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,610
- Okay. So you think energy's being
transferred from the person to the box.

154
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:26,230
- Yeah.

155
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:30,340
- Okay, but the question is still, does
the box have energy? Even if I'm

156
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,150
transferring it there? Does it have energy
while it's moving?

157
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:33,390
- Yeah.

158
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,850
- Well, do you mean before the person?

159
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:40,860
- I mean while I'm moving it. I'm in the
process of pushing the box. Does the

160
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,790
box have energy?

161
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,860
- Yeah, but don't you think part of it,
would be from you, and part of it--

162
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,040
- I think all of it is from you.

163
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,450
- Oh.
- But does it still have energy?

164
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:49,870
- Yeah.

165
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:53,710
- Yeah, it does. So what's your proof?
Chloe just said it. What's your proof that

166
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,680
the box has energy?

167
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,000
- [together] Friction.
- It's moving.

168
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,880
- That it's moving. Okay, now the friction
is proof that's it's moving, perhaps. But

169
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,852
you also see it moving, that would be the proof
that it's moving. Okay, so here's my other

170
00:10:05,852 --> 00:10:08,700
question, I'm going to make this point,
this is too easy for you. We're going to

171
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,956
make this more challenging. What about the
person pushing the box? So here is me,

172
00:10:13,956 --> 00:10:19,640
this is how I push a box. So if I'm
pushing the box, what kind of energy do I

173
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:27,100
have? Think about it. Jack, what do you
think?

174
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:27,900
- Kinetic.

175
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,790
- How many of you agree with Jack, that I
have kinetic energy? How many of you think

176
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,390
there's something else going on there as
well?

177
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,120
- No.

178
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,020
- So I have... I can only have kinetic
energy, right? Because I am... ?

179
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,780
- [together] Moving. Pushing.

180
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,116
- Because I am moving and I'm pushing.
Okay. What other kind of energy must I

181
00:10:44,116 --> 00:10:45,236
have?

182
00:10:45,972 --> 00:10:57,870
- I have to say something else, like it's
kind of helping to [inaudible] and what

183
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,200
disagrees. Yesterday, you told us the
classic pool...

184
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,700
- You're talking about energy transfer?
You guys know what she's talking

185
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,997
about? We're talking about the pool and
handle.

186
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:12,120
- Yeah. I think of it kind of the same
thing only the pool hall has some of the

187
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,380
[inaudible] because you have the stick in
your hand, and you have the energy,

188
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:20,340
potential energy and then you start moving
it, and then it's kinetic and it goes

189
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,983
through the stick, and through the ball,
and it moves.

190
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:26,000
- So you're saying that I have some form
of potential energy as well?

191
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,790
- Yeah, before you start. And then
[inaudible].

192
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,290
- In what form is that potential energy?
Because I think Emily was about to say

193
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:37,370
this, too. Think about this guys. Where am
I getting my energy from? Is it

194
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,460
gravitational?
- [together] No.

195
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,010
- Muscles.

196
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:44,700
- Okay, so I've got my muscles, I've got
my body. But where's that energy coming

197
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,860
from?
- Food.

198
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,340
- Which is a form of what, Marcus?

199
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,680
- Fuel.
- Which is a form of what?

200
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,510
- Potential!

201
00:11:50,510 --> 00:12:00,000
- Time out. We're asking Marcus. Marcus,
what form of potential energy is fuel?

202
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,300
- Um.

203
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:07,380
- This is hard. Did you want a lifeline?

204
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,570
- Yeah.
- Anika, can you help him out.

205
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,250
- Chemical.

206
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,350
- Chemical, right? Make sense?

207
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,280
- [together] Yes.

208
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,680
- Okay. All right, we're going on to
the next slide. Are you ready?

209
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,250
- [together] Yeah.

210
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:25,740
- Woo hoo hoo. Okay, here we go. Now,
goodness, gracious. Okay, this is a

211
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:30,000
hard one. Cold moves faster than heat.
Ready, set, go.

212
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:58,360
[Background Chatter]

213
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,586
- And but also I remember my mom on hot
days, she's like, "Don't go upstairs

214
00:13:02,586 --> 00:13:04,026
because it's hotter." Heat rises.

215
00:13:04,026 --> 00:13:11,834
- So is it, is it move... So your
evidence that it's moving faster is that

216
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:12,698
it goes up.

217
00:13:12,698 --> 00:13:19,030
- Yeah, and also when you put it
in hot, hot water, it's looser

218
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,390
because...

219
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:24,230
- Okay, so you're saying if cold moved
faster it would go up as well?

220
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:24,410
- [together] Yeah.

221
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,770
- Faster than heat? Okay. How about moving
in other directions other than up? Is there...

222
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,220
Do you have any... ?
- Wind!

223
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:41,000
- Okay, so that would... So does one move
faster than the other? [Background Chatter]

224
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Tatum, what do you think? All right. Think about it.
[Background Chatter]

225
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,334
All right, here we go.

226
00:13:53,334 --> 00:14:03,150
[Background Chatter]

227
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:07,360
Okay, here we go. So on three, hold up
your answers please. One, two, three.

228
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,840
We've got strongly agrees. We've got an in
between. We've got an ooh, we've got a

229
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:16,270
strongly agree. And we've got a couple
in-betweens. All right. We're mostly in

230
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:20,330
orange land, we've got one green. So here
we go? You ready?

231
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:20,790
- [together] Yeah.

232
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,110
- And stand together, you're going to back
them up.

233
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:27,190
- Yeah. So, okay, so we agree that. . .

234
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:32,600
- Are you sure?
- No. Just kidding.

235
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,100
- Because I think the answer you just gave
me was certain. So you're a strongly

236
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,150
disagree. Okay.

237
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:45,900
- Well, I read it wrong. I thought it said
heat... Yeah, I thought it said heat moves

238
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,990
faster than cold.

239
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,940
- Okay, so tell me why you strongly
disagree then, Tim?

240
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:55,060
- Well, because there's just as
[inaudible] heat rises. So it has to be

241
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,430
lighter to move.

242
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,240
- And so it must be moving faster?

243
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,080
- Yeah.

244
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,450
- How many of you agreed with this... How
many of you thought about this whole heat

245
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:07,750
rising thing? Interesting. And how many of
you... Nope, you guys, it never crossed

246
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:13,860
your mind. Okay. Let's hop to another...
Tatum, do have anything else to add to

247
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,080
that?
- No.

248
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,640
- What is your evidence that cold moves
slower? Because he was just saying heat

249
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:32,136
was rising, do you have any evidence that
cold would move slower? Let's see, Alex,

250
00:15:32,136 --> 00:15:33,080
what do you think?

251
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,860
- Well, because when we did that
investigation and stuff on molecules,

252
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,800
they move faster when they're hot.

253
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,510
- The coke can.

254
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,150
- Yeah, the coke can investigation.

255
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:47,500
- Okay, so I'm going to ask them for
specific evidence. So what was your

256
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,044
specific evidence in the coke can, the hot
molec- that they were moving faster?

257
00:15:51,044 --> 00:15:56,750
- Well, there was steam coming out of it,
and then in the solid, everything's...

258
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,290
Molecules in solids are super slow. And
then as they move on to liquid then gas,

259
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,070
they move faster.
- Okay.

260
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:06,840
- And then you need heat to make liquid
into gas.

261
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:14,000
- How many of you think that this whole
molecules moving faster in a gaseous state

262
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,960
proves that heat moves faster than cold?
How many of you are kind of stuck on this

263
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:27,330
idea of cold? So let me ask you a
question, and I want you to think about it

264
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:33,170
for 10 seconds, then we might move on,
let's see. What is cold? Not looking for

265
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:40,390
examples of things that are cold but what
is cold? What is the idea of cold or

266
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:48,510
coldness? Okay, think about it for a
second. Ellie, what is cold?

267
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:55,080
- Well, it's like... It could be water
that's frozen in... I was thinking that

268
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:02,880
heat moves faster than, than cold because
if something was frozen, the molecules

269
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,910
wouldn't be moving that fast because if
they were they could try to push out on

270
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:10,020
that.
- Oh, then it might be [inaudible].

271
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,180
- Okay, so she gave me an example of what
is cold. But is coldness? So what, what

272
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:16,570
does that even mean? What does that even
mean? Anna.

273
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,310
- Shivering.
- What's that?

274
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,070
- Shivering.

275
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:25,000
- Okay, shivering is because you are cold.
What is coldness? Okay... [inaudible]

276
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,620
- I think it's when the temperature is
really low and everything's kind of darkness, when

277
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:37,270
you think of the sun warm, it's really
warm, when you have the sun. But it's

278
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,870
when you think of something cold, it's... sometimes.

279
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:42,690
- Okay, I want... You guys are giving me
some really good examples of what cold is.

280
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:53,770
Here's what I want to think about... Okay,
how to phrase this... Is there a such

281
00:17:53,770 --> 00:18:01,090
thing as cold? And if so, how would you
define it?

282
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,940
- It's a hard question!
- Oh!

283
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,440
- You got to answer! Get ready to answer!
Get ready, and do one quick response and

284
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,640
then we're going to put it aside for now,
and we're going to move on. Come on,

285
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,000
Hunter.

286
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,380
- No, because it's just heat that's a...
That's just water that can be heated or

287
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:13,590
[Background Chatter].

288
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,820
- Heat, heat is cold. Heat is that.

289
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,450
- Yeah, it's like...
- Heat, that's cold.

290
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:20,440
- Yeah.
- Oh.

291
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,700
- So it's all just kind of a scale? Like
you got hot over here and cold over here,

292
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,000
and you're talking about there's less heat
over here than there is here?

293
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,810
- Heat has cold molecules.
- Heat has colder?

294
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:32,680
- All right. So here's what we're going to
do, we're going to talk more about this

295
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,000
later. We're going to move on to the next
question for now. Here we go.
