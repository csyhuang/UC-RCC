1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,949
- Scientist number two?

2
00:00:02,479 --> 00:00:04,601
I want to know what your question is,

3
00:00:04,601 --> 00:00:06,691
what is your variable
that you're isolating,

4
00:00:06,691 --> 00:00:08,520
and what are you measuring?

5
00:00:10,917 --> 00:00:12,354
You guys ready?

6
00:00:12,354 --> 00:00:14,330
Okay, so, table two?

7
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,189
Or table one?

8
00:00:15,189 --> 00:00:17,139
- Our central question is

9
00:00:17,139 --> 00:00:19,276
how does different types
of oil stains clothes,

10
00:00:19,276 --> 00:00:21,389
even after they've been rinsed.

11
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:24,616
And our independent variable
is going through the different oils

12
00:00:24,616 --> 00:00:27,936
that we used, and the dependent
variable is how they changed

13
00:00:27,936 --> 00:00:30,494
from before, when we first stained them

14
00:00:30,494 --> 00:00:32,050
to after when we rinsed them.

15
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,558
- Cool, and you may be
able to use the light probe

16
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:37,228
to determine the intensity of that stain.

17
00:00:37,228 --> 00:00:38,203
Tomorrow--

18
00:00:38,203 --> 00:00:40,084
- We also were planning on taking pictures

19
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:42,359
from before and after,
so we could like, compare those.

20
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:44,635
- So, you may want to do a
scale, like Marley did

21
00:00:44,635 --> 00:00:47,398
with the intensity of her
hair dye, as well, okay?

22
00:00:47,398 --> 00:00:49,495
But get it set up today,
make it really controlled

23
00:00:49,495 --> 00:00:51,856
with all your measurements, and
just change the type of oil.

24
00:00:52,606 --> 00:00:55,159
Alright, scientists, do you have any?

25
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,054
- Our experiment is we're
going to mix oil and water

26
00:00:59,054 --> 00:01:01,608
and then try and separate the oil using

27
00:01:01,608 --> 00:01:04,580
positive and negative charges.

28
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,296
- Okay, using positively and
negatively charged particles

29
00:01:07,296 --> 00:01:09,084
to separate oil from water?

30
00:01:09,084 --> 00:01:11,128
I don't know, I read your
document, I don't know

31
00:01:11,128 --> 00:01:12,823
what the positively-charged
particles you are,

32
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,726
but did you work it out?

33
00:01:14,726 --> 00:01:16,666
Okay, so what's your question then?

34
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:19,556
- Our question is does charged particles

35
00:01:19,556 --> 00:01:22,133
affect the oil scum?

36
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:26,893
- Okay, does charged
particles affect the shape

37
00:01:27,843 --> 00:01:31,049
of oil balls, them coming
together, scum balls?

38
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,203
Okay, good.

39
00:01:32,203 --> 00:01:33,964
Table three, what's your question?

40
00:01:33,964 --> 00:01:35,995
- Um, how long does it take to make scum

41
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:38,781
on the surface of the water, like,

42
00:01:38,781 --> 00:01:40,825
using what we're going to use,

43
00:01:40,825 --> 00:01:43,297
mainly olive oil and toilet paper.

44
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:44,527
- Okay.

45
00:01:45,957 --> 00:01:46,815
- Perfect.

46
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:50,894
- And testing, the independent
variable is testing how long

47
00:01:50,894 --> 00:01:53,270
we're going to stir.

48
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,942
How long it takes to make scum,

49
00:01:54,942 --> 00:01:57,798
and then our dependent
variable, we're going to take

50
00:01:57,798 --> 00:01:59,609
the observations of time.

51
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:02,720
- Okay, so the question
is, how long does it take

52
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,090
to form scum balls?

53
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,226
Independent variable is the stir time,

54
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,687
and the dependent variable is the...

55
00:02:08,687 --> 00:02:10,453
- How long it takes.

56
00:02:10,453 --> 00:02:11,799
- How long it takes to do it?

57
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:12,937
- Uh-huh.

58
00:02:12,937 --> 00:02:14,190
- What are you going to measure, though?

59
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:19,190
- We're going to actually try to measure
the surface area of the (mumbles).

60
00:02:19,322 --> 00:02:21,806
- Cool, so you're going to say
how much is covered by scum

61
00:02:21,806 --> 00:02:22,805
at that point in time?

62
00:02:22,805 --> 00:02:25,173
Okay, that should be pretty
easy to do with a camera shot.

63
00:02:25,973 --> 00:02:28,842
Okay, table four, what's your question?

64
00:02:28,842 --> 00:02:32,696
- How does temperature
affect the oil and water?

65
00:02:32,696 --> 00:02:34,228
- How does temperature
affect the oil and water?

66
00:02:34,228 --> 00:02:35,041
Awesome.

67
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:39,123
- And we're trying to figure
out how it will separate.

68
00:02:39,123 --> 00:02:40,098
- How can you separate it?

69
00:02:40,098 --> 00:02:41,816
What are you changing in the experiment?

70
00:02:41,816 --> 00:02:45,276
- We're changing, we're going
to use regular temperature

71
00:02:45,276 --> 00:02:48,178
and put it on a Bunsen burner
and put it in the freezer.

72
00:02:48,178 --> 00:02:49,247
- Cool, and you're more than welcome

73
00:02:49,247 --> 00:02:50,291
to use the freezer in the back.

74
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:51,220
Good idea.

75
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,031
Alright, table five,
what's your question?

76
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:55,214
- Does heat affect the scum ball?

77
00:02:55,214 --> 00:02:56,677
- Does heat affect the scum ball?

78
00:02:56,677 --> 00:03:00,438
- And our independent's
going to be amount of scum

79
00:03:00,438 --> 00:03:03,526
and the amount of water,
and the dependent's going to be

80
00:03:03,526 --> 00:03:05,848
heat (words drowned out by ambient noise).

81
00:03:05,848 --> 00:03:08,031
- Okay, so your independent, now you said heat

82
00:03:08,031 --> 00:03:10,585
and then you said the
amount of water in whatever,

83
00:03:10,585 --> 00:03:13,946
so your independent is
really going to be temperature.

84
00:03:14,973 --> 00:03:18,456
So, I feel like you have
two independent variables.

85
00:03:18,456 --> 00:03:19,988
Why don't you just spend
a minute and talking about

86
00:03:19,988 --> 00:03:21,266
which one you want to isolate.

87
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:23,239
Is it the amount of water
and the amount of scum?

88
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:24,767
Or is it temperature?

89
00:03:24,767 --> 00:03:25,480
Okay?

90
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,722
- We were going to change the temperature.

91
00:03:27,722 --> 00:03:30,714
- Then keep the amount of
water and the scum constant.

92
00:03:32,809 --> 00:03:34,620
Because you can't do different
amounts of water and scum

93
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,218
and different temperatures.

94
00:03:36,218 --> 00:03:38,214
It means you're testing
for two different things.

95
00:03:38,214 --> 00:03:40,350
While you could do that,
it's two experiments

96
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,883
and we don't have time today.

97
00:03:41,883 --> 00:03:43,147
So, just one experiment.

98
00:03:43,147 --> 00:03:45,301
Alright, table six?

99
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,488
- So, our central question is,

100
00:03:48,488 --> 00:03:51,715
is it possible to create scum
balls in different shapes?

101
00:03:51,715 --> 00:03:52,714
- Okay.

102
00:03:52,714 --> 00:03:55,964
- And our independent variable
was the amount of oil.

103
00:03:55,964 --> 00:03:59,610
And the dependent was the shape.

104
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,326
- Okay, so is it possible to make

105
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:03,580
scum balls of different shapes?

106
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,832
Independent variable is
the amount of oil or scum,

107
00:04:05,832 --> 00:04:07,272
dependent variable is the shapes.

108
00:04:07,272 --> 00:04:09,362
While I'm over here, I just
want to draw your attention

109
00:04:09,362 --> 00:04:10,819
to the back of the room.

110
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:13,025
That is the waste beaker,

111
00:04:13,025 --> 00:04:15,277
which has scum on top of it right now.

112
00:04:15,277 --> 00:04:18,737
It's every kind of oil
that Copper used yesterday.

113
00:04:18,737 --> 00:04:22,034
So if you want pre-made scum,

114
00:04:22,034 --> 00:04:25,639
I encourage you to use
Copper's waste from yesterday.

115
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:30,639
So, the bottom portion of it is
a lot of soap and soap water.

116
00:04:30,672 --> 00:04:32,181
But the top portion of it

117
00:04:32,181 --> 00:04:35,356
is just that less dense, oily scum, okay?

118
00:04:36,407 --> 00:04:38,682
Alright, table seven,
what's your question?

119
00:04:38,682 --> 00:04:41,889
- It's can we filter
out oil from the water

120
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:43,455
using the gravel filter?

121
00:04:43,455 --> 00:04:44,197
- Okay.

122
00:04:44,197 --> 00:04:46,053
- So, we're trying two
different types of oil

123
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:47,840
and we're going to put it
through a bunch of gravel

124
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,512
in the container.

125
00:04:49,512 --> 00:04:51,021
- Okay, and you may need to use

126
00:04:51,021 --> 00:04:53,018
two of the same identical filters,

127
00:04:53,018 --> 00:04:54,554
so just make sure you're really consistent

128
00:04:54,554 --> 00:04:56,621
with your measurements
between those two filters.

129
00:04:56,621 --> 00:04:57,294
Good.

130
00:04:57,294 --> 00:04:58,687
Alright, I'm excited about their project

131
00:04:58,687 --> 00:05:01,613
because Copper had one group
that did a filter yesterday

132
00:05:01,613 --> 00:05:04,121
and their results were very interesting.

133
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:06,303
So, check back in with this group later on

134
00:05:06,303 --> 00:05:08,087
if you want to see what's
going on with the filters.

135
00:05:08,087 --> 00:05:10,594
And table eight, what's
your central question?

136
00:05:10,594 --> 00:05:11,895
- Does oil collect some of the things

137
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,450
in the surrounding body of water?

138
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,610
- Does oil collect the most what?

139
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,623
- Does oil collect the most of each thing?

140
00:05:21,623 --> 00:05:23,504
- Oh, the most of each thing

141
00:05:23,504 --> 00:05:24,781
in the surrounding body of water?

142
00:05:24,781 --> 00:05:27,957
Okay, so you're going to look
and see what it attracts?

143
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:29,796
And what are some of the
materials you're going to use?

144
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,375
- Dirt, sand, and pebbles.

145
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,815
- Dirt, sand, and pebbles, awesome.

146
00:05:32,815 --> 00:05:34,603
So, your independent
variable is type of material

147
00:05:34,603 --> 00:05:36,692
that it would possibly attract.

148
00:05:36,692 --> 00:05:38,945
How are you going to measure those results?

149
00:05:40,945 --> 00:05:41,857
- Mass.

150
00:05:41,857 --> 00:05:43,658
- Mass? Okay, cool.

151
00:05:43,658 --> 00:05:45,260
You may want to work on a microscope slide

152
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:50,252
just so you can have a little bit of an easier
time measuring the mass.

153
00:05:50,252 --> 00:05:53,364
If you get too big, it won't
measure on our balances.

154
00:05:53,364 --> 00:05:58,054
Which brings me to my next
topic, which is safety talk.

155
00:05:58,054 --> 00:06:00,463
Conservation of materials.

156
00:06:03,185 --> 00:06:10,525
(students chatter)

157
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:12,380
- [Teacher] Did you
guys get a lecture yet?

158
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,823
- [Student] No, because
Sam is too busy with her.

159
00:06:15,823 --> 00:06:16,980
- [Teacher] Why don't you go over there

160
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,144
and see what they're doing.

161
00:06:22,774 --> 00:06:24,072
Go, talk to her.

162
00:06:25,445 --> 00:06:26,809
Thank you.

163
00:06:27,316 --> 00:06:29,020
Alright, lady scientists.

164
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,767
What's going on?

165
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:34,247
- We're like, I thought that we
didn't need to do the middle one

166
00:06:34,247 --> 00:06:36,221
because yesterday we
didn't have enough time,

167
00:06:36,221 --> 00:06:39,820
so we just did the small
amount and then the larger...

168
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,143
- [Teacher] Amount? Okay.

169
00:06:41,143 --> 00:06:43,674
- [Voiceover] Now that
we did the middle speed,

170
00:06:43,674 --> 00:06:46,786
we're actually seeing
a lot different stuff,

171
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:49,874
because the balls are
actually coming together.

172
00:06:49,874 --> 00:06:54,123
That underneath, and we noticed also

173
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:56,863
under here that everything
settled to the bottom

174
00:06:56,863 --> 00:06:59,649
except the dirt and oil
that reached to the top.

175
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:00,531
- [Teacher] Okay.

176
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:01,994
- [Voiceover] And this
is thicker than that one.

177
00:07:01,994 --> 00:07:03,782
- [Teacher] Okay, let me get
another group over here

178
00:07:03,782 --> 00:07:05,314
because they're also
trying to form a scum ball,

179
00:07:05,314 --> 00:07:07,399
and I'd like them to see your results.

180
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,181
Terrence and Catherine and
Maddy, can you guys pause

181
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:12,381
and come and check out
this group's experiment?

182
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,689
- [Voicover] I don't see scum.

183
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:16,945
It makes me mad.

184
00:07:17,425 --> 00:07:19,858
- [Teacher] Ooh, this is so cool.

185
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:21,581
- [Voiceover] Why does it look like that?

186
00:07:21,581 --> 00:07:22,766
I want it to look like that.

187
00:07:22,766 --> 00:07:24,112
- [Teacher] Come on over.

188
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:25,644
These guys are also doing

189
00:07:25,644 --> 00:07:29,718
an experiment on scum balls.

190
00:07:29,718 --> 00:07:32,498
Can you guys talk about what's
your independent variable?

191
00:07:32,498 --> 00:07:34,029
What are you changing?

192
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:35,931
- [Voiceover] We're just
changing the different speeds.

193
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:38,113
- [Teacher] Okay, and Yasmine,
what were some of the things

194
00:07:38,113 --> 00:07:40,458
you added that were
controlled within all three?

195
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,478
- [Yasmine] The dirt, oil, and the water.

196
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:45,450
- [Teacher] Okay, and they used
the black potting soil dirt.

197
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,238
Is it the peat moss?

198
00:07:47,238 --> 00:07:48,422
In the plastic bag?

199
00:07:48,422 --> 00:07:49,583
That's peat moss.  Okay, good.

200
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:53,166
And Taylor, it looks like
you have some cloudy stuff

201
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,466
in the bottom, what's that?

202
00:07:56,616 --> 00:07:57,415
Don't know?

203
00:07:57,415 --> 00:07:58,483
Can you guys fill her in?

204
00:07:58,483 --> 00:07:59,458
- [Voiceover] Toilet paper.

205
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:00,712
- [Teacher] Toilet
paper, which makes sense

206
00:08:00,712 --> 00:08:02,570
because there's a lot of
toilet paper over there.

207
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:06,885
Okay, and so far, your results have been,

208
00:08:06,892 --> 00:08:09,609
they've just done the high
speed and the low speed, right?

209
00:08:09,609 --> 00:08:12,000
And they're like, oh it's
the same, nothing happened,

210
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,370
nothing happened, right?

211
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,296
They came back today, and
this is the medium speed,

212
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:17,596
and what's going on?

213
00:08:17,596 --> 00:08:19,732
- [Voiceover] A lot of dirt, balls are

214
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,892
actually coming down and forming together.

215
00:08:21,892 --> 00:08:24,005
Because they were all
little pieces of dirt,

216
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:26,643
and now they're making big globs of dirt.

217
00:08:26,643 --> 00:08:27,927
And that's weird.

218
00:08:28,537 --> 00:08:32,038
- [Teacher] So, does
time, sitting overnight,

219
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:33,780
have anything to do with it?

220
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,498
- [Voiceover] That's what we
talked about with these two.

221
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:38,563
Actually this one, because, and this one too,

222
00:08:38,563 --> 00:08:42,951
because we didn't see
a lot of carbon bubbles

223
00:08:42,951 --> 00:08:44,182
in the first one.

224
00:08:44,182 --> 00:08:46,276
And then this one, I just noticed that

225
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:49,433
it's actually the toilet
paper is on the bottom

226
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:52,823
and actually attached to the
bottom layer of the oil.

227
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,890
- [Teacher] Okay, are the
highs and the lows working,

228
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,144
the speeds, yet?

229
00:08:56,144 --> 00:08:58,837
Have you tried to re-run the
highs and the lows today?

230
00:08:58,837 --> 00:08:59,603
- No.

231
00:08:59,603 --> 00:09:00,834
- [Teacher] Re-run the highs and lows,

232
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:02,552
you have a good seven, six minutes.

233
00:09:02,552 --> 00:09:04,711
See if they start to form clump balls.

234
00:09:06,741 --> 00:09:08,171
Not sure if you can use this one.

235
00:09:08,171 --> 00:09:09,495
- [Voiceover] Can I go get a funnel?

236
00:09:09,495 --> 00:09:10,330
- [Teacher] Sure.

237
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,608
There's one on the table.

238
00:09:11,608 --> 00:09:14,092
I am not sure if your choice of particles

239
00:09:14,092 --> 00:09:17,049
simply is inhibiting the
formation of the scum balls

240
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:18,303
or not.

241
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:22,064
If you want to add another
part to your experiment

242
00:09:22,064 --> 00:09:23,202
to make it more controlled,

243
00:09:23,202 --> 00:09:25,315
maybe you could add some toilet paper

244
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,130
and see if that adds anything,

245
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,500
or you could leave it how it is.

246
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,661
It's your choice.

247
00:09:29,661 --> 00:09:32,233
Got about seven minutes, okay?

248
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:33,644
- [Voiceover] Thank you.

249
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:38,386
- [Teacher] Yes, cool.

250
00:09:38,763 --> 00:09:42,756
Hey, you guys have some
diesel fuel on your table?

251
00:09:44,266 --> 00:09:46,511
Any information, research, observations

252
00:09:46,511 --> 00:09:48,090
that could be made about
the shapes of the molecules

253
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,874
would be awesome.

254
00:09:49,874 --> 00:09:51,406
The three of you all together.

255
00:09:51,406 --> 00:09:52,637
Alright, so...

256
00:09:52,637 --> 00:09:57,067
- [Voiceover] We got 97,
no, 47, 94 for all of them.

257
00:09:57,067 --> 00:09:59,468
- [Teacher] Okay, let me
put the camera on you four.

258
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,229
Ready?

259
00:10:05,417 --> 00:10:06,435
Let's talk about it.

260
00:10:06,435 --> 00:10:08,124
Is that okay?

261
00:10:09,778 --> 00:10:11,914
- Okay, so you isolated your variable,

262
00:10:11,914 --> 00:10:12,936
different types of oil.

263
00:10:12,936 --> 00:10:15,792
You made everything the same, same size,

264
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:18,485
same amount of water,
same amount of soap, time,

265
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,273
soaking, everything was
super-controlled, right?

266
00:10:20,273 --> 00:10:22,990
Okay, and then you just did
a light prep on all of them

267
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,612
and the look was the
same across the board.

268
00:10:26,612 --> 00:10:29,851
- Yeah, it was 47, 94, like it jumped

269
00:10:29,851 --> 00:10:31,686
between them two numbers, constantly.

270
00:10:31,686 --> 00:10:32,777
None of them, like...

271
00:10:32,777 --> 00:10:33,961
- Consistent, so it was consistent.

272
00:10:33,961 --> 00:10:36,144
Alright, so any initial conclusions?

273
00:10:36,144 --> 00:10:37,421
Yes.

274
00:10:37,421 --> 00:10:41,529
- I said that since all the
things were like a darker color,

275
00:10:41,869 --> 00:10:44,936
and the oils were kind of close,

276
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,358
I guess, in like,

277
00:10:47,358 --> 00:10:49,448
how they felt and what color they were,

278
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:52,653
I guess that maybe if we used a white shirt,

279
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,324
maybe there would've been a difference

280
00:10:54,324 --> 00:10:56,275
because it would've soiled it more.

281
00:10:56,275 --> 00:10:58,698
- Do you feel like there is
still oil in this fabric?

282
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:00,110
- Yes.

283
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,842
- Yes, okay, alright.

284
00:11:01,842 --> 00:11:03,560
Let me hear your conclusions,
and then I'm going to--

285
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,766
- This one that had water
on it is different-looking

286
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,972
than this one, like the
material looks more like--

287
00:11:07,972 --> 00:11:09,621
- Like dry or something, right?

288
00:11:09,621 --> 00:11:11,896
So, there's some qualitative difference.

289
00:11:11,896 --> 00:11:14,527
I know that this one needs to be flipped over.

290
00:11:14,527 --> 00:11:17,371
Because then it's the
same side of the fabric.

291
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:19,228
Okay, so water--

292
00:11:19,228 --> 00:11:20,505
- That one's whiter.

293
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:21,676
- Lighter, okay, so you feel like these

294
00:11:21,676 --> 00:11:23,371
are a little bit darker looking.

295
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:26,250
And your control?

296
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,040
- This one is darker.

297
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,804
- Your control was the
same as all of them?

298
00:11:28,804 --> 00:11:30,105
The 47, 94.  Okay.

299
00:11:31,345 --> 00:11:32,236
And you?

300
00:11:32,236 --> 00:11:34,210
Any conclusions yet?

301
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,739
- Um, I don't know.

302
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,178
I kind of think the sand thing is sand

303
00:11:39,178 --> 00:11:41,129
because I know the one
we put on the paper,

304
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:43,818
like it went all the way
down to 40-something,

305
00:11:43,818 --> 00:11:47,792
so maybe the fabric was too dark

306
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:49,766
to the point where it was

307
00:11:49,766 --> 00:11:52,291
(student drowned out by class chatter).

308
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:55,965
- Okay, and Lauren, what
was your central question?

309
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,614
- My central question?

310
00:11:57,614 --> 00:11:59,889
- The central question of your experiment.

311
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:03,395
- Oh, it was to see after we washed it

312
00:12:03,395 --> 00:12:05,493
how much of it was still there.

313
00:12:05,493 --> 00:12:06,809
- How much of it was still there?

314
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,666
Okay, or if it would affect
the fabrics differently?

315
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,778
(student drowned out by chatter)

316
00:12:11,317 --> 00:12:12,989
Okay, but your light probe is saying,

317
00:12:12,989 --> 00:12:14,986
no they're all the same,

318
00:12:14,986 --> 00:12:16,867
so maybe your eyes are
off or maybe the probe

319
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:19,063
is a little bit off or whatever.

320
00:12:19,063 --> 00:12:20,930
- Should I take that as data?

321
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,950
- I think you should
take it as data, yeah.

322
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,970
And it's okay, you
addressed your question,

323
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,246
which was, how does oil affect
it different among shirts?

324
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:31,773
In your case, with the soap,
maybe not at all differently.

325
00:12:32,453 --> 00:12:35,573
I'd like you to try one more
thing involving paper towels.

326
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:41,738
And what you're going to
do, is you're going to see,

327
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:43,633
you're going to press down as hard as you can

328
00:12:43,633 --> 00:12:47,277
with a paper towel and
see if there's any oil

329
00:12:47,277 --> 00:12:49,813
that's absorbed on the paper towels, okay?

330
00:12:49,813 --> 00:12:52,228
So, that can be one other way to take data.

331
00:12:52,228 --> 00:12:55,561
To see if there's still any
oil still stuck in the shirts.

332
00:12:55,561 --> 00:12:56,086
- Okay.

333
00:12:56,086 --> 00:12:56,863
- Okay?

334
00:12:58,303 --> 00:12:59,418
Goggles on.

335
00:12:59,418 --> 00:13:01,107
Goggles on! Goggles on!

336
00:13:01,817 --> 00:13:03,287
- [Voiceover] What's
the highest temperature

337
00:13:03,287 --> 00:13:04,634
we could put it at?

338
00:13:04,634 --> 00:13:06,416
- [Teacher] Are you guys boiling?

339
00:13:07,765 --> 00:13:09,389
- [Teacher] You can put it all the way up,

340
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,647
you just have to be really cautious.

341
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,190
Get your Hot Hands out, the big glove.

342
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,332
Alright, Heather's group,
I'm coming over to you guys.

343
00:13:20,952 --> 00:13:21,754
Ready?

344
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:28,763
Okay, what's going on over here?

345
00:13:28,763 --> 00:13:32,654
- [Voiceover] We put 10
millileters of motor oil

346
00:13:32,668 --> 00:13:37,469
in 150 mls of water and we
added five grams of salt.

347
00:13:37,864 --> 00:13:39,401
- Okay, ooh.

348
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,410
Salt, when I was a waitress,
we used to put salt

349
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,093
on our oil stains to get the oil out.

350
00:13:43,093 --> 00:13:45,476
- Maybe you could put a second...

351
00:13:45,476 --> 00:13:47,443
Wait, that's kind of like clay.

352
00:13:47,443 --> 00:13:49,467
I was going to say flour,
because that's what we do

353
00:13:49,467 --> 00:13:50,523
if I spill.

354
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:52,629
- What do you notice?

355
00:13:53,053 --> 00:13:54,469
- It's starting to kind of clump.

356
00:13:54,469 --> 00:13:57,929
- When we had the clay, it
was really, really clumpy,

357
00:13:57,929 --> 00:13:59,090
but then it...

358
00:13:59,090 --> 00:13:59,913
- It, the, uh...

359
00:13:59,913 --> 00:14:02,123
- Yeah, like the clay just clumped.

360
00:14:02,123 --> 00:14:04,096
And then we had to get
before and that didn't really

361
00:14:04,096 --> 00:14:05,838
make a difference, it
just sat at the bottom.

362
00:14:07,478 --> 00:14:08,642
- My hands are sticky.

363
00:14:08,821 --> 00:14:10,644
- Oh, thank you.

364
00:14:11,074 --> 00:14:13,059
While you're here, do
you remember the charge

365
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:15,064
of the particles of clay?

366
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:16,124
Positive or negative?

367
00:14:16,124 --> 00:14:16,922
- Negative.

368
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:19,165
- Okay, so, negatively-charged particles,

369
00:14:19,165 --> 00:14:20,814
and now you've added sodium chloride,

370
00:14:20,814 --> 00:14:22,764
which dissolves in water.

371
00:14:22,764 --> 00:14:25,527
You've got an A plus,
positive, CL minus negative.

372
00:14:25,527 --> 00:14:29,770
And you're clearly getting a scum ball.

373
00:14:30,565 --> 00:14:31,976
No?

374
00:14:33,491 --> 00:14:35,469
What happens when you turn it off?

375
00:14:35,469 --> 00:14:37,828
- It just all settles at the top.

376
00:14:39,156 --> 00:14:41,432
- When we put clay in
there for the first time,

377
00:14:41,432 --> 00:14:45,704
it was all little clay balls
that slowly rose to the top.

378
00:14:45,704 --> 00:14:49,623
But nothing of the magnitude...

379
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:53,565
- So, that motion really
helps it to stay together.

380
00:14:54,313 --> 00:14:55,103
- Yeah, that's what we did.

381
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,980
We put it at 500 RPMs first,

382
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,211
and then we dialed it back down to 100.

383
00:14:59,588 --> 00:15:02,351
- Let's apply this to the
water treatment plant.

384
00:15:02,351 --> 00:15:04,929
Was there motion at the
water treatment plant?

385
00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:05,927
- [All] Yes.

386
00:15:05,927 --> 00:15:07,849
- Was there clay in the water?

387
00:15:08,551 --> 00:15:09,665
- Probably.

388
00:15:09,665 --> 00:15:11,058
- From where?

389
00:15:11,058 --> 00:15:13,032
- From the sediment on the
bottom of the Schuylkill.

390
00:15:13,032 --> 00:15:14,611
- From the sediment on the river?

391
00:15:14,611 --> 00:15:15,841
Now remember, the stuff that's going

392
00:15:15,841 --> 00:15:17,165
in the water treatment plant

393
00:15:17,165 --> 00:15:19,510
is coming directly from
the home, so it hasn't

394
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,565
had a chance to go in
the Schuylkill River yet.

395
00:15:21,565 --> 00:15:22,248
- Okay.

396
00:15:22,248 --> 00:15:25,005
- Would there be any clay in the homes?

397
00:15:25,005 --> 00:15:26,207
- Not in the homes, no.

398
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,973
- Not in the homes?

399
00:15:26,973 --> 00:15:28,965
Not in anything flushed down the toilet?

400
00:15:29,853 --> 00:15:30,990
- Yeah.

401
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,405
- So, yeah, there could be
some, like, clay-like sediment,

402
00:15:33,405 --> 00:15:35,193
sand particles going through.

403
00:15:35,193 --> 00:15:37,004
Or at the very least, we could
say that there's probably

404
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:38,792
some negatively-charged
particles going through,

405
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:40,366
some kind of silicates.

406
00:15:40,366 --> 00:15:41,945
- [Voiceover] Shall we
throw away the fabric?

407
00:15:41,945 --> 00:15:43,222
- Sure.

408
00:15:43,222 --> 00:15:44,824
- Who knows what's in feces, right?

409
00:15:44,824 --> 00:15:47,494
Alright so, what I think is cool
about your experiment

410
00:15:47,494 --> 00:15:51,117
is the motion is really
important in getting those

411
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,363
scum balls to form.

412
00:15:54,065 --> 00:15:55,877
Have you talked about
CeCe's experiment yet?

413
00:15:55,877 --> 00:15:56,712
- [All] No.

414
00:15:56,712 --> 00:15:57,780
- Go ahead and give that a whirl

415
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,777
because they actually
put peat moss in theirs,

416
00:15:59,777 --> 00:16:02,494
and they started to get scum
balls to form on medium speed.

417
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:06,070
Also, Matt, Ian's,
sorry, Catherine's station

418
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:09,018
is using sand, specifically,

419
00:16:09,018 --> 00:16:11,201
and I forget what the other material is.

420
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:13,890
It looks like peat moss, and
they're having no success.

421
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,513
So, go ahead and do a
little quick walk-around.

422
00:16:16,513 --> 00:16:17,815
And clean up.

423
00:16:17,815 --> 00:16:18,736
- Motion.

424
00:16:20,752 --> 00:16:23,845
- Can you let them, give
them a 10 second overview?

425
00:16:23,845 --> 00:16:24,635
- Yeah.

426
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:25,308
- And then go?

427
00:16:25,308 --> 00:16:27,839
Taylor, pull it together, you'll be okay.

428
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,645
You're good? Okay.

429
00:16:30,602 --> 00:16:50,267
(students chatter)

430
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:54,866
- [Teacher] Did you get any scum?

431
00:16:54,866 --> 00:16:57,466
- No we didn't, we just got into lumps.

432
00:16:58,656 --> 00:17:01,437
The fastest way we got a layer, and

433
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:05,384
then everything, the soil
settled on the bottom.

434
00:17:07,324 --> 00:17:10,817
And then for the middle
speed, it actually formed

435
00:17:10,817 --> 00:17:13,382
big clumps of balls with the oil mixed in.

436
00:17:14,002 --> 00:17:16,412
(student is drowned out
by classroom chatter)

437
00:17:19,612 --> 00:17:21,771
- [Teacher] Clean up, clean up.

438
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,138
(students chatter)
