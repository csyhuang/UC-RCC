1
00:00:00,309 --> 00:00:02,502
- (student) ...so you can't
count it out completely.

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:05,509
- (Teacher) Hmm. So we have
three things going on here.

3
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:08,838
I hear exponential decay,

4
00:00:08,838 --> 00:00:12,355
I hear an upside-down parabola,

5
00:00:12,355 --> 00:00:17,259
and I hear a negative-sloping line.

6
00:00:17,259 --> 00:00:19,470
Red, why don't you chime in?
I haven't heard from you.

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,043
Are you going with decay?

8
00:00:25,043 --> 00:00:27,215
Are you going with decreasing line?

9
00:00:27,215 --> 00:00:29,842
You going with upside-down parabola?

10
00:00:29,842 --> 00:00:31,471.
What had you guys decided?

11
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:33,418
- We were going to go with decay but...

12
00:00:33,418 --> 00:00:36,458
- (Teacher) You were going
to go with decay, okay

13
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:38,755
- But, I changed my mind because

14
00:00:38,755 --> 00:00:42,529
decay, it keeps decreasing all the way.

15
00:00:42,529 --> 00:00:47,449
But MySpace, it got to a point
where it stopped decreasing...

16
00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:50,925
and it was (inaudible) like what Rosetta said.

17
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:53,436
- (Teacher) So it stopped decreasing,

18
00:00:53,436 --> 00:00:55,417
which is what you're
saying, and you're saying

19
00:00:55,417 --> 00:00:56,918
that's in agreement with Rosetta.

20
00:00:56,918 --> 00:01:02,323
I have a serious issue
with a line stopping.

21
00:01:02,323 --> 00:01:04,957
Can somebody talk to me about that?

22
00:01:04,957 --> 00:01:08,611
I have a serious issue
with a line stopping

23
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:12,912
or having some kind of decrease
that then slows itself.

24
00:01:12,912 --> 00:01:14,553
- It's the end of the line.

25
00:01:14,553 --> 00:01:19,168
Slows itself. Colin, I
haven't heard from you.

26
00:01:19,168 --> 00:01:24,143
- I don't think it's linear
because the linear is going to

27
00:01:24,143 --> 00:01:26,460
signify that at one point
there are going to be

28
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,840
no users or people on MySpace.

29
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,388
I agree with Elsie that it
might be decay because

30
00:01:34,388 --> 00:01:38,228
it decreased, but

31
00:01:38,228 --> 00:01:43,258
decay doesn't ever touch the X-axis,

32
00:01:43,258 --> 00:01:45,478
which would signify there are no users.

33
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:46,108
- (Teacher) Ah!

34
00:01:46,108 --> 00:01:47,873
- And there will always be users.

35
00:01:47,873 --> 00:01:49,499
- (Teacher) Oooh, what's
somebody thing about that?

36
00:01:49,499 --> 00:01:53,260
Really, really, really
significant comment that

37
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,928
was just made by Colin. What do we think?

38
00:01:56,928 --> 00:02:00,867
The fact that it's never going
to... how did you say it?

39
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:04,621
- I said that the linear
was going to, at one point,

40
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:07,065
to hit zero, and

41
00:02:07,065 --> 00:02:10,255
with decay it's never going to hit zero.

42
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:13,908
It's going to get really
close but not touch it.

43
00:02:13,908 --> 00:02:14,903
- (Teacher) Jeffrey.

44
00:02:14,903 --> 00:02:16,410
- I agree with Colin.

45
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,625
Because if it was a negative line, like
a negative line, right?

46
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:23,774
You're going to go past
zero, and you can't have

47
00:02:23,774 --> 00:02:28,896
a negative amount of users,
'cause a line keeps on going forever.

48
00:02:28,896 --> 00:02:32,311
- (Teacher) Ok, does
exponential keep going forever?

49
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:35,907
- No. I mean yes! Yes, it does, but

50
00:02:35,907 --> 00:02:41,156
because it's so small that
it never touches the X-axis,

51
00:02:41,156 --> 00:02:45,716
but it keeps on going so
it just never hits zero.

52
00:02:45,716 --> 00:02:46,996
- (Teacher) So, if we all agree,

53
00:02:46,996 --> 00:02:48,621
are we getting closer
to agreeing that it's

54
00:02:48,621 --> 00:02:49,801
exponential decay?

55
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:50,836
- (female student) Yes.

56
00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:52,843
- (Teacher) If we are agreeing
it's exponential decay,

57
00:02:52,843 --> 00:02:54,626
then what Jeffrey just said...

58
00:02:56,626 --> 00:02:59,239
what does that mean for
MySpace the company?

59
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:02,132
Will it go out of business?

60
00:03:02,132 --> 00:03:03,391
- (several students) no...

61
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,610
- (Teacher) Based on what
Jeffrey just said about

62
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,689
an exponential decay, at the end.

63
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:10,440
What does that mean for
MySpace the company?

64
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,312
What do you know about MySpace
the company at this moment?

65
00:03:15,312 --> 00:03:17,312
- It's still low. 

66
00:03:17,312 --> 00:03:20,471
- It's still low, but is it in existence?

67
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:21,515
- (several students) Yes

68
00:03:21,515 --> 00:03:26,948
- It is. Do you know what's keeping it

69
00:03:26,948 --> 00:03:27,544
You know?

70
00:03:27,544 --> 00:03:30,358
- I think because you're
always going to have

71
00:03:30,358 --> 00:03:32,946
that one user account

72
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,106
(laughter)

73
00:03:35,106 --> 00:03:37,402
- (Teacher) Ok, you might, you
might always have that one user.

74
00:03:37,402 --> 00:03:39,023
There's something, though,
that MySpace provides

75
00:03:39,023 --> 00:03:43,966
that other websites don't,
that's very easy to do

76
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:47,941
that other sites don't have.
And this is what's keeping it

77
00:03:47,941 --> 00:03:50,516
from touching that X-axis.

78
00:03:50,516 --> 00:03:52,368
Do you know what it is?

79
00:03:52,368 --> 00:03:56,169
Alicia? Talk to us, I can't hear you.

80
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:56,936
- Music?

81
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:58,323
- (Teacher) Yes, Alicia,
who is in the band,

82
00:03:58,323 --> 00:03:59,725
would obviously know this, right?

83
00:03:59,725 --> 00:04:02,965
Tell them what you do on MySpace, Alicia.

84
00:04:02,965 --> 00:04:06,348
- Bands can make pages and they can

85
00:04:06,348 --> 00:04:08,922
upload their songs and
you can listen to them.

86
00:04:08,922 --> 00:04:10,327
- (Teacher) Yeah, you
can upload your music

87
00:04:10,327 --> 00:04:14,058
on MySpace easier than
any of the other sites.

88
00:04:14,058 --> 00:04:15,389
Very good, thank you for chiming in.

89
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:17,868
Alright, let's shift gears from MySpace,

90
00:04:17,868 --> 00:04:21,295
now let's talk Twitter.

91
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:22,216
Twitter, Twitter, Twitter.

92
00:04:22,216 --> 00:04:27,544
What do you think about
the growth of Twitter?

93
00:04:27,544 --> 00:04:30,830
(background chatter)

94
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,003
- Alright, keywords. Red,
start me off with keywords

95
00:04:34,003 --> 00:04:36,868
and then we'll bounce to
Pink and around the room.

96
00:04:36,868 --> 00:04:38,078
(clears throat)

97
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:43,341
Give them your attention,
ladies and gentlemen.

98
00:04:43,341 --> 00:04:44,686
Are you guys prepared
and ready for Twitter?

99
00:04:44,686 --> 00:04:45,804
- Rush

100
00:04:45,804 --> 00:04:46,921
- (Teacher) I'm sorry, rush?

101
00:04:46,921 --> 00:04:48,060
(inaudible)

102
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:55,040
Where, show me?

103
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,211
- It's missing...something there

104
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:02,707
- (Teacher) What's your keyword?

105
00:05:02,707 --> 00:05:03,484
- Rush

106
00:05:03,484 --> 00:05:04,301
- It's in the middle of the sentence.

107
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:05,411
- (Teacher) In the third sentence.

108
00:05:05,411 --> 00:05:07,136
Oh, rush, is that what you said?

109
00:05:07,136 --> 00:05:10,775
Ok, just speak up, I'm
getting old, I can't hear.

110
00:05:10,775 --> 00:05:15,639
- Growth continues steadily.

111
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:22,618
- (Teacher) Okay... anything else?

112
00:05:22,618 --> 00:05:27,707
- Yeah, but it's at the tweets.

113
00:05:27,707 --> 00:05:30,165
- (Teacher) This, the tweeted?

114
00:05:30,165 --> 00:05:32,847
- Yeah.

115
00:05:32,847 --> 00:05:34,777
- (Teacher) It goes with this. Okay.

116
00:05:34,777 --> 00:05:36,424
So what do you guys pick for the growth?

117
00:05:36,424 --> 00:05:43,286
What function models Twitter's growth?

118
00:05:43,286 --> 00:05:44,817
- Exponential growth.

119
00:05:44,817 --> 00:05:46,968
- (Teacher) You think it's
exponential growth, as well?

120
00:05:46,968 --> 00:05:49,785
Alright, is there a team? Pink, you're up.

121
00:05:49,785 --> 00:05:51,458
- I disagree with that.

122
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:54,343
I think it's linear because it says that

123
00:05:54,343 --> 00:05:56,151
another keyword that they've given

124
00:05:56,151 --> 00:05:59,617
is with 40 million in May, that
whole sentence right there.

125
00:05:59,617 --> 00:06:00,705
- (Teacher) Got it.

126
00:06:00,705 --> 00:06:03,691
- That's like a slope,
if you think about it.

127
00:06:03,691 --> 00:06:07,593
With 40 million in May, 2009,
6 months later 60 million,

128
00:06:07,593 --> 00:06:10,580
and then 80 million in May 2010.

129
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,910
The slope, it would be 20 million.

130
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,601
So it's linear. It's going positive slope.

131
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:17,110
(inaudible)

132
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:24,153
- (Teacher) Hmm...
filling out those listening labs?

133
00:06:24,153 --> 00:06:26,303
Pink just gave some hard core evidence.

134
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:30,570
Red, do you have a comeback?
Or have they won you over?

135
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:31,600
You have a comeback.

136
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,247
Let's hear it, Lenny,
what's your comeback?

137
00:06:34,247 --> 00:06:35,868
- This can not be because

138
00:06:35,868 --> 00:06:37,456
(laughter)

139
00:06:37,456 --> 00:06:42,107
because it's going to get to a
point where it's going to stop.

140
00:06:42,107 --> 00:06:43,409
It's not like we're going to take it like

141
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:47,064
100, 100, 200, and so on

142
00:06:47,064 --> 00:06:49,442
- (pink) Do you have a time machine?

143
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,273
(laughter)

144
00:06:51,273 --> 00:06:53,284
- (Teacher) Ok, so let's leave...

145
00:06:53,284 --> 00:06:56,555
Lenny, I think exponential
growth isn't going to stop

146
00:06:56,555 --> 00:06:59,538
and I think a line isn't
going to stop, right?

147
00:06:59,538 --> 00:07:01,817
And I think that, if we
think about the future...

148
00:07:01,817 --> 00:07:04,931
I think that's what Star is maybe
trying to do, is predict the future.

149
00:07:04,931 --> 00:07:08,479
We don't really know. But
from the language here

150
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,951
in your text, the information you do know,

151
00:07:11,951 --> 00:07:16,084
I think 40 million then
60 million then 80 million

152
00:07:16,084 --> 00:07:19,808
is pretty concrete evidence of slope.

153
00:07:19,808 --> 00:07:22,053
Do you agree?

154
00:07:22,053 --> 00:07:22,492
- yes

155
00:07:22,492 --> 00:07:25,016
- (Teacher) Yes? Anybody else
want to chime in on this one

156
00:07:25,016 --> 00:07:26,123
that I haven't heard from?

157
00:07:26,123 --> 00:07:27,916
Maybe from...

158
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,706
Elianna on Blue?

159
00:07:30,706 --> 00:07:32,234
Bleaker, I haven't heard from you.

160
00:07:32,234 --> 00:07:34,487
Carlia yet? What do you guys think?

161
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:40,308
How 'bout anything you
want to add about Twitter?

162
00:07:40,308 --> 00:07:42,525
Anything you want to add?

163
00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:43,662
Greg, go ahead.

164
00:07:43,662 --> 00:07:45,836
- Well what Lenny was
saying, I cannot beat

165
00:07:45,836 --> 00:07:48,180
and I agree with them. That's it.

166
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,117
- (Teacher) Ok, thank you!

167
00:07:51,117 --> 00:07:53,188
Any...?

168
00:07:53,188 --> 00:07:55,670
- I agree with Star because

169
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,193
as you mentioned (inaudible) what this does

170
00:07:58,193 --> 00:08:01,583
or hope is that they'll be able
to Tweet via text messages.

171
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,893
And that's something that
Facebook didn't offer.

172
00:08:03,893 --> 00:08:07,418
So the more things that...

173
00:08:07,418 --> 00:08:10,258
the more things that
Twitter puts out there

174
00:08:10,258 --> 00:08:14,792
the other social networks
is going to increase.

175
00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:17,801
- Ok, so as Twitter grows, you're saying

176
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:20,507
the other networks might be slowed?

177
00:08:20,507 --> 00:08:23,801
Who though, is going to outperform it

178
00:08:23,801 --> 00:08:26,384
if it's a different type of graph?

179
00:08:26,384 --> 00:08:30,339
Who is going to outperform
Twitter for sure,

180
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:33,048
if Twitter is linear and the other one is

181
00:08:33,048 --> 00:08:34,892
a certain other graph we mentioned?

182
00:08:34,892 --> 00:08:35,988
(inaudible)

183
00:08:35,988 --> 00:08:38,058
Facebook, right? Because Facebook is what?

184
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:38,968
- Exponential

185
00:08:38,968 --> 00:08:40,330
- (Teacher) Exponential. Very good.

186
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:43,146
Ok! So let's go now to AIM.

187
00:08:43,146 --> 00:08:45,118
We're doing very well on time here.

188
00:08:45,118 --> 00:08:48,185
AIM. Who's going to start us off with AIM?

189
00:08:48,185 --> 00:08:50,846
Alright, Pink, you can start us off.

190
00:08:50,846 --> 00:08:54,576
(background chatter)

191
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,532
Keywords and reasoning, talk to me.

192
00:08:56,532 --> 00:08:59,056
- Some key words we worked was

193
00:08:59,056 --> 00:09:02,576
AOL lost their dominance.

194
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:09,258
- (Teacher) Lost their dominance. Okay?

195
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:09,932
Yep?

196
00:09:09,932 --> 00:09:14,150
- And then we put continuous
fielding is growth today.

197
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,995
- (Teacher) Okay.

198
00:09:16,995 --> 00:09:21,143
- And we said that it was

199
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:25,421
quadratic equations, because

200
00:09:25,421 --> 00:09:28,477
at one point it was really high,

201
00:09:28,477 --> 00:09:31,797
but then as time went by,
it started decreasing,

202
00:09:31,797 --> 00:09:34,843
but then it started
getting more popular again.

203
00:09:34,843 --> 00:09:38,110
Lately, teenagers liked using it,

204
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,680
so it started going up again.

205
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,485
- (Teacher) Ok. Is there
another keyword up here

206
00:09:43,485 --> 00:09:46,243
that would help anybody?

207
00:09:46,243 --> 00:09:48,976
I think there's at least one more keyword

208
00:09:48,976 --> 00:09:52,475
that I haven't seen pointed up. Elianna?

209
00:09:52,475 --> 00:09:53,653
- Is it comeback?

210
00:09:53,653 --> 00:09:55,602
- Comeback? Where's comeback?

211
00:09:55,602 --> 00:09:57,482
(inaudible)

212
00:09:57,482 --> 00:10:00,229
Beautiful. Made a comeback and maybe even

213
00:10:00,229 --> 00:10:03,384
one more thing a little
earlier. Jermaine? Thank you.

214
00:10:03,384 --> 00:10:04,401
Sorry, say that again?

215
00:10:04,401 --> 00:10:05,018
- Dominated

216
00:10:05,018 --> 00:10:06,405
- (Teacher) Dominated,
very nice, Jermaine.

217
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:09,419
So it started out dominating,

218
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:11,659
then had to make a comeback.

219
00:10:11,659 --> 00:10:13,618
Does anybody want to
add on to what Pink said

220
00:10:13,618 --> 00:10:17,986
about this being quadratic?

221
00:10:17,986 --> 00:10:19,469
- Which way?

222
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:20,850
- (Teacher) Which way?

223
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,374
- Would make it positive from earlier?

224
00:10:22,374 --> 00:10:25,523
- (Teacher) Positive what? Talk
to me about the equation now.

225
00:10:25,523 --> 00:10:27,413
- Quadratic is always going to...

226
00:10:27,413 --> 00:10:30,582
- (Teacher) Do quadratics always go up?

227
00:10:30,582 --> 00:10:35,409
- (student chatter) no,
go down too, parabolic

228
00:10:35,409 --> 00:10:37,815
- (Teacher) This parabola?
They always look like this?

229
00:10:37,815 --> 00:10:39,766
- no

230
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:43,735
- (Teacher) Think about inverses
we learned through this year.

231
00:10:43,735 --> 00:10:46,570
Raise your hand and let me
know what you want to say.

232
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,626
Talk to me. Do parabolas
always open upwards?

233
00:10:49,626 --> 00:10:50,126
Go ahead.

234
00:10:50,126 --> 00:10:51,590
- (male student) I just
want to agree with them

235
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,432
- (Teacher) You agree
that it's a parabola?

236
00:10:53,432 --> 00:10:56,101
- Yeah, because in a parabola...

237
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:58,904
it says that it started
off dominating, but

238
00:10:58,904 --> 00:11:00,469
you're on top if you're dominating.

239
00:11:00,469 --> 00:11:02,622
Then it said that it made a comeback.

240
00:11:02,622 --> 00:11:05,223
That means at one point it
would have to be decreasing

241
00:11:05,223 --> 00:11:07,498
and then to make a
comeback they come back,

242
00:11:07,498 --> 00:11:08,778
they come back up.

243
00:11:08,778 --> 00:11:11,418
- (Teacher) Beautiful. Wanna add to that?

244
00:11:11,418 --> 00:11:14,573
Go ahead.

245
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:19,810
- I was just going to say
the other end (inaudible)

246
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,782
- Alright, so I just want
to make sure I answered

247
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:22,634
Purple's question in the back.

248
00:11:22,634 --> 00:11:25,276
You asked which way? Take a look at this.

249
00:11:25,276 --> 00:11:26,915
This is what you're talking about.

250
00:11:26,915 --> 00:11:31,543
Could the parabola be like this?

251
00:11:31,543 --> 00:11:33,910
(background chatter)

252
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,612
What would this mean if
the parabola were down

253
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,685
for the company?

254
00:11:38,685 --> 00:11:42,814
- If it was down, then that
means it's imaginary. Right?

255
00:11:42,814 --> 00:11:45,147
- (Teacher) You're thinking
of something about imaginary

256
00:11:45,147 --> 00:11:48,495
and it's not if it's down.
That has to do with a negative.

257
00:11:48,495 --> 00:11:51,111
Right, if there's a
negative A coefficient.

258
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:52,353
Something else, though.

259
00:11:52,353 --> 00:11:55,948
What would this mean
for the company's trend?

260
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:58,170
DeShawn?

261
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,660
Go ahead, DeShawn

262
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,367
- They would have had
a spiral at the bottom

263
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:03,960
and then they would lift up

264
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,483
- (Teacher) And come back down.

265
00:12:05,483 --> 00:12:06,539
Purple, are you alright with that now?

266
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:09,300
You understand? This would not have worked

267
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:16,039
based on what DeShawn just said.

268
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:21,381
Here's my question for you on AOL.

269
00:12:21,381 --> 00:12:25,549
Why isn't AOL an absolute value graph?

270
00:12:25,549 --> 00:12:31,769
What starts high, comes
down, and goes back up?

271
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:34,719
We did do absolute value functions, right?

272
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:37,767
Turn and talk first, and
then you're going to tell me.

273
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:39,256
Write that question down somewhere.

274
00:12:39,256 --> 00:12:43,678
I want to know why it's not
an absolute value graph.

275
00:12:43,678 --> 00:12:57,235
(background chatter)

276
00:12:57,235 --> 00:13:03,047
- Oh, yeah, we did talk
about these today (inaudible)

277
00:13:03,047 --> 00:13:14,237
(background chatter)

278
00:13:14,237 --> 00:13:16,058
- if every five minutes
they add ten members

279
00:13:16,058 --> 00:13:19,261
but every five minutes
you're getting ten members

280
00:13:19,261 --> 00:13:22,601
then every five minutes
you're gonna lose ten members

281
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:25,565
so parabola is not possible

282
00:13:25,565 --> 00:13:34,770
(inaudible)

283
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:44,594
(background chatter)

284
00:13:44,594 --> 00:13:47,243
- (Teacher) Ok, guys...

285
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,769
Bring it back.

286
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:52,199
I want to know why isn't...

287
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:55,756
Why didn't anybody say absolute value?

288
00:13:55,756 --> 00:13:58,369
I'm going to maybe put one over here,

289
00:13:58,369 --> 00:14:00,325
and then I have one more
really important question

290
00:14:00,325 --> 00:14:03,552
about these graphs for you,
and then we're in good shape.

291
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:06,199
Absolute value... the reason
I asked that is because

292
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:08,007
that also starts high, comes down low

293
00:14:08,007 --> 00:14:11,183
and goes back up. I need some reasoning.

294
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:15,186
Let's change it around, start
with Gold and go around. Go.

295
00:14:15,186 --> 00:14:18,836
- I don't think it's
an absolute value graph

296
00:14:18,836 --> 00:14:21,985
even though it kind of follows
the same kind of trend.

297
00:14:21,985 --> 00:14:24,606
Because in the absolute value, it's

298
00:14:24,606 --> 00:14:28,795
Y is equal to absolute
value of X, meaning that

299
00:14:28,795 --> 00:14:32,543
as time passed, they would
be losing and gaining

300
00:14:32,543 --> 00:14:34,866
a constant amount of people.

301
00:14:34,866 --> 00:14:38,970
So like, if you gained ten
members every five minutes,

302
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,510
every five minutes you
would be gaining ten members

303
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,582
no matter what. Every five minutes, or

304
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:46,101
when it goes down, every five minutes

305
00:14:46,101 --> 00:14:46,873
you'd be losing ten members.

306
00:14:46,873 --> 00:14:49,007
Whereas a parabola that
changes is not constant,

307
00:14:49,007 --> 00:14:51,059
you can lose and gain
power then they'd be equal

308
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:55,122
to join or don't join
and you can't guarantee

309
00:14:55,122 --> 00:14:56,686
that you're going to gain
that amount of members

310
00:14:56,686 --> 00:14:59,599
every time that amount of time passed.

311
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:01,599
- (Teacher) So would it be
fair to say it's too con-
