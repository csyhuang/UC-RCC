1
00:00:01,421 --> 00:00:03,738
- Get out your journal, I'll read it aloud

2
00:00:03,738 --> 00:00:06,342
and I'll put the time on the timer.

3
00:00:06,342 --> 00:00:08,092
Get our your journal.

4
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:13,254
We're looking at journal entry number 14.

5
00:00:13,254 --> 00:00:16,334
And you're not allowed
to write I don't know,

6
00:00:16,334 --> 00:00:17,818
take a guess if you're not sure,

7
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:19,005
but don't write I don't know.

8
00:00:19,005 --> 00:00:20,861
So question 14 is very simple.

9
00:00:20,861 --> 00:00:24,111
Why do you think an earthquake happens?

10
00:00:25,155 --> 00:00:27,261
You can write it, you can draw a picture.

11
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:31,130
So I'm asking you why do you
think an earthquake happens.

12
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,564
You have three minutes
right now to write what

13
00:00:33,564 --> 00:00:37,647
you think. Why do you think
an earthquake happens?

14
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:58,610
(whispering)

15
00:01:00,074 --> 00:01:02,387
Why do you think an earthquake happens,

16
00:01:02,387 --> 00:01:04,350
and why do you think...

17
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:12,767
(whispering)

18
00:01:14,216 --> 00:01:16,325
Remember there's no right or wrong,

19
00:01:16,325 --> 00:01:19,158
it's what you think is the answer.

20
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:37,135
Remember you can draw a
picture if that helps you.

21
00:01:39,554 --> 00:01:42,165
Okay if you want to draw
(mumbles) alright you've

22
00:01:42,165 --> 00:01:45,653
got like a minute left so
you can draw a picture.

23
00:01:45,653 --> 00:01:47,820
Write down what you think.

24
00:01:49,647 --> 00:02:18,064
(whispering)

25
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,267
I'm gonna give you about 30 more seconds.

26
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:46,071
Many of you are still writing and that's
fine,

27
00:02:46,071 --> 00:02:49,276
but I thought before we talk about this

28
00:02:49,276 --> 00:02:50,852
let's take a look at a little clip

29
00:02:50,852 --> 00:02:52,486
because I realize maybe not everybody

30
00:02:52,486 --> 00:02:54,414
has experience with an earthquake.

31
00:02:54,414 --> 00:02:55,917
So this one's kinda cool.

32
00:02:55,917 --> 00:02:58,500
It was shot obviously on somebody's iPhone

33
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,100
so it's not the best quality,

34
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,837
but many of you know that
Japan has lots of earthquakes

35
00:03:02,837 --> 00:03:05,486
all the time, they're
very used to earthquakes.

36
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:06,870
So this person lives in Japan,

37
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,823
and so again they're used
to earthquakes, right?

38
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:12,020
So they weren't like
panicking so he actually

39
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,964
took his iPhone and filmed the ground.

40
00:03:14,964 --> 00:03:16,799
So I want you to take a look.

41
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:18,675
We're only gonna look
at about a minute of it,

42
00:03:18,675 --> 00:03:22,700
but I want you to notice how
the ground is moving, okay?

43
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,791
And we're gonna use that idea to talk

44
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,713
about why earthquakes happen.

45
00:03:26,713 --> 00:03:28,204
So this is pretty cool.

46
00:03:28,204 --> 00:03:30,787
So this was back in March 2011.

47
00:03:33,483 --> 00:03:34,316
So notice.

48
00:03:34,316 --> 00:03:36,566
(rumbling)

49
00:03:49,216 --> 00:03:51,716
Now they're gonna go to another part.

50
00:03:51,716 --> 00:03:55,549
Notice the ground in the
back, watch the back.

51
00:03:57,793 --> 00:04:00,126
You'll see something happen.

52
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:05,644
(yelling)

53
00:04:07,177 --> 00:04:08,969
Watch what's happening.

54
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:11,219
(rumbling)

55
00:04:29,676 --> 00:04:32,492
Alright so that's real, it's not like

56
00:04:32,492 --> 00:04:35,649
there was a machine
underneath there doing that.

57
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:38,601
So you guys, we can solve what's happening,

58
00:04:38,601 --> 00:04:41,724
so let's take that and let's
talk about this through.

59
00:04:41,724 --> 00:04:43,551
Why do you think an earthquake happens?

60
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:45,505
Why do you guys think
an earthquake happens?

61
00:04:45,505 --> 00:04:47,692
And remember, when we talk
we're gonna let one person

62
00:04:47,692 --> 00:04:49,815
go at a time and we're gonna make sure

63
00:04:49,815 --> 00:04:51,284
we talk loudly so that we can hear.

64
00:04:51,284 --> 00:04:52,744
Alright so let's just start on this side.

65
00:04:52,744 --> 00:04:54,610
We're gonna work this way,
Tony, what did you write?

66
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,071
Why do you think an earthquake happens?

67
00:04:56,071 --> 00:04:58,319
- Well, I think there's something wrong

68
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,339
with the mantle that's
coming out through the crust

69
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:05,190
and makes it vibrate the earth
and causing an earthquake?

70
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,193
- Okay, something to do with the mantle

71
00:05:07,193 --> 00:05:08,938
causes the earth to vibrate?

72
00:05:08,938 --> 00:05:10,741
Also I liked how you
used a complete sentence.

73
00:05:10,741 --> 00:05:12,087
So remember, if you're not sure,

74
00:05:12,087 --> 00:05:13,738
there's some sentence starters up there.

75
00:05:13,738 --> 00:05:14,943
Jheyline, what did you write?

76
00:05:14,943 --> 00:05:17,268
- I think earthquakes happen because two

77
00:05:17,268 --> 00:05:20,225
plate boundaries overlap each other.

78
00:05:20,225 --> 00:05:24,822
- Excellent, because plate
boundaries overlap each other.

79
00:05:24,822 --> 00:05:25,787
Jose.

80
00:05:25,787 --> 00:05:29,954
- [Jose] I think that earthquakes
happen when plates crash.

81
00:05:31,018 --> 00:05:32,795
- When plates crash.

82
00:05:32,795 --> 00:05:33,628
- [Jose] Together.

83
00:05:33,628 --> 00:05:34,461
- Anybody else?

84
00:05:34,461 --> 00:05:35,833
Adrian, and then Dajana.

85
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:40,000
- I think that earthquakes
happen because plates slide.

86
00:05:41,837 --> 00:05:43,641
- Because plates slide, excellent.

87
00:05:43,641 --> 00:05:44,474
Dajana?

88
00:05:44,474 --> 00:05:47,171
- I think an earthquake happens

89
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:48,929
from too much stress?

90
00:05:48,929 --> 00:05:50,840
(mumbles)

91
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,248
Also, I think the plate boundaries overlap.

92
00:05:54,248 --> 00:05:55,653
- Ooh, I like what you said,

93
00:05:55,653 --> 00:05:57,567
and that's exactly where I'm going next.

94
00:05:57,567 --> 00:06:00,367
So in that video clip you
guys saw the ground move.

95
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:02,114
I'm gonna give you 10 seconds.

96
00:06:02,114 --> 00:06:04,020
And that 10 seconds you're gonna share

97
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,174
with the person next to you
how did the ground move?

98
00:06:07,174 --> 00:06:08,957
What direction was that ground moving?

99
00:06:08,957 --> 00:06:11,273
So you have 10 seconds, share
with your partner next to you

100
00:06:11,273 --> 00:06:12,710
or share with the people across from you.

101
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:13,543
Go, 10 seconds.

102
00:06:13,543 --> 00:06:26,710
(students chattering)

103
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:31,755
Alright, finishing up in five,
four, three, two, one, zero.

104
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:38,358
Okay, so I heard lots of people
talking so I'm gonna pull

105
00:06:38,358 --> 00:06:40,704
a name, this time, remember
you can say what you said

106
00:06:40,704 --> 00:06:42,098
or what the person next to you said.

107
00:06:42,098 --> 00:06:46,381
So what kind of movement did
you notice in that video clip?

108
00:06:46,381 --> 00:06:50,318
Let's see... (mumbles).

109
00:06:50,318 --> 00:06:52,919
Now Neferly, what kind
of movement did you see?

110
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,666
- [Neferly] They were
moving (mumbling) apart?

111
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,880
- Good, moving apart, what
else did you notice, Angel?

112
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,444
- [Angel] They were moving apart.

113
00:07:00,444 --> 00:07:03,715
- Moving apart, what else
did you notice, Dajana?

114
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:07,882
- Well, it was crashing
everywhere, but I saw the...

115
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:14,031
(mumbling)

116
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:17,027
- Ooh, kind of like water
coming out of the sky?

117
00:07:17,027 --> 00:07:18,677
Josh, what else did you notice?

118
00:07:18,677 --> 00:07:20,514
(knocking)

119
00:07:20,514 --> 00:07:23,812
Oh, so a little bit of up and down movement?

120
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:29,562
Alright so, up and down movement.

121
00:07:30,052 --> 00:07:33,969
Anybody else notice any
other type of movement?

122
00:07:34,351 --> 00:07:37,422
So you guys said up and
down, you said moving apart.

123
00:07:37,422 --> 00:07:39,779
(background noise drowns out speaker)

124
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:43,310
Oh, did you see how that
piece literally slid?

125
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,143
- Yeah.

126
00:07:44,143 --> 00:07:45,629
- Alright, so that's movement.

127
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:48,402
You guys know some words for this.

128
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:49,921
What are some words that we've learned

129
00:07:49,921 --> 00:07:53,436
to describe movement,
and Dajana said a couple.

130
00:07:53,436 --> 00:07:54,758
What words, Jina?

131
00:07:54,758 --> 00:07:55,939
- [Jina] Shearing.

132
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:58,402
- Yes, so there was
some shearing happening.

133
00:07:58,402 --> 00:08:01,031
What else was happening?

134
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:01,864
Rodolfo.

135
00:08:01,864 --> 00:08:02,849
- [Rodolfo] Tension?

136
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,416
- Yes, some tension pulling apart.

137
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,118
And what else did you notice, Daniel?

138
00:08:07,118 --> 00:08:07,951
- Compression?

139
00:08:07,951 --> 00:08:09,410
- Yeah, compression, squeezing together.

140
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:12,016
Okay, so we're getting this
idea that, didn't Dajana,

141
00:08:12,016 --> 00:08:15,753
you said it was stress, or you
said stress, Dajana right?

142
00:08:15,753 --> 00:08:19,920
So something about stress
being kind of important.

143
00:08:21,113 --> 00:08:23,234
So we're gonna take that idea.

144
00:08:23,234 --> 00:08:25,222
Give us a moment, okay, thanks.

145
00:08:25,222 --> 00:08:29,139
Alright, so sorry
about the interruption.

146
00:08:30,603 --> 00:08:32,426
So stress, Dajana was saying stress.

147
00:08:32,426 --> 00:08:34,880
So let me give you an example.

148
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,032
So let's imagine that this
rubber band is not a rubber band.

149
00:08:38,032 --> 00:08:39,883
Let's imagine that it's a rock.

150
00:08:39,883 --> 00:08:41,377
And let's imagine it's a rock, I know,

151
00:08:41,377 --> 00:08:43,400
it's a rubber band, but
let's imagine it's a rock.

152
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,158
So I'm gonna take, I'm gonna go

153
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:46,433
like this, it's a rock, remember?

154
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:49,785
So I'm doing this to the
rock, and then I'm gonna

155
00:08:49,785 --> 00:08:53,254
stand here for an entire
year, and then a year from now

156
00:08:53,254 --> 00:08:55,328
I'm gonna put my hands further apart.

157
00:08:55,328 --> 00:08:58,374
And then another year, I'm gonna
put my hands further apart.

158
00:08:58,374 --> 00:09:01,289
What's happening to this
rock, or this rubber band?

159
00:09:01,289 --> 00:09:04,490
What's happening to this rock over time?

160
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,623
What's happening, Lupita, to this rock?

161
00:09:06,623 --> 00:09:07,456
- [Lupita] It's stretching.

162
00:09:07,456 --> 00:09:08,830
- It's stretching, what else?

163
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:09,663
Add to that, Tucker.

164
00:09:09,663 --> 00:09:13,137
- [Tucker] (mumbling)
and stretching it out,

165
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:14,291
stretch is added to it?

166
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,663
- Stress is added too, nice, Victor?

167
00:09:16,663 --> 00:09:19,649
- [Victor] So maybe it's
getting a little compression.

168
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:21,727
- Okay, maybe a little compression too.

169
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,235
My hands are getting tired, Tony?

170
00:09:23,235 --> 00:09:24,287
- Continental drift?

171
00:09:24,287 --> 00:09:26,304
- Ooh, like okay, so if there were

172
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:27,900
other pieces like my hands were

173
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,504
Africa and South America,
they'd be moving apart.

174
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:31,337
Ernesto?

175
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,206
- [Ernesto] Thinner in the middle?

176
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:35,302
- Thinner in the middle. Sakura?

177
00:09:35,302 --> 00:09:36,376
- [Sakura] Tension.

178
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:39,126
- So tension, now I'm gonna
stop because my hands

179
00:09:39,126 --> 00:09:43,059
starting to hurt, but what would
happen if I kept doing that?

180
00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:45,583
I'm gonna have you take 10 seconds

181
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:46,772
to talk to the person next to you.

182
00:09:46,772 --> 00:09:48,422
What might happen if I kept doing that,

183
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,220
and I kept doing that,
and I kept doing that?

184
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,322
What might happen to this
rubber band, or this rock?

185
00:09:53,322 --> 00:09:56,624
So 10 seconds, to the
person next to you, ten seconds.

186
00:09:56,624 --> 00:10:08,791
(students chattering)

187
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:13,296
Alright, finishing up in five,
four, three, two, one, zero.

188
00:10:17,036 --> 00:10:19,236
Okay, I heard lots of good discussion.

189
00:10:19,236 --> 00:10:21,417
So if I kept doing this, I kept doing it,

190
00:10:21,417 --> 00:10:23,449
I kept doing it, Moses, what might happen?

191
00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:25,142
- [Moses] It might crack and break.

192
00:10:25,142 --> 00:10:26,281
- It might crack and break.

193
00:10:26,281 --> 00:10:28,443
Everyone, what else maybe might happen?

194
00:10:28,443 --> 00:10:29,276
Victor?

195
00:10:29,276 --> 00:10:30,775
- [Victor] It will scrape the mountain

196
00:10:30,775 --> 00:10:32,380
and it will create an
earthquake and it'll break.

197
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,615
- Ooh, oh I like, 'cause you
remember this a lot right?

198
00:10:34,615 --> 00:10:36,675
Little earthquake, excellent Tucker?

199
00:10:36,675 --> 00:10:39,422
- It's just like when
you shove your fingers, go

200
00:10:39,422 --> 00:10:41,693
all the way back it will break.

201
00:10:41,693 --> 00:10:43,741
- Oh yeah, that would be painful.

202
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:44,574
Jheyline?

203
00:10:44,574 --> 00:10:46,255
- It'd probably explode from so much

204
00:10:46,255 --> 00:10:48,326
tension and stretch everything.

205
00:10:48,326 --> 00:10:50,779
- Did everybody hear
that word she just said?

206
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:52,315
Which word did you say, it would?

207
00:10:52,315 --> 00:10:53,148
- Explode.

208
00:10:53,148 --> 00:10:54,436
- Explode, wow.

209
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:56,468
That's a big, powerful word, but that's

210
00:10:56,468 --> 00:10:59,081
pretty equal to what happened, right?

211
00:10:59,081 --> 00:11:00,467
Big amount of power.

212
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:03,890
- Or like when you were
doing that with the rock,

213
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:07,404
like when you were moving it,
like it would get more thinner

214
00:11:07,404 --> 00:11:10,166
and get more, it would kinda get wider

215
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:12,600
when after all while it's still going

216
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,132
it's gonna like (mumbles).

217
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:18,288
- Good, so let's step back a little bit.

218
00:11:18,288 --> 00:11:21,971
So who was it, someone had
said earthquake, right?

219
00:11:21,971 --> 00:11:22,852
You had said earthquake.

220
00:11:22,852 --> 00:11:26,309
So it's sounding like, what
if that happens first?

221
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:28,513
So before the earth actually moves,

222
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:29,935
before what we saw in the video,

223
00:11:29,935 --> 00:11:32,651
what did you guys think was happening?

224
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:35,413
And Moses had used the word for it too.

225
00:11:35,413 --> 00:11:38,525
What was happening to the rocks over time?

226
00:11:38,525 --> 00:11:40,972
So over time what was
happening in that rock

227
00:11:40,972 --> 00:11:43,942
that would eventually
lead to an earthquake?

228
00:11:43,942 --> 00:11:45,340
What's happening over time?

229
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,258
Ernesto, what's happening over time?

230
00:11:47,258 --> 00:11:48,091
- It's stretching?

231
00:11:48,091 --> 00:11:50,131
- It's stretching, keep
going with that, Diego?

232
00:11:50,131 --> 00:11:51,935
- [Diego] It was standing.

233
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,101
- It was standing, Tony?

234
00:11:53,101 --> 00:11:54,637
- [Tony] It's spreading apart?

235
00:11:54,637 --> 00:11:55,470
- Spreading apart, Jheyline?

236
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,303
- [Jheyline] Widening?

237
00:11:56,303 --> 00:11:57,337
- Widening, Tiger?

238
00:11:57,337 --> 00:11:58,170
- Breaking?

239
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,627
- Breaking, so wait before
the breaking though,

240
00:12:00,627 --> 00:12:02,561
you guys were saying it was stretching,

241
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:05,174
it was pulling, so what
word can you describe

242
00:12:05,174 --> 00:12:09,091
it building up in here,
building up, Stephanie?

243
00:12:10,168 --> 00:12:11,407
- [Stephanie] Through stress?

244
00:12:11,407 --> 00:12:14,052
- Ah, okay, so it sounds
like if we're gonna make an

245
00:12:14,052 --> 00:12:16,652
earthquake we need to have stress first.

246
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:19,457
We have said stress that builds, right?

247
00:12:19,457 --> 00:12:22,681
Stress builds, and then
what's gonna happen

248
00:12:22,681 --> 00:12:24,501
when the stress builds, and it builds,

249
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:27,959
and it builds and it builds
and it can't take it anymore?

250
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,335
What's going to happen, Manuel?

251
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,168
- Collide?

252
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,385
- This is stress, keep going.

253
00:12:34,385 --> 00:12:36,991
Not collide, what's another
word that's kind of, same idea?

254
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,291
So you said it when I was over here.

255
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,335
It's gonna keep stressing, and stressing,

256
00:12:42,335 --> 00:12:44,027
and what's gonna happen to the rock?

257
00:12:44,027 --> 00:12:44,860
- Rip?

258
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,693
- It'll what?

259
00:12:45,693 --> 00:12:46,526
- Rip?

260
00:12:46,526 --> 00:12:47,402
- Rip, what's another word you can say.

261
00:12:47,402 --> 00:12:49,149
- It'll explode.

262
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:50,409
- Explode, Adrian?

263
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:51,274
- Break?

264
00:12:51,274 --> 00:12:55,628
- Break, great, so there's
going to be a rupture.

265
00:12:55,628 --> 00:12:57,277
Or a break.

266
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,614
And then is that it?

267
00:12:58,614 --> 00:12:59,732
End of the story?

268
00:12:59,732 --> 00:13:01,387
Nice day, that's it?

269
00:13:01,387 --> 00:13:05,176
Where does all this energy go, right?

270
00:13:05,176 --> 00:13:09,032
There's all this energy
building up, where does it go?

271
00:13:09,032 --> 00:13:11,832
Yeah it ruptures, it
breaks, and then is it over?

272
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:12,665
- No.

273
00:13:12,665 --> 00:13:15,424
- No, what, where, what happened?

274
00:13:15,424 --> 00:13:18,001
Where did the energy go?

275
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:20,084
Where did that energy go?

276
00:13:21,752 --> 00:13:23,441
Irma, where'd it go?

277
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:25,370
- [Irma] Plate tectonics?

278
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,589
- Yeah, it has to do with
plate tectonics, absolutely.

279
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:29,672
Where did that energy go?

280
00:13:31,628 --> 00:13:33,299
Where did it go, Rodolfo?

281
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:34,740
- [Rodolfo] Plate boundaries?

282
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,642
- [Teacher] Yeah, plate boundaries.

283
00:13:36,642 --> 00:13:39,374
So okay we got stress builds, ruptures,

284
00:13:39,374 --> 00:13:41,576
it breaks, and then is that it?

285
00:13:41,576 --> 00:13:42,409
- No.

286
00:13:42,409 --> 00:13:43,934
- That's the earthquake?

287
00:13:43,934 --> 00:13:44,934
What action?

288
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,333
Yeah, Anna.

289
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,858
- It becomes an earthquake?

290
00:13:48,858 --> 00:13:50,232
- Yeah, it becomes an earthquake

291
00:13:50,232 --> 00:13:52,634
and so what do we experience?

292
00:13:52,634 --> 00:13:53,467
Jheyline?

293
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:54,300
- Shaking?

294
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,133
- Shaking, oh!

295
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:57,544
So it sounds like there's
a rupture or a break,

296
00:13:57,544 --> 00:14:00,555
and then that's gonna lead to shaking

297
00:14:00,555 --> 00:14:04,536
and that shaking is actually
what being released?

298
00:14:04,536 --> 00:14:06,024
- An earthquake.

299
00:14:06,024 --> 00:14:08,430
- It's an earthquake, yes and what is that

300
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,080
shaking actually being released?

301
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,747
So the shaking is released, what?

302
00:14:14,852 --> 00:14:15,685
Victor?

303
00:14:15,685 --> 00:14:16,518
- All the stress?

304
00:14:16,518 --> 00:14:17,704
- Yes, it's releasing all the stress.

305
00:14:17,704 --> 00:14:19,543
What's another word you could say?

306
00:14:19,543 --> 00:14:21,109
Releasing all of its...?

307
00:14:21,109 --> 00:14:22,587
- Power.

308
00:14:22,587 --> 00:14:24,738
- Power is a good word, or, Diego?

309
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:25,571
- [Diego] Energy.

310
00:14:25,571 --> 00:14:26,682
- Energy, right?

311
00:14:26,682 --> 00:14:29,348
So it seems like all an earthquake is,

312
00:14:29,348 --> 00:14:32,926
is stress building up,
building up, building up,

313
00:14:32,926 --> 00:14:36,070
breaks, and then we feel that.

314
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,711
What do we experience the energy as?

315
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,552
So what do we experience,
think of the energy as?

316
00:14:41,552 --> 00:14:43,224
What do we experience it, as an energy?

317
00:14:43,224 --> 00:14:44,057
(knocking)

318
00:14:44,057 --> 00:14:44,948
- That?

319
00:14:44,948 --> 00:14:45,882
- That, what's that?

320
00:14:45,882 --> 00:14:46,740
(knocking)

321
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,607
- Shaking.

322
00:14:47,607 --> 00:14:48,456
- Shaking, right?

323
00:14:48,456 --> 00:14:49,289
Alright awesome.

324
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:52,300
So now we're gonna, you
guys did that perfectly.

325
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,928
So we're gonna write
that down in our notes.

326
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:55,761
- [All Students] Woah.

327
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,939
- I know, that, earthquakes
release energy, right?

328
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:01,189
So that's what happens as a result.

329
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:03,554
So we are not in any way done with this,

330
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:06,962
because we are gonna talk
all about different (mumbles).

331
00:15:06,962 --> 00:15:10,094
You guys have made a good
start on what's happening.

332
00:15:10,094 --> 00:15:12,088
So we are gonna take two notes today.

333
00:15:12,088 --> 00:15:13,512
They're pretty short.

334
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:15,960
I'm sorry, the first one's a little long.

335
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,667
The other one's super short.

336
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:20,690
But this is what you
guys were just telling me

337
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,969
except now we're gonna add
the word elastic strain,

338
00:15:23,969 --> 00:15:25,858
which is what you guys were telling me.

339
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,083
You were telling me that
energy was building up,

340
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,881
you were telling me
stress was building up,

341
00:15:29,881 --> 00:15:32,504
and that's gonna cause elastic strain.

342
00:15:32,504 --> 00:15:33,337
Yes, Dajana?

343
00:15:33,337 --> 00:15:37,504
- The pictures that
you showed us (mumbles).

344
00:15:40,002 --> 00:15:40,835
- What?

345
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:46,218
- It only cut through the (mumbles).

346
00:15:46,218 --> 00:15:48,120
- Kind of, yeah.

347
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,953
- Yes.

348
00:15:49,995 --> 00:15:52,995
- So like maybe 'cause on the bottom

349
00:15:57,627 --> 00:16:01,910
that came out of the ground (mumbles).

350
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:02,743
- Yeah.

351
00:16:02,743 --> 00:16:04,384
- And then it just spilled it over,

352
00:16:04,384 --> 00:16:05,651
then it came out of the ground.

353
00:16:05,651 --> 00:16:08,685
- Yeah, so thank you for
those of you who got started.

354
00:16:08,685 --> 00:16:11,173
Rodolfo, let me just
read this off for people.

355
00:16:11,173 --> 00:16:14,136
So our first topic today
is earthquake energy.

356
00:16:14,136 --> 00:16:17,023
And this is what we just talked about.

357
00:16:17,023 --> 00:16:20,214
But now we're getting a
chance to write it down

358
00:16:20,214 --> 00:16:23,504
and we're adding in a bigger word.

359
00:16:23,504 --> 00:16:25,920
And that word is elastic strain.

360
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,087
So elastic strain is the energy stored

361
00:16:31,192 --> 00:16:33,025
as rocks change shape.

362
00:16:35,183 --> 00:16:38,350
So elastic strain is the energy stored

363
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,553
as rocks change shape.

364
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:46,761
Okay, so that's step
one in an earthquake.

365
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:47,594
Step two.

366
00:16:47,594 --> 00:16:51,761
Energy is released when the
rock ruptures or breaks.

367
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,267
So elastic strain is the energy
stored as rocks change shape

368
00:17:06,322 --> 00:17:10,489
and energy is released when
the rock ruptures or it breaks

369
00:17:14,306 --> 00:17:18,784
and released energy
travels in seismic waves,

370
00:17:18,784 --> 00:17:21,082
and we will learn all
about those next week.

371
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,157
But you can still write
down, you just think

372
00:17:23,157 --> 00:17:27,324
released energy travels
and it's felt as shaking.
