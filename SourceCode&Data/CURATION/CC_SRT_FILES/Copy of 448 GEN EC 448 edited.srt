1
00:00:00,953 --> 00:00:02,573
- Can you make some shadows?

2
00:00:02,573 --> 00:00:05,784
I see light, how will you
make a shadow?

3
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:10,846
How are you making a shadow?

4
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:15,667
How are you making a shadow Alicia?

5
00:00:16,706 --> 00:00:17,872
- My hands.

6
00:00:17,872 --> 00:00:20,023
- What is your hand doing?

7
00:00:20,272 --> 00:00:22,063
- Making a shadow.

8
00:00:22,392 --> 00:00:24,292
- How is it making a shadow?

9
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:25,922
- I don't know.

10
00:00:26,372 --> 00:00:28,322
- How is it making a shadow Brandon?

11
00:00:28,794 --> 00:00:30,716
- Because your hand is stopping the light.

12
00:00:30,716 --> 00:00:32,746
- Your hand is stopping the light.

13
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,339
- And it's small 'cause your hand

14
00:00:35,339 --> 00:00:39,369
is far away from your body and...

15
00:00:42,769 --> 00:00:46,550
More light comes around your hand.

16
00:00:46,721 --> 00:00:48,991
- What happens if you move
it close to the light?

17
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,016
- It has it big because
it stops more light.

18
00:00:54,406 --> 00:00:56,447
because it stops more light.

19
00:00:56,447 --> 00:00:58,737
- It's stopping more light,
you're right.

20
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,000
Let's go see what
these guys are doing.

21
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:03,701
What are you guys doing?

22
00:01:03,971 --> 00:01:07,841
- Blocking the light
from the light in there.

23
00:01:07,871 --> 00:01:09,187
- You're blocking the light?

24
00:01:09,187 --> 00:01:10,566
How are you blocking it?

25
00:01:10,792 --> 00:01:12,242
- We're going

26
00:01:13,492 --> 00:01:17,874
forwards and backwards
to make it little.

27
00:01:17,874 --> 00:01:20,344
- So I see your shadow is changing.

28
00:01:20,395 --> 00:01:21,845
How is it changing?

29
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:24,055
- Because you're closer to the light

30
00:01:24,055 --> 00:01:25,745
and then you're...

31
00:01:25,815 --> 00:01:27,856
When you get close it gets bigger.

32
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:29,476
- It gets bigger?

33
00:01:29,476 --> 00:01:33,017
- And when you're far it gets littler.

34
00:01:33,017 --> 00:01:35,527
- Okay, why does that happen?

35
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:38,807
What's happening when
you're down here?

36
00:01:39,157 --> 00:01:40,958
- It gets big.
- It gets bigger.

37
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:42,287
- Why does it get bigger?

38
00:01:42,287 --> 00:01:43,857
What happens to the light?

39
00:01:44,227 --> 00:01:46,598
- The light can't go through
your hand.

40
00:01:46,847 --> 00:01:49,228
- And and and it's blocking it.

41
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:51,097
- It's blocking more light?

42
00:01:51,127 --> 00:01:53,497
What happens over there then?

43
00:01:53,927 --> 00:01:56,657
- It's blocking a little
bit of light.

44
00:01:57,887 --> 00:02:00,590
- Okay.  So more light
gets around it, right?

45
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,070
Alright very good.

46
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,880
Can you guys make
different shadows?

47
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,633
- It's a turkey.

48
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:07,283
[laughs]

49
00:02:07,493 --> 00:02:09,996
That looks like the
red nosed reindeer.

50
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:12,749
- [laughing]
The red-nosed reindeer?

51
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,309
How are you changing your shadow?

52
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:20,452
- You have to make
shapes of the animals.

53
00:02:21,122 --> 00:02:23,593
- I don't know what to make.

54
00:02:23,922 --> 00:02:26,229
- [laughs] That's okay,
make anything you want.

55
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,852
You guys go ahead,
make 'em big and small,

56
00:02:28,852 --> 00:02:30,642
and I'll be back in a little bit.

57
00:02:32,606 --> 00:02:35,296
Duwant is helping you.

58
00:02:35,366 --> 00:02:36,816
- Duwant!

59
00:02:41,507 --> 00:02:43,397
- What's happening over here?

60
00:02:45,027 --> 00:02:46,737
Doing some measuring?

61
00:02:47,627 --> 00:02:49,337
What are you measuring?

62
00:02:50,047 --> 00:02:51,787
How come you guys are
measuring down here,

63
00:02:51,787 --> 00:02:53,657
and not in the window?

64
00:02:54,527 --> 00:02:56,457
- Because....

65
00:02:57,487 --> 00:02:59,217
- Are you able to see the box?

66
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:05,719
how come you're not
measuring the fifth one?

67
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,790
Where's the sun?

68
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,750
- The sun is on the other side.

69
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,380
- Other side of the building?

70
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,010
Way over there?

71
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,510
So we can't measure the
shadow sticks today, can we?

72
00:03:17,642 --> 00:03:20,152
That's why you're making
shadow sticks on the ground?

73
00:03:20,642 --> 00:03:22,532
Okay, show me a shadow stick.

74
00:03:23,442 --> 00:03:25,742
Okay Bristava you can
handle the light,

75
00:03:25,742 --> 00:03:27,832
what can you do?

76
00:03:30,364 --> 00:03:31,724
Can you hold the stick up for us,

77
00:03:31,724 --> 00:03:33,463
Julie, to make a shadow?

78
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,914
Okay, can you do the measuring?

79
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,095
Okay, go ahead and measure it.

80
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:41,615
Put your hand down here
so we can see the top.

81
00:03:42,605 --> 00:03:44,395
Can we measure that stick?

82
00:03:48,325 --> 00:03:51,335
No we're gonna measure the shadow.

83
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:57,905
You wanna measure the stick first,

84
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:00,575
and then compare it to
the shadow? Okay.

85
00:04:03,005 --> 00:04:04,845
You gotta hold that
real still, don't you?

86
00:04:05,888 --> 00:04:07,638
Is your light high or low?

87
00:04:08,028 --> 00:04:09,578
- Low?

88
00:04:09,608 --> 00:04:10,908
- It's lower--

89
00:04:10,908 --> 00:04:12,848
what happens if you put it lower,

90
00:04:12,848 --> 00:04:14,338
what happens to the shadow?

91
00:04:14,468 --> 00:04:15,978
- It turns big.
- It grows.

92
00:04:16,508 --> 00:04:18,248
- It grows? It gets longer.

93
00:04:18,248 --> 00:04:19,858
What if we put it high?

94
00:04:20,369 --> 00:04:22,079
- It's gonna be fat.

95
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,280
- Gonna be short?

96
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,040
is the shadow longer or
shorter than the stick?

97
00:04:34,632 --> 00:04:36,382
I need to you to measure it.

98
00:04:56,632 --> 00:04:58,632
Okay, let's record it.

99
00:04:58,764 --> 00:05:01,614
You measure the shadow.

100
00:05:04,768 --> 00:05:06,358
Measure the shadow.

101
00:05:07,728 --> 00:05:09,698
Whoops! 'Scuse me!

102
00:05:10,851 --> 00:05:13,942
Let's measure the shadow,
measure the shadow.

103
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:16,987
Is that long enough or
do you need another?

104
00:05:16,987 --> 00:05:18,877
Hold it still Bristava.

105
00:05:20,368 --> 00:05:22,077
Is that long enough?

106
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,890
Is the shadow longer
or the stick longer?

107
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,161
Let's compare.

108
00:05:26,871 --> 00:05:29,660
There's the shadow measurer
and there's the stick.

109
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,061
What do you notice?

110
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,033
- It's the same size.

111
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:39,193
- It's the same size, it sure is.

112
00:05:39,193 --> 00:05:41,623
What if you did it down here though?

113
00:05:41,713 --> 00:05:44,803
Would it be the same size if
you put the ball down here?

114
00:05:45,153 --> 00:05:48,964
No, the shadow would be
much longer wouldn't it?

115
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:52,103
Good work guys, keep measuring!

116
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:55,023
Try a different stick,
use that pointer stick.

117
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:58,303
Or another stick. Here's a stick.

118
00:05:58,434 --> 00:06:00,703
Here's some more
sticks for you to try.

119
00:06:01,813 --> 00:06:03,923
[Background Chatter]

120
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:11,023
- I'm done with these
things already.

121
00:06:11,353 --> 00:06:13,204
- it's okay.

122
00:06:14,253 --> 00:06:16,543
Okay, what are we doing?

123
00:06:20,154 --> 00:06:21,996
Can you guys guess what that is?

124
00:06:21,996 --> 00:06:23,439
- Scissors!

125
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:25,279
- How did you know it was scissors?

126
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,489
- Because the shadow.

127
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,582
- Okay, the shape of the
shadow told you,

128
00:06:33,582 --> 00:06:34,395
didn't it?

129
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:36,185
- She put on some blocks.

130
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:37,849
- Okay.
- No.

131
00:06:38,425 --> 00:06:40,616
Oh, she says no it's not blocks.

132
00:06:41,105 --> 00:06:42,646
Is she tricking you?

133
00:06:42,646 --> 00:06:43,268
- Yeah.

134
00:06:43,268 --> 00:06:45,688
- Sometimes the shape is hard to tell,

135
00:06:45,688 --> 00:06:46,868
can you guess?

136
00:06:46,868 --> 00:06:48,518
- Adam, no.

137
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:51,231
- Take a look at this one, Adam.

138
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:52,791
Take a look at this one,

139
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,091
oh nope, not from up here.

140
00:06:55,385 --> 00:06:56,915
What do you think that is?

141
00:07:01,065 --> 00:07:04,715
Know what this is? Bryce?

142
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,065
What is that one?

143
00:07:07,065 --> 00:07:10,875
Can you tell from the
shape what this one is?

144
00:07:11,228 --> 00:07:13,038
- Gluestick.

145
00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:15,358
- A gluestick you're right!

146
00:07:15,628 --> 00:07:18,152
Good guessing, how could you tell?

147
00:07:18,152 --> 00:07:19,861
- Shadow of the lid.

148
00:07:20,131 --> 00:07:22,171
- You saw the shadow of the lid?

149
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:23,954
Good job.

150
00:07:23,954 --> 00:07:25,785
- Bryce's turn.

151
00:07:26,757 --> 00:07:28,477
- Okay, now are you guys gonna play

152
00:07:28,477 --> 00:07:30,167
the takeaway game?

153
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,777
Okay. Remember, she's gonna put a whole

154
00:07:32,777 --> 00:07:35,227
bunch of objects on there, sit down,

155
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:39,257
and you grab a good long
look and then close your eyes

156
00:07:39,257 --> 00:07:41,197
and she'll take one away,
and you'll have to guess

157
00:07:41,197 --> 00:07:44,307
what shadow is missing. Okay?

158
00:07:46,477 --> 00:07:48,627
Alright, what are we
doing over here, guys?

159
00:07:57,457 --> 00:07:58,927
What are we doing?

160
00:08:03,187 --> 00:08:04,367
You're making shadows?
- Shadows

161
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:06,197
- You're checking out
different materials?

162
00:08:06,447 --> 00:08:07,667
- Yeah.

163
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:09,067
- Okay.  So what is that one, Shelby,

164
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:11,237
what did you find out about that one?

165
00:08:11,527 --> 00:08:12,957
- Goes through.

166
00:08:14,109 --> 00:08:16,079
- What goes though?

167
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:20,739
What goes through?

168
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,710
- The light.

169
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,730
- The light goes through,

170
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,300
so does it make a shadow?

171
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,760
- Yes?

172
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,120
- Which part of it makes a shadow?

173
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,810
Boys and girls, check your voices please?

174
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,221
Thank you.

175
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:40,801
- This part.

176
00:08:41,731 --> 00:08:43,212
- Okay, that thick part

177
00:08:43,212 --> 00:08:44,533
makes a shadow, doesn't it?

178
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:46,283
What about the thin parts?

179
00:08:48,693 --> 00:08:50,593
Doesn't make a shadow does it?

180
00:08:50,593 --> 00:08:51,613
The light goes right through.

181
00:08:51,613 --> 00:08:53,063
What else did you try?

182
00:08:54,253 --> 00:08:56,013
What are you trying Takori?

183
00:08:56,013 --> 00:08:57,823
Tell me about it. Show me.

184
00:08:59,513 --> 00:09:01,363
Why don't you try this, Trayshawn.

185
00:09:03,213 --> 00:09:04,853
But wait, Takori was trying something!

186
00:09:04,853 --> 00:09:06,445
Just a minute.

187
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,035
What have you got, Takori?

188
00:09:08,175 --> 00:09:09,025
- A tissue.

189
00:09:09,658 --> 00:09:10,678
- It's what?

190
00:09:10,678 --> 00:09:11,578
- A tissue.

191
00:09:11,578 --> 00:09:13,608
- A tissue? Is the light
going through it?

192
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,078
Or did it stop the light?

193
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:18,198
- Stopped the light.

194
00:09:18,198 --> 00:09:19,078
- It stopped the light,

195
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:20,478
so it made a shadow, didn't it?

196
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:22,528
Did it make a light
shadow or a dark shadow?

197
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:24,589
A dark one.

198
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:27,789
Okay Trayshawn, your turn,
what are you trying?

199
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,590
- The box.

200
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,200
- is it stopping the light?

201
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,790
Get back here so you can see.

202
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,390
Put it down here.

203
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,930
Can you see it?

204
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,230
What do you see about it?

205
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,060
- It's making a shadow.

206
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:46,169
- Which part is making a shadow?

207
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,959
- The whole thing.

208
00:09:48,609 --> 00:09:51,039
- is that a dark shadow
or a light shadow?

209
00:09:51,469 --> 00:09:53,179
- A dark shadow.

210
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:56,089
- Is this part dark or light?

211
00:09:56,089 --> 00:09:57,329
- Light.

212
00:09:57,329 --> 00:09:58,839
- Okay why is this part light?

213
00:09:58,869 --> 00:10:01,659
- Becuase it is a light shadow.

214
00:10:03,109 --> 00:10:04,669
Can't hear you babe.

215
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:06,789
- Because it's a light shadow.

216
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:08,589
- Why is it a light shadow?

217
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,870
Why isn't it a dark shadow?

218
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,810
What's happening to the light?

219
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,320
Some of the light going through it?

220
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,760
- Mm-hmm.

221
00:10:27,341 --> 00:10:28,971
- What do you think, Cooper?

222
00:10:29,221 --> 00:10:30,931
What's making that shadow?

223
00:10:31,521 --> 00:10:35,131
- Um, the light.

224
00:10:35,222 --> 00:10:37,372
- Okay, the light is
making the shadow.

225
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:41,162
What are we using, what is this?

226
00:10:41,162 --> 00:10:42,962
- A box.

227
00:10:42,962 --> 00:10:46,112
- Okay,
is it clear or colored?

228
00:10:46,882 --> 00:10:47,643
- Clear.

229
00:10:47,643 --> 00:10:49,933
- Okay, so what happens to the light?

230
00:10:50,003 --> 00:10:51,463
- It goes through.

231
00:10:51,463 --> 00:10:53,063
- Okay, it goes through it, doesn't it,

232
00:10:53,063 --> 00:10:55,953
so it only makes a
little bit of a shadow.

233
00:10:56,163 --> 00:10:57,793
Good job.

234
00:10:57,804 --> 00:10:59,244
Did you guys write the things over here,

235
00:10:59,244 --> 00:11:01,434
did you find anything new to write down?

236
00:11:02,924 --> 00:11:04,664
Let's try that Shelby.

237
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,445
You and Cooper come over here

238
00:11:05,445 --> 00:11:06,815
and try that.

239
00:11:12,185 --> 00:11:14,775
Okay Cooper, you may
go to the bathroom.

240
00:11:16,945 --> 00:11:18,715
What do you see, Shelby?

241
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,235
- Sorry.

242
00:11:26,406 --> 00:11:28,046
- You see a light shadow?

243
00:11:28,046 --> 00:11:29,388
Why is it light?

244
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,908
- 'Cause it goes right through.

245
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:33,658
- Is any part of that dark?

246
00:11:34,788 --> 00:11:35,761
- This part.
- That part?

247
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,771
Why do you think that part's dark?

248
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:40,981
- 'Cause it has a wrapper.

249
00:11:40,981 --> 00:11:42,862
- The wrapper, and what's the wrapper

250
00:11:42,862 --> 00:11:44,292
doing to the light?

251
00:11:48,193 --> 00:11:51,903
- It's stopping the light
and it's making a shadow.

252
00:11:51,953 --> 00:11:54,283
- Exactly. Very good Shelby, thank you.

253
00:11:55,073 --> 00:11:57,263
[student clapping]

254
00:11:58,573 --> 00:12:00,524
Go right here, okay?

255
00:12:04,035 --> 00:12:05,625
What's our time?

256
00:12:06,175 --> 00:12:07,905
- We have two minutes left.

257
00:12:10,735 --> 00:12:13,185
- We might wanna go back and see--

258
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:18,495
Hey what'd we find out?

259
00:12:18,495 --> 00:12:19,865
Raja, what are we doing here?

260
00:12:21,817 --> 00:12:23,547
- Measuring.

261
00:12:26,877 --> 00:12:28,567
- What's your shadow doing?

262
00:12:30,937 --> 00:12:32,947
Can you change your shadow?

263
00:12:34,098 --> 00:12:35,758
How do you change your shadow?

264
00:12:35,758 --> 00:12:36,958
- By moving.

265
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,518
- By moving? By moving the object?

266
00:12:39,518 --> 00:12:41,388
How else could you change your shadow?

267
00:12:45,158 --> 00:12:46,948
What about the light?

268
00:12:48,297 --> 00:12:49,859
What would you do with the light?

269
00:12:49,859 --> 00:12:51,019
- Move it?

270
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:51,960
- Move it? I'll hold your stick,

271
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,470
and you move the light.

272
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,640
How is your shadow changing?

273
00:12:57,931 --> 00:12:59,601
Getting bigger?

274
00:12:59,851 --> 00:13:01,771
What else could you do?

275
00:13:01,771 --> 00:13:03,821
Move your light some more.

276
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:07,741
Move it up or down.

277
00:13:08,511 --> 00:13:10,821
Ooh, what happened to the shadow?

278
00:13:13,231 --> 00:13:15,301
It got shorter?

279
00:13:16,871 --> 00:13:18,661
Oh, now what's happening?

280
00:13:20,771 --> 00:13:22,392
Got longer, didn't it.

281
00:13:22,392 --> 00:13:25,702
This is making a shadow
that's easy to see.

282
00:13:26,212 --> 00:13:28,044
Look at that shadow.

283
00:13:29,034 --> 00:13:30,734
When the light is high,

284
00:13:30,734 --> 00:13:32,174
the shadow is?

285
00:13:32,174 --> 00:13:32,956
- Shorter.

286
00:13:32,956 --> 00:13:36,616
- Short. And when the light is low,

287
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:38,366
the shadow is?

288
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:42,947
Alright now measure that. Measure that.

289
00:13:47,097 --> 00:13:49,560
How many cubes lie on that shadow?

290
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,621
- One, two three, four,
five, six, seven.

291
00:13:53,621 --> 00:13:55,261
- Is the shadow longer or shorter

292
00:13:55,261 --> 00:13:56,241
than the stick?

293
00:14:00,408 --> 00:14:02,338
Longer or shorter than the stick?

294
00:14:02,468 --> 00:14:03,668
- The same.

295
00:14:03,668 --> 00:14:05,679
- Oh it's the same!

296
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:09,560
I think our--
