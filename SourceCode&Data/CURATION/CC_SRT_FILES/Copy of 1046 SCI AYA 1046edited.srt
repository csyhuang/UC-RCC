1
00:00:00,407 --> 00:00:02,700
- Okay, so for our first trial,

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,025
we just wanted to see
how long it would take

3
00:00:05,025 --> 00:00:08,534
for 25 milliliters of magnesium hydroxide

4
00:00:08,534 --> 00:00:13,408
to turn into acid by adding HCL,

5
00:00:13,408 --> 00:00:16,267
and it took 73.5 milliliters.

6
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:17,750
- And for our second trial,

7
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,376
we had the same amount
of milk of magnesia,

8
00:00:21,376 --> 00:00:25,322
but this time, we diluted it
with 100 milliliters of water.

9
00:00:26,272 --> 00:00:30,709
And it took less HCL, hydrochloric acid than in

10
00:00:30,709 --> 00:00:32,940
the first trial that we did.

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,230
- And, the first time, we
only added five drops of

12
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,438
phenylthalene, and the second
time we added ten drops

13
00:00:40,438 --> 00:00:42,923
just to see if it would make it different,

14
00:00:42,923 --> 00:00:45,173
and the ten drops
definitely made it pinker,

15
00:00:45,173 --> 00:00:47,072
but we don't think it affected the results

16
00:00:47,072 --> 00:00:48,981
because phenylthalene
is just the indicator,

17
00:00:48,981 --> 00:00:51,514
and not part of the reaction.

18
00:00:53,162 --> 00:00:54,858
- You guys actually
brought up a good point.

19
00:00:54,858 --> 00:00:59,146
How many groups added phenylthalene

20
00:00:59,146 --> 00:01:01,732
in large quantities?

21
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,217
(laughter)

22
00:01:06,217 --> 00:01:10,025
How many think that you didn't add enough?

23
00:01:10,025 --> 00:01:11,764
Let's just ask that.

24
00:01:11,764 --> 00:01:13,363
(scattered mumbling)

25
00:01:13,363 --> 00:01:15,315
Or, how would you know if you added

26
00:01:15,315 --> 00:01:18,216
too much or not enough?

27
00:01:19,556 --> 00:01:21,096
Alright, go ahead, Will.

28
00:01:21,096 --> 00:01:22,302
- Well, as long as it turns pink,

29
00:01:22,302 --> 00:01:23,976
you know that the indicator's working.

30
00:01:23,976 --> 00:01:25,512
- [Instructor] What if it's pinker?

31
00:01:25,512 --> 00:01:28,648
- It wouldn't matter because
it turns clear towards the end.

32
00:01:29,778 --> 00:01:31,688
- [Instructor] What do other people think?

33
00:01:31,688 --> 00:01:32,680
Alright, Vivian?

34
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,631
- I feel like if there's
not enough indicator

35
00:01:34,631 --> 00:01:39,346
that when you add more and
more HCL to the solution,

36
00:01:39,346 --> 00:01:42,716
it becomes, the pink
color becomes so diluted

37
00:01:42,716 --> 00:01:45,521
that you can hardly
tell when it turns clear

38
00:01:45,521 --> 00:01:48,263
and when it turns back to very pale pink.

39
00:01:48,263 --> 00:01:50,630
So, I don't think there's such a thing

40
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,625
as adding too much indicator.

41
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,630
Our group added about five drops,

42
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,209
and that was enough.

43
00:01:56,209 --> 00:01:57,649
- [Instructor] Okay, what, Tad?

44
00:01:57,649 --> 00:01:59,846
- Actually, adding too much indicator

45
00:01:59,846 --> 00:02:02,480
is bad for the experiment
because that would

46
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,680
distort the actual
concentration of reactants.

47
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,141
So, in an extreme case,

48
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:09,531
if we added like 100
milliliters of indicator,

49
00:02:09,531 --> 00:02:12,805
that would definitely
distort the concentration.

50
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,847
- [Instructor] True, what
do people think about that?

51
00:02:16,847 --> 00:02:18,031
Alright, Jimmy?

52
00:02:18,031 --> 00:02:22,234
- The indicator doesn't
participate in the overall reaction

53
00:02:22,234 --> 00:02:25,626
so it doesn't really make a difference.

54
00:02:27,626 --> 00:02:30,201
- [Instructor] What do
people have to say to that?

55
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:34,062
Alright, why don't you take
30 seconds with your group.

56
00:02:34,062 --> 00:02:37,988
Discuss, would adding too much indicator,

57
00:02:37,988 --> 00:02:40,675
would that affect your concentration?

58
00:02:40,675 --> 00:02:42,510
Like, in terms of volume,
maybe you're adding

59
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,464
to more volume of your reaction,

60
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:49,405
would that affect the
concentrations of your reactants?

61
00:02:50,296 --> 00:03:18,047
(children talking loudly)

62
00:03:19,713 --> 00:03:21,811
Okay, thoughts?

63
00:03:23,225 --> 00:03:25,473
Alright, Jerry.

64
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:27,307
- I feel like if you added the indicator,

65
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:30,187
it would dilute the
solution because it would be

66
00:03:30,187 --> 00:03:33,088
somewhat like water, if
you added, let's say,

67
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:37,845
100 milliliters of water it
would change the concentration.

68
00:03:37,845 --> 00:03:41,610
- [Instructor] Okay, alright, Stephanie?

69
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,863
- I think it would, like,
because if you started out

70
00:03:44,863 --> 00:03:47,295
with 25 milliliters of milk of magnesia,

71
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:50,154
even if you add a lot of phenylthalene,

72
00:03:50,154 --> 00:03:53,545
it would still be 25
milliliters of milk of magnesia

73
00:03:53,545 --> 00:03:55,476
and that's what's reacting.

74
00:03:55,476 --> 00:03:59,113
So, I don't think it affects it.

75
00:04:01,503 --> 00:04:02,808
- Alright, Mackenzie?

76
00:04:02,808 --> 00:04:05,709
- Isn't pH determined by the concentration

77
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:08,429
of hydroxide or hydrogen ions?

78
00:04:08,429 --> 00:04:11,351
So, if it's, it would
be moles over liters,

79
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,909
so if there were more liters,

80
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:15,874
it would be a smaller
concentration, right?

81
00:04:20,114 --> 00:04:21,143
- Alright, Corey?

82
00:04:21,143 --> 00:04:23,959
- It's mostly about the moles
because if the moles of each of

83
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:28,876
the acid and the base
combine, they will neutralize.

84
00:04:28,876 --> 00:04:32,108
It doesn't really matter, the over liters,

85
00:04:32,108 --> 00:04:35,442
as long as the moles are equal.

86
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,865
- [Instructor] Okay, Rick?

87
00:04:36,865 --> 00:04:39,489
- Well, since phenylthalene
is an indicator,

88
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:41,398
it doesn't actually
participate in the reaction,

89
00:04:41,398 --> 00:04:44,064
just like water, so adding it
would just increase the volume

90
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:47,808
which, as he said, which
would dilute the solution.

91
00:04:47,808 --> 00:04:50,688
Adding a lot would have a profound affect,

92
00:04:50,688 --> 00:04:53,706
but adding a little bit wouldn't
actually make a difference.

93
00:04:53,706 --> 00:04:56,277
- [Instructor] Okay, Richard?

94
00:04:56,277 --> 00:05:00,533
- It would, because there's
a lower concentration,

95
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:04,170
it would take a lot
longer for it to react,

96
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:09,170
meaning that it greatly
increases the risk of error.

97
00:05:09,631 --> 00:05:14,631
Because, when you're using a
burette, it's continuously

98
00:05:15,156 --> 00:05:17,737
dripping so then, if you're swirling

99
00:05:17,737 --> 00:05:22,737
and it doesn't react as
fast, then you have more

100
00:05:23,049 --> 00:05:26,061
that goes in before you
actually realize it.

101
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:30,387
- So, those are all good
thoughts that you guys

102
00:05:30,387 --> 00:05:32,221
came up with, and all reasonable.

103
00:05:32,221 --> 00:05:35,123
It does affect the
concentration, and when you add

104
00:05:35,123 --> 00:05:37,405
a few drops, just like Vivian said,

105
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:40,466
if you don't add enough,
then it's still indicating,

106
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:43,303
but in terms of the overall concentration,

107
00:05:43,303 --> 00:05:45,437
the concentration of the phenylthalene

108
00:05:45,437 --> 00:05:48,508
would be relatively small,
and so that's why you see,

109
00:05:48,508 --> 00:05:52,156
like a very faint pink,
but it's still indicating.

110
00:05:52,156 --> 00:05:53,735
Now, if you add more drops,
of course you're going

111
00:05:53,735 --> 00:05:57,702
to have a darker pink, but
the overall reaction volume

112
00:05:57,702 --> 00:06:02,161
would increase and so, if you
add drops of phenylthalene,

113
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:05,318
if you're adding like, five
drops, compared to your

114
00:06:05,318 --> 00:06:07,867
overall reaction volume, it wouldn't be

115
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,798
that big of a difference.
So you would still have

116
00:06:09,798 --> 00:06:11,718
some source of error, but
since you're only adding

117
00:06:11,718 --> 00:06:14,705
five drops as opposed
to five million drops,

118
00:06:14,705 --> 00:06:17,265
five million drops
could conceivably double

119
00:06:17,265 --> 00:06:19,536
your reaction volume and
then your concentration

120
00:06:19,536 --> 00:06:23,440
on a greater scale would be affected.

121
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,691
You know, it would make
it so it's more diluted.

122
00:06:25,691 --> 00:06:27,387
Okay, does that make sense to everyone?

123
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,179
Alright, those were all good comments.

124
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:31,013
Anyone else have a comment?

125
00:06:31,013 --> 00:06:33,770
Alright, so let's go to table two.

126
00:06:34,725 --> 00:06:38,650
- In last week's experiment,
we were testing how much

127
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:43,462
HCL it would take to

128
00:06:43,462 --> 00:06:47,504
neutralize 25 mL of milk of magnesia.

129
00:06:47,504 --> 00:06:50,585
First, we measured 25
mL of milk of magnesia

130
00:06:50,585 --> 00:06:54,670
using a graduated cylinder
and add the milk of magnesia

131
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:57,881
into the flask, and then we add three drop

132
00:06:57,881 --> 00:07:00,505
of phenylthalene as
indicator to the flask.

133
00:07:00,505 --> 00:07:03,640
Then, we slowly used the
burette to drop the HCL

134
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,949
into the flask and it
took us 55.5 mL of HCL

135
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:10,205
to clear the solution.

136
00:07:10,925 --> 00:07:15,458
- Every time we'd see that it's clear,

137
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:20,194
it took the solution longer time.

138
00:07:22,786 --> 00:07:25,079
So, the first time, we stopped putting,

139
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:28,001
we stopped adding HCL,
but then it only took

140
00:07:28,001 --> 00:07:31,415
about one second to turn back to pink.

141
00:07:31,415 --> 00:07:34,689
But then, after the third
or fourth stop that we made,

142
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:37,078
it took longer than one second,

143
00:07:37,078 --> 00:07:41,323
so by the time it took,

144
00:07:41,323 --> 00:07:45,136
so like, towards the end,
it didn't turn pink anymore.

145
00:07:46,176 --> 00:07:49,014
- So, for the second trial, what we did,

146
00:07:49,014 --> 00:07:53,173
instead of using just 25
milliliters of milk of magnesia,

147
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:56,234
we just used 15 milliliters,
and diluted it with

148
00:07:56,234 --> 00:07:58,368
ten milliliters of water to see if there's

149
00:07:58,368 --> 00:08:01,695
a change in the amount of HCL we used,

150
00:08:01,695 --> 00:08:06,314
and it did, because it took a lot less,

151
00:08:06,314 --> 00:08:10,612
which was 35.5 milliliters of HCL

152
00:08:10,612 --> 00:08:13,929
as compared to the first
trial where we used 55.5.

153
00:08:15,249 --> 00:08:17,950
- So, we thought there might be a relation

154
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:22,270
between the concentration of
trial two versus trial one.

155
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:26,899
It was roughly, 35.5 is
roughly two thirds the amount

156
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:30,472
it took for the m.o.m
to come clear as over

157
00:08:30,472 --> 00:08:34,632
55.5 milliliters of
HCL, and we were kind of

158
00:08:34,632 --> 00:08:37,000
surprised by the results
because we didn't expect it

159
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,492
to keep going back to pink
after it turned clear once.

160
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,221
- Do you think you did something wrong?

161
00:08:44,221 --> 00:08:46,770
- Well, we kind of did,
but then we remembered

162
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,020
that this reaction was
actually reversible,

163
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,644
so then we tried it again
and then we eventually

164
00:08:51,644 --> 00:08:53,867
made it all clear.

165
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,825
(group members agree)

166
00:08:55,825 --> 00:08:58,215
- Did anyone else, did any
other groups think that,

167
00:08:58,215 --> 00:08:59,729
when the reaction was happening,

168
00:08:59,729 --> 00:09:01,929
that you had done something wrong?

169
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:08,201
Or were surprised by the results?

170
00:09:08,201 --> 00:09:10,424
Alright, Ian?

171
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,638
- Oh, no, just saying yes.

172
00:09:12,638 --> 00:09:14,846
- [Instructor] Okay,
anyone have a comment?

173
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,075
- We thought something
was going wrong because

174
00:09:17,075 --> 00:09:22,075
it took a lot of HCL for the
indicator to start working.

175
00:09:22,184 --> 00:09:24,851
- [Instructor] What do
you mean start working?

176
00:09:24,851 --> 00:09:26,824
- To start turning opaque,

177
00:09:26,824 --> 00:09:28,989
because it was pink for a long time.

178
00:09:28,989 --> 00:09:32,210
We had to add extra HCL to the burette.

179
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,850
- We actually thought that
it wouldn't stop turning pink

180
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:40,188
because we stopped it
for about three times,

181
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:42,609
stopped the burette from running,

182
00:09:42,609 --> 00:09:45,041
and every time it kept changing color.

183
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:48,177
So, we thought that happened
throughout the experiment.

184
00:09:48,177 --> 00:09:49,830
- Did you think it was
going to go on forever?

185
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,918
- Yep.

186
00:09:50,918 --> 00:09:53,630
- Okay, any other groups?

187
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,208
Alright, Andrew?

188
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:58,376
- We noticed that, yeah, what they said.

189
00:09:58,376 --> 00:10:01,245
It changed to clear, and then
after we stopped stirring it

190
00:10:01,245 --> 00:10:03,688
it would go back to pink.

191
00:10:03,688 --> 00:10:08,466
We thought it was the
reversible reaction rates,

192
00:10:08,466 --> 00:10:10,557
but then, like we were surprised

193
00:10:10,557 --> 00:10:12,391
at how big a difference it was,

194
00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:14,599
because it was really clear
when we were stirring it,

195
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:17,072
but once we stopped, became really pink.

196
00:10:17,072 --> 00:10:18,738
- [Instructor] Okay, alright, Will?

197
00:10:18,738 --> 00:10:22,170
- There was also a transitional
phase where it turned light,

198
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,740
and we thought that was the
phase it would turn into,

199
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,575
rather than clear, so we
actually stopped it there,

200
00:10:26,575 --> 00:10:28,356
but then we looked around
and realized that people

201
00:10:28,356 --> 00:10:32,516
with a less concentration turned clear,

202
00:10:32,516 --> 00:10:34,393
so we started adding more.

203
00:10:35,933 --> 00:10:40,313
- [Instructor] Okay,
alright, group three?

204
00:10:41,943 --> 00:10:45,507
- First, we used 25 milliliters
of milk of magnesia,

205
00:10:45,507 --> 00:10:49,272
and then we took 200 milliliters
of water to dilute it

206
00:10:49,272 --> 00:10:52,216
and then we added five
drops of phenylthalene.

207
00:10:52,216 --> 00:10:56,674
It took about 7 milliliters
of one molar HCL

208
00:10:56,674 --> 00:11:01,111
to actually fully, huh?

209
00:11:02,591 --> 00:11:04,621
Yeah, it took 70 milliliters,

210
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:07,959
and then it stayed clear from there.

211
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,242
- For the second trial, we want to see

212
00:11:10,242 --> 00:11:13,580
if we added less milk of magnesia,

213
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,644
would it, would the time decrease?

214
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:22,644
I mean the time to neutralize decrease.

215
00:11:23,073 --> 00:11:26,539
And so, we add 15 mL of magnesia

216
00:11:26,539 --> 00:11:29,280
and the same amount of H2O,

217
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,558
and so we used up about

218
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:36,489
38 mL of HCL.

219
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:41,269
- So, I heard something about timing,

220
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:42,901
because I heard the first couple groups

221
00:11:42,901 --> 00:11:44,544
timed some of the things.

222
00:11:44,544 --> 00:11:46,794
What did you guys time,
and why did you choose

223
00:11:46,794 --> 00:11:49,258
to time that?

224
00:11:50,398 --> 00:11:52,629
Here, let's start here because
you guys timed something.

225
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,004
What did you time,

226
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,159
and why did you choose to time that?

227
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:01,159
- Well, basically, I think we're
just measuring the amount

228
00:12:02,015 --> 00:12:06,910
of HCL we used up, and see how many times

229
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:11,203
we need to stop the burette for.

230
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:17,179
- Well, we observed that it
kept changing from pink to clear

231
00:12:18,152 --> 00:12:23,152
but the more HCL we
put, the faster it was,

232
00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:28,539
from the switch, so we kept adding HCL,

233
00:12:28,893 --> 00:12:33,019
and it turned all clear.

234
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:36,001
- It turned all clear, the faster--

235
00:12:36,001 --> 00:12:39,356
- The previous times were milky white,

236
00:12:39,356 --> 00:12:42,631
and then towards the
end, it becomes clear.

237
00:12:42,631 --> 00:12:44,721
Like, totally clear.

238
00:12:44,721 --> 00:12:47,569
- Okay, did anyone observe
something different,

239
00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:49,756
in terms of the amount of time that it took

240
00:12:49,756 --> 00:12:52,725
for it to turn back to pink?

241
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:55,654
Okay, table six?

242
00:12:55,654 --> 00:12:58,416
- As we added more HCL, the white color

243
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:01,158
persisted longer and it took longer for it

244
00:13:01,158 --> 00:13:02,939
to turn back to pink.

245
00:13:02,939 --> 00:13:05,680
- [Instructor] Okay, so, yeah, Rick?

246
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,570
- I don't think time really
matters in this experiment

247
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,845
because the changing of
the colors in the reaction

248
00:13:11,845 --> 00:13:14,010
depended more on the
amount that was added,

249
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,581
rather than the time you left it in there.

250
00:13:16,581 --> 00:13:20,602
So, if you add more, of course
it's going to change quicker

251
00:13:20,602 --> 00:13:25,602
but it doesn't matter, like
how long you have to wait for.

252
00:13:25,753 --> 00:13:29,422
- So, you guys were saying that
when you added the HCL,

253
00:13:29,422 --> 00:13:32,281
that it changed quicker to white,

254
00:13:32,281 --> 00:13:37,281
and then it took longer for
it to turn back to pink.

255
00:13:40,131 --> 00:13:41,966
Okay, Gabriel?

256
00:13:41,966 --> 00:13:44,270
- We timed it because we
think that there might

257
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,029
be a connection between the time it takes

258
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:48,195
each time to turn back to pink

259
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:50,563
and the concentration of the reactants

260
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,602
because the longer it
takes to turn back to pink

261
00:13:53,602 --> 00:13:55,394
might mean that there are less reactants

262
00:13:55,394 --> 00:13:57,154
and therefore, it will take a long time

263
00:13:57,154 --> 00:14:02,154
to get back to the reactions,

264
00:14:02,228 --> 00:14:04,223
right back to the products

265
00:14:04,223 --> 00:14:06,452
which turns it to pink.

266
00:14:06,452 --> 00:14:10,697
- [Instructor] Okay, alright, Corey?

267
00:14:10,697 --> 00:14:14,697
- I was saying that it was
faster turning back to pink.

268
00:14:15,697 --> 00:14:17,875
- The reaction was actually,

269
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,792
it was slower going back to pink.

270
00:14:24,637 --> 00:14:26,376
That's okay.

271
00:14:26,376 --> 00:14:28,898
Okay, let's go to table four.

272
00:14:30,642 --> 00:14:33,831
- In our experiment, in
our procedure, actually,

273
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:38,684
we had two beakers of
the magnesium hydroxide,

274
00:14:38,684 --> 00:14:42,599
and one beaker, we would
heat, instead of diluting it,

275
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:47,175
we would heat up one beaker
to around 50 degrees Celsius,

276
00:14:47,175 --> 00:14:50,897
and we would perform the experiment with

277
00:14:50,897 --> 00:14:54,331
adding HCL using the burette,
and in the other beaker,

278
00:14:54,331 --> 00:14:56,326
we would leave it in room temperature,

279
00:14:56,326 --> 00:14:59,046
which is around 25 degrees Celsius,

280
00:14:59,046 --> 00:15:01,019
and we would do the same procedure,

281
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:04,411
adding the HCL with the burette.

282
00:15:04,411 --> 00:15:07,312
- Our purpose for heating it was to see

283
00:15:07,312 --> 00:15:12,069
whether the reaction was
an endothermic reaction

284
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:14,906
or an exothermic reaction.

285
00:15:14,906 --> 00:15:18,245
- What we found was
that when we heated it,

286
00:15:18,245 --> 00:15:23,245
it actually, changing from pink to clear,

287
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,628
it actually took less
time than when we did it

288
00:15:26,628 --> 00:15:28,953
at room temperature, so we don't know

289
00:15:28,953 --> 00:15:33,006
if it accounts for the
exothermic or endothermic,

290
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:35,449
or maybe the molecules
are just moving faster

291
00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:38,115
so it'll react faster.

292
00:15:38,115 --> 00:15:42,691
- We also did not dilute
the milk of magnesia

293
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,227
like most of the groups did,

294
00:15:44,227 --> 00:15:47,128
so that may have skewed our
answers a little as well.

295
00:15:47,128 --> 00:15:50,637
It took us a lot longer, and more HCL,

296
00:15:50,637 --> 00:15:53,596
to turn the solution clear again.

297
00:15:55,277 --> 00:15:58,114
- [Instructor] Comments?

298
00:15:58,114 --> 00:16:00,621
Does anyone think that,

299
00:16:00,621 --> 00:16:02,733
so this group didn't dilute.

300
00:16:02,733 --> 00:16:06,248
How many groups diluted
and added distilled water?

301
00:16:06,248 --> 00:16:09,036
Okay, so all the other groups did.

302
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:10,721
(laughter)

303
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:14,561
Do you think that their
data would be affected

304
00:16:14,561 --> 00:16:16,492
because they didn't dilute,

305
00:16:16,492 --> 00:16:18,348
and because you did?

306
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,401
What are your thoughts?

307
00:16:21,401 --> 00:16:22,667
Alright, Nina?

308
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:24,048
- We diluted our second trial,

309
00:16:24,048 --> 00:16:26,795
and it didn't affect the
amount of HCL needed.

310
00:16:26,795 --> 00:16:27,979
- [Instructor] Why do you think,

311
00:16:27,979 --> 00:16:30,304
well, from your
observations, that's obvious,

312
00:16:30,304 --> 00:16:33,483
but does anyone know why?

313
00:16:33,483 --> 00:16:36,405
Or think why that might happen?

314
00:16:37,335 --> 00:16:39,253
Why would your data not be affected?

315
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:41,546
Or think that maybe theirs was a fluke?

316
00:16:41,546 --> 00:16:44,149
And, your data should have been affected

317
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:47,988
by diluting it with water?

318
00:16:47,988 --> 00:16:49,823
Alright, Joey?

319
00:16:49,823 --> 00:16:51,956
- Is it because the HCL only reacts

320
00:16:51,956 --> 00:16:54,537
with the milk of magnesia?

321
00:16:54,537 --> 00:16:56,447
So, it doesn't affect how much water

322
00:16:56,447 --> 00:16:58,676
because it doesn't react with water?

323
00:16:58,676 --> 00:17:00,809
- [Instructor] Okay,
what do you guys think?

324
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:03,177
Alright, Katie?

325
00:17:03,177 --> 00:17:07,283
- I think it will affect it
because the concentration's

326
00:17:07,283 --> 00:17:12,283
higher and the milk of magnesia by itself

327
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:18,992
is more dense so there's less
surface area, I would say.

328
00:17:19,378 --> 00:17:21,330
- [Instructor] Okay, less surface area.

329
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,674
Okay, that's a possibility.

330
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:23,858
Alright, Gabriel?

331
00:17:23,858 --> 00:17:26,674
- I think it wouldn't
affect the amount of HCL

332
00:17:26,674 --> 00:17:28,743
that would be added, but it
will just affect the time

333
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:31,804
because with water, it
will take longer for the

334
00:17:31,804 --> 00:17:36,753
reaction to take place
because there's more volume,

335
00:17:36,753 --> 00:17:41,073
and without diluting it, their group just

336
00:17:41,073 --> 00:17:43,452
made it straight up so it would be faster

337
00:17:43,452 --> 00:17:45,979
for the reactants to go back to pink,

338
00:17:45,979 --> 00:17:48,667
and then at the end, it
will just turn clear,

339
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:49,855
either way.

340
00:17:49,855 --> 00:17:52,116
- [Instructor] Why do you
think it would be faster

341
00:17:52,116 --> 00:17:53,599
if they didn't dilute it?

342
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:55,039
- Because there would be less volume,

343
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,124
and the smaller the
spaces, the molecules will

344
00:17:59,124 --> 00:18:02,793
react faster and have
less room to move around.

345
00:18:02,793 --> 00:18:04,766
- [Instructor] Okay, reasonable, yep.

346
00:18:04,766 --> 00:18:06,478
- So, our group kind of did both.

347
00:18:06,478 --> 00:18:09,261
We had a control, we
redid the same experiment

348
00:18:09,261 --> 00:18:11,331
for number one, and then
we measured how many

349
00:18:11,331 --> 00:18:13,069
milliliters of HCL it took,

350
00:18:13,069 --> 00:18:14,957
so if you change the concentration,

351
00:18:14,957 --> 00:18:19,529
it does affect the amount of HCL it takes

352
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:22,324
to neutralize it.

353
00:18:22,324 --> 00:18:23,551
- [Instructor] Alright, Michael?

354
00:18:23,551 --> 00:18:28,361
- We diluted it, and it
took longer for us to,

355
00:18:28,361 --> 00:18:31,678
we added more HCL for it to neutralize,

356
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:36,678
and I feel like if you
dilute the milk of magnesia,

357
00:18:37,064 --> 00:18:40,735
there would be less molarity,

358
00:18:40,735 --> 00:18:44,419
and if it's not diluted,

359
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:48,212
it would be a stronger weak
base than if it was diluted.

360
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:50,185
It would become weaker.

361
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:55,134
- You can't change the
strength of an acid or a base

362
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:59,614
because it's based on what,

363
00:18:59,614 --> 00:19:01,406
it's by definition.

364
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:04,072
You can't make a strong base weak,

365
00:19:04,072 --> 00:19:06,362
but that's okay, Wintel?

366
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:08,274
(laughter)

367
00:19:08,274 --> 00:19:12,008
- In our case we did two
solutions, different concentration.

368
00:19:12,008 --> 00:19:16,007
The amount of HCL that's needed

369
00:19:16,007 --> 00:19:18,183
to neutralize the solution shouldn't be,

370
00:19:18,183 --> 00:19:20,626
should be the same, but in this case,

371
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:25,626
the time delay causes the
solution with low concentration

372
00:19:26,364 --> 00:19:29,382
to take more HCL because

373
00:19:29,382 --> 00:19:34,382
during the delay, the reaction,

374
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:39,715
the HCL hasn't still reacted
with milk of magnesia yet,

375
00:19:39,782 --> 00:19:43,472
and because of that delay,
there's more HCL that's needed

376
00:19:43,472 --> 00:19:46,485
to compensate for that.

377
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:49,093
- Okay, so there's a little
bit of stoichiometry going on,

378
00:19:49,093 --> 00:19:52,112
where the number of moles or the amount,

379
00:19:52,112 --> 00:19:55,269
the amount's still the
same, regardless of whether,

380
00:19:55,269 --> 00:19:57,935
of milk of magnesia,
regardless of whether or not

381
00:19:57,935 --> 00:19:59,983
you added distilled water or you didn't.

382
00:19:59,983 --> 00:20:01,323
So the amount's still the same.
