1
00:00:02,838 --> 00:00:04,754
- [Voiceover] How you guys doing?

2
00:00:04,754 --> 00:00:06,171
- So .3.

3
00:00:08,543 --> 00:00:11,577
- Oh, what did you do by touching those?

4
00:00:11,577 --> 00:00:12,804
- It made a short circuit.

5
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:13,887
- It crossed.

6
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:19,082
- Wow, the orange is a
lot less than the kiwi and the apple.

7
00:00:19,082 --> 00:00:20,433
- Yeah.

8
00:00:20,433 --> 00:00:22,065
- It's only .3.

9
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:22,922
- Why do you think that is?

10
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:24,230
- .03.

11
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,730
- Maybe because...

12
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:30,384
- It's like different rods or something.

13
00:00:30,384 --> 00:00:33,441
- Oranges are more sour
than the other fruit.

14
00:00:33,441 --> 00:00:36,911
Not, and like have more acid or something.

15
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:39,0780
Because it stops the energy.

16
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:43,485
- We want it a half
centimeter apart right?
- Yeah.

17
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:44,818
Two centimeters.

18
00:00:46,586 --> 00:00:47,419
Around.

19
00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:50,296
- So okay, go ahead.

20
00:00:53,201 --> 00:00:55,784
Make sure they aren't touching.

21
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,999
- 0.1.

22
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:01,625
- It's not even measuring at all.

23
00:01:02,547 --> 00:01:04,631
Oh, 0.1.

24
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:05,981
0.01.

25
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:06,814
- Oh .01.

26
00:01:06,814 --> 00:01:07,647
- That's crazy.

27
00:01:07,647 --> 00:01:08,714
- I know.

28
00:01:08,714 --> 00:01:12,047
How this supposed to be one, the other two were so high?

29
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:16,341
- 0.98.

30
00:01:16,341 --> 00:01:19,483
- I never thought fruits and vegetables

31
00:01:19,483 --> 00:01:21,439
could have so much energy.

32
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,848
Except for oranges.

33
00:01:23,848 --> 00:01:27,041
I thought this would have
as much as the apple.

34
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:29,819
- My hypothesis, I actually thought that the
orange would have the most.

35
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:30,736
- Go ahead.

36
00:01:32,274 --> 00:01:35,941
Alright, Lizzy you can
do the voltage reader.

37
00:01:36,956 --> 00:01:39,412
Stick them in a half centimeter apart.

38
00:01:39,412 --> 00:01:41,079
And a centimeter in.

39
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:45,926
Okay, Lizzy make sure they don't touch.

40
00:01:47,293 --> 00:01:49,543
- Don't short circuit them.

41
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,552
- It's like completely zero.

42
00:01:55,552 --> 00:01:58,958
(children talking over each other)

43
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:01,775
- The bigger it is, the more volts it has.

44
00:02:01,775 --> 00:02:03,854
- The middle one, it left like a little here

45
00:02:03,854 --> 00:02:05,650
and this was the most.

46
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,528
- I think it's more
concentrating volts in the middle

47
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:09,121
more than anywhere else.

48
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:11,327
- Hmm, I wonder why that would be.

49
00:02:11,327 --> 00:02:14,827
- Okay, so now we have to get a calculator.

50
00:02:16,806 --> 00:02:19,056
Okay, so 0.22.

51
00:02:21,131 --> 00:02:23,131
Plus 0.09.

52
00:02:24,317 --> 00:02:26,067
- Plus 0.28.

53
00:02:29,866 --> 00:02:34,362
- I got 0.1966667.

54
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:37,299
- So what are you
gonna do with that number?

55
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:38,606
- Round it up.
- Okay.

56
00:02:38,606 --> 00:02:39,773
0.20.

57
00:02:40,765 --> 00:02:43,618
But wait, doesn't someone
else need to try it?

58
00:02:43,618 --> 00:02:46,868
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a good idea.

59
00:02:48,443 --> 00:02:50,488
0.22, plus--

60
00:02:50,488 --> 00:02:52,821
- 0., oh never mind.

61
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,364
- Divided by three.

62
00:02:58,364 --> 00:03:00,197
I got the same answer.

63
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:08,560
- So what was the answer to
the investigative question?

64
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,826
What do you think?

65
00:03:09,826 --> 00:03:10,659
- The...

66
00:03:14,521 --> 00:03:15,521
- The apple,

67
00:03:17,055 --> 00:03:18,138
had the most.

68
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:22,724
- Do you agree with that?

69
00:03:22,724 --> 00:03:23,866
- Yes.

70
00:03:23,866 --> 00:03:25,053
- Why do you think that is?

71
00:03:25,053 --> 00:03:26,197
Do you have any guesses?

72
00:03:26,197 --> 00:03:27,030
- It's...

73
00:03:29,453 --> 00:03:31,182
- It's bigger.

74
00:03:31,182 --> 00:03:33,627
It could carry more volts.

75
00:03:33,627 --> 00:03:34,893
- It has, yeah--

76
00:03:34,893 --> 00:03:36,809
- It has like more juice.

77
00:03:36,809 --> 00:03:38,606
- Yeah, that's true.

78
00:03:38,606 --> 00:03:40,523
- I think the juice.

79
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,763
- Was your hypothesis correct?

80
00:03:45,763 --> 00:03:46,030
- Actually,

81
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,363
it was.

82
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,103
Like right here, well.

83
00:03:54,113 --> 00:03:57,464
Well, actually I said the potatoes
will have the most voltage

84
00:03:57,464 --> 00:04:00,818
because like usually they,
potatoes for like cloth

85
00:04:00,818 --> 00:04:02,735
and other things to

86
00:04:06,898 --> 00:04:10,648
energize with, but I
guess apples would work better.

87
00:04:12,856 --> 00:04:14,084
- What was yours?

88
00:04:14,084 --> 00:04:16,820
- I thought the, I thought
the carrots would produce more

89
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,777
because you know,

90
00:04:18,777 --> 00:04:22,613
usually when you like eat
one it's like very wet,

91
00:04:22,613 --> 00:04:25,137
wet when you just get them,

92
00:04:25,137 --> 00:04:28,146
so I thought the carrot
was going to win, but guess not.

93
00:04:28,146 --> 00:04:29,900
- I thought it was the apple.

94
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,567
I already said that.

95
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,377
- My hypothesis, I thought,

96
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,603
I think the potato would have the most

97
00:04:40,603 --> 00:04:42,270
because I heard like,

98
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:47,506
I've heard that potatoes
could produce a lot of energy,

99
00:04:48,644 --> 00:04:50,477
and last year when

100
00:04:52,766 --> 00:04:54,438
when they were doing a science experiment

101
00:04:54,438 --> 00:04:55,986
they said that

102
00:04:55,986 --> 00:04:57,862
they had potatoes for like volts.

103
00:04:57,862 --> 00:05:00,557
So I suspected that they may have been,

104
00:05:00,557 --> 00:05:02,807
have a lot of voltage also.
- Okay.

105
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,225
- To our investigative question,

106
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:12,392
our question was which fruit
will produce the most energy?

107
00:05:13,412 --> 00:05:14,638
- And the...

108
00:05:14,638 --> 00:05:15,471
- Kiwi.

109
00:05:15,471 --> 00:05:17,882
- Kiwi and apple had tied for it.

110
00:05:17,882 --> 00:05:19,882
- 0.98.

111
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:22,452
- So I don't know, maybe like

112
00:05:22,452 --> 00:05:24,695
some other time we should
do another experiment

113
00:05:24,695 --> 00:05:26,165
and see if we get the same results.

114
00:05:26,165 --> 00:05:28,252
- I wonder why the
orange was so low though.

115
00:05:28,252 --> 00:05:29,835
- Maybe because we,

116
00:05:32,004 --> 00:05:35,473
since we put it too deep or something.

117
00:05:35,473 --> 00:05:37,603
- No, we did the same thing,

118
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,272
we put all of them.

119
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,439
- Yeah, I know.

120
00:05:43,195 --> 00:05:44,028
- Well.

121
00:05:44,028 --> 00:05:45,195
- So then our,

122
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,950
so our answer was that the kiwi and the

123
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,034
apple both had the highest.

124
00:05:51,034 --> 00:05:53,480
- So how about your hypothesis?

125
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,625
- I thought orange would have it.

126
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,054
I thought orange would have it.

127
00:05:58,054 --> 00:05:59,401
- I thought orange had it too.

128
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,746
- And had the highest.

129
00:06:00,746 --> 00:06:01,579
- Why?

130
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:03,246
- Because it had like...

131
00:06:04,335 --> 00:06:08,168
- I thought the apple
would because we didn't,

132
00:06:09,811 --> 00:06:14,383
I thought the apple was
because of how much bigger it was.

133
00:06:14,383 --> 00:06:16,748
- How about you Kirsten what did you think?

134
00:06:16,748 --> 00:06:20,713
- I thought the orange because
it has more citrus in it,

135
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,018
I mean yeah.

136
00:06:22,018 --> 00:06:25,527
- I would have thought kiwi
would have less because

137
00:06:25,527 --> 00:06:26,994
it's so small.

138
00:06:26,994 --> 00:06:27,827
- Yeah, me too.

139
00:06:27,827 --> 00:06:29,487
- That's what I thought.

140
00:06:29,487 --> 00:06:31,647
- Then what was our evidence?

141
00:06:31,647 --> 00:06:34,147
- Apple had for an average, had

142
00:06:35,651 --> 00:06:37,942
0.98.

143
00:06:37,942 --> 00:06:40,275
Orange had 0.16.

144
00:06:41,574 --> 00:06:43,124
And then kiwi had

145
00:06:43,124 --> 00:06:44,791
0.06.

146
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:47,290
0.16.

147
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,087
And then kiwi had

148
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,477
0.98.

149
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:53,054
So kiwi and apple tied.

150
00:06:53,054 --> 00:06:55,060
- And then our evidence is our data table

151
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,539
because that's where
we recorded everything.

152
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:58,682
- Yep.

153
00:06:58,682 --> 00:07:00,439
- So then how can you be sure

154
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:03,464
that you conducted a fair investigation?

155
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:06,797
- We did them the same length apart and...

156
00:07:08,234 --> 00:07:10,153
- So what are you guys trying
to figure out over here?

157
00:07:10,153 --> 00:07:11,497
- We're,

158
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:14,888
we're trying to figure out what

159
00:07:14,888 --> 00:07:18,602
if the apple, carrot or
potato has enough voltage

160
00:07:18,602 --> 00:07:20,769
to light the food battery.

161
00:07:22,827 --> 00:07:26,276
- What is the food
representing in this case?

162
00:07:26,276 --> 00:07:27,254
- A battery.
- Okay.

163
00:07:27,254 --> 00:07:28,567
- Yeah.

164
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:30,641
- Okay, how you gonna figure that out?

165
00:07:30,641 --> 00:07:32,036
What is your plan?

166
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:33,786
- We are gonna do,

167
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:38,237
gonna try to do a voltage reader

168
00:07:38,237 --> 00:07:39,487
and put,

169
00:07:40,563 --> 00:07:43,813
try to see how much voltage there is in

170
00:07:46,122 --> 00:07:48,455
an apple, potato or a carrot.

171
00:07:49,546 --> 00:07:51,945
- I think we should use the apple

172
00:07:51,945 --> 00:07:54,923
because in our investigation
it had the most voltage,

173
00:07:54,923 --> 00:07:56,310
well like the apple,

174
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,993
but should we do a parallel battery

175
00:07:59,993 --> 00:08:00,826
or the

176
00:08:02,724 --> 00:08:05,257
something that starts with an S battery?
- Series.

177
00:08:05,257 --> 00:08:08,113
- Series, let's do series.

178
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:09,053
- Let's try series.

179
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:11,011
- It lights up more.

180
00:08:11,011 --> 00:08:12,606
- Yeah, it's brighter.

181
00:08:12,606 --> 00:08:14,689
- Okay, let's get it done.

182
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,629
Oh wait, we're gonna need more.

183
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:21,712
- There's a wire in here.

184
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,777
- So I think that the
apple will like light up

185
00:08:34,777 --> 00:08:36,527
the battery brighter.

186
00:08:40,005 --> 00:08:42,088
Or at all because it has,

187
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:47,427
I think it's gonna have the most,

188
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:50,427
it has the most voltage and so it'll

189
00:08:52,487 --> 00:08:54,487
make it become brighter.

190
00:09:02,774 --> 00:09:04,040
- Which do you?

191
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,873
- Oh wait, we're doing
a series battery so...

192
00:09:09,218 --> 00:09:10,525
- Maybe we--

193
00:09:10,525 --> 00:09:11,872
- Where's the other apple?

194
00:09:11,872 --> 00:09:14,085
- It's over there, Reece has it.

195
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:16,239
- Need to wrap it around tight.

196
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:17,262
- Can I check?

197
00:09:17,262 --> 00:09:18,571
- Jayden, do you wanna do it?

198
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:19,715
- Sure.

199
00:09:19,715 --> 00:09:22,285
I'll have the honors.

200
00:09:22,285 --> 00:09:24,526
- Keep this one untouched

201
00:09:24,526 --> 00:09:26,078
because I'm gonna wrap
this wire against that

202
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:28,895
because it needs to, this negative.

203
00:09:28,895 --> 00:09:30,283
Just the white one.

204
00:09:30,283 --> 00:09:33,283
- Okay, there is no wire in this.

205
00:09:34,205 --> 00:09:36,038
- Okay, so--

206
00:09:36,038 --> 00:09:39,386
- I think we have enough wires here.

207
00:09:39,386 --> 00:09:41,301
- What do you need the wires for?

208
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:42,634
- To wrap around,

209
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:45,817
to make a series.

210
00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:51,024
- To allow the energy to flow through.

211
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:54,775
- Okay, so what's the purpose of the wires?

212
00:09:54,775 --> 00:09:57,754
- So that the energy will be able to flow.

213
00:09:57,754 --> 00:10:00,199
- What is the energy that's
going through the wires?

214
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,205
- Electricity.

215
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:04,758
- But okay, so what is the
function of the wires?

216
00:10:04,758 --> 00:10:08,008
- To like be able to pass from one spot

217
00:10:09,249 --> 00:10:11,867
to like, the battery to the light.

218
00:10:11,867 --> 00:10:13,947
- Okay, so you have two different wires.

219
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,624
Why is that?

220
00:10:15,624 --> 00:10:17,124
- To be able to...

221
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,128
- You know, why you have
two different wires?

222
00:10:25,128 --> 00:10:25,961
- Um,

223
00:10:28,275 --> 00:10:29,133
no.

224
00:10:29,133 --> 00:10:30,564
- No.

225
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:32,604
I'm gonna give you a
minute to think about it.

226
00:10:32,604 --> 00:10:33,437
- Okay.

227
00:10:35,837 --> 00:10:36,670
- Is it working?

228
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,503
- No, not yet.

229
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,759
Well, I don't think it's working.

230
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,146
- I think I didn't--

231
00:10:41,146 --> 00:10:42,396
- Oh, it's going.

232
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:45,721
- No, I don't think I 

233
00:10:45,721 --> 00:10:48,942
wrapped the wire around right.

234
00:10:48,942 --> 00:10:50,046
- Oh, yeah, because the--

235
00:10:50,046 --> 00:10:51,105
- This is really short.

236
00:10:51,105 --> 00:10:52,493
- So yeah, it was tucking it.

237
00:10:52,493 --> 00:10:54,821
- Let's see that and that and that.

238
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,102
Yeah, that thing's wrapped up tight.

239
00:10:57,102 --> 00:10:59,911
- Well, if the volts are enough.

240
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:01,950
- Don't the apples have to be touching?

241
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,705
- No, they don't have to be touching.

242
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:04,929
They just have to be,

243
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:07,872
the wires just have to
go from positive to negative.

244
00:11:07,872 --> 00:11:08,705
- Yeah.

245
00:11:08,705 --> 00:11:09,627
- True.

246
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,243
- But if they don't have enough voltage,

247
00:11:12,243 --> 00:11:13,754
we should use a potato.

248
00:11:13,754 --> 00:11:16,837
- Yeah, we can put the potato to help.

249
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,387
- Yeah, we need to put them in every fruit.

250
00:11:23,387 --> 00:11:25,912
And then connect the wires like

251
00:11:25,912 --> 00:11:28,935
that to that, that to that.

252
00:11:28,935 --> 00:11:30,653
- So, make sure they don't touch.

253
00:11:30,653 --> 00:11:34,070
- Yeah, so kinda wrap it around with the wire.

254
00:11:37,044 --> 00:11:40,950
Yeah, try to wrap it
around as tight as you can

255
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,867
so that...

256
00:11:53,387 --> 00:11:54,411
- Do you, what do you guys think,

257
00:11:54,411 --> 00:11:57,027
do you think that fruit
could power our school?

258
00:11:57,027 --> 00:11:59,317
- I don't think so.

259
00:11:59,317 --> 00:12:01,929
- It might power a small light bulb

260
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,035
like the ones that we use in here, but--

261
00:12:05,035 --> 00:12:06,338
- You don't think there's enough voltage

262
00:12:06,338 --> 00:12:08,096
to supply our whole school?

263
00:12:08,096 --> 00:12:09,200
- No.

264
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,365
- Well, like maybe if we put like

265
00:12:11,365 --> 00:12:13,528
a bunch of fruit on the roof or something.

266
00:12:13,528 --> 00:12:14,888
I don't know how that would turn out,

267
00:12:14,888 --> 00:12:17,136
but maybe if we put a whole bunch

268
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,748
and like stacked it on top.

269
00:12:19,748 --> 00:12:22,735
- Would you think that
would be economical?

270
00:12:22,735 --> 00:12:26,043
You think that would be
beneficial to us in any way?

271
00:12:26,043 --> 00:12:26,876
- Maybe.

272
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:28,209
- Why?

273
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:29,126
- It could,

274
00:12:29,992 --> 00:12:33,754
but we'd have to keep
changing out the fruit,

275
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,510
and changing out the fruit.

276
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,927
- It'd be lots more work that's for sure.

277
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:42,244
Don't let them touch.

278
00:12:42,244 --> 00:12:45,077
- That connects to that and that.

279
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:47,761
- Do we have another one?

280
00:12:47,761 --> 00:12:49,928
Because this one is broken.

281
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:57,708
- Can we borrow one from over here?
- Oh, we have one.

282
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,147
There you go.

283
00:13:03,406 --> 00:13:05,490
- What do you think is gonna happen?

284
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,157
- I think it'll like,

285
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:11,245
because we have none of the same touching.

286
00:13:11,245 --> 00:13:14,390
- First we should check the voltage.

287
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:18,557
- Well I don't, we'll just
see if it lights the light.

288
00:13:22,516 --> 00:13:23,985
- No, don't connect those.

289
00:13:23,985 --> 00:13:26,716
- Why would you wanna check the voltage?

290
00:13:26,716 --> 00:13:30,883
- Just to see if it has
enough potential of battery.

291
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,184
- Would make more electricity.

292
00:13:34,184 --> 00:13:35,245
All the averages.

293
00:13:35,245 --> 00:13:37,118
- I think it should be good this way.

294
00:13:37,118 --> 00:13:40,677
- Because we tested a battery
and saw how much it was.

295
00:13:40,677 --> 00:13:42,344
- Connect one to it.

296
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,625
Then connect yours Lizzy.

297
00:13:53,353 --> 00:13:55,359
- Maybe, did we do it wrong?

298
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:57,192
- No, I don't think so.

299
00:13:58,218 --> 00:14:00,016
- Well, I think that maybe it loses

300
00:14:00,016 --> 00:14:00,959
potential inside the fruit?

301
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,792
- Maybe it--

302
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:03,691
- Try an separate those
a little more Kirsten.

303
00:14:03,691 --> 00:14:06,441
- Maybe they're both plus and plus.

304
00:14:08,635 --> 00:14:12,802
- Maybe it's because we're
using three types of fruit.

305
00:14:13,648 --> 00:14:15,779
If we use just two.

306
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:19,278
What if we took the prongs out and replace

307
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:20,663
that with this?

308
00:14:20,663 --> 00:14:21,996
- Okay, try that.

309
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:26,702
- Put it in a different hole this time

310
00:14:26,702 --> 00:14:28,952
because we just changed it.

311
00:14:29,966 --> 00:14:30,799
- Well, don't--

312
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:32,211
- What are we trying to do here?

313
00:14:32,211 --> 00:14:34,538
- We were trying to make

314
00:14:34,538 --> 00:14:36,455
all these the same one.

315
00:14:37,682 --> 00:14:39,682
- Why would you do that?

316
00:14:40,662 --> 00:14:42,507
- Maybe because they need to be the same?

317
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:45,322
From the, both positive and negative.

318
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:46,261
- Oh.

319
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:49,178
- And we need to make sure so those

320
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:53,407
could be the plus and minus,
doesn't matter which way.

321
00:14:53,407 --> 00:14:55,366
And that and that needs to touch,

322
00:14:55,366 --> 00:14:59,533
and then that one and that one, which is
exactly what we did.

323
00:14:59,944 --> 00:15:00,777
But wait--
