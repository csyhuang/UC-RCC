1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,180
- Okay, I can see two

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,090
[inaudible]
in here...

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,540
- Can you read the article first, please?

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,280
- Yes.
- Loudly.

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,840
- The president of the republic should be
an Egyptian born to Egyptian parents and

6
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,770
enjoy salient political rights. His age
must not be less than 40 Gregorian years.

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,290
- Mm-hmm.

8
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:26,430
- I agree with the president, um...

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:26,900
- Mm-hmm.

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,690
- He should be Egyptian born to Egyptian
parents, because it will have, make him

11
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:38,680
have well-rounded perspectives, and it may
lead him to having interests to other

12
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,850
countries, and so...

13
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,140
- It would make him have interest, or will
not make him, prevent him?

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:52,000
- It would not prevent him to, um, from
getting to a different country's interest

15
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,150
than his country.

16
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,548
- Okay. Good job.

17
00:00:55,548 --> 00:01:02,320
- I agree with Yessenia, because if both,
if he's from parents that are Egyptians,

18
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:09,390
he can have some connection with
Egyptians, and he won't have pressure from

19
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:15,340
other countries that want to change some
of the rules they have. And, um, have,

20
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,470
like, wars with different countries about
their economy and things they have

21
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:21,360
different.
- Mm-hmm.

22
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,990
- That's what I, that's what my opinion,
yeah, that's why I agree with her.

23
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:25,620
- Good.

24
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:32,460
- I disagree with the part of the, where
it says that they should be Egyptian

25
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,440
parents.
- Mm-hmm.

26
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:40,200
- But I agree with Jesus and his concerns
about the Egyptian parents. But my opinion

27
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,030
is that they should have at least one
parent Egyptian and the other another race.

28
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,730
- Mm-hmm.

29
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:54,500
- Because if one parent's Egyptian, like,
the child, or the, becoming president,

30
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:01,800
would have a something of concerns, and
would know some parts of Egypt and its

31
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:09,610
government, and if the other, and this
other race would help him guarantee for

32
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:16,000
the governments in the other places and
countries, states.

33
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,000
- Okay. Good job.

34
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,760
- Which, the legislative process.
- Good job.

35
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:25,150
- I agree with Yessenia and Jesus, because
if they're from Egypt and their parents

36
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:31,160
are Egyptian, then they can have some
cultural background, and they'll know more

37
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,180
from people, and they'll have connections
with the people.

38
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,540
- Good. Good. So now, what is the result
now? Do you think you're going to change

39
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,810
the part? I see, I've heard some different
opinions here. Are you going with the

40
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,390
change, or do you want to keep it as it
is?

41
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:52,630
- I think we should keep it as it is,
because, I mean, that's a good thing to

42
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:57,770
have Egyptian parents and a background,
like Hilda said, a background of culture.

43
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,100
- Mm-hmm.

44
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,130
- So I'll say yes, leave it. Just leave it
the same.

45
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,130
- Okay.
- Just that part.

46
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:09,100
- Okay. Very good. So you will just leave
that part as it is without change. Is

47
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,910
there any other parts for this article?

48
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:19,030
- Yeah, there's a second part. His age
must not be less than 40 Gregorian years.

49
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,180
- Mm-hmm.

50
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:28,020
- Um, I disagree, because, um, when you're
young, you'll know more about technology

51
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,639
and computers and everything.
- Mm-hmm.

52
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:37,830
- And that's how, um... the youth and
younger children in Egypt, that's how they

53
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,460
went and communicate.

54
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:47,260
- I agree with Yessenia a lot, because
when a president is younger but not old,

55
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:54,460
he can connect with the youth and other
younger people. Because when Egypt was in

56
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:01,050
the revolution, the president was 81 years
old.

57
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:01,910
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

58
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:08,320
- Eighty-four. And behind the revolution
was the young, and they were, like,

59
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,670
younger. So he didn't really understand
them really well, and they didn't

60
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:19,702
understand him well, because he was a
little older than them. So for me, I'll

61
00:04:19,702 --> 00:04:29,260
say 35, um... yeah, that's a good age
for the president. They can connect with

62
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,410
teenagers and people of younger...

63
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,980
- I just...

64
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,570
- Very good. I like the connection that
you made, Jesus, between the age and the

65
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,780
people who were behind the revolution.
Good job.

66
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,000
- I disagree with Jessie and Jesus.
- Good. Yeah.

67
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:51,510
- Because I think that part of the
constitution is okay, because 40, um, 40

68
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:56,700
years is, makes them have plenty of
experience and

69
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:56,880
[inaudible]

70
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:02,220
to doing his, their work. And, like, it
makes them... like, for, like, what

71
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,640
Jesus said about technology, they can
learn about it, and they can show them and

72
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,890
all. So basically, they, they'll pretty
much know.

73
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,750
- Who do you mean by they?

74
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,320
- The becoming president.

75
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,800
- That the old, or the young?

76
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,610
- The old.

77
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:22,310
- The older one. He cannot understand or
work with technology that much?

78
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:28,649
- Yeah. Because Jesus said that they, um,
they won't know about technology much.

79
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:29,113
- Mm-hmm.

80
00:05:29,113 --> 00:05:32,730
- But they, if they're 40, they would have
plenty of experience.

81
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:33,410
- Mm-hmm.

82
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:38,360
- And they can learn about the technology
and know how to communicate with the

83
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,990
younger adults and teens, you know?

84
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:43,810
- Okay. Good, good.

85
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:49,990
- I agree with Emi, but I agree with Jesus
and Yessenia, so...

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,500
- Mm-hm. That's okay.
- Um, because...

87
00:05:52,536 --> 00:05:53,349
- Focus on what you want to do.

88
00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:56,780
- Like, youth was, like, 70 or 80% of
Egypt.

89
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,000
- Oh, good.

90
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,160
- But if he's older, he's going to have
more responsibilities.

91
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:02,860
- Mm-hmm.

92
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,820
- And he can be more responsible.

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,130
- Mm-hm.
- So...

94
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:13,820
- I disagree with Hilda. Responsibility.
Because when they're younger, they're more

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,090
active and more responsible. Like, they
can remember most things where they keep

96
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:27,040
stuff. And when they're active, they can,
like, travel through Egypt and see what's

97
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:32,090
wrong with the country, and what's wrong
with the economy, and they can make

98
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:36,670
changes and talk to some people about
their opinions and things they want to

99
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:42,560
change the country. So I'll say the
younger, but not too young. Like, 35 and up.

100
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,691
- Thank you.

101
00:06:44,691 --> 00:06:52,040
- My opinion is that 40 is okay, because
the young, the young people, like, at 35,

102
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:57,650
because 35's not that young, but lower
than that, can make a little bit of

103
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:03,180
difficulties, because they make, they
might make, like, a mistake. They might

104
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,950
not know a thing, and they just put
another thing.

105
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,510
- You mean they will not be mature enough?

106
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,910
- Yeah, mature.
- Sure. Good.

107
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:15,810
- Like, the 40s, the 40-year-old people,
like, they, they pretty much know

108
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:19,850
everything. They learn it, they were
educated. The government laws, and...

109
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,220
- Mm-hmm.
- ...this and that.

110
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,750
- Mm-hmm.

111
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,340
- But I think that part is, 40 years is
better.

112
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:34,760
- Good. So you would like to say, okay,
just to open or, or, or break it down to

113
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:43,210
35, it's okay to be less than 35, but not
so young like 30 or 20, or even teenager,

114
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:48,950
right? Well, I like that, the two parts
that you brought, Hilda, about 70%, that

115
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:55,430
the majority of the population of Egypt
are already youth. And your part that you

116
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:00,850
said that this will make, Jesus, that that
will make, help them to have good

117
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,140
connection with the young people there.
Good job.

118
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,780
So what did you decide on? I see that
you're going with certain direction.

119
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,859
- We should change it. The first part of
the statement of Art. 75.

120
00:08:14,859 --> 00:08:15,555
- Mm-hmm.

121
00:08:15,555 --> 00:08:20,280
- Which is the constitution. We should
keep that as it is. And the second part of

122
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,070
the 40 years, we should change it. Well,
we should leave it like that, as well.

123
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:30,500
- Very good. I like how you are
compromising with them, Emi, and you are

124
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,080
going with the change. So what part are
you going to change?

125
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:34,800
- Um...

126
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,740
- It will be transforming to what?

127
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,910
- Thirty-five.
- Mm-hmm.

128
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,140
- Thirty-five years.
- Not less than 35.

129
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,380
- Not less.

130
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:48,360
- Good job. Excellent. Very good. After
you take your notes, let's move to the

131
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,010
next article.

132
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:58,250
- Article 77. The term of the presidency
shall be Gregorian, six Gregorian years,

133
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,190
starting from the date of the announcement
of the results of the

134
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:01,600
[inaudible].

135
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,719
- Mm-hmm.

136
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:09,471
- The president of the republic may be
re-elected for other successful years.

137
00:09:09,471 --> 00:09:11,140
- Mm-hmm.

138
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,006
- I disagree with the six years. Um...

139
00:09:16,006 --> 00:09:18,142
- Yes. Mm-hmm. Yes. Keep going.

140
00:09:18,142 --> 00:09:24,220
- Because I think it's a little longer,
and some advantages are that people could

141
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:31,240
get tired of the same president, um,
having them over again. And I think it

142
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:37,250
should be lower, for four years, like in
America. And some of the disadvantages are

143
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:45,660
that people could like him, and he might
be re-elected for another six more years.

144
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:51,470
Um, people could elect him because he did
some great things to the economy and

145
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:56,490
things to the country. And that's what I
think of for the first one. What do you

146
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,420
all think about it?

147
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,150
- You think the first one should be as it
is, or changed?

148
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,990
- Changed to four years.

149
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,843
- Changed to four years.
- Yeah.

150
00:10:03,843 --> 00:10:04,981
- Okay.
- What do you think?

151
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:12,290
- I agree. I agree with Jesus, because an
example of this is Hosni Mubarak. He, he,

152
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:18,950
um, was following, supposedly, the terms
of the constitution, which, which he made

153
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:27,790
an excuse and took many chances in, um,
having the presidency. So I, for, like, 30

154
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:33,130
years. So I, my opinion is to lower it
down to four years, and if they're

155
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:36,720
re-elected, which, they can use democracy
like here in America.

156
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,010
- Mm-hmm.

157
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:43,021
- If they're re-elected, they will have at
least 12 years. Basically.

158
00:10:43,021 --> 00:10:44,108
- Okay.

159
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,830
- Do you disagree?

160
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:52,471
- Um, the statement, I agree, because it
will give them more stability and more

161
00:10:52,471 --> 00:10:54,886
time to elect.
- Mm-hmm.

162
00:10:54,886 --> 00:10:58,310
- I agree with Jesus and Emi.

163
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,610
- Why do you agree with them?

164
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:04,390
- Because six years is a lot of years, and
if they don't like him, they'll have to

165
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:09,911
wait a lot, a long time so that another
president can come into power.

166
00:11:09,911 --> 00:11:15,920
- Okay. So you think bringing it down to
four years is better than having the

167
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,370
president for one term for six years?

168
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,720
- Yes.
- Okay.

169
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:25,610
- The second one is the president of the
republic may be elected for another

170
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:29,610
successful years. The thing I dislike
about this is that they don't really

171
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:38,240
explain how, um, the terms. For example,
the president of Egypt, um, used an excuse

172
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:44,720
to be re-elected, because, um, he said
that in the constitution, it said, it

173
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:52,740
didn't say specifically how much, how many
terms, um, they lead. So I'll, I'll change

174
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:59,880
that, that, um, leave specifically a
number of terms they need to be elected.

175
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:00,910
Um...

176
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:05,130
- Very good point, Luis. I didn't... um,
Jesus, I'm sorry. Very good point here.

177
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:10,370
You brought really a very important point.
And this is what will, this was, like, the

178
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:15,310
concern of many people over there. The
specification of, of what?

179
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,640
- Successful terms.

180
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,954
- Of the, how many terms, very good.
Successive terms. Very good.

181
00:12:20,954 --> 00:12:23,067
- Does anybody have an opinion or
disagreement?

182
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:25,040
- Uh, I...
- I agree with...

183
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:31,400
- Okay. I agree with, um, you, because
that's what Hosni Mubarak was really, he

184
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:37,160
was making excuse to, like, stay, um, him
how, like, it is, to keep him as a

185
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:42,330
president and re-elect him over and over,
to, um... and he was telling them that

186
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,820
he was following the constitution, because
their theory said there was, like, no

187
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,790
number of
[inaudible].

188
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,760
- Yeah, so he...

189
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:56,120
- I agree also, because, like you said,
the example of Hosni Mubarak was the

190
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:03,730
serious, serious excuse. They, um, the
people were basically mad at them that,

191
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:10,270
um, certain term, because they didn't give
a number of the terms, so, um, that's why

192
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:14,290
Hosni Mubarak made that excuse and wanted
to take over.

193
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:20,670
- Very good. When, the point of staying
too many years in power or in office, that

194
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:25,090
brings to me something that's going on in
other two countries. You remember any of

195
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:31,410
the other countries in the Middle East,
and Africa, that has something going on

196
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,670
there? Because of this specific part?

197
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:35,000
- Libya and Yemen.

198
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,170
- What's going on in Libya now?

199
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:41,854
- They're protesting against, um, Gaddafi?

200
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:46,400
- Very good, yes. Good job. I like how you
remembered his name. Why? Why they are

201
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,630
protesting against him?

202
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:53,299
- Because he'd been in power for, like,
about 43 years.

203
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:58,490
- Good job. Mm-hmm. Okay, what else is
going on in another country? Or what

204
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,910
country is having something going on?

205
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,200
- Yemen.
- Yemen.

206
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,120
- Yemen.

207
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,770
- Very good. Okay. Well, this brings us to
go back again a little further, something

208
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:13,570
about different types of governments.
Remember, Egypt was a republic, okay? When

209
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:19,710
their, the president stayed there for so
many years, that will not be a republic

210
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,000
country. That will be what?

211
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,000
- A dictatorship.

212
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:27,550
- A dictatorship. Very good. That will be
a dictatorship. So the, the, the type of

213
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:33,150
government is, if government is not a, the
republic, or maybe democracy, as they say

214
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:37,190
or claim, but it will be... it will be?

215
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,530
- A dicta--

216
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:42,910
- A dictatorship. Very good. And the
people in power, the people in the office,

217
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:49,180
government office, will be what?
Dictators. Okay? It's because they do what

218
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,320
they want to do, and they don't listen to
other people. Okay, and what is another

219
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,263
name for dictatorship, or very close to
it?
