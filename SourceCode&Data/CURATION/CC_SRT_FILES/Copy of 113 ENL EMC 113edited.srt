1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,764
- Okay guys, yesterday we talked about

2
00:00:02,764 --> 00:00:06,027
three key vocabulary
words that we mentioned,

3
00:00:06,027 --> 00:00:09,028
we studied, we found definitions for.

4
00:00:09,828 --> 00:00:13,957
Those words were adaptation,
there's habitat and community.

5
00:00:13,957 --> 00:00:17,089
Okay, adaptation is the first word.

6
00:00:17,089 --> 00:00:19,104
Who can tell me something
about adaptation?

7
00:00:19,104 --> 00:00:19,886
Karina.

8
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:24,288
- Adaptation is how animals
act, like the howler monkeys,

9
00:00:24,288 --> 00:00:28,126
they howl so they can tell other monkeys

10
00:00:28,126 --> 00:00:33,331
that they are in danger,
so they can survive

11
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:35,026
- Okay, so they can survive, right?

12
00:00:35,026 --> 00:00:37,071
Adaptation helps them survive.

13
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:38,382
And then, habitat.

14
00:00:38,382 --> 00:00:40,124
Who can tell me what habitat is?

15
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:40,871
Ernesto.

16
00:00:40,871 --> 00:00:42,061
- Where you live.

17
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:44,337
- Okay it's the environment
where they live.

18
00:00:44,337 --> 00:00:46,125
It's the surroundings, okay?

19
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:48,761
It's the trees, it's the
plants, it's the ground,

20
00:00:48,761 --> 00:00:50,421
and it's the climate that they live in.

21
00:00:50,421 --> 00:00:53,474
And, the last one is community.

22
00:00:53,474 --> 00:00:55,786
Okay, so, if we're
thinking about animals,

23
00:00:55,786 --> 00:00:59,917
what makes up a community
for these animals?

24
00:00:59,917 --> 00:01:01,017
Who can tell me?

25
00:01:01,017 --> 00:01:01,936
Sergio.

26
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:07,309
- The community

27
00:01:07,309 --> 00:01:09,100
- What makes up a community?

28
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,241
It's not the environment

29
00:01:10,241 --> 00:01:11,181
- The animals?

30
00:01:11,181 --> 00:01:11,999
- It's all the animals.

31
00:01:11,999 --> 00:01:14,589
Do we have just one animal in the community?

32
00:01:14,589 --> 00:01:15,457
(collective no)

33
00:01:15,457 --> 00:01:16,835
- We have many, we have many.

34
00:01:16,835 --> 00:01:20,538
It could be very many.

35
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:22,164
Okay, we're going to on,

36
00:01:22,164 --> 00:01:24,243
and I'd like you to listen to this sound.

37
00:01:24,243 --> 00:01:25,473
Shhhh.

38
00:01:25,473 --> 00:01:27,511
Just listen to this sound.

39
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:34,624
(owl hooting)

40
00:01:34,624 --> 00:01:37,871
Okay, you may have, and you
can hear this sound at night.

41
00:01:37,871 --> 00:01:40,134
Okay, what I'd like you yo do right now

42
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:45,671
is tell me one thing that you
know about this animal, okay.

43
00:01:45,671 --> 00:01:46,913
If you know the name of this animal,

44
00:01:46,913 --> 00:01:48,213
go ahead and write that down too.

45
00:01:48,213 --> 00:01:49,967
First of all. let's just
write it in our "K".

46
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:51,407
Just put it under for "K".

47
00:01:51,407 --> 00:01:54,790
What do you know about that animal?

48
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,752
Just write it down first,
then we'll talk about it.

49
00:01:56,752 --> 00:01:58,632
I'd like you to discuss
what you know also.

50
00:01:58,632 --> 00:02:02,343
Talk to a neighbor.

51
00:02:02,343 --> 00:02:03,444
Okay, this is what you know,

52
00:02:03,444 --> 00:02:05,313
so you are going to be looking at that.

53
00:02:05,313 --> 00:02:07,064
What is something you
know about that animal?

54
00:02:07,064 --> 00:02:07,945
Okay?

55
00:02:07,945 --> 00:02:09,980
Tell your neighbor "What do
you know about this animal?"

56
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,460
Just tell a neighbor.

57
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,858
(background chatter)

58
00:02:15,858 --> 00:02:18,508
- Tell a neighbor what you know.

59
00:02:18,508 --> 00:02:33,452
(background chatter)

60
00:02:33,452 --> 00:02:37,213
- Tell your neighbor,
Eddie, what you know.

61
00:02:37,213 --> 00:02:38,731
What do you know?

62
00:02:38,731 --> 00:02:40,917
You can talk out loud, guys.

63
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:42,767
(background chatter)

64
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:44,727
Okay, small ears, okay.

65
00:02:44,727 --> 00:02:46,131
All right, so write that down.

66
00:02:46,131 --> 00:02:49,262
Okay, now after that go
to what you want to know.

67
00:02:49,262 --> 00:02:50,343
Go to the "W".

68
00:02:50,343 --> 00:02:53,059
What do you want to
know about this animal?

69
00:02:53,059 --> 00:02:55,157
By the way, what animal is this?

70
00:02:55,157 --> 00:02:55,957
- An owl.

71
00:02:55,957 --> 00:02:56,554
- It's an owl.

72
00:02:56,554 --> 00:02:59,284
It's a Great Horned Owl, okay.

73
00:02:59,284 --> 00:03:00,469
Now, what I'd like you to do,

74
00:03:00,469 --> 00:03:03,803
you want to put this information.

75
00:03:03,803 --> 00:03:05,658
Yea, what do you want to know.

76
00:03:05,658 --> 00:03:08,393
So, write one thing about
what you want to know.

77
00:03:08,393 --> 00:03:10,076
What do you want to know?

78
00:03:10,076 --> 00:03:14,072
Tell a neighbor, "What
do you want to know?"

79
00:03:14,072 --> 00:03:15,894
Sergio.

80
00:03:15,894 --> 00:03:20,898
(background chatter)

81
00:03:20,898 --> 00:03:23,556
You don't have to whisper, you can say it.

82
00:03:23,556 --> 00:03:42,180
(background chatter)

83
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,295
How old an owl can live?

84
00:03:44,295 --> 00:03:47,165
Okay, good. Good, okay.

85
00:03:47,165 --> 00:03:48,468
Now, one thing I want you to think about.

86
00:03:48,468 --> 00:03:51,093
Let's listen to this sound again, okay?

87
00:03:51,093 --> 00:03:52,701
Listen to the sound again.

88
00:03:52,701 --> 00:03:55,839
(owl hooting)

89
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:57,220
Any predictions, and you can just tell me,

90
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,741
without writing them down.

91
00:03:58,741 --> 00:04:00,468
What do you think that--

92
00:04:00,468 --> 00:04:02,664
Why does the owl make
the sound that it makes?

93
00:04:02,664 --> 00:04:03,280
Yea

94
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,811
- Maybe to warn other owls.

95
00:04:05,811 --> 00:04:07,099
- Warn other owls?

96
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:08,409
Anything else?

97
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:08,910
Yea, Ernesto.

98
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,060
- To communicate.

99
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,313
- And to communicate, that's right.

100
00:04:11,313 --> 00:04:13,566
Okay, let's take a look
a page twenty-three.

101
00:04:13,566 --> 00:04:18,674
Okay, we're going to look at
text structure on page 23.

102
00:04:18,674 --> 00:04:20,126
This is the Great Horned Owl.

103
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:24,141
And, I'd like everyone to
put your finger on the title

104
00:04:24,141 --> 00:04:26,521
for this animal, the Great Horned Owl.

105
00:04:26,521 --> 00:04:29,029
Just put your finger so I know
you know what the title is.

106
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:32,568
Next, I'd like you to put
your finger on the caption.

107
00:04:32,568 --> 00:04:35,471
Okay, and can I have one
person read the caption?

108
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:36,969
Let's have Karina read the caption.

109
00:04:36,969 --> 00:04:39,732
- Owls have large eyes to
help them see in the dark.

110
00:04:39,732 --> 00:04:41,253
- Okay, very good.

111
00:04:41,253 --> 00:04:44,225
Then we have, underneath the
title of the Great Horned Owl,

112
00:04:44,225 --> 00:04:45,966
We have what I call bullet points.

113
00:04:45,966 --> 00:04:47,742
We talked a little bit about them.

114
00:04:47,742 --> 00:04:50,110
And, put your fingers on
the bullet points there.

115
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,270
And, let's have Ernesto
read those bullet points.

116
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:57,539
- Bird found in North,
Central, and South America.

117
00:04:57,539 --> 00:05:01,562
Live in the canopy and understory.

118
00:05:01,562 --> 00:05:02,579
- Understory, very good.

119
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:04,389
And we live in what continent?

120
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:06,584
Eddie, what continent do we live in?

121
00:05:06,584 --> 00:05:08,069
- North America.

122
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:08,987
- North America.

123
00:05:08,987 --> 00:05:10,446
So, we'll find these,

124
00:05:10,446 --> 00:05:13,247
and actually I will usually
hear these at night.

125
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:17,179
And usually hear them kind
of in the winter time.

126
00:05:17,179 --> 00:05:18,763
All right, let's have the first paragraph.

127
00:05:18,763 --> 00:05:20,085
Eddie, why don't you continue?

128
00:05:20,085 --> 00:05:25,647
- The Great Horned Owl has
no ears, but can hear anyway.

129
00:05:25,647 --> 00:05:31,218
It can also see very good,
even on the darkest night.

130
00:05:31,218 --> 00:05:35,325
- Okay, and the second paragraph, Makayla.

131
00:05:35,325 --> 00:05:39,518
- An owl hunts for food at
night from high in the air.

132
00:05:39,518 --> 00:05:43,479
When it hears a mouse move or squeak,

133
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:46,621
the owl swoops down upon it.

134
00:05:46,621 --> 00:05:49,201
- Swoops, okay very good.

135
00:05:49,201 --> 00:05:51,675
Okay, now we've read
about the Great Horned Owl.

136
00:05:51,675 --> 00:05:52,939
I'd like you to tell your neighbor,

137
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:55,400
one thing that you learned
new about this owl,

138
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,249
that you are going to
put down under the "L".

139
00:05:58,249 --> 00:06:01,181
What is one thing that
you learned about the owl?

140
00:06:01,181 --> 00:06:18,061
(background chatter)

141
00:06:18,061 --> 00:06:20,476
Okay, so write something down

142
00:06:20,476 --> 00:06:25,918
that you've talked about with
your partner or your neighbor.

143
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:28,078
Now we're going to continue
working in partners here

144
00:06:28,078 --> 00:06:32,050
and I'm going to give you
something to take a look at.

145
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,558
And I'm going to have you guys,

146
00:06:33,558 --> 00:06:36,798
just close your books for a second.

147
00:06:36,798 --> 00:06:38,713
After you're done
writing, close your books.

148
00:06:38,713 --> 00:06:41,789
Okay, I'm going to give each
pair or each little group

149
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:43,912
one of these sticks.

150
00:06:43,912 --> 00:06:45,510
I want you to look at the stick carfeully

151
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,616
and look how an animal might have

152
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:51,419
changed or interacted
with the stick, okay?

153
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:53,954
So take a close look at it, all right?

154
00:06:53,954 --> 00:06:56,729
And, take a look at it,

155
00:06:56,729 --> 00:06:58,273
and then I'd like you to put down

156
00:06:58,273 --> 00:07:02,321
what you know about that stick, okay?

157
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,353
There are, yes you can
see that some insects have

158
00:07:04,353 --> 00:07:06,422
interacted with the stick also.

159
00:07:06,422 --> 00:07:08,189
But what is something,

160
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:10,753
look at the ends of the stick,

161
00:07:10,753 --> 00:07:12,774
and let's put down something we know

162
00:07:12,774 --> 00:07:18,031
about what an animal might
have done to this stick.

163
00:07:18,031 --> 00:07:21,054
Okay, just write it down
or tell your neighbor.

164
00:07:21,054 --> 00:07:22,432
Tell your neighbor.

165
00:07:22,432 --> 00:07:37,415
(background chatter)

166
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:43,144
Yeah, he bit the stick on here.

167
00:07:43,144 --> 00:07:45,024
But did he actually cut it?

168
00:07:45,024 --> 00:07:46,638
Was he able to bite it?

169
00:07:46,638 --> 00:07:47,481
- Yes

170
00:07:47,481 --> 00:07:48,759
Yeah he was, he was.

171
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,981
Okay, all right, now who can tell me

172
00:07:50,981 --> 00:07:52,638
what animal this might be?

173
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,457
Karina.

174
00:07:53,457 --> 00:07:54,183
- A beaver.

175
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:57,074
- It is a beaver and you
will find these in this area.

176
00:07:57,074 --> 00:07:58,642
What I would like you to put down next is

177
00:07:58,642 --> 00:08:01,196
what you want to know about the beaver.

178
00:08:01,196 --> 00:08:03,274
So, let's write that down.

179
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,897
Just skip this and go right
to "What do you want to know?"

180
00:08:05,897 --> 00:08:07,814
Tell your neighbor.

181
00:08:07,814 --> 00:08:08,929
Go ahead and tell your neighbor about it.

182
00:08:08,929 --> 00:08:12,421
What do you want to know?

183
00:08:12,421 --> 00:08:17,704
(background chatter)

184
00:08:17,704 --> 00:08:19,077
Okay, tell your neighbor, guys, too

185
00:08:19,077 --> 00:08:23,369
once you have written it down.

186
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,830
(background chatter)

187
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,105
- How old can a beaver live?

188
00:08:28,105 --> 00:08:30,070
- Okay, how old can a beaver live?

189
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,907
That's good.

190
00:08:30,907 --> 00:08:31,528
Yea, Keelie.

191
00:08:31,528 --> 00:08:34,301
- What I want to know how about

192
00:08:34,301 --> 00:08:35,734
are they electric.

193
00:08:35,734 --> 00:08:36,415
- Okay.

194
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:39,107
(background chatter)

195
00:08:39,107 --> 00:08:40,821
Okay, I want to know

196
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:43,026
how long they are in their house, maybe.

197
00:08:43,026 --> 00:08:44,452
Yes.

198
00:08:44,452 --> 00:08:49,206
- I want to know how big can they be.

199
00:08:49,206 --> 00:08:50,267
- Okay good

200
00:08:50,267 --> 00:08:52,263
- I have hair on here.

201
00:08:52,263 --> 00:08:53,623
- It's possible.

202
00:08:53,623 --> 00:08:54,865
Actually, yeah that is very possible,

203
00:08:54,865 --> 00:08:56,606
you have hair of a beaver

204
00:08:56,606 --> 00:08:59,507
I would actually, I'm
going to hang onto that.

205
00:08:59,507 --> 00:09:01,784
And actually let's put
that in the garbage.

206
00:09:01,784 --> 00:09:03,084
But, that's good.

207
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,965
- It's right here.

208
00:09:04,965 --> 00:09:06,021
(laughter)

209
00:09:06,021 --> 00:09:06,932
- Okay i'll take it.

210
00:09:06,932 --> 00:09:07,932
Okay.

211
00:09:07,932 --> 00:09:11,027
Yea, you're going to find that probably,

212
00:09:11,027 --> 00:09:12,287
we're not going to look
at the sticks too much.

213
00:09:12,287 --> 00:09:14,495
We need to find insects
still living in the stick,

214
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,867
but we're going to leave
that for right now.

215
00:09:15,867 --> 00:09:17,758
I'd like you to take
a look at page twenty.

216
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:20,381
Take a look at page twenty.

217
00:09:20,381 --> 00:09:23,003
I do recommend that if
you ever by chance go to

218
00:09:23,003 --> 00:09:24,398
Deerbro, there's a forest
near the school here.

219
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:25,547
Your parents can take you.

220
00:09:25,547 --> 00:09:28,078
You might actually see a beaver house.

221
00:09:28,078 --> 00:09:30,539
Okay, let's find out some more information

222
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:32,896
about beaver on page twenty.

223
00:09:32,896 --> 00:09:34,509
Put your fingers on the title.

224
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:38,189
Put your fingers on the title.

225
00:09:38,189 --> 00:09:39,919
You know what, I'll take that.

226
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,319
Here we go.

227
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:42,677
And you know what, let me recollect these,

228
00:09:42,677 --> 00:09:43,896
because we have.

229
00:09:43,896 --> 00:09:45,115
Let me collect those back.

230
00:09:45,115 --> 00:09:46,380
Thank you.

231
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,207
There we go.

232
00:09:49,207 --> 00:09:53,371
Okay, put your fingers on
the beaver, the title, okay?

233
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:56,037
Can I have one person
read the bullet again?

234
00:09:56,037 --> 00:09:58,617
Bullet marks.

235
00:09:58,617 --> 00:10:00,007
Sergio, go ahead.

236
00:10:00,007 --> 00:10:03,356
- Mammal found in North
America, Europe, and Asia

237
00:10:03,356 --> 00:10:07,173
Lives in rivers and streams
near the forest floor.

238
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:10,927
- okay, and can you name another mammal?

239
00:10:10,927 --> 00:10:12,268
If you happen to know
what the mammal might be.

240
00:10:12,268 --> 00:10:13,958
Can you name another mammal?

241
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:14,480
- Whale.

242
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,891
- A whale is a mammal,
and we are also mammals

243
00:10:16,891 --> 00:10:18,672
Okay, the next paragraph I'd like to have

244
00:10:18,672 --> 00:10:20,451
one person read that paragraph.

245
00:10:20,451 --> 00:10:22,134
Karina.

246
00:10:22,134 --> 00:10:25,367
- Beavers eat bark,
twigs, leaves and roots.

247
00:10:25,367 --> 00:10:28,665
They have wide flat tails.

248
00:10:28,665 --> 00:10:32,890
These tails help beavers
to clear a placement,

249
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:37,113
Beavers use their split
claws to comb their own fur.

250
00:10:37,113 --> 00:10:41,260
They also use their claws to
spread oil onto their fur.

251
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:45,176
This oil helps keep
them warm in the water.

252
00:10:45,176 --> 00:10:47,009
- Okay, before we go on,

253
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:49,747
as we're going to be
looking at a lot of things,

254
00:10:49,747 --> 00:10:51,170
think about what it is you're learning.

255
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,620
What's something new that you're
learning about this beaver?

256
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,861
Now, before we go on,

257
00:10:54,861 --> 00:10:57,940
everybody put your finger on the caption.

258
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,524
Okay, caption.

259
00:10:58,524 --> 00:10:59,946
Makayla, what does the caption say?

260
00:10:59,946 --> 00:11:03,323
- A beaver's fur keeps
it warm in the snow.

261
00:11:03,323 --> 00:11:04,184
- All right, very good.

262
00:11:04,184 --> 00:11:06,412
So, let's take one more thing.

263
00:11:06,412 --> 00:11:08,490
We're going to take a look at
a diagram on page seventeen.

264
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:11,267
So, now let's go to page seventeen.

265
00:11:11,267 --> 00:11:14,161
And this talks a little
bit more about a beaver.

266
00:11:14,161 --> 00:11:17,449
And the title, let's put our
finger on the title of page 17.

267
00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:20,415
What does the title say?

268
00:11:20,415 --> 00:11:21,121
Keelie

269
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:22,445
- Graph Section Diagram

270
00:11:22,445 --> 00:11:25,649
- Okay, we're looking
at page 17 right here.

271
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:28,289
Put your finger on the top of the diagram,

272
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:29,561
And that's the title.

273
00:11:29,561 --> 00:11:30,722
What does it say Keelie?

274
00:11:30,722 --> 00:11:31,627
- Beaver lodge.

275
00:11:31,627 --> 00:11:33,310
- Okay what is, we know
a beaver is the animal,

276
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,322
What's a lodge Keelie?

277
00:11:34,322 --> 00:11:36,630
- Their house, where they live.

278
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,105
- Yea, it's like their house.

279
00:11:38,105 --> 00:11:40,103
Okay, next there's a caption

280
00:11:40,103 --> 00:11:42,865
built into the diagram and it's green.

281
00:11:42,865 --> 00:11:45,384
Let's have Sergio read the caption there.

282
00:11:45,384 --> 00:11:49,923
- This beaver lodge was
built on a shallow part

283
00:11:49,923 --> 00:11:51,991
of the wood floor.

284
00:11:51,991 --> 00:11:56,763
If it wouldn't float, the
lodge will have to be rebuilt.

285
00:11:56,763 --> 00:11:58,505
- Okay, very good.

286
00:11:58,505 --> 00:11:59,640
Let's get some more information.

287
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,624
There's some other things in the diagram

288
00:12:02,624 --> 00:12:05,198
to give us information, Makayla.

289
00:12:05,198 --> 00:12:10,790
- Some lodges are two meters, 6.5' high.

290
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,125
- Okay, very good.

291
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:15,059
And, Keelie.

292
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:18,403
- The lodge is made from logs and sticks.

293
00:12:18,403 --> 00:12:20,857
- Okay, and Eddie, the last one.

294
00:12:20,857 --> 00:12:26,732
- Beavers come in and out under the water.

295
00:12:26,732 --> 00:12:28,687
- Okay, so this is where they live.

296
00:12:28,687 --> 00:12:31,111
This is how they live,
and why do you think

297
00:12:31,111 --> 00:12:32,912
they build their house this way?

298
00:12:32,912 --> 00:12:33,770
Anybody?

299
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,326
What do you think they do?

300
00:12:35,326 --> 00:12:37,602
Why do they build it this way?

301
00:12:37,602 --> 00:12:38,402
Karina.

302
00:12:38,402 --> 00:12:42,825
- Because when they, when people come,

303
00:12:42,825 --> 00:12:46,366
like hunters, if they want to catch them

304
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:49,641
It is going to be difficult for them.

305
00:12:49,641 --> 00:12:51,171
- Okay, like predators?

306
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:52,206
Other predatory animals?

307
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:52,486
- Yeah.

308
00:12:52,486 --> 00:12:54,281
So this is a way they adapt.

309
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:57,161
So, how do they adapt to
survive in their environment?

310
00:12:57,161 --> 00:12:58,181
Makayla.

311
00:12:58,181 --> 00:13:00,963
- To enter from the underground water.

312
00:13:00,963 --> 00:13:05,110
- Okay, can you use adapt
or adaptation in a sentence?

313
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,979
Beavers...

314
00:13:06,979 --> 00:13:12,969
- Beavers adapt to

315
00:13:12,969 --> 00:13:16,205
- Beavers adapt how?

316
00:13:16,205 --> 00:13:17,261
Yea, Karina.

317
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:22,584
- Beavers adapt by entering from a
little hole under the water.

318
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:24,122
- Okay, so they adapt in that way,

319
00:13:24,122 --> 00:13:26,887
other predators can't
see when they're coming.

320
00:13:26,887 --> 00:13:28,987
And as we saw on the sticks, the sticks,

321
00:13:28,987 --> 00:13:31,262
they just pile these sticks up on here

322
00:13:31,262 --> 00:13:33,642
and they move them around
until they make something

323
00:13:33,642 --> 00:13:36,490
that looks like this, okay?

324
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:40,077
So, what kind of a habitat
do the beavers live in again?

325
00:13:40,077 --> 00:13:41,803
Using the word habitat,
I'd like you to tell me.

326
00:13:41,803 --> 00:13:44,101
What's the habitat of a beaver?

327
00:13:44,101 --> 00:13:45,728
- They live in lodges.

328
00:13:45,728 --> 00:13:47,341
- They live in lodges.

329
00:13:47,341 --> 00:13:51,170
Okay, what's around their lodge?

330
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,097
Yeah, Karina.

331
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:53,921
- Sticks and wood.

332
00:13:53,921 --> 00:13:56,988
- Okay, sticks, but then
what is this blue stuff here?

333
00:13:56,988 --> 00:13:57,626
- Water.

334
00:13:57,626 --> 00:13:58,566
- It's water.

335
00:13:58,566 --> 00:14:00,482
Yeah, so they actually go
underwater to get into their home.

336
00:14:00,482 --> 00:14:02,912
And that makes it very safe.

337
00:14:02,912 --> 00:14:04,487
So, I would like you to add one more thing

338
00:14:04,487 --> 00:14:07,895
to what you learned on the
third column of this organizer.

339
00:14:07,895 --> 00:14:18,010
Okay?

340
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:22,990
Okay, once you've got one third, okay.

341
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,454
And, Eddie, when you've got something,

342
00:14:24,454 --> 00:14:25,396
why don't you tell your neighbor?

343
00:14:25,396 --> 00:14:26,719
When you've got something,
tell your neighbor

344
00:14:26,719 --> 00:14:28,583
what you learned

345
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:34,668
(background chatter)

346
00:14:34,668 --> 00:14:36,290
- Like this?

347
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,478
- Okay.

348
00:14:37,478 --> 00:14:38,758
Actually, right here, yea.

349
00:14:38,758 --> 00:14:41,334
What you've learned.

350
00:14:41,334 --> 00:14:48,497
(background chatter)

351
00:14:48,497 --> 00:14:50,931
Okay, and if you were to go out somewhere,

352
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,618
and you were in the
woods, what would you see?

353
00:14:52,618 --> 00:14:55,264
What do you think you
would see from this house?

354
00:14:55,264 --> 00:14:57,388
This is all water, so all
you're going to see...

355
00:14:57,388 --> 00:14:58,710
Are you going to see the hole that's here?

356
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,332
- No.

357
00:14:59,332 --> 00:14:59,780
- No.

358
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,812
What do you think you're going to see?

359
00:15:00,812 --> 00:15:02,743
- The sticks.

360
00:15:02,743 --> 00:15:04,576
- Just like a stick.

361
00:15:04,576 --> 00:15:07,396
Just a mound of sticks,
about two meters high.

362
00:15:07,396 --> 00:15:09,218
Which is probably about that tall.
