1
00:00:00,383 --> 00:00:02,872
- Brooke, what did you choose?

2
00:00:02,872 --> 00:00:04,271
- [Brooke] The cylinder.

3
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:05,483
- [Teacher] Why?

4
00:00:05,483 --> 00:00:06,483
(mumbles)

5
00:00:06,483 --> 00:00:09,518
Okay, five, and what about you, Ms. Leah?

6
00:00:09,518 --> 00:00:11,179
- [Leah] Cylinder.

7
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:11,840
- [Teacher] Why?

8
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,963
- [Leah] Because it has two faces.

9
00:00:15,963 --> 00:00:17,474
- [Teacher] It has two faces,

10
00:00:17,474 --> 00:00:19,703
and what about you, Ms. Cecilia?

11
00:00:19,703 --> 00:00:21,677
(Cecilia is drowned out)

12
00:00:21,677 --> 00:00:23,244
The sphere, and why,

13
00:00:23,244 --> 00:00:24,266
you need to write your words down.

14
00:00:24,266 --> 00:00:25,485
Okay, so write your words down so you guys

15
00:00:25,485 --> 00:00:27,324
can hand in your sheet.

16
00:00:27,324 --> 00:00:29,149
- [Girl] Who thinks wants to cut?

17
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:34,558
Who think will cut?

18
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:37,964
Here, what about Samantha, then you?

19
00:00:37,964 --> 00:00:41,302
Okay, and then me, then Brian.

20
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:47,513
Okay, but he goes, you too.

21
00:00:49,505 --> 00:00:51,106
You called...

22
00:00:51,106 --> 00:00:53,389
You want to hold

23
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:56,234
and stretch?

24
00:00:56,234 --> 00:00:59,804
Well, that's the one you're
doing, and you'll be cutting.

25
00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:06,201
Okay, so Katie cuts, then
Samantha, then me and then Brian.

26
00:01:06,847 --> 00:01:11,399
He is going to roll the

27
00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:14,634
shapes down the hill.

28
00:01:14,634 --> 00:01:16,490
I'll stretch,

29
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,290
and you can hold, okay?

30
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:30,941
(children chattering)

31
00:01:31,871 --> 00:01:35,336
Samantha...

32
00:01:35,946 --> 00:01:38,981
Wait guys, this is...

33
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,646
- [Girl in Pink] Guys, it's the sphere.

34
00:01:41,646 --> 00:01:43,108
Spheres.

35
00:01:43,108 --> 00:01:45,972
Those are spheres.

36
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:49,084
- [Girl in Black] That's the cylinders.

37
00:01:49,084 --> 00:01:50,594
No.

38
00:01:50,594 --> 00:01:54,745
- [Girl in Red] This is the
sphere color, you already got...

39
00:01:55,237 --> 00:01:59,742
- Here, how about I'll be...

40
00:01:59,742 --> 00:02:01,447
(drowned out by chatter)

41
00:02:01,447 --> 00:02:04,774
Who wants cylinder, raise your hand.

42
00:02:06,285 --> 00:02:08,826
Who wants

43
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:11,568
sphere?

44
00:02:13,194 --> 00:02:16,306
Who wants cylinder?

45
00:02:18,554 --> 00:02:20,443
So, it's three versus one.

46
00:02:20,443 --> 00:02:21,941
So, do the cylinder first

47
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,821
and then use... (mumbles)

48
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:27,278
- [Girl in Red] Fine, I'll get on it.

49
00:02:27,278 --> 00:02:29,003
- [Teacher] You guys working it out?

50
00:02:29,003 --> 00:02:31,732
Alright.

51
00:02:31,732 --> 00:02:45,626
(all talking over each other)

52
00:02:47,948 --> 00:02:49,910
- [Teacher] Yes, Blake, what do you need?

53
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,220
- [Blake] We need more string.

54
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,216
- [Teacher] You need more string?

55
00:02:53,216 --> 00:02:54,670
Okay, alright.

56
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,339
Keep that one right there,

57
00:02:56,339 --> 00:02:57,766
and roll one of your other shapes

58
00:02:57,766 --> 00:02:59,903
and I'll get you a longer piece of string.

59
00:02:59,903 --> 00:03:01,576
- [Brooke] Okay.

60
00:03:01,576 --> 00:03:03,356
(all chattering over each other)

61
00:03:03,356 --> 00:03:05,500
- [Teacher] Hold on, I got it right here.

62
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,652
I'll tie it on there, how's that?

63
00:03:14,497 --> 00:03:17,496
(teacher laughs)

64
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:23,882
Okay, is that going to work for you?

65
00:03:23,882 --> 00:03:26,430
Alright, Isaac, go
ahead and stretch it out.

66
00:03:44,059 --> 00:03:47,050
- [Girl in Pink] How long it was?

67
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:52,163
- [Boy in Black] We need to hang that up.

68
00:03:52,163 --> 00:03:54,904
(all chattering)

69
00:03:54,904 --> 00:03:56,824
- [Girl in Gray] You can cut this tie.

70
00:03:56,824 --> 00:03:59,669
- [Girl in Pink] Okay, I'll cut this time.

71
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:01,730
I'll have...

72
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,430
Don't roll it now.

73
00:04:06,348 --> 00:04:09,734
I can measure it.

74
00:04:09,734 --> 00:04:13,305
I'll cut it.

75
00:04:18,615 --> 00:04:21,483
Now, Leila roll it down.

76
00:04:21,483 --> 00:04:24,056
- [Boy in Black] Move
the cylinder! (shrieks)

77
00:04:26,035 --> 00:04:29,406
(class chatter)

78
00:04:29,406 --> 00:04:34,138
- [Girl in Pink] Blue,
blue, oh we have only blue?

79
00:04:40,228 --> 00:04:41,956
- [Teacher] When you guys are measuring,

80
00:04:41,956 --> 00:04:44,482
who's doing the holding?

81
00:04:44,975 --> 00:04:45,650
You are?

82
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,833
Okay Foster, hold it.

83
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,447
Who's doing the stretching?

84
00:04:48,447 --> 00:04:49,932
Because you're going to have to stretch it out,

85
00:04:49,932 --> 00:04:52,703
you can't cut it until it's stretched.

86
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,586
You're stretching, and so Sierra's cutting?

87
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,710
Okay Foster, you hold it,

88
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,405
you gotta stretch it all the way out.

89
00:04:59,405 --> 00:05:03,731
Yeah, okay, cut it right here.

90
00:05:04,757 --> 00:05:08,118
Like that.

91
00:05:13,888 --> 00:05:17,471
Here, there you go.

92
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:19,507
Open it a little bit more.

93
00:05:19,507 --> 00:05:21,482
There you go, okay.

94
00:05:21,482 --> 00:05:22,792
And Foster go put it up on the graph,

95
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:25,632
and Sierra you can throw away the extra.

96
00:05:25,928 --> 00:05:28,917
Okay, good job.

97
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,877
What shape is this, Hunter?

98
00:05:31,877 --> 00:05:33,036
- [Hunter] Sphere.

99
00:05:33,036 --> 00:05:34,221
- [Teacher] Sphere, alright, 
and what do you know,

100
00:05:34,221 --> 00:05:36,717
what's special about the sphere?

101
00:05:36,717 --> 00:05:40,059
It rolls, and what's
really special about it?

102
00:05:40,059 --> 00:05:40,872
- [Hunter] It has no faces.

103
00:05:40,872 --> 00:05:43,798
- [Teacher] It has no
faces, you're brilliant.

104
00:05:43,798 --> 00:05:57,146
(class chatter)

105
00:05:58,356 --> 00:05:59,981
Okay, the next one...

106
00:05:59,981 --> 00:06:12,668
(drowned out by chatter)

107
00:06:13,425 --> 00:06:16,089
- [Girl in Blue] Whoa!

108
00:06:18,898 --> 00:06:20,162
- [Hunter] You can cut it.

109
00:06:20,162 --> 00:06:21,835
You may be able to...

110
00:06:21,835 --> 00:06:25,289
(drowned out)

111
00:06:28,915 --> 00:06:31,951
- [Girl in Blue] I want to straighten it.

112
00:06:33,965 --> 00:06:37,326
Measure it.

113
00:06:41,012 --> 00:06:54,626
(drowned out by chatter)

114
00:06:55,954 --> 00:06:57,126
- [Teacher] The sphere went the farthest?

115
00:06:57,126 --> 00:07:01,292
So, was your prediction right, Jackson?

116
00:07:01,292 --> 00:07:02,466
Was your prediction right?

117
00:07:02,466 --> 00:07:04,032
- [Girl in Blue] Yes.

118
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:04,868
No.

119
00:07:04,868 --> 00:07:06,954
- [Teacher] No. (laughs)

120
00:07:06,954 --> 00:07:07,987
So, you want to circle no,

121
00:07:07,987 --> 00:07:09,370
and you want to circle yes.

122
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,760
Anthony, was your prediction right?

123
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,941
Okay, so you want to circle the check mark

124
00:07:14,941 --> 00:07:17,502
for yes, your prediction was right.

125
00:07:18,134 --> 00:07:20,375
And then you guys can get some crayons and

126
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:23,586
draw your observations, and what you saw

127
00:07:23,695 --> 00:07:25,761
in your experiment.

128
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:38,786
(class chatter)

129
00:07:39,971 --> 00:07:43,036
- [Girl in Green] I think...

130
00:07:43,036 --> 00:07:46,131
The cylinder.

131
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:49,130
- [Teacher] Okay, who's letting this go?

132
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,388
- [Cecilia] Me.

133
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:52,850
- [Teacher] Okay, you can't
measure it till she lets it go.

134
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,722
Ready, go Cecilia, let her go.

135
00:07:56,657 --> 00:07:57,795
(laughs)

136
00:07:57,795 --> 00:07:59,092
Look at the poor little cube.

137
00:07:59,092 --> 00:08:01,090
Why do you think it doesn't go very far?

138
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:04,063
- [Both Girls] Because it has sides.

139
00:08:04,063 --> 00:08:05,582
- [Teacher] What kind of sides?

140
00:08:05,582 --> 00:08:07,091
- Squares.

141
00:08:07,091 --> 00:08:09,123
- [Teacher] And they're what?

142
00:08:09,123 --> 00:08:10,411
- Flat.

143
00:08:10,411 --> 00:08:12,003
- [Teacher] Flat, alright, but

144
00:08:12,003 --> 00:08:13,257
now you've picked it up and
you can't measure it.

145
00:08:13,257 --> 00:08:15,880
(laughs)

146
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,040
Alright, who's doing the holding?

147
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,802
Okay, now hold on a second Leah,

148
00:08:20,802 --> 00:08:22,684
so when you measure you want to turn it

149
00:08:22,684 --> 00:08:26,039
this way, so the edge is right up against

150
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,405
the ramp, and then you hold it tight,

151
00:08:28,405 --> 00:08:30,925
and then you can cut it right here, okay?

152
00:08:30,925 --> 00:08:32,526
Alright, so who's holding, you are?

153
00:08:32,526 --> 00:08:33,456
Okay, alright--

154
00:08:33,456 --> 00:08:37,101
- [Girl in Blue] You
hold this, you hold that.

155
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:41,727
Okay, can I go hang that up?

156
00:08:44,647 --> 00:08:46,949
Now, we do some...

157
00:08:47,422 --> 00:08:51,467
(class chatter)

158
00:08:53,517 --> 00:08:55,717
- [Teacher] Okay, hold
on, can you hold this away

159
00:08:55,717 --> 00:08:57,760
for a second while she sends it down?

160
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,760
Ready?

161
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,722
Okay, ready?

162
00:08:59,722 --> 00:09:02,010
Alright, now are you the holder?

163
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,542
Okay.

164
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:06,056
Use the stretcher.

165
00:09:06,866 --> 00:09:09,426
- [Girl in Red] Try and stretch the...

166
00:09:11,788 --> 00:09:14,006
- [Teacher] So, Katie,
you took Brian's turn

167
00:09:14,006 --> 00:09:17,193
last time, honey, so it's his turn.

168
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,633
Okay, girls, what shape is this one?

169
00:09:21,633 --> 00:09:23,121
- [Girl in Pink] Rectangular prism.

170
00:09:23,121 --> 00:09:25,592
- [Teacher] And what's special about it?

171
00:09:25,592 --> 00:09:28,245
- [Girl in Black] Because...

172
00:09:28,876 --> 00:09:30,932
Because...

173
00:09:30,932 --> 00:09:33,865
Because it has...

174
00:09:34,739 --> 00:09:37,956
Because it has rectangle.

175
00:09:37,956 --> 00:09:40,300
- [Teacher] Rectangle what?

176
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,919
- Faces.

177
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:44,812
- [Teacher] Faces, and they are...

178
00:09:45,095 --> 00:09:45,978
- [Girl in Pink] Flat.

179
00:09:45,978 --> 00:09:47,150
- [Teacher] Flat rectangles, right,

180
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,449
so did it go very far?

181
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:49,216
- No.

182
00:09:49,216 --> 00:09:50,378
- Did anybody pick the rectangular prism

183
00:09:50,378 --> 00:09:53,181
to go the farthest?

184
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,591
You picked that one?

185
00:09:54,591 --> 00:09:57,052
Okay, so now you know,

186
00:09:57,052 --> 00:09:58,133
it didn't go too far.

187
00:09:58,133 --> 00:10:01,146
Alright, so now you're going to try your...

188
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:01,812
- [Girl in Red] Cube.

189
00:10:01,812 --> 00:10:02,798
- [Teacher] Cube, okay good.

190
00:10:02,798 --> 00:10:03,810
- [Girl in Black] Who's cutting now?

191
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,710
- Who?

192
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,755
Who's sliding it?

193
00:10:08,755 --> 00:10:10,832
Samantha!

194
00:10:10,832 --> 00:10:14,027
- [Girl in Black] No, I
didn't slide it down before.

195
00:10:18,262 --> 00:10:20,892
- [Girl in Red] Samantha didn't...

196
00:10:21,501 --> 00:10:25,043
- [Teacher] So, were you right Leila?

197
00:10:25,043 --> 00:10:26,098
- [Girl in Pink] Yeah, you did!

198
00:10:26,098 --> 00:10:27,070
- [Teacher] Yes or yes ma'am?

199
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:27,652
- [Leila] Yes ma'am.

200
00:10:27,652 --> 00:10:29,253
- [Teacher] Alright, so you
can circle your prediction

201
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,728
was correct, and then,

202
00:10:30,728 --> 00:10:34,703
was your prediction correct, Isaac?

203
00:10:35,546 --> 00:10:37,309
No, you guys said the
cylinder went the farthest.

204
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:40,102
Was your prediction correct?

205
00:10:42,524 --> 00:10:44,510
Okay, so you circle here, your prediction

206
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,727
wasn't correct, and then,

207
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:49,931
was your prediction correct, Aspen?

208
00:10:49,931 --> 00:10:51,892
No, and what about you Blake, yes?

209
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:54,632
Okay, so now you guys
can go ahead and clean up

210
00:10:54,632 --> 00:10:57,094
all of your stuff, and then you can get

211
00:10:57,094 --> 00:10:59,590
one of the crayon caddies
and draw a picture

212
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,308
of what happened.

213
00:11:01,308 --> 00:11:03,095
Blake, I want you to
help your team clean up

214
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:05,736
before you start drawing
your observations.

215
00:11:05,736 --> 00:11:07,333
(class chatter)

216
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,230
Good job team!

217
00:11:15,018 --> 00:11:16,841
- [Girl in Blue] Hey, that's mine!

218
00:11:16,841 --> 00:11:18,663
That's my pencil!

219
00:11:18,663 --> 00:11:21,605
(class chatter)

220
00:11:21,605 --> 00:11:25,419
- [Girl] Wait, I'm not ready
yet, I'm not ready yet.

221
00:11:34,468 --> 00:11:38,270
- [Girl in Blue] I got it right.

222
00:11:38,507 --> 00:11:40,157
I got it right.

223
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:43,002
- [Boy in Red] Yeah, I got it right.

224
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,284
I got it right.

225
00:11:50,618 --> 00:11:53,799
- [Teacher] So, which
shape do you guys have left?

226
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:54,797
What is that?

227
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:55,435
- [Girl in Green] Cone.

228
00:11:55,435 --> 00:11:58,314
- [Teacher] The cone, and
what's special about the cone?

229
00:11:58,314 --> 00:12:02,488
(girl in green mumbles)

230
00:12:02,494 --> 00:12:04,131
And so what happens to it?

231
00:12:04,131 --> 00:12:05,558
- [Girl in Green] It slides.

232
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,497
- [Teacher] It does slide on its face.

233
00:12:07,497 --> 00:12:09,818
What else is special
about the cone, Cecilia?

234
00:12:09,818 --> 00:12:11,652
- It rolls in a circle.

235
00:12:11,652 --> 00:12:12,697
- [Teacher] Why?

236
00:12:12,697 --> 00:12:14,312
- Because...

237
00:12:14,312 --> 00:12:15,517
- [Teacher] You okay?

238
00:12:15,517 --> 00:12:18,212
- Because it has a flat face.

239
00:12:18,212 --> 00:12:19,640
- [Teacher] Mm hmm, and
what else makes it roll

240
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,149
in that circle, Leah?

241
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:22,913
- It has a point.

242
00:12:22,913 --> 00:12:24,110
- [Teacher] It has the point on it,

243
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,555
so this is your last one to measure?

244
00:12:25,555 --> 00:12:26,531
- [Leah] Yes.

245
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:27,377
- [Teacher] Okay, yes or yes ma'am?

246
00:12:27,377 --> 00:12:28,238
- [All] Yes ma'am.

247
00:12:28,238 --> 00:12:30,487
- [Teacher] Alright, good luck.

248
00:12:30,487 --> 00:12:31,484
- [Boy in Black] You throw that away,

249
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:32,983
I'll throw it away.

250
00:12:32,983 --> 00:12:34,130
- [Teacher] So, was your
prediction correct, Hunter?

251
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:34,723
- [Hunter] Yes.

252
00:12:34,723 --> 00:12:36,569
- [Teacher] Yes, so the
cylinder went the farthest

253
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:38,009
for you guys?

254
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:41,526
Okay, so Sierra, if the
cylinder went the farthest,

255
00:12:41,526 --> 00:12:43,767
your prediction wasn't
right, so now you're gonna

256
00:12:43,767 --> 00:12:45,823
circle the X.

257
00:12:45,823 --> 00:12:47,262
Does it matter that you are right?

258
00:12:47,262 --> 00:12:48,062
- [Sierra] No.

259
00:12:48,062 --> 00:12:50,930
- [Teacher] No, you're just
predicting, and that means you're

260
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,333
guessing, you don't have to be right.

261
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,050
Circle the X, and then go ahead and draw

262
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:58,127
your pictures.

263
00:12:58,127 --> 00:12:59,925
- [Ciara] It's orange.

264
00:12:59,925 --> 00:13:00,879
- [Teacher] So, you guys are gonna show

265
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:03,259
the cylinder going the farthest.

266
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:04,639
- [Sierra] Just do it.

267
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,764
Do it here.

268
00:13:11,944 --> 00:13:15,538
- [Girl in Green] Now, I don't
know what's going the farthest.

269
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:21,061
- [Leah] It was probably cylinder.

270
00:13:21,508 --> 00:13:23,760
- [Girl in Green] Yeah...

271
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,957
(drowned out by chatter)

272
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,487
- [Teacher] Okay, so what
shape went the farthest

273
00:13:34,487 --> 00:13:35,927
for you guys?

274
00:13:35,927 --> 00:13:36,889
- [Girl] Um, the cylinder.

275
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:40,018
- [Teacher] The cylinder, so
was your prediction correct?

276
00:13:40,244 --> 00:13:41,818
Was yours?

277
00:13:42,045 --> 00:13:43,960
Was yours?

278
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,828
- [Girl in Red] Mm, no.

279
00:13:45,828 --> 00:13:48,265
- [Teacher] What shape did you predict?

280
00:13:48,265 --> 00:13:49,822
- [Girl in Red] Um, the sphere.

281
00:13:49,822 --> 00:13:51,101
- [Teacher] Sphere, but the
cylinder went the farthest,

282
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:52,562
so were you right?

283
00:13:52,562 --> 00:13:54,640
No, so did you circle the little X

284
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,498
on the bottom?

285
00:13:56,498 --> 00:13:58,622
And then you can do your picture.

286
00:13:58,622 --> 00:14:01,420
Was your prediction correct, Brian?

287
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,766
Okay, so circle the check mark

288
00:14:02,766 --> 00:14:04,961
and draw your picture, and then you guys

289
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:07,341
can copy the graph from the board

290
00:14:07,341 --> 00:14:09,186
on the back, so you can show your parents

291
00:14:09,186 --> 00:14:11,286
what happened.

292
00:14:11,286 --> 00:14:13,783
Good work team!

293
00:14:13,783 --> 00:14:17,258
(class chatter)

294
00:14:21,768 --> 00:14:25,332
All right, so this team's all set?

295
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:27,398
Okay, so which one went
the furthest for this team?

296
00:14:27,398 --> 00:14:28,455
- [Girl] The sphere.

297
00:14:28,455 --> 00:14:29,941
- [Teacher] The sphere, okay, so was your

298
00:14:29,941 --> 00:14:31,264
prediction right, Cecilia?

299
00:14:31,264 --> 00:14:32,217
- [Cecilia] Yeah.

300
00:14:32,217 --> 00:14:34,121
- [Teacher] Okay, was yours right, Brooke?

301
00:14:34,121 --> 00:14:36,802
So, does it matter if you got it right?

302
00:14:36,802 --> 00:14:38,880
Not at all.

303
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,420
Alright, so then draw your
observations, draw what happened,

304
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,161
and then you can draw
the graph on the back.

305
00:14:45,161 --> 00:14:52,986
(class chatter)

306
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:58,120
- [Girl in Green] Now we have
to draw the graph on the back.
