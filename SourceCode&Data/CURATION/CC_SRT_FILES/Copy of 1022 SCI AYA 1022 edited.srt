1
00:00:00,144 --> 00:00:02,396
- You're going to test
and be coming up here

2
00:00:02,396 --> 00:00:04,440
for materials.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,431
Okay, go.

4
00:00:12,497 --> 00:00:13,704
- You just follow the lines.

5
00:00:13,704 --> 00:00:17,628
- If, no, if the lines,
if red lines are drawn

6
00:00:17,628 --> 00:00:19,416
on a white piece of paper, the termites

7
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:21,204
will follow the lines.

8
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:27,847
- We should draw, like a bunch
of different circles

9
00:00:27,847 --> 00:00:29,330
and different colors and
see which one they follow.

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,025
- [Student] And we'll make it like this.

11
00:00:31,025 --> 00:00:32,860
- Well, it's not going to be on a circle.

12
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,021
- [Student] It can be like this

13
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:35,692
and see if they'll follow that circle.

14
00:00:35,692 --> 00:00:36,714
- [Student] Yeah.

15
00:00:36,714 --> 00:00:37,689
- [Student] Would that
be a good, may I bother

16
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:38,525
you with this?

17
00:00:38,525 --> 00:00:40,099
- [Student] I'm just covering them up.

18
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:41,706
- [Teacher] What are you saying?

19
00:00:41,706 --> 00:00:42,681
- [Student] Yeah, well beside this one.

20
00:00:42,681 --> 00:00:45,793
If termites... we'll place on a red piece,

21
00:00:45,793 --> 00:00:47,673
on a white piece of
paper with a red circle

22
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:50,924
and red lines, then the
termites will follow the lines,

23
00:00:50,924 --> 00:00:51,783
in the circle.

24
00:00:51,783 --> 00:00:54,778
- Okay, so you're going to
use the color red line again.

25
00:00:54,778 --> 00:00:55,870
What color paper would you use?

26
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:56,613
- White.

27
00:00:56,613 --> 00:00:57,449
- White paper?

28
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:58,478
- Yeah.

29
00:00:58,478 --> 00:00:59,982
- And I think since we've
already used colored paper,

30
00:00:59,982 --> 00:01:00,864
I think that's a result of that.

31
00:01:00,864 --> 00:01:03,349
- Well, again you
could do yours and yours

32
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:04,765
and tie them together.

33
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:06,878
Use different colored
papers, so what's the point

34
00:01:06,878 --> 00:01:08,410
of your test?

35
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,382
- That depending on the
colored paper we'll determine

36
00:01:11,382 --> 00:01:13,054
what the termites sight can do.

37
00:01:13,054 --> 00:01:14,587
- I would think it's the color of the line

38
00:01:14,587 --> 00:01:15,655
because that's what they're following.

39
00:01:15,655 --> 00:01:17,559
- So, you think they're
following the color of the line?

40
00:01:17,559 --> 00:01:18,069
- [Student] Yes.

41
00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:19,486
- Yeah, but when they went to the end of

42
00:01:19,486 --> 00:01:21,018
the white paper, they went to the black

43
00:01:21,018 --> 00:01:22,365
and they came right back.

44
00:01:22,365 --> 00:01:25,546
- [Student] Well, no, that's because
they knew what it was,

45
00:01:25,546 --> 00:01:27,775
that's because I, like, kept hitting them back.

46
00:01:27,775 --> 00:01:30,492
- [Teacher] Okay, so you're kind of
going along with the idea

47
00:01:30,492 --> 00:01:32,140
of color.

48
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,995
How could you prove that color was...

49
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:37,411
- That color effects their...

50
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:38,943
- [Student] You draw a bunch of different circles,

51
00:01:38,943 --> 00:01:41,358
draw a bunch of circles
about the exact same size,

52
00:01:41,358 --> 00:01:44,214
but of different colors and
see which one they go to?

53
00:01:44,214 --> 00:01:45,375
- I like that.

54
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:46,466
- Nice, okay.

55
00:01:46,466 --> 00:01:47,372
- On a white piece of paper?

56
00:01:47,372 --> 00:01:48,161
- [Student] Yeah.

57
00:01:48,161 --> 00:01:49,415
- Again I've got colored paper.

58
00:01:49,415 --> 00:01:51,180
The more tests you do, the more accurate

59
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,178
your results would be.

60
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:53,595
- All right, so let's do the same test

61
00:01:53,595 --> 00:01:54,825
but on two different types of paper.

62
00:01:54,825 --> 00:01:58,471
So, if termites are placed
on a white piece of paper...

63
00:01:58,471 --> 00:01:59,632
- [Teacher] Put that on top of it just so we block

64
00:01:59,632 --> 00:02:00,955
some of the light out.

65
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:03,788
No, that down.

66
00:02:03,788 --> 00:02:05,274
Good, and there you go.

67
00:02:05,274 --> 00:02:07,572
So, what were we thinking about testing?

68
00:02:07,572 --> 00:02:11,450
- Um, putting tables in line
using different color.

69
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,609
- And to see if, we're not
going to finish the circle

70
00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:14,979
and see if they follow it around.

71
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:16,721
- [Student] Oh, very nice.

72
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:18,160
- Yeah, because we drew a line

73
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,806
leading back to the thing
and they followed it down.

74
00:02:22,806 --> 00:02:26,542
- [Student] They followed it down...
- [Teacher] Tricky, okay.

75
00:02:26,542 --> 00:02:28,191
- [Student] They went, it's true.

76
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:30,652
- [Teacher] So they
didn't follow this part?

77
00:02:30,652 --> 00:02:31,743
- [Student] Yeah, because it curves.

78
00:02:31,743 --> 00:02:33,345
- [Student] No, because they...

79
00:02:33,345 --> 00:02:34,205
- [Student] We drew the circle.

80
00:02:34,205 --> 00:02:37,223
- [Student] They go, like, then
they curve and go down.

81
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,197
- [Student] And they came
here and went back up.

82
00:02:39,197 --> 00:02:39,824
They all followed.

83
00:02:39,824 --> 00:02:42,412
- [Teacher] Hmm, interesting.

84
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,351
Thank you, four.

85
00:02:44,351 --> 00:02:46,487
You've got about two more, about a minute

86
00:02:46,487 --> 00:02:48,391
and a half actually.

87
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:50,179
What are we thinking?

88
00:02:50,179 --> 00:02:52,594
I'm going to go ahead and cover these up.

89
00:02:52,594 --> 00:02:55,961
- We were planning on doing, um, like,
we think they're attracted

90
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:57,958
to the ink and I'm going
to test it with like

91
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,210
a marker, a pen, and a crayon.

92
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:00,697
- [Teacher] Okay.

93
00:03:00,697 --> 00:03:03,484
- To see if, like, if they
follow the ink better

94
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:04,668
than the other ones.

95
00:03:04,668 --> 00:03:08,894
- Nice, would you use
the same color of ink?

96
00:03:08,894 --> 00:03:11,192
- Yeah, because it would be the control.

97
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:13,881
- [Teacher] There you go, very nice?

98
00:03:13,881 --> 00:03:16,370
Um, what color paper are you going to use?

99
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,369
- Should we use regular?

100
00:03:17,369 --> 00:03:18,158
- White.

101
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:19,638
- I would say white yeah.

102
00:03:19,638 --> 00:03:21,432
- All right, good.

103
00:03:21,432 --> 00:03:24,683
Okay, sounds good.

104
00:03:24,683 --> 00:03:26,471
Where are your termites?

105
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:29,234
Stop playing with them and
we're going to actually cover

106
00:03:29,234 --> 00:03:31,463
them to kind of get the light out.

107
00:03:31,463 --> 00:03:33,297
What were you guys thinking about testing?

108
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:35,410
- Mainly, if they are going
to follow the red line,

109
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:38,498
then they must be attracted to red.

110
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:40,147
- [Teacher] They must
be attracted to what?

111
00:03:40,147 --> 00:03:40,890
- [Student] Red.

112
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,817
- [Teacher] Red? Okay, so how
could you test that they

113
00:03:42,817 --> 00:03:45,905
are just attracted to red?

114
00:03:45,905 --> 00:03:49,063
- We're going to make two large circles.

115
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:52,906
- [Teacher] Two large circles...

116
00:03:52,906 --> 00:03:54,249
- [Student] And some other lines.
- [Teacher] And some other lines...

117
00:03:54,249 --> 00:03:57,427
- But, what are you testing again?

118
00:03:57,427 --> 00:04:00,811
- If they go to the
red line then they must

119
00:04:00,811 --> 00:04:03,133
be attracted to red.

120
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:07,220
- Okay, so you're talking
about the color red.

121
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,494
Um, would you use, so you
tell me what you're going

122
00:04:10,494 --> 00:04:11,330
to set up.

123
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,792
I'm trying to follow.

124
00:04:12,792 --> 00:04:16,299
- [Student] Probably just
a black one and a red one.

125
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:17,854
- Lines or circles?

126
00:04:17,854 --> 00:04:18,644
- [Student] Circles.

127
00:04:18,644 --> 00:04:22,359
- Circles? Okay, all right.

128
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:24,750
- Yeah, basically just for fun.

129
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,095
- [Teacher] Okay, okay, just for fun, all right.

130
00:04:27,095 --> 00:04:31,414
Um, you should be collecting materials.

131
00:04:31,414 --> 00:04:34,665
If pens and things aren't
working, let me know.

132
00:04:34,665 --> 00:04:45,514
- (background chatter)

133
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:51,912
- [Student] Dude, get the line.

134
00:04:51,912 --> 00:04:54,215
- [Teacher] What
happened to your situations?

135
00:04:54,215 --> 00:04:56,630
- Well we put tape over
this and now it doesn't

136
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,559
follow it over here.

137
00:04:57,559 --> 00:04:58,859
- [Student] I think
they like the color red.

138
00:04:58,859 --> 00:05:00,763
- [Student] None of them are
following any of these lines.

139
00:05:00,763 --> 00:05:01,947
- [Teacher] How could
you continue to test

140
00:05:01,947 --> 00:05:03,781
that they like the color red?

141
00:05:03,781 --> 00:05:07,018
- [Student] Put more red over here?

142
00:05:07,018 --> 00:05:09,006
- [Student] I mean, we also put the tape there

143
00:05:09,006 --> 00:05:10,376
and it doesn't like the tape.

144
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:12,024
It gets confused.

145
00:05:12,024 --> 00:05:14,207
- [Student] And we have the
red paper and it didn't

146
00:05:14,207 --> 00:05:15,693
follow the black lines.

147
00:05:15,693 --> 00:05:16,552
- [Student] Or the pencil.

148
00:05:16,552 --> 00:05:18,363
- [Student] Yeah, that's what I mean.

149
00:05:20,413 --> 00:05:22,658
- [Student] None of them
here are even doing anything.

150
00:05:22,658 --> 00:05:24,493
- [Student] They get tired
and just start standing

151
00:05:24,493 --> 00:05:27,024
there twitching.

152
00:05:29,294 --> 00:05:31,435
- [Teacher] Do you need some new ones?

153
00:05:31,435 --> 00:05:34,570
No, there are still pretty lively.
- [Student] Yeah.

154
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,536
- [Teacher] So, what are some of the
conclusions that you're thinking?

155
00:05:37,536 --> 00:05:38,471
Oh, Terrance, be sweet.

156
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:41,535
- [Student] Ah, be sweet.
- [Student] Ah, white on red.

157
00:05:43,755 --> 00:05:45,369
- [Student] They only like that.

158
00:05:45,369 --> 00:05:48,548
Also they only follow that type of pen.

159
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:53,122
They don't follow any other
type of pen or pencil.

160
00:05:53,122 --> 00:05:57,162
Um, they don't necessarily
have an affiliation to red.

161
00:05:57,162 --> 00:05:58,532
- [Teacher] Okay, how do you know that?

162
00:05:58,532 --> 00:06:00,784
- 'Cause they walked off the red paper?

163
00:06:00,784 --> 00:06:02,618
- [Teacher] Okay, they walked off the red paper?

164
00:06:02,618 --> 00:06:03,756

So, you threw that one out.

165
00:06:03,756 --> 00:06:06,148
How could you continue
to say that they like

166
00:06:06,148 --> 00:06:10,787
that particular pen, and
not having to do red?

167
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,848
- [Student] We tried black pen.

168
00:06:11,848 --> 00:06:13,462
- [Student] We haven't
tried another color

169
00:06:13,462 --> 00:06:14,924
on white yet.

170
00:06:14,924 --> 00:06:16,364
- [Student] See look,
it stopped at the tape.

171
00:06:16,364 --> 00:06:17,943
- [Student] It's confused at the tape.

172
00:06:17,943 --> 00:06:19,200
- [Teacher] No, Neal, what I
asked you is that a pen

173
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,616
or a marker?

174
00:06:20,616 --> 00:06:21,499
It's a pen.

175
00:06:21,499 --> 00:06:23,147
- [Neal] It's a pen.

176
00:06:23,147 --> 00:06:27,907
- [Student] Oh, he's
following the other...

177
00:06:27,907 --> 00:06:29,184
- [Student] We drew
it on the other side...

178
00:06:29,184 --> 00:06:30,624
- [Student] We drew a
circle on the other side.

179
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:31,901
- [Student] It looked like he was following it.

180
00:06:31,901 --> 00:06:33,921
- [Teacher] Is it
something inside of them?

181
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:35,500
- [Student] No.

182
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,774
- [Student] Like, what
the ink's made out of?

183
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:41,815
- [Teacher] How could you test that?

184
00:06:41,815 --> 00:06:44,602
- [Student] Using the red pen on this?
- [Teacher] Okay.

185
00:06:46,512 --> 00:06:49,139
- [Student] Taking two different pens...

186
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:50,230
- [Teacher] Go grab some more.

187
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,384
That's a good idea.

188
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:58,825
- Red color pen, red color pencil.
- You killed the ant...

189
00:07:00,675 --> 00:07:05,269
- [Teacher] Gentlemen,
be nice to your termites.

190
00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:11,378
- [Student] Oh, oh, wait... wait?

191
00:07:13,774 --> 00:07:23,766
- [Teacher] Here Neal, let's get...

192
00:07:24,734 --> 00:07:26,081
- [Student] All right,
group, here's a red pen,

193
00:07:26,081 --> 00:07:35,304
colored pencil.

194
00:07:37,318 --> 00:07:39,940
- [Student] Oh, look! That one's alive!

195
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,359
- [Teacher] Okay, now
then, so what are you

196
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:42,357
saying is going on?

197
00:07:42,357 --> 00:07:47,357
- They're still following the red one.

198
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,718
Yeah, they're still following the red pen.

199
00:07:49,718 --> 00:07:52,922
So, it's not necessarily an
affiliation to the color red.

200
00:07:52,922 --> 00:07:54,385
- [Student] So, it is
something inside the ink.

201
00:07:54,385 --> 00:07:55,615
- [Teacher] So, how can
you test if it's something

202
00:07:55,615 --> 00:07:57,682
inside the ink?

203
00:07:57,682 --> 00:07:59,795
- I just got the other colored pencil.

204
00:07:59,795 --> 00:08:02,436
- [Student] Take another red pen.

205
00:08:02,436 --> 00:08:03,324
- [Teacher] Go grab some.

206
00:08:03,324 --> 00:08:03,997
- [Student] It's right there.

207
00:08:03,997 --> 00:08:05,390
- [Teacher] That's a pencil.

208
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,575
- [Student] It's the color red, look.

209
00:08:06,575 --> 00:08:08,293
- [Teacher] Stick with the, no, you
just threw out the idea

210
00:08:08,293 --> 00:08:09,175
that it's red.

211
00:08:09,175 --> 00:08:14,051
Stick with the color...
stick with the pen idea.

212
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:15,560
- [Student] We need a pen like this.

213
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,184
- [Student] No, I think
we have the exact same pen.

214
00:08:18,184 --> 00:08:20,785
- [Student] No, no,
the blue one like this.

215
00:08:20,785 --> 00:08:22,712
- [Student] They have
a blue one like that?

216
00:08:22,712 --> 00:08:25,214
- [Teacher] Go see,
there's blue pens up there.

217
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,653
- [Student] Hey, can
we borrow a red pen?

218
00:08:30,653 --> 00:08:32,696
I meant blue, you know what I meant.

219
00:08:32,696 --> 00:08:35,598
- [Student] Bam, it's
a different type of pen.

220
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,177
- [Student] It's all right.

221
00:08:37,177 --> 00:08:41,676
- [Student] Different type
of pen, but it's blue now.

222
00:08:41,676 --> 00:08:43,493
- [Student] Did you get a blue one?

223
00:08:43,493 --> 00:08:45,513
- [Student] No, I just got red ones.

224
00:08:45,513 --> 00:08:47,092
I got bundles. (laughter)

225
00:08:47,092 --> 00:08:59,205
- [Teacher] Nice.

226
00:09:01,615 --> 00:09:03,229
- [Student] Now they're
going to follow it.

227
00:09:03,229 --> 00:09:04,901
- [Teacher] Now, I thought
we were going to get away

228
00:09:04,901 --> 00:09:09,382
from the red idea and go with the pen.

229
00:09:10,982 --> 00:09:12,540
- [Student] I think it's that pen.

230
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,515
- [Student] I've got the same pen.

231
00:09:13,515 --> 00:09:14,653
- [Student] They're still the red.

232
00:09:14,653 --> 00:09:17,390
I think they are.
- [Teacher] Okay, try that one.

233
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,482
- [Student] There's a
hole there, by the way.

234
00:09:19,482 --> 00:09:35,429
If you press through it, it will break.

235
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:42,863
- [Teacher] Go.

236
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:45,325
- [Student] Are you going to make it

237
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:46,532
intercept the line?

238
00:09:46,532 --> 00:09:49,527
- [Student] Yeah I'm going to.

239
00:09:49,527 --> 00:09:51,966
- [Student] Oh, look, he's
following the little one.

240
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,032
- [Student] Maybe it likes circles.

241
00:09:54,032 --> 00:09:55,123
- [Student] Wait, wait.

242
00:09:55,123 --> 00:09:56,493
- [Student] I still think
it's something inside the ink.

243
00:09:56,493 --> 00:09:57,422
- [Student] Draw a square.

244
00:09:57,422 --> 00:09:58,699
See if it follows a square.

245
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,185
- [Teacher] So, that would be able,

246
00:10:00,185 --> 00:10:01,973
you would be able to throw out your idea

247
00:10:01,973 --> 00:10:03,830
that it likes circles
if you drew the square.

248
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,665
So draw a square, see what happens.

249
00:10:05,665 --> 00:10:07,197
- [Student] Yeah, draw a square.

250
00:10:07,197 --> 00:10:10,100
- [Student] I've got another black pen.

251
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,307
I have all these pens.

252
00:10:11,307 --> 00:10:13,229
- (laughing)

253
00:10:16,322 --> 00:10:17,251
- [Student] Why not draw the square

254
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:19,434
inside of there?

255
00:10:19,434 --> 00:10:22,801
- [Student] Inscribe
the square in the circle.

256
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:25,912
Terms...terminology.

257
00:10:25,912 --> 00:10:28,419
- [Student] You're a professor now.

258
00:10:30,549 --> 00:10:32,506
- [Students] Oh, it's following it!

259
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:35,914
- [Student] It is the pen.

260
00:10:37,289 --> 00:10:39,797
- [Student] Curves are easier.

261
00:10:39,797 --> 00:10:41,515
- [Student] It didn't
know where the line was.

262
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:46,344
- [Teacher] Okay, five, four.

263
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:50,965
- [Student] Um, we drew different lines in
the different types of pens,

264
00:10:50,965 --> 00:10:53,288
markers, colored pencils.

265
00:10:53,288 --> 00:10:54,588
- [Teacher] Did you do
it all on the same page

266
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:56,492
or on different pages?

267
00:10:56,492 --> 00:10:57,701
- On different colored pages.

268
00:10:57,701 --> 00:10:58,793
- [Teacher] Why would
you do it on different

269
00:10:58,793 --> 00:11:01,068
colored pages?

270
00:11:01,068 --> 00:11:04,388
- [Student] Ah, to make sure the tests varied?

271
00:11:04,388 --> 00:11:06,046
- [Teacher] Okay, did
you use the same color

272
00:11:06,046 --> 00:11:07,555
of ink on each page?

273
00:11:07,555 --> 00:11:09,366
Describe to me your experiment web.

274
00:11:09,366 --> 00:11:13,466
The whole group can chime in too.

275
00:11:15,076 --> 00:11:17,609
- [Student] Um, like we drew, like a
black circle on a black

276
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:18,329
sheet of paper.

277
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:19,048
- [Teacher] Okay.

278
00:11:19,048 --> 00:11:20,186
- [Student] To see if they could only like...

279
00:11:20,186 --> 00:11:21,510
- [Teacher] Please don't be rude.

280
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,553
- [Teacher] Black circle on a black sheet of paper.

281
00:11:23,553 --> 00:11:26,200
Keep going, what else?

282
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,732
- [Student] And that didn't work.
They could not see it

283
00:11:27,732 --> 00:11:29,868
or follow it or anything
so we decided to go

284
00:11:29,868 --> 00:11:32,562
with an experiment that
Christian came up with,

285
00:11:32,562 --> 00:11:34,210
that take a white piece
of paper and we drew, like, 

286
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:37,206
every kind of color their was all at once

287
00:11:37,206 --> 00:11:39,179
and they seemed to only
the follow the blue

288
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:40,154
or red circles.

289
00:11:40,154 --> 00:11:41,060
None of the other colors.

290
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,450
- What were the blue and
the red circles drawn with?

291
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,445
- [Student] I believe different types of stuff.

292
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:49,930
Mainly pen though.

293
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,834
- And this was all on one sheet of paper?

294
00:11:51,834 --> 00:11:54,597
- [Student] Well, we tried it on
different sheets too.

295
00:11:54,597 --> 00:11:55,579
- Okay.

296
00:11:55,579 --> 00:11:56,739
- [Student] That's what started us off.

297
00:11:56,739 --> 00:11:59,158
- Okay.

298
00:11:59,158 --> 00:12:01,898
Um, did you have it all on one sheet at first?

299
00:12:01,898 --> 00:12:03,128
- Yeah.

300
00:12:03,128 --> 00:12:06,867
- Okay, what did you
realize was wrong with that?

301
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:09,676
- They were pretty much getting confused.

302
00:12:09,676 --> 00:12:12,486
- As in we're going to
have issues with what?

303
00:12:12,486 --> 00:12:14,506
Maintaining?

304
00:12:14,506 --> 00:12:15,249
- [Student] A control?

305
00:12:15,249 --> 00:12:16,433
- A control, good.

306
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:20,009
Only one independent variable, nice.

307
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:21,982
Um, Nick's group, how did you go through

308
00:12:21,982 --> 00:12:23,886
the indentation?

309
00:12:23,886 --> 00:12:28,886
- We drew several circles
using each of the utensils

310
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:34,358
and then I think we placed
the termites in the middle

311
00:12:34,358 --> 00:12:38,096
and they all sort of, if
they weren't in the middle,

312
00:12:38,096 --> 00:12:41,347
sort of eating off of the
wood or, like, just exploring

313
00:12:41,347 --> 00:12:43,645
around, they were following the pen.

314
00:12:43,645 --> 00:12:47,788
- Okay, um, your indentation
line, did you draw that

315
00:12:47,788 --> 00:12:49,814
with just pens, different types of pens,

316
00:12:49,814 --> 00:12:50,998
did you draw it with markers, did you draw

317
00:12:50,998 --> 00:12:53,970
it with a paper clip?

318
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,663
- We just used the same color
but we used different things.

319
00:12:56,663 --> 00:13:01,663
Like we used pens,
Vis-A-Vis, colored pencils,

320
00:13:01,818 --> 00:13:02,607
stuff like that.

321
00:13:02,607 --> 00:13:04,256
- [Teacher] Okay, and what was
your conclusion with that?

322
00:13:04,256 --> 00:13:06,601
- They followed the pen
because we thought it was

323
00:13:06,601 --> 00:13:09,921
the one that had the most
distinct indentation.

324
00:13:09,921 --> 00:13:12,150
- [Student] Because they came, the
termites, into that line,

325
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,892
because we saw them go up to the edge

326
00:13:13,892 --> 00:13:16,492
and because they would
feel there is a drop,

327
00:13:16,492 --> 00:13:18,234
and I figured oh, well they must be blind

328
00:13:18,234 --> 00:13:21,299
because they can't see
that there's a drop there.

329
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:23,249
- [Teacher] Interesting point.

330
00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:27,684
Why might you have used
a paper clip as well

331
00:13:27,684 --> 00:13:31,933
to create the indentation,
instead of a pen?

332
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:34,719
- Because it wouldn't have shown a color,

333
00:13:34,719 --> 00:13:38,179
but it would have still left
the same indentation as a pen.

334
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:41,244
- Okay, so any components within that pen,

335
00:13:41,244 --> 00:13:44,804
color, chemicals, type of pen, whatever,

336
00:13:44,804 --> 00:13:48,929
if you would have used the paper clip

337
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:51,158
and then followed that indentation,

338
00:13:51,158 --> 00:13:56,158
you would have been able to do what?

339
00:13:56,777 --> 00:13:58,937
Pen verses paper clip.

340
00:13:58,937 --> 00:14:00,516
- [Student]Pen would have looked, I
think it would have looked...

341
00:14:00,516 --> 00:14:04,881
- [Student] The paper clip 
would have looked deeper,

342
00:14:04,881 --> 00:14:08,271
- but the thing is, like, 
would it prove if you had

343
00:14:08,271 --> 00:14:09,594
it or not.

344
00:14:09,594 --> 00:14:10,314
- [Teacher] Had what or not?

345
00:14:10,314 --> 00:14:12,055
- [Student] If they followed the dent or not.

346
00:14:12,055 --> 00:14:15,631
Not just like, the color
or the like, smell,

347
00:14:15,631 --> 00:14:16,421
or whatever.

348
00:14:16,421 --> 00:14:17,791
- [Teacher] Very good, very good.

349
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:21,482
So, by using the paper clip
to create the indentation,

350
00:14:21,482 --> 00:14:24,779
they would have been able to rule out

351
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:29,516
any type of color from the
pen that left the indent,

352
00:14:29,516 --> 00:14:32,095
maybe the scent from the pen,

353
00:14:32,095 --> 00:14:34,480
the chemical from the
pen that left the indent.

354
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,807
By doing the paper clip just by itself,

355
00:14:36,807 --> 00:14:38,061
we would have been able to say okay,

356
00:14:38,061 --> 00:14:40,406
that obviously doesn't
leave any chemicals,

357
00:14:40,406 --> 00:14:42,263
it doesn't leave any color,
and if they're following

358
00:14:42,263 --> 00:14:44,260
that indentation, we know that that's

359
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,187
what they are drawn too.

360
00:14:46,187 --> 00:14:47,604
Okay?

361
00:14:47,604 --> 00:14:52,604
Carly, your group had
an interesting set up.

362
00:14:53,176 --> 00:14:55,823
- Um, we, well we kind of did two.

363
00:14:55,823 --> 00:14:56,915
- [Teacher] All right.

364
00:14:56,915 --> 00:15:00,583
- But the first one, we have
like a black piece of paper

365
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:04,391
and we bordered it with, like, white pieces

366
00:15:04,391 --> 00:15:07,804
of paper and we drew a white circle in

367
00:15:07,804 --> 00:15:11,264
the black piece of paper
to see if they would

368
00:15:11,264 --> 00:15:15,977
go away from the white to
go to the darker paper.

369
00:15:15,977 --> 00:15:19,274
And that didn't really work,
so we did the other one

370
00:15:19,274 --> 00:15:23,779
and, um, with, like, the
different colors of circles

371
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:27,239
on a white piece of paper, and they only

372
00:15:27,239 --> 00:15:30,048
went on the red pen one.

373
00:15:30,048 --> 00:15:34,413
- [Teacher] Okay, what could have been
a variable in your experiment

374
00:15:34,413 --> 00:15:37,409
that you just described?

375
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:39,707
As in something that might have thrown off

376
00:15:39,707 --> 00:15:40,984
the results?

377
00:15:40,984 --> 00:15:44,746
- Paper? I don't know.

378
00:15:44,746 --> 00:15:46,650
- [Teacher] Well, notice in one of the experiments

379
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:49,622
you used a what, to create the circle?

380
00:15:49,622 --> 00:15:50,550
- The pen.

381
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,456
- [Teacher] Okay, you used a pen

382
00:15:51,456 --> 00:15:54,591
and in the other
experiment you used a what?

383
00:15:54,591 --> 00:15:55,450
- Paper?

384
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,820
- [Teacher] But you used a...

385
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,372
Oh, white, yeah, you used
a white colored pencil.

386
00:16:00,372 --> 00:16:03,507
So, by using a colored pen and then

387
00:16:03,507 --> 00:16:08,238
a white colored pencil, what
are those two things now?

388
00:16:09,613 --> 00:16:12,283
Added on what?
- [Students] Variables.

389
00:16:12,283 --> 00:16:14,095
- [Teacher] Added on variables.

390
00:16:14,095 --> 00:16:16,091
Okay, for one you're using pen and pencil,

391
00:16:16,091 --> 00:16:17,879
another you're using colors.

392
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:21,409
So, how could you have made your experiment

393
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:26,145
a little bit more definite
that would of maybe

394
00:16:26,145 --> 00:16:28,699
ruled out some of the other variables?

395
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:32,002
Gentlemen, calm down.

396
00:16:32,002 --> 00:16:33,877
- We could have used colored
pencils the whole time.

397
00:16:33,877 --> 00:16:35,340
- Okay, could have used the same color

398
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,663
colored pencil the whole time.

399
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,357
Good.

400
00:16:39,357 --> 00:16:43,049
Um, what group haven't I talked to?

401
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:46,764
Matthew, explain to us
the set up of your group.

402
00:16:46,764 --> 00:16:48,505
- Do you want to start?

403
00:16:48,505 --> 00:16:49,759
- I don't know what to say.

404
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,759
- Oh, okay then we started off thinking

405
00:16:56,376 --> 00:17:01,043
that they followed the
color and so we drew

406
00:17:01,043 --> 00:17:06,043
with a different type of pen
and it did not follow it,

407
00:17:06,802 --> 00:17:09,100
so we decided maybe it's not color.

408
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:14,100
So, we took a black pen, a big one.

409
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,479
Um, we took a black pen, 
and then two red pens

410
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:22,451
of different type, and two
blue pens of different type,

411
00:17:22,451 --> 00:17:26,445
and they only followed
the specific type of pen

412
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,024
red and blue.

413
00:17:28,024 --> 00:17:31,066
It was the BIC pens, so
we decided there must

414
00:17:31,066 --> 00:17:34,316
be something in that, in the chemical
structure of that ink

415
00:17:34,316 --> 00:17:37,335
that's, you know, similar to some sort of

416
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:41,282
pheromone of some sort.

417
00:17:41,282 --> 00:17:42,907
Um, and the termites followed it.

418
00:17:42,907 --> 00:17:46,854
- Okay, um, did you think of the
pheromone thing yesterday?

419
00:17:46,854 --> 00:17:48,178
- Yeah.

420
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,729
- After school.

421
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:54,795
- That was extracurricular.

422
00:17:54,795 --> 00:17:57,303
- [Teacher] All right so...

423
00:17:57,303 --> 00:17:58,952
- But we figured out the BIC pens.

424
00:17:58,952 --> 00:17:59,880
We figured that out.

425
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,739
- Okay, good.

426
00:18:00,739 --> 00:18:01,691
Excellent set up there.

427
00:18:01,691 --> 00:18:05,128
Were there any variables that,

428
00:18:05,128 --> 00:18:06,312
when I was over there earlier

429
00:18:06,312 --> 00:18:10,190
you had different shapes
with the different pens?

430
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:10,863
- You got this?

431
00:18:10,863 --> 00:18:12,233
- Yeah, we were drawing with different shapes

432
00:18:12,233 --> 00:18:15,692
'cause it followed the
circle and then we were

433
00:18:15,692 --> 00:18:18,386
trying to get them back inside the thing.

434
00:18:18,386 --> 00:18:20,615
So, we drew a line pointing down there

435
00:18:20,615 --> 00:18:21,915
so they would follow it.

436
00:18:21,915 --> 00:18:24,980
And they did follow it
but then we realized

437
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,556
it might not be the shape,
it might be in the pen

438
00:18:28,556 --> 00:18:29,461
or the color.

439
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:30,878
- [Student] They don't really
like sharp angles though.

440
00:18:30,878 --> 00:18:32,410
We drew a square and they got lost.

441
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,362
- [Student] Yeah.

442
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,986
- They couldn't find the angle.

443
00:18:35,986 --> 00:18:40,986
- [Teacher] Okay, interesting. So, um,
if any of you did do any sort of

444
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:46,535
research (inaudible), you were able to
find that the pheromone

445
00:18:49,151 --> 00:18:54,151
that termites emit, and we
learned that those were what?

446
00:18:54,515 --> 00:18:56,186
Pheromones?

447
00:18:56,186 --> 00:18:58,555
- [Student] Enzymes.

448
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:00,575
- Enzymes, not enzymes.

449
00:19:02,115 --> 00:19:04,350
What are pheromones having to do with?

450
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,929
We just spent three days on it.

451
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:06,834
- [Student] Animal behavior.

452
00:19:06,834 --> 00:19:08,785
- Animal behavior, communication,

453
00:19:08,785 --> 00:19:10,503
their chemical signals.

454
00:19:10,503 --> 00:19:15,503
Okay, so we learned that termites emit

455
00:19:16,052 --> 00:19:16,958
these pheromones.

456
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:19,071
We might have encountered this last time

457
00:19:19,071 --> 00:19:22,298
and that's the same thing why ants

458
00:19:22,298 --> 00:19:25,108
follow a specific trail.

459
00:19:25,108 --> 00:19:29,519
Um, when honeybees sense danger, they emit

460
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:32,538
a warning pheromone that
tells everybody in the hive

461
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,720
to freak out, that danger's coming.

462
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,720
But the pheromone that
termite's emit to have

463
00:19:40,107 --> 00:19:42,266
them follow each other in the hole trails

464
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:46,167
and all of that, the
chemical in that mimics

465
00:19:46,167 --> 00:19:49,998
or the chemical in the pen,
in Bic and PaperMate pens

466
00:19:49,998 --> 00:19:54,503
actually, mimics the
chemical in the pheromones,

467
00:19:54,503 --> 00:19:59,078
which is why they followed certain pens.
