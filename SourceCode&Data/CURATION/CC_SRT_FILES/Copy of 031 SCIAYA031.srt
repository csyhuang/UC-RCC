1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,300
And...

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,780
So I wanted to 
talk about impulse which

3
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,300
I think is the important 
part about brain injuries.

4
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,740
I guess, because it has to do 
with the time you have

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,860
and the force you feel.

6
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,780
So as we know...
 Impulse...

7
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,620
equals

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,500
force times the change in time.

9
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,380
So that's impulse.

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,660
So when you get hit,

11
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,540
if you have... anyone 
ever played football,

12
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,380
you have little helmets or if you've ever 
ridden a bike, they've little pads on there,

13
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,580
and whenever you get hit,

14
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,900
those pads are on there to 
make the time be a little bit longer.

15
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,060
So if you have bigger time,

16
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,380
if you have a big force, 
it's going to decrease.

17
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,140
Because it's force / time.

18
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,860
Right?

19
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,900
So what they're trying to do is

20
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,700
helmets is...

21
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,620
This is one of the questions.

22
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,660
We have what we tell 'em 
and you use science to prove it.

23
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,060
It's... What will you 
tell them to do?

24
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,900
So... -Edward, let me just say...

25
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,340
Sorry to... 
But to clarify the design,

26
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,820
Yes, the design of the helmet

27
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,860
So how would 
you design the helmet

28
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,300
so that you 
could have less force?

29
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,860
Because if you have less force,

30
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,740
that means that

31
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,780
your brain is going to move 
less because of momentum.

32
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,460
So you're going to have 
less momentum coming at you.

33
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,020
And...

34
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,820
So is that completely inelastic?

35
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,260
Ask Ether

36
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,980
That's completely 
inelastic, right?

37
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,340
When something is not moving 
and then you just hit it and then...

38
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,300
Yeah.

39
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,420
All right. So we have 
completely inelastic or inelastic.

40
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,700
So if you raise up..., 
if you have a big force,

41
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,300
and you have small time,

42
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,660
which is what people have 
when they get hit with helmet.

43
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,580
So if you didn't have a helmet at all,

44
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,300
you'd get hit right away, right?

45
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,820
But if you have your helmet,

46
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,500
you're not going to hit the other side of your helmet, so...

47
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,420
a little bit longer, because 
it's going to take the padding.

48
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,980
So if you have lot of padding,

49
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,380
so if you have like a
huge helmet like this,

50
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,540
and you got hit,

51
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,380
you'd have to get...

52
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,820
The padding would have to 
go all the way here, then hit you

53
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,700
and then it'd have to come over 
here and hit the padding again.

54
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,980
So what would 
happen to the force?

55
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,820
The force... If you have a longer time,

56
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,980
the force is still down.

57
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,660
So what I wanted 
to ask you guys is-

58
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,660
How would you design 
a helmet to make this?

59
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,860
So using this science,

60
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,540
to make it so that 
people get less concussions

61
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,420
or the concussions 
that are not as dangerous.

62
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,700
So I was looking in 
materials to the helmets,

63
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,220
and I find out that

64
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,980
The problem is not the helmet, 
the problem is the money.

65
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,420
(unintelligible) to have like

66
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,420
the 250

67
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,220
(unintelligible) the X1 is the 
most expensive one.

68
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,180
So we also talk about-

69
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,580
there are more concussion 
in high school football than in uh... 
-NFL

70
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,500
Yeah...

71
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,740
So here's like... you can see that

72
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,380
the professional players who 
can pay that money.

73
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,500
They're really rich,

74
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,420
so there's so much sponsors 
that they pay for their helmets.

75
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,660
But like in... high school football

76
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,380
what they want is long pass

77
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,980
(unintelligible) cheaper material

78
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,780
So they don't 
care much about

79
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,620
The health about the guys, 
they want to go just...

80
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,380
Their problem is 
the money of the helmets.

81
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,700
How much cost of helmet is...

82
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,260
like helmets with 
Kevlar or that stuff.

83
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,420
like they use in 
the military equipment.

84
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,460
(unintelligible)

85
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,540
So how can we combine

86
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,020
your thoughts and your thoughts

87
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,940
so that we can 
save these thoughts?

88
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,780
So what kind of 
ideas you guys have?

89
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,020
How could you design a helmet

90
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,460
so it's not this big

91
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:04,900
or really neat and super expensive?

92
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,900
The type of padding we use

93
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,340
So what ideas 
do you guys have?

94
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,940
So what kind of...
 So you play football...

95
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,180
What kind of padding right 
now is inside of the helmet?

96
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,780
I mean they're not soft.

97
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,140
It's like it's air glove.

98
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,620
It's almost like a hard 
balloon stuck to your head.

99
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,180
So it's just one on the side 
and the whole top is full.

100
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,700
and one on the other side 
and one in the back.

101
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,300
But that's it. I mean, you could 
actually feel the hit.

102
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,620
But it... you just 
don't get a concussion, unless
you're heavy.

103
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,620
So have 
you ever been hit?

104
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,460
Have you ever had 
a helmet to helmet contact?

105
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,340
So where did you get hit?

106
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,140
My head

107
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,980
Almost like right here.

108
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,300
On top of your head.
-Right, but there's padding there.

109
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,660
Oh, but you said 
you could still feel it.

110
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,180
I mean, I could feel it for like 
a quick couple of seconds or so.

111
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,940
Then it just goes away.

112
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,860
It's because of 
the padding, I guess.

113
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,740
It's... umm...

114
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,620
It's like (unintelligible)

115
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,020
So is there any 
way that you would change

116
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,820
the design of the 
helmet that you have now?

117
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,980
Um...more cushion.

118
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,420
Okay. So that's 
kind of going back to

119
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,700
what Angel was talking about.

120
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,100
So how can 
we change the design

121
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,300
to make it more cushiony, but...

122
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,980
Because if you have 
something that's too cushiony,

123
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,180
right, is that going 
to decrease the time?

124
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,700
or increase the time 
and decrease the force?

125
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,380
if it's really cushiony?

126
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,220
Oh, that's really cushiony? 
-Yeah

127
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,820
Oh, you mean 
like it will just go...

128
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,140
Yeah.
-No.

129
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,780
Right. So you're saying 
you want it more cushiony,

130
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,980
you're saying you want it cheaper, 
you're saying you want it smaller.

131
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:48,700
I think like what Matt's kind of saying is more 
for comfort than for safety. -Right. Right.

132
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:53,900
So why... So can you relate sort of to what 
Angel's saying and why if it is more cushiony

133
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,300
it would be more dangerous.

134
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,180
Umm, with the head rattling?

135
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,100
Like if it hits on this side, 
it's quicker to hit the other side.

136
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,980
Is that what you mean?

137
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,580
what? So how...?

138
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,580
So think about how 
the padding is right now.

139
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,180
How it's stiff

140
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,020
compared to something 
that kind of gave.

141
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,980
So think about 
relating this back to force

142
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,980
times the change in time.

143
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,620
You can ask...

144
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,140
If it's built too soft, it's 
going to hit you with a stronger force...

145
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,540
So what could 
happen to the time?

146
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,460
It's going to be slower, it's going to be faster.

147
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,180
It's going to be faster, so what's 
going to happen to the force?

148
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,460
The force is going to increase... 
So it's going to hurt even

149
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,300
more and it will 
be more dangerous.

150
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,860
So what you need is like a stable
material that

151
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,300
not too soft, but at the same time

152
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,060
So besides Kevlar,
which you brought up which is

153
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,540
I was thinking like (unintelligible)

154
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,380
like for example 
when you are hit

155
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,980
and you're hit you want that

156
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,780
like bulletproof

157
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:12,860
(unintelligible) that the force spreads in 
all the space of the body of the helmet. So is you are
hit here, all the force is not concentrated in this place, 
but is moving over all the helmet.

158
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,180
So it displaces the 
force so it's not on one area.

159
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,780
So I was like 
thinking like maybe

160
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,820
like this big, the helmet

161
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,580
then in the middle like

162
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,780
like a wave

163
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,140
like when it hits, 
it spreads to all the helmet.

164
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:36,100
So that's you versus less (unintelligible)

165
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,620
you spread all the 
force on your head

166
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,180
so you have like less

167
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,300
(unintelligible)

168
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,100
Something that will 
transfer the motion

169
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,180
Yeah.

170
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,500
I like this idea.

171
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,140
But what I was thinking is that
we could put layers

172
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,380
so instead of hitting

173
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,660
the helmet right away

174
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,820
you hit something cushiony first

175
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,980
so have something 
cushiony on the outside

176
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,380
so that it takes time 
for you to hit the helmet.

177
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,460
And once you hit the 
helmet, the small cushiony

178
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,220
so that it takes 
time for that to hit

179
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,820
the other hard part

180
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:12,020
which would then hit cushion again 
and then hit you.

181
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,020
So kind of 
like an atmosphere.

182
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,660
Yeah, it will have 
like little layers

183
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,540
It will probably have to make 
the helmet a little bit like bigger.

184
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,660
But not like... 
Don't make it like huge,

185
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,020
but have layers on there.

186
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,820
and then incorporate his idea 
when you're making waves.

187
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:31,140
So something 
like that first layer

188
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:34,020
could help 
dissipate the force.

189
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,540
So we have cushiony 
against cushiony like boxers use.

190
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,620
And then they have the 
hard part on the bottom

191
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,380
when they do little wrapping.

192
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,740
So we have the
cushiony part first.

193
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,100
So it's going to take time and 
I think that's what they use.

194
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,220
They put cushion on there,

195
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,900
so that it takes time for you 
to actually feel the force.

196
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,700
So that the force will be less.

197
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,340
And if you have 
cushion with cushion

198
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,180
It's because you 
are increasing the time.

199
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,060
Yeah, because if you have two 
helmets that are hitting each other,

200
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,300
that are cushion and cushion,

201
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,700
it will take longer for 
them to hit each other.

202
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,780
And then the force 
will be decreased.

203
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,700
My question for Matt is- 
How big is the helmet?

204
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,820
Oh! The padding?

205
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,500
It's like thick. 
It's kind of thick.

206
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,860
That's just the padding 
and then you have the helmet,

207
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,780
which is like that 
much more. -Yeah.

208
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:22,020
It's like that thick.

209
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,340
How heavy is the helmet?

210
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,260
Like when you're wearing it, 
does it feeling like it's weighing you down?

211
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:31,420
Yeah, it takes time to get used to it. 
And that day, you're neck will hurt.

212
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,460
That's how heavy it is.

213
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,460
Another version of like 
what we are trying to do.

214
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,820
I think it'd also be cool.

215
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,980
Maybe like helmet 
were like it was fitted to like the head

216
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,900
and then it'd have like
inbetween kind of like a net structure.

217
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,300
which is a part of uh...

218
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,660
kind of like what he had

219
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,620
but something that is hung.

220
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,420
I want to kind of 
imagine it like the bridges.

221
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,860
How they have like

222
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,860
a whole bunch of 

223
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,140
little columns

224
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,500
But just a whole bunch that

225
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,860
is attached to the 
outside of the helmet.

226
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,700
I will draw it, and I'll show you guys.

227
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,860
You had your hand up, do you want 
to share while he...?

228
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,700
Yeah I was wondering, since 
we're talking about the injuries

229
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,860
and can you guys give an example of the 
type of brain damage that you can get?

230
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,420
Just like an actual name.

231
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,940
Like I heard concussion.

232
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,660
Other injuries, other names.

233
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,340
Can you tell...

234
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,460
What a concussion is?

235
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,220
What is a concussion? Ask the group.

236
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,940
Well, a concussion is when...

237
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,660
It's when you...

238
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,380
your brain between your 
actual brain and your skull

239
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,060
There is a liquid, 
like Spinal fluid, is it?

240
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,260
and that's supposed 
to cushion your brain from

241
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,980
touching the, or hitting, your skull.

242
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,300
But a concussion is when it's 
hitting and it's going back and forth.

243
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,060
I mean gradually it will

244
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,340
go back to normal but...

245
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,060
That's my understanding
 of concussion.

246
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:05,860
And you would have lost like feeling
for like one or two seconds

247
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,980
on the biggest 
areas of the impact

248
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,700
So what part do you think 
is the most dangerous part

249
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,980
to hit of your brain, 
on your brain?

250
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,020
The sides.

251
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,980
What do the sides control?

252
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,780
Well, it wasn't like that.

253
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,020
I thinking like in 
the structure of the...

254
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,220
of the skull.

255
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,340
So the sides, where 
the nerves enter, like

256
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,900
Your optic nerves?-Yeah.

257
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,380
So I think that's like less pain.

258
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:44,020
It's like a really big hit here 
 can kill a man.

259
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,580
So I think that hit is worst.

260
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,860
You're saying the skull 
is thinnest right there? -Yeah.

261
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,700
It's not as thick 
as the other parts.

262
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,940
It's thickest, like right here...

263
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,820
What does your 
frontal lobe control?

264
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,100
So that's what 
kind of separates us

265
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,180
from other species

266
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,020
is that we have the most 
developed frontal lobe.

267
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,900
And then on the sides is 
more of your sensory stuff.

268
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,060
and then in the back is your

269
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,540
actually your Occipital lobe

270
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,900
for your eyes is in 
the back, a long with

271
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,060
your movement, 
your cerebellum.

272
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:26,260
So different spots, 
that's why you have

273
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,380
padding here, and 
here and back here,

274
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,460
is to protect all sides of the brain.

275
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,340
So a concussion is just like your 
brain keeps vibrating, basically, after the blow?

276
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,060
So I like to think about it, and I meant to bring
this in 

277
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,300
and I apologize.

278
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,020
So if you have... 
Think about your Tupperware.

279
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,180
and inside the 
Tupperware you have an egg.

280
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,540
You just cracked 
a nice egg inside

281
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,460
and then you shake it.

282
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,620
So imagine 
that egg is your brain.

283
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,660
And that Tupperware is your skull.

284
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,940
So the harder you rattle it, 
what's going to happen to the egg?

285
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,500
It will break.

286
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,860
It's gonna break, right? The yolk's going to
break, right?

287
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,500
I mean your brain doesn't really break.

288
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,980
But you can think that

289
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,100
It's just kind 
of the movement.

290
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,940
Because if you think about 
what does Newton's first law say?

291
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,460
An object that's in motion will
stay in motion 
unless acted upon by outside force.

292
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,580
So if the brain...
If you get hit here,

293
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,020
which way is your 
brain going to go?

294
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,020
That way.

295
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:24,620
Until it hits the 
skull and then it's going to *thunk*

296
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,980
So that's what they 
call rattling your cage.

297
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,980
I was thinking of like 
when I play baseball,

298
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:35,020
when I swing the 
bat and I hit the ball, and my hands keep like,
I can feel it inside and

299
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,060
like even after 
a minute it will keep rattling.

300
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,420
So now take that 
and think about

301
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,460
how that would...

302
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,220
Okay! So David, can you uh...

303
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,940
Explain what you 
have so we can...

304
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,700
This is kind of like the bridge 
idea that I had where like

305
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,380
there's like different

306
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,260
columns that go around, like the frame.

307
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,420
So in this, it would kind of be like, 
the head goes right here

308
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,900
and the helmet's right here.

309
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,780
And these would be like some kind of
material that's bendable.

310
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,620
So, when something 
hits it, they would bend in

311
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,300
so, to absorb kind of the impact.

312
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,980
Kind of like a cage 
in the racing cars.

313
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,100
Like how racing cars have a cage

314
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,260
inside of them.

315
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,060
Just in case they roll over, 
the cage still protects the person.

316
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,580
Yeah kind of...
No, but...

317
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,420
Yeah kind of like that 
but these are like cushions.

318
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,540
Yeah. So they 
absorb the momentum.

319
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,460
So like a coil? Like for your bed. 
The bed spring

320
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,860
that when you jump up on it, 
you rebound back, so...

321
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,860
Wouldn't that be 
more dangerous if it's...?

322
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,860
elastic?

323
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,100
Yeah, it's elastic, and when we did the little 
cars

324
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,980
When it was elastic, 
it completely transferred

325
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,220
all of its momentum 
to the other car.

326
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,580
So when you get hit, 
it will just like swing

327
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,700
and then all the 
momentum will hit you.

328
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,140
instead of both 
of you sharing it.

329
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,380
So if you share, 
it'd probably be better.

330
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,940
But I don't know if that's...

331
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:07,780
(Multiple people talking)

332
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,260
Because I was also 
thinking of mattresses.

333
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,780
A little sleep mattresses.

334
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,500
and how they talked about the coils 
and how they give you pressure points

335
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,660
and it will be stronger 
over here than over here.

336
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,060
and then they have the new 
ones now that are like foam.

337
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,700
The Tempurpedic ones, Yeah.

338
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,020
So I was thinking also 
 if you like spread out...

339
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,180
where the momentum goes.

340
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:32,140
Saying if you spread out where 
it won't be in one certain area.

341
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,500
Then you won't get hit 
really hard right here.

342
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,140
And if you get hit 
hard like over here,

343
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,860
it'd probably be better 
than getting hit hard

344
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,980
just right there. -Yeah.

345
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,580
It will probably 
be less of a force.

346
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,020
So when they 
design like a helmet,

347
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,380
they've got one piece thing 
where it's like your body

348
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,260
their shoulder pads 
connected to their helmet.

349
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,660
So your body absorbs some of 
that too, instead of just your head.

350
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,860
So that depends 
how you turn your head

351
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,660
And would it be 
good if your body...

352
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,900
have you guys ever heard

353
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,060
that people who 
are like drunk drivers

354
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,580
they kind of walk 
away from a car crash

355
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,980
and it's the passengers or the victims

356
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,660
are the ones 
that get hurt the most...

357
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,300
So think about what's different between

358
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,980
their body in motion and 
the other person's body in motion.

359
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,900
So they're looser, right?

360
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,220
They're not tightening their muscles 
compared to someone who is

361
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,740
trying to absorb the impact.

362
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,740
We flex, right? 

363
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,980
Just waiting for it, and 
so, by being more rigid

364
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,380
your body doesn't move.

365
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,780
You're trying to 
fight against the motion.

366
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,020
So you get more of the whiplash

367
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:42,860
and stuff like that.

368
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,420
Because you... 
It hurt your body more

369
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,180
because you're 
trying to fight against

370
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,140
what you're body is 
actually going to do instead of

371
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,500
the other person 
who's just like really loose

372
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,900
is moving with it,

373
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,780
so there's not as much impact.

374
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,940
Well, I've been playing football

375
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,380
and how you play

376
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,540
like you want to win.

377
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,140
You hit someone you want to.

378
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,380
After that

379
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,180
you're still going and

380
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,740
if you are like losing

381
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:10,620
the other person is stronger than you
can beat you up like...

382
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,820
I know. What he 
is saying is like

383
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,660
if you see someone 
about to collide with you,

384
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,380
you want to hit 
him back instead of...

385
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:15,980
Yeah.

386
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:19,380
Why is that? 
Related that to momentum.

387
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,300
Because momentum 
is vector, right?

388
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,980
So you have to think 
about the direction

389
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,340
and of the way 
that things are moving.

390
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,780
So think back to...

391
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,660
When we were playing 
with different cars.

392
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,460
So you had the greater mass 
in one car going this way.

393
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,740
And had the smaller 
mass going this way.

394
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,500
Right?

395
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,540
So what would you want to 
do to the smaller mass

396
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,260
car to make sure that

397
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,220
the impact of the....

398
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,860
Raise his speed

399
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,020
Increase the speed, right?

400
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,300
And so by knowing that 
you're going to get hit

401
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,700
you're going to 
run a little faster.

402
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,820
So then what was the...

403
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,500
what is the ending result there?

404
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,500
So like if you have more speed

405
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,260
you hit the other object

406
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,500
that has more mass

407
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:04,420
Mean like.... 
how do you think is like...

408
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,740
Inelastic, I don't know, like

409
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,220
So what's going to happen?

410
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,740
Are they going to 
stay stuck together?

411
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,100
(Multiple people speaking)

412
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,660
So it's elastic

413
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,340
so it comes off, right?

414
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,020
Think about it 
like a rubber band,

415
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,020
an elastic rubber band.

416
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,380
You can stretch it, so...

417
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,220
elastic is, is saying, something 
that's going to rebound.

418
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,340
whereas inelastic 
you're just rigid.

419
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,220
There is no motion, 
I guess, you should say.

420
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,020
I thought that was inelastic, when you 
hit something, it will both go off

421
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,900
completely and 
elastic it will stick together.

422
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,000
And inelastics magnets.
