1
00:00:00,129 --> 00:00:03,126
- [Voiceover] Who came up with
the definition for radiation?

2
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:06,263
Peter, you had a good definition,

3
00:00:06,263 --> 00:00:08,119
could you repeat that, remind us?

4
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:11,810
- I don't remember it
exactly, but it was something

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:15,554
along the lines of anything
with waves that move,

6
00:00:15,554 --> 00:00:18,019
waves that are radiated, I mean.

7
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:19,858
- [Girl in purple] Didn't
you say it was waves

8
00:00:19,858 --> 00:00:21,647
that are spread?

9
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:23,306
- Yeah, waves that are
spread by something,

10
00:00:23,306 --> 00:00:25,526
and they usually have energy with them.

11
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:29,426
Like, the sun sends its
radiation to the earth,

12
00:00:29,426 --> 00:00:33,900
in the form of light, heat, UVA, UVB rays.

13
00:00:37,076 --> 00:00:39,350
- [Voiceover] Okay, so
with that understanding,

14
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,664
would you guys say that
all radiation is harmful?

15
00:00:43,664 --> 00:00:45,076
- [Voiceover] Not all.

16
00:00:45,076 --> 00:00:47,045
- Yes.

17
00:00:47,045 --> 00:00:50,877
To a degree, all of radiation is harmful.

18
00:00:50,877 --> 00:00:54,080
But just, it depends on how harmful.

19
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,461
- But so then, what is
like, when it's not harmful?

20
00:00:58,461 --> 00:01:00,805
- It's very, very, very.

21
00:01:00,805 --> 00:01:02,164
- Not, almost?

22
00:01:02,164 --> 00:01:03,953
- It's almost negligible.

23
00:01:06,245 --> 00:01:09,504
- [Voiceover] What types
of waves that radiate,

24
00:01:09,504 --> 00:01:12,000
or what types of radiation
do you associate with

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,094
being not harmful?
- [Peter] Radio waves.

26
00:01:14,094 --> 00:01:16,992
(students agreeing)

27
00:01:17,992 --> 00:01:20,153
- [Voiceover] Any others, Jordan?

28
00:01:20,153 --> 00:01:22,510
- Microwaves?

29
00:01:24,647 --> 00:01:26,370
- [Voiceover] Visible light.

30
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,186
- Yeah, visible light
isn't really that harmful.

31
00:01:28,186 --> 00:01:29,758
- [Voiceover] What about
microwaves, that's a good one.

32
00:01:29,758 --> 00:01:31,269
What do you guys think about microwaves?

33
00:01:31,269 --> 00:01:32,226
- I thought they were dangerous,

34
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:33,322
but somebody told me that they weren't.

35
00:01:33,322 --> 00:01:35,277
- They're not really
that harmful are they?

36
00:01:35,277 --> 00:01:36,580
I mean--
(cross-talk)

37
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,021
- [Voiceover] You probably
shouldn't stand in front of it.

38
00:01:39,021 --> 00:01:40,990
- Saying they're not that harmful?

39
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,612
- They're not.

40
00:01:42,612 --> 00:01:45,870
I mean, I think probably
like extended exposure

41
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,741
to them would be bad,
but I think that could be

42
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:52,332
the same with a lot of things.

43
00:01:54,236 --> 00:01:56,621
- [Jordan] The door shuts when
you use the microwave too.

44
00:01:56,621 --> 00:02:00,448
- [Voiceover] What about
then, where do they fall on

45
00:02:00,448 --> 00:02:03,138
the spectrum, what makes you
think they're not dangerous?

46
00:02:03,138 --> 00:02:04,470
Or that they are?

47
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,936
- [Voiceover] Because they
are longer than light waves.

48
00:02:07,936 --> 00:02:09,877
- They've got longer wavelengths.

49
00:02:09,877 --> 00:02:11,597
- [Voiceover] Which what does that mean?

50
00:02:11,597 --> 00:02:14,093
- They have lower frequencies.

51
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:16,907
They don't carry as much energy with them.

52
00:02:16,907 --> 00:02:19,394
Lower frequencies.

53
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,067
- [Claire] Let me consult my chart.

54
00:02:24,067 --> 00:02:25,301
- [Voiceover] Okay, good idea.

55
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:26,410
Or can anyone help her?

56
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,129
What was your question Claire?

57
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:29,460
- Oh, I didn't have a question.

58
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,491
- [Voiceover] Oh, okay.

59
00:02:30,491 --> 00:02:31,670
- What was the question?

60
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,112
Why is she looking at her chart?

61
00:02:37,902 --> 00:02:40,118
- Nope, same (mumbles).

62
00:02:41,421 --> 00:02:43,474
- We think they're not
dangerous because they

63
00:02:43,474 --> 00:02:47,010
have a longer wavelength and a
smaller frequency than light.

64
00:02:49,228 --> 00:02:51,202
Light is (mumbles).

65
00:02:51,202 --> 00:02:54,058
- [Voiceover] Okay good, so
I think this is a good segue

66
00:02:54,058 --> 00:02:56,512
to the next question,
which is, why are some

67
00:02:56,512 --> 00:02:59,979
electromagnetic waves
considered dangerous to humans,

68
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,213
while others aren't?

69
00:03:01,213 --> 00:03:02,752
- Do you know what a segue is?

70
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:08,271
- [Voiceover] Okay.

71
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:11,612
Which ones have more energy than others?

72
00:03:11,612 --> 00:03:15,911
- Gamma rays and X-rays, and UVH rays?

73
00:03:18,102 --> 00:03:19,558
- [Voiceover] Okay good,
Peter did you have something

74
00:03:19,558 --> 00:03:21,457
you wanted to add?

75
00:03:21,457 --> 00:03:23,177
- To what he just said?

76
00:03:23,177 --> 00:03:24,868
- [Voiceover] Mm-hmm.

77
00:03:28,473 --> 00:03:30,789
Okay, good, and,

78
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:32,453
can you repeat that, Sam?

79
00:03:32,453 --> 00:03:36,737
- Some electromagnetic
waves are more dangerous

80
00:03:36,737 --> 00:03:38,637
because they have much more energy.

81
00:03:38,637 --> 00:03:39,844
- [Voiceover] Okay, good.

82
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:42,229
So ultimately, what is that energy doing?

83
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:44,530
Why is that harmful to us?

84
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:51,144
- Can stimulate cell growth (mumbles).

85
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,117
- The more energy it has the more like,

86
00:03:59,117 --> 00:04:01,114
materials it can penetrate.

87
00:04:01,114 --> 00:04:04,608
Like visible light wouldn't
really cut through you,

88
00:04:04,608 --> 00:04:08,380
but gamma rays could,
like travel through skin.

89
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,557
And X-rays can.

90
00:04:10,557 --> 00:04:12,914
- [Voiceover] What did you guys learn about

91
00:04:12,914 --> 00:04:14,911
perhaps in biology?

92
00:04:14,911 --> 00:04:17,684
Cancer (mumbles).

93
00:04:19,348 --> 00:04:22,052
- Well that it's, when cells grow too fast,

94
00:04:22,052 --> 00:04:26,711
the abnormal growth of
cells keep reproducing and...

95
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:30,455
- There's a mistake in
the coding of the DNA,

96
00:04:30,455 --> 00:04:33,866
and then everything just goes haywire and,

97
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:37,720
the cells, like what Caleb
said, grow at abnormally

98
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,185
fast rates, and they just
take over that area and spread.

99
00:04:42,185 --> 00:04:45,485
- Well yeah, they stop
functioning as normal cells,

100
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,718
and their sole function is to reproduce,

101
00:04:47,718 --> 00:04:49,285
and to continue growing and then

102
00:04:49,285 --> 00:04:52,127
they eat portions of other cells.

103
00:04:52,127 --> 00:04:54,692
- [Voiceover] Okay, so what
do electromagnetic waves

104
00:04:54,692 --> 00:04:57,521
have to do with this extra energy?

105
00:04:57,521 --> 00:04:59,310
This dangerous energy?

106
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,445
- Well wouldn't like, Cho
said they would like stimulate

107
00:05:01,445 --> 00:05:04,551
the growth and, or is that not?

108
00:05:04,551 --> 00:05:06,284
- Why do they stimulate growth?

109
00:05:06,284 --> 00:05:07,643
- [Cho] Because they have energy.

110
00:05:07,643 --> 00:05:09,903
- What does the energy do to stimulate it?

111
00:05:09,903 --> 00:05:11,595
- [Voiceover] What were
you going to say, Ronnie?

112
00:05:11,595 --> 00:05:13,009
- Well, I just said that they trigger,

113
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:16,850
they don't like stimulate, I
mean cell growth to an extent

114
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,526
is necessary (mumbles).

115
00:05:19,526 --> 00:05:22,979
But they can trigger something dangerous,

116
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:25,572
like with (mumbles).

117
00:05:25,572 --> 00:05:29,094
I don't really have like
the percent (mumbles)

118
00:05:29,094 --> 00:05:31,160
or anything but...

119
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,834
- [Voiceover] What else
might control cell growth?

120
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,068
- DNA?

121
00:05:36,068 --> 00:05:38,301
- [Voiceover] Okay good, yeah.

122
00:05:39,845 --> 00:05:44,130
- Lots of energy can.
Can energy alter DNA?

123
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,847
I feel like it can't.

124
00:05:49,777 --> 00:05:52,352
- Well, isn't that what it's doing if it's

125
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,584
triggering abnormal cell growth?

126
00:05:54,584 --> 00:05:56,332
- I don't know.

127
00:06:00,145 --> 00:06:02,502
- [Voiceover] Is anyone
in here, have you taken,

128
00:06:02,502 --> 00:06:05,608
or are you taking (mumbles) biology?

129
00:06:05,608 --> 00:06:07,688
- I took it last year.

130
00:06:07,688 --> 00:06:10,600
I kind of remember what we
talked about with cancer.

131
00:06:13,234 --> 00:06:15,619
- [Voiceover] It's okay,
and you guys have actually

132
00:06:15,619 --> 00:06:18,892
come to a good conclusion,
that it does lie in the DNA,

133
00:06:18,892 --> 00:06:23,440
and that, you know, certain
types of radiation can

134
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,546
cause mutations in DNA

135
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,234
that affect the cell cycle.

136
00:06:34,756 --> 00:06:37,709
So, when we think about
cancer a lot of times,

137
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:39,526
in light, or electromagnetic waves,

138
00:06:39,526 --> 00:06:42,505
a lot of times we
think about skin cancer.

139
00:06:42,505 --> 00:06:45,817
And we talked a bit about that yesterday.

140
00:06:47,516 --> 00:06:50,516
We also probably notice
skin variations among

141
00:06:50,516 --> 00:06:54,230
different people from
different regions of the world.

142
00:06:55,094 --> 00:06:59,347
So, how does skin color
variation, how do you think

143
00:06:59,347 --> 00:07:02,935
it relates to the amount of UV radiation

144
00:07:02,935 --> 00:07:07,670
that a particular population receives?

145
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,828
- [Caleb] You mean based on their race?

146
00:07:11,828 --> 00:07:15,416
- [Voiceover] Just based on
their geologic background.

147
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,968
Geographic background, not geologic.

148
00:07:17,968 --> 00:07:20,273
- Well I mean, people with
darker skin tend to not get

149
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:24,402
sunburned as much as somebody
with really, really pale skin.

150
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,397
- I don't think that's
true, I think it's just that

151
00:07:26,397 --> 00:07:28,238
it doesn't show up as much,
like you can definitely

152
00:07:28,238 --> 00:07:29,599
still get sun damage--

153
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,099
- No, of course you can
still get sunburned,

154
00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:32,527
but I don't think it's like--

155
00:07:32,527 --> 00:07:33,981
- [Sam] It's harder?

156
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:35,126
- I think so.

157
00:07:35,126 --> 00:07:36,162
- [Voiceover] I think
it's just less noticeable.

158
00:07:36,162 --> 00:07:37,848
- Yeah, I think it's just less noticeable,

159
00:07:37,848 --> 00:07:40,276
I really don't think it
has anything to do with--

160
00:07:40,276 --> 00:07:41,652
(cross-talk)

161
00:07:44,775 --> 00:07:46,956
- [Voiceover] Okay, so you're
getting the same amount,

162
00:07:46,956 --> 00:07:50,420
good, you're getting the same
amount of radiation, sure.

163
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,359
- [Sam] Is sunburning caused
by like the amount of light

164
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:55,617
we absorb, our skin absorbs?

165
00:07:55,617 --> 00:07:58,169
- It's actually, it's in their,

166
00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:01,912
Grace and Lana's video.

167
00:08:01,912 --> 00:08:04,371
About how (mumbles).

168
00:08:04,371 --> 00:08:05,886
- What did we do?

169
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:07,124
- On your presentation about sunburn.

170
00:08:07,124 --> 00:08:09,539
How sunburn works.

171
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,488
I don't remember (mumbles).

172
00:08:21,739 --> 00:08:24,430
- [Voiceover] Okay, so ultimately I guess,

173
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,059
I'll restate the question.

174
00:08:27,059 --> 00:08:31,235
So, how does skin color relate to

175
00:08:31,235 --> 00:08:35,906
the amount of UV radiation a
certain population may receive?

176
00:08:38,237 --> 00:08:41,624
We see a lot of variation, so
a lot of people often times

177
00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:45,274
say, "Oh, why do people in,

178
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:48,398
"in countries that are near the equator,

179
00:08:48,398 --> 00:08:51,429
"Why are they darker, wouldn't
that make them hotter?"

180
00:08:54,387 --> 00:08:59,096
Because we tend to think
of dark colors as absorbing

181
00:08:59,096 --> 00:09:02,406
a lot of different wavelengths of light.

182
00:09:04,404 --> 00:09:07,082
Is that true, is that what's happening?
It seems kind of...

183
00:09:08,441 --> 00:09:10,467
- Wouldn't that make you sweat more then?

184
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,049
Which would be good if it was hot.

185
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:15,648
- I guess sweat (mumbles).

186
00:09:18,126 --> 00:09:21,158
- [Cho] Sweat is just to
release the heat on your body.

187
00:09:21,158 --> 00:09:22,519
- No, but that's what I'm saying,

188
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:24,529
like if you get hotter quicker,

189
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:27,019
then you would start sweating earlier,

190
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:28,968
which cools you down.

191
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,391
- [Voiceover] What is the pigment in skin

192
00:09:44,391 --> 00:09:47,685
that causes color variations?

193
00:09:47,685 --> 00:09:50,394
- [Students] Melanin.

194
00:09:52,975 --> 00:09:56,099
- [Voiceover] Okay, good, alright.

195
00:09:56,099 --> 00:09:59,934
So, people who have darker skin,

196
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:01,929
do they have more or less?

197
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:04,017
- They have more.

198
00:10:04,017 --> 00:10:06,677
- It's in eyes, too, right?

199
00:10:06,677 --> 00:10:09,198
It's what causes eye color differences?

200
00:10:09,198 --> 00:10:11,023
Maybe I'm making that up, but...

201
00:10:19,998 --> 00:10:21,111
- [Voiceover] What do
you think the purpose

202
00:10:21,111 --> 00:10:22,797
of the melanin is?

203
00:10:22,797 --> 00:10:25,627
Is it to absorb, Grace offered one theory,

204
00:10:25,627 --> 00:10:27,576
what's another theory too there?

205
00:10:27,576 --> 00:10:30,144
There are several different reasons.

206
00:10:30,144 --> 00:10:33,376
What does it do to UV light?

207
00:10:33,376 --> 00:10:36,701
What's different about people that live

208
00:10:36,701 --> 00:10:40,398
say, in the equator regions,

209
00:10:40,398 --> 00:10:43,939
like the (mumbles) and
people who live up north?

210
00:10:43,939 --> 00:10:47,280
- They don't get sunburned
if they live there.  I mean...

211
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,921
- There's like nothing to (mumbles).

212
00:10:54,476 --> 00:10:55,899
- Yeah, exactly.

213
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:57,739
People who live in northern climates are

214
00:10:57,739 --> 00:10:59,595
much more likely to get sunburned,

215
00:10:59,595 --> 00:11:01,621
because they're not
exposed to that much sun,

216
00:11:01,621 --> 00:11:03,632
or their relatives weren't.

217
00:11:03,632 --> 00:11:06,400
And as they adapted they
just passed on that trait

218
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,983
of having fair skin.

219
00:11:08,983 --> 00:11:12,001
But, I don't know why.

220
00:11:24,109 --> 00:11:25,748
Do you know, Miss Roseborough?

221
00:11:25,748 --> 00:11:29,862
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I have
an understanding, yes.

222
00:11:29,862 --> 00:11:32,944
And when I think about
it, I kind of think about

223
00:11:32,944 --> 00:11:35,681
the actual pigment itself,
and what it's doing,

224
00:11:35,681 --> 00:11:38,372
and where it's located on the body.

225
00:11:38,372 --> 00:11:40,955
What it may be serving to do.

226
00:11:40,955 --> 00:11:43,724
- [Cho] Doesn't it
synthesize vitamin D for us?

227
00:11:47,904 --> 00:11:49,925
- That would make sense.

228
00:11:52,481 --> 00:11:56,181
- Yeah that's, vitamin D from sunlight,

229
00:11:56,181 --> 00:11:58,194
I guess that's why.

230
00:12:00,156 --> 00:12:03,156
- [Voiceover] Okay, so
people who have more melanin

231
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:07,362
have, live in the sun,

232
00:12:07,362 --> 00:12:09,513
you know they have more
exposure to the sun.

233
00:12:09,513 --> 00:12:13,395
Why do they need that extra melanin?

234
00:12:13,395 --> 00:12:15,312
- [Girl in bandana] To protect them.

235
00:12:15,312 --> 00:12:18,143
- [Voiceover] Okay yeah,
so let's go with that,

236
00:12:18,143 --> 00:12:19,550
to protect them.

237
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,555
From what?

238
00:12:20,555 --> 00:12:22,148
- From the radiation like,

239
00:12:22,148 --> 00:12:25,504
I guess if you're out in the sun more,

240
00:12:25,504 --> 00:12:27,793
you need more protection, so like,

241
00:12:27,793 --> 00:12:30,825
it's kind of like a built-in sunblock.

242
00:12:32,638 --> 00:12:34,463
- [Voiceover] What would it protect?

243
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:36,582
So, it's on the surface, right?

244
00:12:36,582 --> 00:12:39,180
- Protects the inner skin?

245
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:42,784
It protects the outer layer, right?

246
00:12:42,784 --> 00:12:44,500
- [Claire] Epidermis.

247
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,851
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I
feel like Ewan brought up

248
00:12:46,851 --> 00:12:49,856
something like this yesterday
when we were talking.

249
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:52,934
- Is that why they, you
have lighter on your hands?

250
00:12:52,934 --> 00:12:55,083
- Oh, I think that's the thing about like,

251
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,372
gamma rays, for example, being more,

252
00:12:57,372 --> 00:12:59,831
like that was one of
the (mumbles) question,

253
00:12:59,831 --> 00:13:02,491
because they have more ability
to penetrate through skin,

254
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:04,752
and (mumbles).

255
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,225
- [Voiceover] Okay, so
really what's happening is

256
00:13:10,225 --> 00:13:13,163
the melanin actually absorbs
the wavelengths of light

257
00:13:13,163 --> 00:13:16,365
that would normally penetrate the skin.

258
00:13:16,365 --> 00:13:18,313
- How does it do that?

259
00:13:18,313 --> 00:13:21,778
- [Voiceover] It just doesn't,
the energy is just sort of

260
00:13:21,778 --> 00:13:25,149
dissipated as heat, and so...

261
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:26,665
- You get the heat but not the radiation?

262
00:13:26,665 --> 00:13:28,583
- [Voiceover] Right,
exactly, so it doesn't go

263
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,129
further into your body.

264
00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:32,758
- So, darker people get less sunburned

265
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:35,682
than fairer people,

266
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:38,249
because of that?

267
00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:40,708
- Well, does it necessarily
have to do with sunburn?

268
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,630
- And they're less likely
to get skin cancer?

269
00:13:48,766 --> 00:13:50,343
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I'd say
they're less likely to get

270
00:13:50,343 --> 00:13:51,627
skin cancer.

271
00:13:51,627 --> 00:13:53,174
- When you get tan, are
you getting more melanin

272
00:13:53,174 --> 00:13:54,442
in your skin?

273
00:13:54,442 --> 00:13:56,576
- [Voiceover] Yeah, what's
happening when you get tan?

274
00:13:56,576 --> 00:13:58,958
- So, shouldn't tanning
make your skin stronger?

275
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,211
- Well--

276
00:14:00,211 --> 00:14:01,819
- If it increases melanin?

277
00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:04,711
- I don't think it's
necessarily increasing it.

278
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:06,644
- [Girl in bandana]
Because the tan goes away.

279
00:14:06,644 --> 00:14:07,743
- Oh.

280
00:14:07,743 --> 00:14:10,449
- So, it's like you have whatever
your natural skin color is,

281
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,403
then that is determined, how much.

282
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:17,106
- Okay.

283
00:14:22,442 --> 00:14:25,443
- [Voiceover] Okay, so next misconception,

284
00:14:25,443 --> 00:14:27,082
that a lot of people have,
or just something that

285
00:14:27,082 --> 00:14:28,799
I've always wondered about.

286
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:30,624
I don't know if it's a
misconception or not,

287
00:14:30,624 --> 00:14:33,686
but I'm thinking about
colors that we associate

288
00:14:33,686 --> 00:14:36,810
with certain, just everyday things.

289
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:40,012
So, when I go into the bathroom,
when I go into the kitchen,

290
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,740
I see red and

291
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,739
that indicates the faucet that I turn

292
00:14:45,739 --> 00:14:49,375
for hot water, and blue for cold water.

293
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:52,546
Why do you think those
colors were chosen and

294
00:14:52,546 --> 00:14:53,891
is that always true?

295
00:14:53,891 --> 00:14:56,971
- [Students] Because fire is red.

296
00:14:58,627 --> 00:15:00,746
- Water and ice is blue.

297
00:15:00,746 --> 00:15:03,344
It's not really blue, it's more clear.

298
00:15:03,344 --> 00:15:07,072
- White and blue flames are
much hotter than red flames.

299
00:15:09,219 --> 00:15:11,215
- [Voiceover] Yeah, explain that.

300
00:15:11,215 --> 00:15:13,102
- [Caleb] I don't know, I guess back,

301
00:15:13,102 --> 00:15:15,329
a long time ago before they knew that--

302
00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:17,989
- The hottest part of
the fire is at the top,

303
00:15:17,989 --> 00:15:19,845
and if you think about
a flame, usually you see a

304
00:15:19,845 --> 00:15:22,768
little blue or white part at the bottom,

305
00:15:22,768 --> 00:15:24,794
and then it's the red orange at the top.

306
00:15:24,794 --> 00:15:26,171
- Which is where it would be the hottest.

307
00:15:26,171 --> 00:15:27,826
- It's hottest at the top.

308
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:30,919
- But there's, at the top it
would be starting to cool off

309
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:32,203
as it gets away from--

310
00:15:32,203 --> 00:15:34,491
- At the peak it's the hottest.

311
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:37,105
But then the bunsen burner,
the hottest part is like...

312
00:15:37,105 --> 00:15:40,708
- Yeah, the hottest part
of the flame is the top.

313
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,736
- You get a marshmallow,
you put it at the bottom?

314
00:15:48,736 --> 00:15:50,576
- No, sir!

315
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:52,973
- [Voiceover] What color
is at the top, guys?

316
00:15:52,973 --> 00:15:54,287
- [Students] Red.

317
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,308
- [Girl in bandana] White.

318
00:15:55,308 --> 00:15:56,653
- Or orange.

319
00:15:56,653 --> 00:16:00,430
(cross-talk)

320
00:16:02,499 --> 00:16:04,896
- Blue and white at the bottom.

321
00:16:05,896 --> 00:16:07,495
- It's an experiment, Miss Rose,

322
00:16:07,495 --> 00:16:09,645
let's do experiments on fire.

323
00:16:09,645 --> 00:16:12,027
- [Voiceover] That's a good idea,

324
00:16:12,027 --> 00:16:14,424
I think we should at this point.

325
00:16:14,424 --> 00:16:16,914
- Do you have bunsen burners in here?

326
00:16:16,914 --> 00:16:19,852
- [Voiceover] No, I
don't have a gas source.

327
00:16:19,852 --> 00:16:23,286
So, let's just go back,
I even broke it down,

328
00:16:23,286 --> 00:16:25,033
and I was thinking about well,

329
00:16:25,033 --> 00:16:26,719
where did this come from?

330
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:30,044
I was thinking, what wavelengths of light

331
00:16:30,044 --> 00:16:32,875
are being absorbed by the color red,

332
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,643
and what are being
reflected by the color red?

333
00:16:35,643 --> 00:16:39,773
And so is the color red actually hotter?

334
00:16:39,773 --> 00:16:41,690
How could I relate that to temperature?

335
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:44,861
How do you even relate
a color to temperature?

336
00:16:44,861 --> 00:16:49,408
So, just the color red,
what's it reflecting?

337
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,728
What's it absorbing?

338
00:16:51,728 --> 00:16:54,929
- What color does it reflect?

339
00:16:56,929 --> 00:16:58,071
It reflects red.

340
00:16:59,074 --> 00:17:01,487
- And it absorbs green and blue.

341
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,361
Or cyan.

342
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:08,121
- [Voiceover] Right, so,

343
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:11,895
going back to the, what
makes it that color,

344
00:17:11,895 --> 00:17:14,903
its natural frequency,

345
00:17:14,903 --> 00:17:18,274
what types of waves are causing it

346
00:17:18,274 --> 00:17:22,110
to change in temperature?

347
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,795
What's happening as a result of

348
00:17:28,795 --> 00:17:32,538
different white light say, striking it,

349
00:17:32,538 --> 00:17:36,714
and its actual reflection and absorption

350
00:17:36,714 --> 00:17:39,157
of different waves of light?

351
00:17:39,157 --> 00:17:42,297
Would red or blue actually be hotter?

352
00:17:42,297 --> 00:17:45,452
As a pigment?

353
00:17:47,304 --> 00:17:51,387
- Blue should be hotter,
because it has more energy,

354
00:17:51,387 --> 00:17:55,254
it has the shorter wavelength
and greater frequency.

355
00:17:55,254 --> 00:17:56,738
- Yeah, Sam's right.

356
00:17:56,738 --> 00:17:58,254
- [Voiceover] So, with a pigment?

357
00:17:58,254 --> 00:18:01,177
Think about a pigment first.

358
00:18:07,816 --> 00:18:10,371
- What about it, just think about it?

359
00:18:10,371 --> 00:18:12,234
- [Voiceover] Yeah, so
certain wavelengths of light

360
00:18:12,234 --> 00:18:14,322
are being absorbed, and certain,

361
00:18:14,322 --> 00:18:17,585
wavelengths of light are being reflected.

362
00:18:17,585 --> 00:18:20,926
What does it mean when a pigment

363
00:18:20,926 --> 00:18:23,184
absorbs wavelengths of light?

364
00:18:23,184 --> 00:18:26,509
What happens to the energy
that is being absorbed?

365
00:18:27,509 --> 00:18:30,185
- It transfers to the medium?

366
00:18:30,185 --> 00:18:33,078
- [Voiceover] Okay, good.

367
00:18:34,078 --> 00:18:37,254
- I was going to say the pigment has the same

368
00:18:37,254 --> 00:18:38,873
frequency as those wavelengths, so...

369
00:18:38,873 --> 00:18:40,919
- [Peter] Probably right.

370
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,283
- [Voiceover] Okay good, so it absorbs,

371
00:18:46,283 --> 00:18:48,510
so let's think about blue again.

372
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,289
How could you apply that?

373
00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:54,202
What wavelengths of light does it absorb?

374
00:18:54,202 --> 00:18:57,434
- [Peter] Shorter wavelengths than red.

375
00:18:57,434 --> 00:19:00,017
- Well no, blue absorbs red and green,

376
00:19:00,017 --> 00:19:01,873
so this would be,

377
00:19:01,873 --> 00:19:05,476
longer wavelengths and lower frequencies.

378
00:19:05,476 --> 00:19:09,281
- So, red would absorb the blue.

379
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:13,055
Therefore it would absorb
the higher frequency,

380
00:19:13,055 --> 00:19:16,318
had more energy, which means
it would be hotter, right?

381
00:19:16,318 --> 00:19:18,715
- [Voiceover] What do you guys think?

382
00:19:18,715 --> 00:19:21,128
Can you restate that?

383
00:19:21,128 --> 00:19:24,036
- Sorry, because red absorbs blue,

384
00:19:24,036 --> 00:19:26,990
and blue has a higher frequency,

385
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:30,253
the red would be absorbing
the higher frequency,

386
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:32,418
which means it would
be getting more energy

387
00:19:32,418 --> 00:19:34,429
from the higher frequency.

388
00:19:34,429 --> 00:19:37,027
So, red would be the hottest.

389
00:19:37,027 --> 00:19:39,610
- The man has a point.

390
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,636
I agree with Peter.

391
00:19:41,636 --> 00:19:43,894
- I agree with it, too.

392
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,483
- I agree with Peter.

393
00:19:49,483 --> 00:19:52,979
- [Voiceover] Yeah, that's sort
of the conclusion I came to, the only conclusion.

394
00:19:52,979 --> 00:19:56,582
Then I started thinking more, I was like,

395
00:19:56,582 --> 00:19:58,933
well how does this apply to stars?

396
00:19:58,933 --> 00:20:00,900
So, if I see a star that gives off a...
