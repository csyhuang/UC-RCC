1
00:00:00,288 --> 00:00:11,698
(Background chatter)

2
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:12,658
- Alright.

3
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:14,748
I heard the term velocity.

4
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:16,978
So, I think that sounds pretty good.

5
00:00:19,008 --> 00:00:19,668
(teacher murmurs)

6
00:00:19,668 --> 00:00:21,178
Velocity of a skateboarder,

7
00:00:21,448 --> 00:00:22,828
the more important you're going to have.

8
00:00:23,448 --> 00:00:24,428
I like velocity.

9
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:27,988
Keep talking amongst yourselves.

10
00:00:27,988 --> 00:00:30,148
I'm just kind of here to guide you along.

11
00:00:31,718 --> 00:00:33,868
Make sure the people here,

12
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:35,428
I don't want anyone to have
their back to each other.

13
00:00:35,428 --> 00:00:37,508
I know the room is difficult to do that,

14
00:00:37,508 --> 00:00:41,168
but if you guys could try to
make sure you look at everyone

15
00:00:41,168 --> 00:00:42,468
inside of the group.

16
00:00:42,468 --> 00:00:43,540
I know it's difficult.

17
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:43,820
- Wait.

18
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:44,350
The whole class?

19
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:45,410
- Oh, yeah.

20
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:46,780
I want the whole class to discuss this.

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,200
- I thought you were doing
like table and table?

22
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:48,900
No, no, no.

23
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,920
I want everyone to talk.

24
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:50,600
Sorry.

25
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:50,890
- Okay.

26
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,040
- You guys can talk, just
like I talk across the room.

27
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,210
Feel free to do so.

28
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,460
(students murmur)

29
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,441
- [Teacher] So, someone,
when we ask their velocity.

30
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:06,741
- [Student] You need more
length to the tracks.

31
00:01:07,761 --> 00:01:08,360
- [Student] Steeper.

32
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,760
- [Teacher] You don't
have to raise your hand.

33
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,900
If you're looking in that person's eye,

34
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,840
or you're looking in my eye,

35
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,141
feel free to....

36
00:01:14,631 --> 00:01:15,700
- [Student] You need a longer track.

37
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:18,400
- [Student] Distance.

38
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,121
(students murmur)

39
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:26,790
- Is it the friction?

40
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,451
(student murmurs)

41
00:01:28,451 --> 00:01:29,241
- [Teacher] I will tell you that we're

42
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:30,510
not going to look at friction

43
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,540
as part of the system.

44
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:47,150
(students murmur)

45
00:01:48,085 --> 00:01:50,064
- Let's look back at that
proposal for one second.

46
00:01:50,064 --> 00:01:52,245
Just want to make sure
I didn't miss anything.

47
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:54,594
(students murmur)

48
00:01:54,594 --> 00:01:57,304
It's always good to look
at what they give us.

49
00:01:57,544 --> 00:02:02,544
(students murmur)

50
00:02:03,235 --> 00:02:03,855
Let's see.

51
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:05,184
What science terms are in there?

52
00:02:07,634 --> 00:02:08,395
- [Student] Quantitative.

53
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:08,865
Qualitative.

54
00:02:09,155 --> 00:02:09,584
- [Teacher] Okay.

55
00:02:09,584 --> 00:02:10,305
- [Student] Energy.

56
00:02:10,855 --> 00:02:11,165
- [Teacher] Oh.

57
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:12,724
We got energy in there.

58
00:02:12,724 --> 00:02:14,515
- [Student] Energy transfer.

59
00:02:14,515 --> 00:02:15,255
- [Teacher] Oh, energy transfer.

60
00:02:15,255 --> 00:02:15,695
Okay.

61
00:02:18,535 --> 00:02:21,564
So, I think they want
something to do with energy.

62
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:33,236
- It said quantitative.

63
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,081
We should probably use
the formulas for kinetic

64
00:02:35,081 --> 00:02:36,781
and potential energy, right?

65
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:37,961
- [Student] Do we have them?

66
00:02:38,361 --> 00:02:38,901
- Yeah.

67
00:02:38,901 --> 00:02:39,511
- [Student] We do?

68
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:42,091
- It's half mv squared, right?

69
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:43,221
And then...

70
00:02:44,241 --> 00:02:49,230
(students murmur)

71
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:56,762
- What Christina said, we're
going to be collecting data,

72
00:02:56,762 --> 00:02:57,702
quantitative,

73
00:02:58,032 --> 00:02:59,622
we'll probably have to use some formula

74
00:02:59,622 --> 00:03:00,622
that associates with this.

75
00:03:01,362 --> 00:03:02,102
- I agree.

76
00:03:02,572 --> 00:03:03,062
- Okay.

77
00:03:03,062 --> 00:03:03,331
- [Student] Okay.

78
00:03:03,331 --> 00:03:04,372
- [Student] He gave us the formula.

79
00:03:05,942 --> 00:03:20,402
(students murmur)

80
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,640
- E sub k 1/2 mv squared.

81
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,460
Energy due to the gravitational
field, E sub g mg.

82
00:03:34,195 --> 00:03:34,915
Alright.

83
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:36,071
Let's make sure we

84
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:39,772
know what each of these
letters stands for.

85
00:03:40,702 --> 00:03:44,882
M, mass and the unit.

86
00:03:46,381 --> 00:03:47,192
Kilogram.

87
00:03:49,422 --> 00:03:49,872
G?

88
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:53,801
(students murmur)

89
00:03:53,941 --> 00:03:54,972
- Acceleration due to gravity.

90
00:03:56,472 --> 00:03:58,341
- Lauren said force of gravity.

91
00:03:58,591 --> 00:04:01,661
(students murmur)

92
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:03,812
Okay.

93
00:04:03,812 --> 00:04:05,113
You want me to write that in?

94
00:04:05,113 --> 00:04:05,672
Which one is it?

95
00:04:05,672 --> 00:04:07,473
(students murmur)

96
00:04:07,473 --> 00:04:10,792
Oh, its the effect from
the gravitational field.

97
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,693
Okay, that's fine.

98
00:04:11,693 --> 00:04:13,953
You will sometimes see
textbooks that read

99
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:16,853
gravitational force, but
what are the units for this?

100
00:04:16,853 --> 00:04:20,053
(students murmur)

101
00:04:20,053 --> 00:04:21,293
Meters per second squared.

102
00:04:21,293 --> 00:04:22,552
So, that can be kind of confusing,

103
00:04:22,552 --> 00:04:24,392
if they're calling it gravitational force,

104
00:04:24,392 --> 00:04:26,413
and then they're saying
meters per second squared

105
00:04:26,413 --> 00:04:28,583
because what do you think
when you see those units?

106
00:04:29,463 --> 00:04:30,323
- Acceleration.

107
00:04:30,323 --> 00:04:31,374
- [Teacher] Acceleration, right.

108
00:04:31,374 --> 00:04:35,564
So, I'm going to put
acceleration due to gravity.

109
00:04:38,098 --> 00:04:38,348
Okay.

110
00:04:39,344 --> 00:04:39,614
Good.

111
00:04:41,494 --> 00:04:42,224
- [Student] H is height.

112
00:04:42,224 --> 00:04:43,384
- [Teacher] Yeah, h is height.

113
00:04:45,684 --> 00:04:46,454
And that's in?

114
00:04:46,504 --> 00:04:48,074
(students murmur)

115
00:04:48,074 --> 00:04:48,744
- Meters.

116
00:04:48,744 --> 00:04:49,234
Sounds good.

117
00:04:49,234 --> 00:04:49,814
Okay.

118
00:04:50,964 --> 00:04:52,284
So, now we go over here.

119
00:04:54,324 --> 00:04:58,295
Mass and kilograms and then,

120
00:04:59,455 --> 00:05:02,325
velocity, and that's in

121
00:05:02,365 --> 00:05:03,404
meters per second.

122
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:04,284
Good.

123
00:05:06,684 --> 00:05:08,264
And then, if you remember that

124
00:05:08,264 --> 00:05:09,924
force doesn't like careless errors,

125
00:05:09,924 --> 00:05:12,304
so, maybe we should make sure that we get

126
00:05:12,304 --> 00:05:14,665
from these fundamental
units the derived units.

127
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,724
So, what are the units
that we're going to have for

128
00:05:18,724 --> 00:05:20,064
E sub g and E sub k?

129
00:05:20,064 --> 00:05:22,074
(student murmurs)

130
00:05:22,074 --> 00:05:22,685
What is it?

131
00:05:22,685 --> 00:05:23,144
- [Students] Joules.

132
00:05:23,144 --> 00:05:23,494
- Joules.

133
00:05:23,494 --> 00:05:24,024
Oh, that's right.

134
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,315
How do you remember that?

135
00:05:25,315 --> 00:05:26,014
- [Student] I'm smart.

136
00:05:26,734 --> 00:05:27,254
- Okay.

137
00:05:27,254 --> 00:05:27,944
That's good, too.

138
00:05:28,124 --> 00:05:29,154
(teacher laughs)

139
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:31,717
(students murmur)

140
00:05:31,717 --> 00:05:33,717
- Oh, there was a pretest
that had that on there.

141
00:05:33,907 --> 00:05:34,937
That sounds good.

142
00:05:34,937 --> 00:05:36,787
(students murmur)

143
00:05:36,787 --> 00:05:37,237
- Okay.

144
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:37,627
Great.

145
00:05:37,627 --> 00:05:39,437
You're taking that prior knowledge.

146
00:05:39,437 --> 00:05:40,537
- [Student] Energy is a jewel.

147
00:05:41,447 --> 00:05:43,717
- Energy is a precious jewel.

148
00:05:43,717 --> 00:05:44,337
Alright.

149
00:05:44,337 --> 00:05:45,177
You want precious?

150
00:05:45,177 --> 00:05:46,057
Okay, there's jewels.

151
00:05:46,057 --> 00:05:48,347
There's semi-precious
and there's precious.

152
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,697
What are they, diamonds and rubies?

153
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:51,977
So, energy is a precious jewel.

154
00:05:52,927 --> 00:05:55,277
Kilogram times a meter per second squared.

155
00:05:57,707 --> 00:05:58,527
- [Student] Newton.

156
00:05:58,527 --> 00:05:58,927
- [Teacher] Newton.

157
00:05:58,927 --> 00:05:59,407
Good.

158
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:00,577
Newton times a meter?

159
00:06:01,017 --> 00:06:01,517
- A joule?

160
00:06:01,797 --> 00:06:02,217
- A joule.

161
00:06:02,217 --> 00:06:02,757
Right.

162
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:05,538
Over here, mass and kilograms.

163
00:06:06,998 --> 00:06:11,077
Kilogram times meters squared
over seconds squared,

164
00:06:11,077 --> 00:06:12,057
don't forget the square.

165
00:06:12,057 --> 00:06:13,677
Kilograms times a meter,

166
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:14,917
again is a newton.

167
00:06:16,057 --> 00:06:17,377
Newton times a meter,

168
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,998
that's going to be kilogram times a meter

169
00:06:18,998 --> 00:06:20,817
over seconds squared is a newton

170
00:06:21,227 --> 00:06:22,857
and then, multiply that by that meter,

171
00:06:23,577 --> 00:06:25,178
and, again, you get joules.

172
00:06:25,778 --> 00:06:26,037
Okay.

173
00:06:26,757 --> 00:06:27,877
We want to make sure that we don't,

174
00:06:28,417 --> 00:06:30,007
did everyone see how we
got that joule there?

175
00:06:30,244 --> 00:06:31,584
(students murmur)

176
00:06:32,074 --> 00:06:35,845
- Meter times another meter, right?

177
00:06:36,335 --> 00:06:36,624
- [Student] Yeah.

178
00:06:37,374 --> 00:06:39,144
- Because kilogram times a
meter per seconds squared

179
00:06:39,144 --> 00:06:39,804
gives me a newton.

180
00:06:40,714 --> 00:06:44,054
Times a meter, remember
this is meters squared,

181
00:06:44,054 --> 00:06:44,504
because of that.

182
00:06:45,564 --> 00:06:45,844
- Oh, okay.

183
00:06:45,844 --> 00:06:46,544
- Okay.

184
00:06:47,264 --> 00:06:49,084
So, you know the boss
doesn't like careless errors,

185
00:06:49,084 --> 00:06:52,004
so let's make sure that we
have the appropriate units.

186
00:06:52,414 --> 00:06:52,964
Okay.

187
00:06:52,964 --> 00:06:54,665
I don't mean to interrupt you guys.

188
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:56,164
Why don't you continue with that?

189
00:06:56,724 --> 00:06:58,394
You've got some formulas here now.

190
00:06:59,364 --> 00:07:00,784
- For potential energy,

191
00:07:02,674 --> 00:07:05,685
wouldn't mass and
acceleration due to gravity

192
00:07:05,685 --> 00:07:08,464
be constants, so height
is the only one that

193
00:07:08,464 --> 00:07:09,765
that could manipulate.

194
00:07:11,205 --> 00:07:15,154
So, if the height is the
greater distance from the Earth

195
00:07:15,154 --> 00:07:17,404
then it would have more potential energy

196
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:19,824
because they're directly proportional.

197
00:07:19,824 --> 00:07:21,215
(student murmurs)

198
00:07:22,785 --> 00:07:23,284
- [Student] Yes.

199
00:07:27,354 --> 00:07:28,387
- Let me ask you guys...

200
00:07:28,387 --> 00:07:31,037
I can't help but interrupt
once in a while, right?

201
00:07:31,037 --> 00:07:33,127
But, I just wanted to...

202
00:07:33,127 --> 00:07:34,727
If I put this marker on the table,

203
00:07:34,727 --> 00:07:37,207
does this marker have potential energy?

204
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,547
- What is the reference point?

205
00:07:38,547 --> 00:07:39,388
- Oh, oh, oh.

206
00:07:39,388 --> 00:07:40,147
The table.

207
00:07:40,147 --> 00:07:41,367
- No.

208
00:07:41,897 --> 00:07:42,887
- The center of our planet.

209
00:07:43,077 --> 00:07:44,007
- Yes.

210
00:07:44,007 --> 00:07:44,827
- Okay.

211
00:07:45,277 --> 00:07:47,307
So, I heard a fight, I
think that's a good thing.

212
00:07:51,227 --> 00:07:56,227
(students murmur)

213
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,775
- The more danger, the
more fun I thought, right?

214
00:07:59,075 --> 00:07:59,595
- Yes.

215
00:08:00,555 --> 00:08:01,455
- They're going to wear their headgear.

216
00:08:01,455 --> 00:08:02,455
Is this guy wearing any head,

217
00:08:02,455 --> 00:08:03,515
oh he's wearing head protection.

218
00:08:03,515 --> 00:08:04,535
(students murmur)

219
00:08:04,535 --> 00:08:05,775
Why is that important, by the way?

220
00:08:07,615 --> 00:08:09,215
- So, the force doesn't
apply to your head...

221
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,155
(student murmurs)

222
00:08:10,155 --> 00:08:11,175
- Okay, I like that.

223
00:08:11,175 --> 00:08:15,695
(student murmurs)

224
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:15,965
- Ah.

225
00:08:15,965 --> 00:08:17,315
Inversely proportional, right?

226
00:08:17,315 --> 00:08:18,235
I like that, yeah.

227
00:08:18,235 --> 00:08:19,615
So, it increases the amount of time,

228
00:08:19,615 --> 00:08:21,015
decreases the force.

229
00:08:21,015 --> 00:08:23,075
So, yeah, danger is an aspect here,

230
00:08:23,075 --> 00:08:26,695
but this guy seems like he's doing okay.

231
00:08:26,695 --> 00:08:27,755
He's got his headgear on,

232
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:30,955
but, that's definitely,

233
00:08:30,955 --> 00:08:32,455
if you're designing a park,

234
00:08:32,455 --> 00:08:33,755
you want to make sure

235
00:08:33,755 --> 00:08:35,295
that the people that visit the park

236
00:08:35,295 --> 00:08:36,655
aren't going to be injured.

237
00:08:37,675 --> 00:08:39,155
There are going to be
accidents with skateboards

238
00:08:39,155 --> 00:08:40,275
but they'll wear their gear.

239
00:08:42,205 --> 00:08:43,215
I'm going to step back

240
00:08:43,215 --> 00:08:45,445
and let you guys continue
your thought earlier.

241
00:08:45,445 --> 00:08:45,825
- [Student] Okay.

242
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:48,215
So, how high do we want the...

243
00:08:49,675 --> 00:08:54,025
- If we want it to have a
bigger potential energy,

244
00:08:54,025 --> 00:08:56,855
transferring the bigger kinetic energy,

245
00:08:56,855 --> 00:08:58,295
we might want to have the height

246
00:08:58,945 --> 00:09:00,395
from the reference point,

247
00:09:00,395 --> 00:09:03,045
which is the ground and kind of higher.

248
00:09:03,507 --> 00:09:04,647
- [Teacher] I heard reference point.

249
00:09:04,647 --> 00:09:07,237
Let me see if I can put a
reference point on this.

250
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:14,067
(students murmur)

251
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:16,497
I did just put a little, click a button

252
00:09:16,497 --> 00:09:17,877
and get the reference point, okay?

253
00:09:19,417 --> 00:09:20,977
- [Student] I think the thing
should be on the ground.

254
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,567
(student murmurs)

255
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:23,027
- [Student] Yeah.

256
00:09:24,157 --> 00:09:26,497
- The weight's, like it's
safer and it's possible.

257
00:09:26,497 --> 00:09:28,727
(students murmur)

258
00:09:28,727 --> 00:09:29,877
- Do you want me to just to extend the...

259
00:09:29,877 --> 00:09:34,187
(students murmur)

260
00:09:34,187 --> 00:09:35,797
We've got a couple of
things going on here.

261
00:09:35,797 --> 00:09:36,457
I'm sorry.

262
00:09:37,597 --> 00:09:38,217
A couple people said yes,

263
00:09:38,217 --> 00:09:40,267
they wanted me to put that on the ground?

264
00:09:40,817 --> 00:09:42,357
So, if those people could say that again,

265
00:09:42,897 --> 00:09:43,597
that would be great.

266
00:09:43,597 --> 00:09:44,397
Say that again?

267
00:09:44,397 --> 00:09:46,137
(students murmur)

268
00:09:46,137 --> 00:09:47,017
You want to put it on the ground.

269
00:09:47,017 --> 00:09:48,097
And, I think I heard

270
00:09:48,097 --> 00:09:49,997
a dissenting voice in the crowd.

271
00:09:49,997 --> 00:09:51,497
Someone that said something else?

272
00:09:51,907 --> 00:09:52,337
- [Student] I did.

273
00:09:52,707 --> 00:09:53,137
- Oh, okay.

274
00:09:53,947 --> 00:09:56,777
- [Student] I said that if
you increase the height,

275
00:09:56,777 --> 00:09:59,217
it's still possible to
have it above the ground

276
00:09:59,217 --> 00:10:02,057
because you would have two
supports on either side,

277
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:05,277
technically, you'd be
able to go back and forth.

278
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:12,297
(students murmur)

279
00:10:14,437 --> 00:10:16,807
- [Teacher] They haven't
brought in the supports

280
00:10:16,807 --> 00:10:18,177
for this herculean innovation.

281
00:10:18,177 --> 00:10:19,127
That's right.

282
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,457
I mean, I don't think it
really is going to affect

283
00:10:22,457 --> 00:10:24,017
the design structure, so...

284
00:10:24,017 --> 00:10:25,197
- Whether it's on the ground or...

285
00:10:25,197 --> 00:10:26,497
- [Teacher] I'll just pull that down.

286
00:10:26,497 --> 00:10:28,077
That's fine.

287
00:10:28,077 --> 00:10:29,417
(students murmur)

288
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:31,427
Yeah, I don't think that's
going to make a difference.

289
00:10:34,857 --> 00:10:36,357
That might make it easier for the person

290
00:10:36,357 --> 00:10:39,147
to step off the track,
too, when they're done.

291
00:10:39,177 --> 00:10:41,817
You know, this guy's
going to get really tired.

292
00:10:41,817 --> 00:10:43,377
There's no friction, so

293
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:45,487
he won't have to step off
on the nice safe track.

294
00:10:46,044 --> 00:10:48,514
- But, you notice how as
long as the track is longer

295
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:53,254
he doesn't go back up as
high, so if you have...

296
00:10:53,254 --> 00:10:55,604
(students murmur)

297
00:10:55,604 --> 00:10:55,894
- [Teacher] Alright.

298
00:10:55,894 --> 00:10:56,954
One at a time.

299
00:10:56,954 --> 00:10:57,994
I like this.

300
00:10:59,654 --> 00:11:01,214
Someone said something.
Christina said something,

301
00:11:01,214 --> 00:11:03,084
and I think Karuna wanted to add to that.

302
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,954
- He goes just as high...

303
00:11:04,954 --> 00:11:07,124
(student mumbles)

304
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:10,983
like there's no change because
there's no friction. So...

305
00:11:10,983 --> 00:11:12,963
- Yeah, then he doesn't go up to the top.

306
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:17,963
(animated conversation)

307
00:11:21,501 --> 00:11:26,501
(students murmur)

308
00:11:31,701 --> 00:11:33,651
- [Teacher] I could put
the pie chart in, sure.

309
00:11:34,091 --> 00:11:36,321
- And, can you start him at the top?

310
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,961
(students murmur)

311
00:11:38,961 --> 00:11:39,481
- [Teacher] Alright.

312
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:41,201
So, I'm going to put the pie chart in

313
00:11:41,761 --> 00:11:43,261
and then you want me to,

314
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:45,801
he's going to climb up the ladder, right?

315
00:11:45,801 --> 00:11:47,761
There's like, a pretend ladder here.

316
00:11:47,761 --> 00:11:49,781
And then, how's that?

317
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:50,661
- Yeah.

318
00:11:50,921 --> 00:11:51,381
- [Teacher] Okay.

319
00:11:52,841 --> 00:11:55,041
Now, I noticed when I did
that, something happened.

320
00:11:55,661 --> 00:11:56,281
- The pie chart.

321
00:11:56,281 --> 00:11:56,901
(students murmur)

322
00:11:56,901 --> 00:11:57,321
- Oh, yeah.

323
00:11:57,921 --> 00:11:58,411
Why?

324
00:11:58,411 --> 00:12:02,931
(students murmur)

325
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,881
Sounds like a height
there that's increasing,

326
00:12:05,811 --> 00:12:07,741
reference point is greater, I like that.

327
00:12:07,741 --> 00:12:09,061
Okay, I'm going to let him go.

328
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:23,701
(students murmur)

329
00:12:30,174 --> 00:12:31,234
I don't know if I can do that, actually,

330
00:12:31,234 --> 00:12:32,194
but I will try.

331
00:12:32,194 --> 00:12:34,783
Yeah, we can play around with it.

332
00:12:35,954 --> 00:12:37,034
- [Student] Make the sides taller,

333
00:12:37,034 --> 00:12:39,354
then he'll have a greater
distance to travel

334
00:12:39,354 --> 00:12:41,013
and it'll actually be more.

335
00:12:41,013 --> 00:12:41,873
- [Teacher] I don't know if I can,

336
00:12:41,873 --> 00:12:43,393
yeah, I don't think I can do that.

337
00:12:43,393 --> 00:12:44,133
I don't think it'll,

338
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:48,233
it only allows me to click
on the blue dots there.

339
00:12:49,193 --> 00:12:50,454
- You have to add track to do that.

340
00:12:50,454 --> 00:12:53,214
(students murmur)

341
00:12:53,214 --> 00:12:54,914
- You want me to pull
those off to the side?

342
00:12:54,914 --> 00:12:55,673
Okay.

343
00:12:55,673 --> 00:13:00,163
(students murmur)

344
00:13:00,854 --> 00:13:01,314
Okay.

345
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:04,334
So, you made a little
bit different half-pipe.

346
00:13:04,334 --> 00:13:05,694
(students exclaim)

347
00:13:05,694 --> 00:13:06,173
Oh, no!

348
00:13:07,813 --> 00:13:08,133
Alright.

349
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:09,354
So, you don't want to,

350
00:13:11,704 --> 00:13:12,954
look there's some thermal energy.

351
00:13:13,524 --> 00:13:14,453
What's going on with that?

352
00:13:14,453 --> 00:13:16,273
(students murmur)

353
00:13:16,273 --> 00:13:16,733
Okay.

354
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:17,994
That might've happened.

355
00:13:17,994 --> 00:13:20,494
But why do I now see red in the pie chart?

356
00:13:20,494 --> 00:13:23,954
(students murmur)

357
00:13:23,954 --> 00:13:24,453
Yeah.

358
00:13:24,453 --> 00:13:27,014
There's a force that will allow
for the energy to transfer.

359
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,093
Good.

360
00:13:28,093 --> 00:13:30,194
Let's get him back on that half-pipe and

361
00:13:30,194 --> 00:13:31,214
you know guys,

362
00:13:31,214 --> 00:13:33,813
I don't think that it makes
much of a difference in the

363
00:13:35,203 --> 00:13:37,514
design or engineering of this, whether

364
00:13:39,224 --> 00:13:41,813
we make the bottom hit
the ground or have it up.

365
00:13:42,223 --> 00:13:44,094
So, I don't really think that is going to

366
00:13:44,094 --> 00:13:45,304
make much of a difference.

367
00:13:45,314 --> 00:13:48,724
But, we do need to collect some data, and

368
00:13:48,924 --> 00:13:51,184
start with this proposal, so...

369
00:13:51,184 --> 00:13:52,084
Where did we leave off?

370
00:13:52,084 --> 00:13:53,664
I think there was something that we were

371
00:13:55,284 --> 00:13:56,644
looking to collect there.

372
00:13:57,074 --> 00:13:57,544
- [Student] Height.

373
00:13:58,034 --> 00:13:58,804
- Okay, good.

374
00:14:00,244 --> 00:14:01,694
Let's continue with that, please.

375
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:03,484
- Well, measuring tape.

376
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:04,084
- Oooh!

377
00:14:04,184 --> 00:14:05,024
There is a measuring tape.

378
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:08,044
I don't even see these things.

379
00:14:09,684 --> 00:14:10,484
Measuring tape, oh.

380
00:14:10,484 --> 00:14:11,844
It even says fet, okay good.

381
00:14:13,284 --> 00:14:14,254
So, how's that look?

382
00:14:14,304 --> 00:14:15,254
- No, no!

383
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:16,284
- [Teacher] Well, what do
you want me to do with it?

384
00:14:16,284 --> 00:14:20,484
(animated conversation)

385
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,044
Going to the ground.

386
00:14:22,014 --> 00:14:24,864
(students murmur)

387
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:25,604
That's not the ground?

388
00:14:26,224 --> 00:14:27,264
- From the reference point.

389
00:14:27,264 --> 00:14:27,864
- [Teacher] Oh, alright.

390
00:14:27,864 --> 00:14:28,984
I'm right on the reference point!

391
00:14:28,984 --> 00:14:29,824
- Go up a little.

392
00:14:29,824 --> 00:14:37,704
(students murmur)

393
00:14:41,424 --> 00:14:42,764
- [Teacher] So, what do
you want me to measure?

394
00:14:43,454 --> 00:14:48,454
(animated conversation)

395
00:14:52,974 --> 00:14:54,400
Well, where am I going to measure?

396
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:54,890
From what to what?

397
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,150
- The reference point
to the highest point.

398
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,780
- [Teacher] Okay.

399
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,230
I think the highest
point would probably be

400
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,871
the center of him,

401
00:15:03,371 --> 00:15:04,810
but they do have that
nice, little red dot.

402
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,911
Can we just agree that we're
going to go with the red dot?

403
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:07,510
- Yes.

404
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:07,981
- [Teacher] Yeah.

405
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:10,070
Why don't we go there?

406
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,290
- It can't be diagonal.

407
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,111
- [Teacher] Okay.

408
00:15:18,031 --> 00:15:21,240
(students murmur)

409
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,040
Is that good?

410
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,350
- Yeah.

411
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:29,050
(students murmur)

412
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:29,410
- [Teacher] Yes.

413
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:34,890
(students murmur)

414
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,550
Shut the lights off for this measure.

415
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,410
Okay.

416
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:43,850
(students murmur)

417
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,130
Now, this measuring tape is
a little tricky to work with.

418
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,270
I wonder if there's any easier way for me

419
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:49,730
to get this.

420
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:53,500
(students murmur)

421
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:53,874
Oh.

422
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,010
Oh, that's pretty neat.

423
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,140
I suppose I could use a measuring tape or

424
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,250
I actually have that,

425
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,730
so maybe that will help make it

426
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,860
a little bit easier, if
it could speed things up.

427
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,340
So, what do we want to say for the height?

428
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,080
- Seven.

429
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,060
(students murmur)

430
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,440
- I don't know if I'd say seven.

431
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,210
(students murmur)

432
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,850
So, we all agree it's somewhere
between six and eight, yes?

433
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,430
- Yes.

434
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:24,240
I'd say 7.2.

435
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,460
- And it does go over the
seven a little bit, so

436
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,100
height equals seven point...

437
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,240
(students murmur)

438
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:30,700
Two.

439
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,510
Four.

440
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:33,970
Six.

441
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,390
Zero.

442
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:36,880
42.

443
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,870
(students laugh)

444
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,410
You tell me or it's going to go forever!

445
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,070
65.

446
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,890
Let's start over again.

447
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:44,360
Seven.

448
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:48,350
(animated conversation)

449
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,199
I don't think it goes to the half mark.

450
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:53,818
(animated conversation)

451
00:16:53,818 --> 00:16:54,648
7.1?

452
00:16:54,648 --> 00:16:56,138
(students murmur)

453
00:16:56,138 --> 00:16:58,069
Maybe we need a show of hands on this?

454
00:16:58,539 --> 00:16:59,809
Who believes it's 7?

455
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:03,359
Who believes it's 7 meters?

456
00:17:04,639 --> 00:17:05,958
No one's raising their hands, that's good.

457
00:17:06,118 --> 00:17:07,198
How about 7.1?

458
00:17:08,678 --> 00:17:09,708
7.1 meters?

459
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:11,348
Alright.

460
00:17:11,348 --> 00:17:12,638
I got one person there.

461
00:17:12,638 --> 00:17:14,218
Now, I'm looking at this
from an angle, right?

462
00:17:14,218 --> 00:17:15,579
And anytime you want to make a measure,

463
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:17,088
you do want to have your eyes

464
00:17:17,718 --> 00:17:18,938
right above what you're measuring

465
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:19,779
and obviously...

466
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:20,799
(teacher mumbles)

467
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,178
I'm just going to move over here,

468
00:17:22,328 --> 00:17:23,319
just so I can get,

469
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:24,859
a little bit better.

470
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:26,838
And then what else can I do

471
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,468
to try to really measure this well?

472
00:17:29,105 --> 00:17:29,725
- [Student] Pause it.

473
00:17:29,725 --> 00:17:30,095
- Yeah.

474
00:17:30,095 --> 00:17:31,765
I think I'm going to pause the animation.

475
00:17:34,745 --> 00:17:36,375
Now, if I was making
an actual measurement,

476
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,785
I'd make sure my eyes were
perpendicular to whatever

477
00:17:38,785 --> 00:17:39,765
I was measuring.

478
00:17:40,955 --> 00:17:42,605
What do we say about, oh, that's good.

479
00:17:42,765 --> 00:17:44,525
What do we say about these measures

480
00:17:44,525 --> 00:17:45,695
that we make in science?

481
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:46,855
- [Student] They should be,

482
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:48,315
you're only as good as your measures.

483
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:48,845
- [Teacher] Yeah.

484
00:17:48,845 --> 00:17:50,835
You're only as good as your measures.

485
00:17:50,835 --> 00:17:51,795
What does that mean?

486
00:17:51,975 --> 00:17:52,665
Kristen?

487
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:57,235
- It means that if your
measures are not precise

488
00:17:57,235 --> 00:17:58,675
and consistent, then

489
00:17:58,675 --> 00:18:01,325
everything else won't be
precise and consistent.

490
00:18:02,325 --> 00:18:04,215
- [Teacher] Can someone
elaborate on that a little bit?

491
00:18:04,215 --> 00:18:05,455
Or do you want to add to that?

492
00:18:05,495 --> 00:18:07,025
- No, someone else can elaborate on it.

493
00:18:07,395 --> 00:18:07,815
- [Teacher] Okay.

494
00:18:07,815 --> 00:18:08,335
Are you sure?

495
00:18:08,335 --> 00:18:09,295
I can give you a little more...

496
00:18:09,295 --> 00:18:09,745
- No.

497
00:18:09,745 --> 00:18:11,565
(Kristen murmurs)

498
00:18:13,715 --> 00:18:14,325
- [Teacher] Okay.

499
00:18:14,575 --> 00:18:15,135
Let's see.

500
00:18:15,455 --> 00:18:17,335
Who haven't I called on at all today

501
00:18:17,455 --> 00:18:19,235
because I want to make sure I get everyone.

502
00:18:19,235 --> 00:18:23,435
(students murmur)

503
00:18:25,155 --> 00:18:26,295
- You haven't called on Jill.

504
00:18:27,585 --> 00:18:29,555
(students laugh)

505
00:18:29,731 --> 00:18:32,191
(Jill mumbles)

506
00:18:32,371 --> 00:18:32,701
- [Teacher] Alright.

507
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,591
I'm sure she doesn't mind
repeating it for you.

508
00:18:34,591 --> 00:18:37,821
(Kristen mumbles)

509
00:18:37,821 --> 00:18:39,371
I think you said, you're only
as good as your measures.

510
00:18:39,371 --> 00:18:41,891
(Kristen mumbles)

511
00:18:41,891 --> 00:18:45,661
- Because if your measures aren't precise,

512
00:18:45,661 --> 00:18:48,211
then all your other work

513
00:18:48,901 --> 00:18:51,011
that you're using the measures for...

514
00:18:51,011 --> 00:18:53,171
(Jill mumbles)

515
00:18:53,171 --> 00:18:57,351
Yeah, if you measure
something for speed...

516
00:18:57,351 --> 00:18:59,811
(Jill mumbles)

517
00:18:59,811 --> 00:19:01,111
It would be wrong.

518
00:19:02,201 --> 00:19:02,731
- [Teacher] Why?

519
00:19:03,071 --> 00:19:04,251
- Well no, if you...

520
00:19:04,251 --> 00:19:05,521
- [Teacher] It could be, you're right.

521
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:07,821
If you make some poor measures,

522
00:19:07,821 --> 00:19:08,821
and then you go to graph it.

523
00:19:09,651 --> 00:19:10,141
- No.

524
00:19:10,141 --> 00:19:12,871
If you take distance and then

525
00:19:12,871 --> 00:19:15,881
multiply it by time, then
speed would be wrong.

526
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:18,311
Like, if you had the wrong distance,

527
00:19:18,731 --> 00:19:20,261
then speed would be wrong,

528
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,391
and then making it after that,

529
00:19:22,565 --> 00:19:23,735
your graph would be wrong.

530
00:19:24,475 --> 00:19:25,695
- [Teacher] Well, it would be wrong,

531
00:19:25,695 --> 00:19:27,335
right from the perspective, you said,

532
00:19:27,335 --> 00:19:28,655
distance times time,

533
00:19:28,655 --> 00:19:30,875
and speed is distance divided by time.

534
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:31,925
Did everyone hear that?

535
00:19:32,085 --> 00:19:32,465
- Yeah.

536
00:19:32,465 --> 00:19:33,815
- [Teacher] That's okay, though.

537
00:19:33,815 --> 00:19:34,875
You're saying,

538
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,575
we don't want to get
off the main idea here.

539
00:19:37,575 --> 00:19:39,295
If you're getting these distances wrong

540
00:19:39,295 --> 00:19:40,915
and then you're going to graph,

541
00:19:40,915 --> 00:19:43,795
your slope is going to be incorrect, yes?

542
00:19:44,235 --> 00:19:46,295
So, remember in science, we collect data.

543
00:19:46,295 --> 00:19:49,215
From that data, we put
it in a nice data table

544
00:19:49,215 --> 00:19:52,075
to organize it and then we look at trends

545
00:19:52,075 --> 00:19:54,695
and patterns, graph it,
look at trends and patterns.

546
00:19:55,425 --> 00:19:57,575
So, if everything starts
from our measures,

547
00:19:57,575 --> 00:20:00,128
those next steps aren't
going to be correct.
