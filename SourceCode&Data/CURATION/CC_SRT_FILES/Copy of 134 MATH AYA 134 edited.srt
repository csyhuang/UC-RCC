1
00:00:00,868 --> 00:00:02,887
- [Teacher] Are you gonna have any
angles in there that add to 90?

2
00:00:02,887 --> 00:00:06,688
No, so you won't have any
complementary to worry about.

3
00:00:06,688 --> 00:00:08,519
- [Student] Is that supplementary, though?

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:10,557
- [Teacher] You will have supplementary.

5
00:00:13,037 --> 00:00:15,480
Right. You're not gonna have
to worry about the outside.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,631
You're just gonna look at your inside.

7
00:00:16,631 --> 00:00:18,157
When you measure your
angles you'll be able

8
00:00:18,157 --> 00:00:19,437
to see supplementary.

9
00:00:19,437 --> 00:00:20,037
- [Student] Yeah.

10
00:00:20,037 --> 00:00:22,208
- [Teacher] Then kinda go back to those

11
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:25,648
parallel lines cut by a
transversal rules to explain why.

12
00:00:27,517 --> 00:00:42,848
(Background Chatter)

13
00:00:45,477 --> 00:00:48,267
- [Student] We're supposed to draw a line?

14
00:00:48,267 --> 00:00:50,837
- [Teacher] Well I want you to see
what's congruent sides.

15
00:00:50,837 --> 00:00:52,591
Now, you dont have to
measure all your sides

16
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:55,509
because have these, so
you've got the same colors,

17
00:00:55,509 --> 00:00:58,038
so they're all the same.

18
00:00:58,038 --> 00:01:00,508
You're don't have to do angles.

19
00:01:00,508 --> 00:01:03,227
Kinda figure out, OK...

20
00:01:03,227 --> 00:01:04,590
So they're all 90 degrees.

21
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,467
One of yours looks 90.

22
00:01:09,587 --> 00:01:12,277
So you know they're 90s.

23
00:01:12,277 --> 00:01:14,558
So you got, for the
outside of your figure,

24
00:01:14,558 --> 00:01:16,357
you got some a little bit easier work.

25
00:01:16,357 --> 00:01:16,957
- [Student] Yeah

26
00:01:16,957 --> 00:01:20,597
- [Teacher] OK, so you need to
explain why things are 90,

27
00:01:20,597 --> 00:01:23,031
and what are congruent.

28
00:01:23,031 --> 00:01:25,717
And then, you're gonna
get a lot more new stuff

29
00:01:25,717 --> 00:01:29,477
when you redraw and draw
your diagonals in there.

30
00:01:29,477 --> 00:01:30,877
Then you'll actually have to measure

31
00:01:30,877 --> 00:01:33,148
your diagonals and your angles.

32
00:01:33,148 --> 00:01:35,877
So you know a lot about
a square to start with.

33
00:01:35,877 --> 00:01:38,207
- [Student] Yeah the equal sides
have to be congruent,

34
00:01:38,207 --> 00:01:41,427
and certain sides, so write that?

35
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:47,358
- [Teacher] Then measure those 
angles and segments

36
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:48,157
and see if you can't find

37
00:01:48,157 --> 00:01:50,397
some more rules that go with a square.

38
00:01:50,397 --> 00:01:50,910
- [Student] Oh, OK.

39
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,597
- [Teacher] So yes, your first set of
rules for the first page,

40
00:01:53,597 --> 00:01:55,750
from here, you know a lot.

41
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,749
You know that any point and what they are.

42
00:01:58,749 --> 00:02:00,357
You know you have equal sides.

43
00:02:00,357 --> 00:02:01,757
Then you don't have to measure these sides

44
00:02:01,757 --> 00:02:03,432
because you used the same color.

45
00:02:03,432 --> 00:02:05,627
So you can explain it using the colors.

46
00:02:13,387 --> 00:02:16,837
So you got a lot you
know from the first part.

47
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:20,147
But then when you draw
your diagonals here,

48
00:02:20,147 --> 00:02:21,678
you're gonna have to measure your pieces.

49
00:02:21,678 --> 00:02:23,231
See what happens to these angles.

50
00:02:23,231 --> 00:02:26,034
See what happens to these diagonals.

51
00:02:26,034 --> 00:02:28,278
And then see if you can't
come up with some rules.

52
00:02:28,278 --> 00:02:31,358
You're main part here, you know a lot.

53
00:02:31,358 --> 00:02:34,597
But now when we do this,
this will some of the new.

54
00:02:34,597 --> 00:02:35,538
- [Student] OK.

55
00:02:35,538 --> 00:02:38,038
- [Teacher] Square is the last 
one that we teach.

56
00:02:38,038 --> 00:02:41,638
So you will be the last
group up there, today.

57
00:02:41,638 --> 00:02:43,989
Right, we're trying to
get these rules today.

58
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:45,958
You can kinda build upon them

59
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,038
so when you hear what these
other groups are doing

60
00:02:48,038 --> 00:02:49,338
when you get up there.

61
00:02:49,338 --> 00:02:50,637
- [Student] Yeah.

62
00:02:52,947 --> 00:02:56,509
- [Teacher] There's just three of you. 
(Laughs)

63
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,637
- [Student] OK.

64
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:01,917
- [Teacher] How you doing?

65
00:03:01,917 --> 00:03:02,638
- [Student] Good.

66
00:03:09,988 --> 00:03:12,628
- [Teacher] What do you notice 
about some of these?

67
00:03:16,677 --> 00:03:18,757
Corresponding is what
I got here, down here.

68
00:03:22,997 --> 00:03:25,077
These are supplementary.

69
00:03:25,077 --> 00:03:27,797
Supplementary because
they're what type of angles?

70
00:03:27,797 --> 00:03:29,078
Help him respond.

71
00:03:32,018 --> 00:03:35,387
Well there are options, focus on one.

72
00:03:35,387 --> 00:03:36,627
If we were to look at...

73
00:03:36,627 --> 00:03:39,077
If I was continuing these lines here

74
00:03:39,077 --> 00:03:42,512
they're gonna be same side interior.

75
00:03:42,512 --> 00:03:44,798
Obviously yes, so they're
not quite supplementary.

76
00:03:52,368 --> 00:03:54,250
So you might need to go
back and do it again.

77
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,917
Sammy knows they need to be supplementary.

78
00:03:55,917 --> 00:03:57,177
Same side interior.

79
00:03:57,177 --> 00:04:00,388
Somehow your measurements
didn't get there.

80
00:04:00,388 --> 00:04:02,078
So go back and try to remeasure.

81
00:04:02,078 --> 00:04:04,869
You realize you wrote the error.

82
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:13,077
That's good, so you're using some of that

83
00:04:13,077 --> 00:04:15,558
previous knowledge and
realizing your error.

84
00:04:23,408 --> 00:04:25,567
Yeah, so you need what we did

85
00:04:25,567 --> 00:04:27,469
on that worksheet the other day.

86
00:04:27,469 --> 00:04:29,277
When you measured between 110 and 120

87
00:04:29,277 --> 00:04:31,032
you read the wrong way.

88
00:04:31,032 --> 00:04:34,638
You read 122 when it's
going this way it's 118.

89
00:04:39,448 --> 00:04:43,449
So what you did is you read this way,

90
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,437
when you're going this way.

91
00:04:45,437 --> 00:04:50,327
You said 122, when it's
between 120 and 110.

92
00:04:53,277 --> 00:04:55,197
At least your teammates knew that

93
00:04:55,197 --> 00:04:57,309
we needed supplementary and worked it.

94
00:04:57,309 --> 00:04:58,791
- [Student] You said it was only off by one degree.

95
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,291
- [Teacher] Any amount...

96
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:10,317
Then again, to then
explain your rules now,

97
00:05:10,317 --> 00:05:14,197
what's congruent, what's supplementary,

98
00:05:14,197 --> 00:05:15,957
and then explain why, like you were saying

99
00:05:15,957 --> 00:05:17,917
same side interior,
that's what you'll have.

100
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:18,957
(PA system dings)

101
00:05:18,957 --> 00:05:19,648
- [Teacher] Yes?

102
00:05:19,648 --> 00:05:21,070
- [PA Announcer] Do you
have Chester Marlin?

103
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,717
- [Teacher] Yes I do.

104
00:05:21,717 --> 00:05:23,397
- [PA Announcer] Please send 
him to the office.

105
00:05:23,397 --> 00:05:24,147
- [Teacher] OK.

106
00:05:26,477 --> 00:05:55,887
(Background Chatter)

107
00:05:58,727 --> 00:06:01,338
- [Teacher] What you did was perfect.

108
00:06:02,718 --> 00:06:05,017
- [Student] Because they're same side interior.

109
00:06:05,017 --> 00:06:06,918
- [Teacher] So you would say this...

110
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:08,989
- [Student] Would you say equal
angle one and angle four?

111
00:06:08,989 --> 00:06:10,877
- [Teacher] That'd be fine, 
because you can go ahead and

112
00:06:10,877 --> 00:06:13,237
when you're teaching it
you can label those angles,

113
00:06:13,237 --> 00:06:16,068
and that would be a
really good way to do it.

114
00:06:16,068 --> 00:06:19,277
- [Student] So it's like, angle
one and angle four are

115
00:06:19,277 --> 00:06:20,278
same side interior?

116
00:06:20,278 --> 00:06:23,397
- [Teacher] Same side interior, so
that has to equal 180.

117
00:06:27,017 --> 00:06:28,398
OK, bisectors are gonna come

118
00:06:28,398 --> 00:06:31,327
when you cut diagonals in there.

119
00:06:31,327 --> 00:06:34,078
Your second page, when
you redraw the figure.

120
00:06:34,078 --> 00:06:35,397
You're gonna draw the diagonals,

121
00:06:35,397 --> 00:06:37,238
you're gonna see your
diagonals cut each other,

122
00:06:37,238 --> 00:06:41,067
you're gonna see if your
diagonals cut your angles in half.

123
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:45,278
I'll be to Ashley then at
Brandon's group in just a minute.

124
00:06:45,278 --> 00:06:47,118
So make sure your congruent sides.

125
00:06:47,118 --> 00:06:48,637
You don't have to measure your sides

126
00:06:48,637 --> 00:06:52,197
if you use your colors, you
can use colors to explain it.

127
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:57,837
So yeah, you're exactly
on the right track.

128
00:06:57,837 --> 00:06:59,637
Here we're just gonna
draw the same figure,

129
00:06:59,637 --> 00:07:01,078
draw those diagonals in there,

130
00:07:01,078 --> 00:07:03,517
and then we got a little bit--
some more things.

131
00:07:03,517 --> 00:07:05,837
You might see bisectors, you might not.

132
00:07:05,837 --> 00:07:08,157
Some figures you do and some you don't.

133
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:13,967
All right.

134
00:07:15,718 --> 00:07:18,437
OK, it's up to you.

135
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:21,428
I love the way you put your letters there.

136
00:07:21,428 --> 00:07:24,309
So you're getting really
good with your letters.

137
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:26,430
You can say...

138
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,288
Since you only have one
angle at each letter,

139
00:07:29,288 --> 00:07:32,157
you can say angle J or angle H,

140
00:07:32,157 --> 00:07:34,087
however you want to do that.

141
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:35,429
- [Student] Could we just put supplementary,

142
00:07:35,429 --> 00:07:37,958
and draw a little diagonal like that?

143
00:07:40,078 --> 00:07:41,631
- [Teacher] That'd be fine.

144
00:07:42,981 --> 00:07:45,479
Actually, do all these, and
you've got your congruent

145
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:47,117
and your angles, then you're gonna redraw

146
00:07:47,117 --> 00:07:48,797
the same thing over here,

147
00:07:48,797 --> 00:07:51,797
put your diagonals in and measure again.

148
00:07:51,797 --> 00:07:52,797
When you put diagonals in,

149
00:07:52,797 --> 00:07:54,319
you might see some that bisect the angles,

150
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,007
or bisect segments. You might not,

151
00:07:57,007 --> 00:08:00,158
but that's what you're looking for.

152
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:02,437
- [Student] So this is gonna be...
(Background Chatter)

153
00:08:02,437 --> 00:08:04,807
- [Teacher] Well, the diagonals...

154
00:08:05,947 --> 00:08:06,858
We're not gonna draw one of them.

155
00:08:06,858 --> 00:08:07,637
- [Student] Oh, we're not?

156
00:08:07,637 --> 00:08:09,238
- [Teacher] No, we're just gonna
look at our diagonals.

157
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:12,317
Otherwise you're breaking
it into two other figures.

158
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:16,038
And that's a possibility,
but you don't have to.

159
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:17,517
I love the way that
you've lettered it, here.

160
00:08:17,517 --> 00:08:19,038
You're using those correct terms,

161
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,287
that'll be really good as you go up there.

162
00:08:25,058 --> 00:08:27,407
All right, Brandon.

163
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:32,477
- [Student] What all did we mess up so far?

164
00:08:32,477 --> 00:08:34,647
- [Teacher] Let's see.

165
00:08:37,319 --> 00:08:38,798
Well it's a four sided figure.

166
00:08:38,798 --> 00:08:40,828
What should a four sided figure add up to?

167
00:08:40,828 --> 00:08:41,471
- [Student] 360.

168
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,477
- [Teacher] 360. Does it?

169
00:08:54,587 --> 00:08:57,687
- [Student] No, it's a little more than 360.

170
00:08:57,687 --> 00:08:59,277
- [Teacher] So you might need to
change things a little bit,

171
00:08:59,277 --> 00:09:01,998
to remeasure it, and one
of your rules could be

172
00:09:01,998 --> 00:09:05,277
you know that they have to add to 360.

173
00:09:05,277 --> 00:09:07,667
There's some that I see
really right away that's good.

174
00:09:16,967 --> 00:09:18,237
- [Teacher] It's like 370.

175
00:09:18,237 --> 00:09:21,837
- [Teacher] OK, so you're gonna try to make it work.

176
00:09:21,837 --> 00:09:23,270
You know you need to make it work.

177
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,870
You know it's gotta be 360

178
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,278
so measure it a little bit better.

179
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:28,557
- [Student] Can we just add one
here and add two there?

180
00:09:28,557 --> 00:09:29,438
- [Teacher] Well go ahead and look to see

181
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:31,197
what your actual angles are.

182
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:33,277
But one good thing you see,

183
00:09:33,277 --> 00:09:35,030
you see that these angles are the same,

184
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,940
which is something you're supposed

185
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,598
to come up with, which is good.

186
00:09:37,598 --> 00:09:39,314
Now if I was giving this,

187
00:09:39,314 --> 00:09:40,637
when you're up there explaining it,

188
00:09:40,637 --> 00:09:42,977
you need a way to explain,

189
00:09:42,977 --> 00:09:46,557
and I know you said that the
two obtuse angles are congruent,

190
00:09:46,557 --> 00:09:49,998
and in your picture that's good.

191
00:09:49,998 --> 00:09:52,919
But sometimes, let's think for a minute,

192
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:55,477
If I gave you...

193
00:09:59,337 --> 00:10:00,358
Write them out.

194
00:10:00,358 --> 00:10:02,118
Yeah it may always be the obtuse angle.

195
00:10:02,118 --> 00:10:03,838
So here, yeah, that's what I was thinking.

196
00:10:03,838 --> 00:10:05,278
If you were to do it this way,

197
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:06,603
the angles that are congruent

198
00:10:06,603 --> 00:10:09,117
aren't necessarily the obtuse ones.

199
00:10:09,117 --> 00:10:12,509
So what you've found is good,

200
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:15,511
but in your picture it is the obtuse ones,

201
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:17,070
but if you can see as you move that,

202
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,597
it doesn't have to be the obtuse ones.

203
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:20,477
Let's look at a way we can describe.

204
00:10:20,477 --> 00:10:23,350
You're saying that these
two angles are congruent,

205
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,998
which is correct, so
instead of saying obtuse,

206
00:10:25,998 --> 00:10:29,237
how can I explain that
these two and not those two.

207
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:30,669
What's the difference
between these two angles

208
00:10:30,669 --> 00:10:32,719
and those two angles?

209
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,027
- [Student] They're 45 degrees?

210
00:10:34,027 --> 00:10:34,677
- [Teacher] Well it didn't have to be.

211
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:39,038
It could be 45, it looks 45,
if I was to do this it's not.

212
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,397
- [Student] It's the short side's angles.

213
00:10:40,397 --> 00:10:42,080
- [Teacher] It's where your short
sides meet your long sides.

214
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,437
So the angles with the
non-congruent sides.

215
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:49,087
Or the short sides meet the long angles,

216
00:10:49,087 --> 00:10:50,518
that would be perfect.

217
00:10:50,518 --> 00:10:52,197
That would be a little
better to explain it.

218
00:10:52,197 --> 00:10:53,797
And even when you're up there explaining,

219
00:10:53,797 --> 00:10:55,718
a good thing to do would
be to move your figure

220
00:10:55,718 --> 00:10:57,317
to show how it didn't have to be...

221
00:10:57,317 --> 00:10:59,557
And normally it's the bigger angles,

222
00:10:59,557 --> 00:11:01,927
but it doesn't have to be.

223
00:11:02,677 --> 00:11:04,478
- [Student] Draw diagonals?

224
00:11:04,478 --> 00:11:06,837
- [Teacher] That's right, 
and you're gonna look for

225
00:11:06,837 --> 00:11:08,598
all the angles again.

226
00:11:08,598 --> 00:11:10,711
When you draw your
diagonals, a lot of times

227
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:11,997
you're gonna see bisectors,

228
00:11:11,997 --> 00:11:13,838
like segments might bisect each other,

229
00:11:13,838 --> 00:11:16,558
they might bisect angles,
they might or they might not.

230
00:11:16,558 --> 00:11:18,517
So that's what you're
looking for when you do that.

231
00:11:18,517 --> 00:11:20,518
And then you're gonna
kind of come up to...

232
00:11:20,518 --> 00:11:22,797
- [Student] We just draw them like this?

233
00:11:22,797 --> 00:11:24,197
- [Teacher] Just like that, that's right.

234
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:25,598
Then you'll measure all of those angles,

235
00:11:25,598 --> 00:11:27,177
and all of those segments.

236
00:11:27,177 --> 00:11:29,918
We won't be able to use
the color to show congruent

237
00:11:29,918 --> 00:11:32,358
when we draw the diagonals on the inside,

238
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,517
because you won't have a
piece that matches correctly

239
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:35,957
for your diagonals, so you'll actually

240
00:11:35,957 --> 00:11:38,919
have to measure that part with a ruler.

241
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,878
But again, you're not as much concerned

242
00:11:40,878 --> 00:11:45,798
with the measurement as
bisecting it or something else.

243
00:11:45,798 --> 00:11:47,808
So that's what you'll do.

244
00:11:49,978 --> 00:11:52,247
All right, I'll be right back.

245
00:11:52,247 --> 00:11:52,797
Yes?

246
00:11:53,438 --> 00:11:56,887
- [Student] So are we supposed to do this?

247
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:01,157
- [Teacher] You don't need the
angles that are out there.

248
00:12:01,157 --> 00:12:03,518
I mean, you could, but it's not necessary.

249
00:12:03,518 --> 00:12:06,861
What should, of course,
our figure add up to?

250
00:12:06,861 --> 00:12:07,598
- [Student] The angles inside?

251
00:12:07,598 --> 00:12:08,477
- [Teacher] Uh huh.

252
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,397
- [Student] 360?

253
00:12:09,397 --> 00:12:10,870
- [Teacher] 360. So make sure yours do.

254
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,187
- [Student] What if they don't?

255
00:12:13,187 --> 00:12:16,717
- [Teacher] So I think, if I was to 
look at your measurements, here...

256
00:12:16,717 --> 00:12:20,031
- [Student] I know what I did, I
messed up, I wrote these...

257
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,117
- [Teacher] Good, perfect, that's
what I was gonna get to,

258
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:24,897
you read the wrong one and didn't notice.

259
00:12:26,877 --> 00:12:28,560
All right, I'll be right back.

260
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:37,728
(Background Chatter)

261
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:40,757
How are you doing?

262
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:46,637
So you want to make some general rules.

263
00:12:46,637 --> 00:12:50,237
- [Student] So the top and the bottom
sides have to be parallel.

264
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:53,792
- [Teacher] I wouldn't really want 
to use the words top and bottom,

265
00:12:53,792 --> 00:12:55,477
because what if you turn it this way?

266
00:12:55,477 --> 00:12:56,597
- [Student] Yeah, well, A and B sides.

267
00:12:56,597 --> 00:12:58,077
- [Teacher] Yeah, so you're gonna do that.

268
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:00,447
So you've got your pieces.

269
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,678
What do you notice about your angles?

270
00:13:02,678 --> 00:13:04,318
You've got the angles that are equal,

271
00:13:04,318 --> 00:13:06,877
but what if I was looking
for supplementary?

272
00:13:06,877 --> 00:13:08,528
Do you have any supplementary angles?

273
00:13:08,528 --> 00:13:10,937
- [Student] A and D ?

274
00:13:10,937 --> 00:13:13,029
- [Teacher] A and D, so you say A
and D are supplementary,

275
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:15,077
what makes them supplementary?

276
00:13:15,077 --> 00:13:16,599
What rule do we already know

277
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:18,477
that was why they're supplementary?

278
00:13:18,477 --> 00:13:20,207
- [Student] They add up to 180.

279
00:13:20,207 --> 00:13:22,117
- [Teacher] Right, they add up to 180, but...

280
00:13:22,117 --> 00:13:23,548
- [Student] Are they same side interior angles?

281
00:13:23,548 --> 00:13:24,990
- [Teacher] Same side interior angles.

282
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,597
So you can say they're 180 because

283
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:29,017
they're same side interior angles.

284
00:13:31,087 --> 00:13:32,049
Then what you're gonna do,

285
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:33,897
you're gonna go to this page,

286
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:36,679
you're gonna draw your figure again,

287
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:38,237
but you've got to draw your diagonals,

288
00:13:38,237 --> 00:13:39,512
and measure the things.

289
00:13:39,512 --> 00:13:40,997
When you draw the diagonals,

290
00:13:40,997 --> 00:13:42,517
what you're really looking for is to see,

291
00:13:42,517 --> 00:13:44,158
is there anything that cuts in half?

292
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:46,597
Do you bisect any angles
or bisect any segments?

293
00:13:46,597 --> 00:13:48,841
Some figures do, some figures don't.

294
00:13:48,841 --> 00:13:50,557
But that's what you're looking for.

295
00:13:50,557 --> 00:13:52,437
So you're gonna redraw
it, draw your diagonals,

296
00:13:52,437 --> 00:13:54,598
then measure, you'll have
more angles to measure.

297
00:13:54,598 --> 00:13:55,997
You're actually gonna have
to measure your segments

298
00:13:55,997 --> 00:13:58,918
because your little angle legs

299
00:13:58,918 --> 00:14:01,077
won't match your diagonals correctly.

300
00:14:01,077 --> 00:14:02,837
You're gonna have to
actually do the measurements.

301
00:14:02,837 --> 00:14:05,677
and see. See if the segments are bisected,

302
00:14:05,677 --> 00:14:07,157
see if the angles are bisected.

303
00:14:07,157 --> 00:14:09,198
That's kind of what
you're gonna come up with.

304
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:10,477
It may be, it may not be.

305
00:14:10,477 --> 00:14:13,107
Some of the figures do and some don't.

306
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:15,758
OK?

307
00:14:15,758 --> 00:14:16,678
- [Student in Brown] I think I understand that.

308
00:14:16,678 --> 00:14:19,297
- [Student in Red] We draw from angles to angles?

309
00:14:19,297 --> 00:14:22,318
- [Teacher] Yeah, from vertex to
vertex, that's right.

310
00:14:22,318 --> 00:14:24,239
So make an X in the middle.

311
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:26,087
All right, you're good.

312
00:14:26,792 --> 00:14:27,747
Yes?

313
00:14:28,177 --> 00:14:29,430
- [Student] I think we have about everything,

314
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:33,607
and then I think we
have the other vertex...

315
00:14:37,907 --> 00:14:42,687
Angle bisectors, they bisect
the angle number five.

316
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,968
All the triangles are isosceles.

317
00:14:46,877 --> 00:14:48,797
- [Teacher] Wow, that's good, I
didn't think you'd get that.

318
00:14:48,797 --> 00:14:50,628
(Laughs) I'm impressed.

319
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:51,408
- [Student] He did it.

320
00:14:51,408 --> 00:14:52,637
- [Teacher] Good job.

321
00:14:52,637 --> 00:14:56,358
- [Student] And then, diagonals
make a perpendicular.

322
00:14:56,358 --> 00:14:57,277
- [Teacher] Perfect, what I'm gonna do,

323
00:14:57,277 --> 00:14:58,837
is I'm gonna give you another sheet,

324
00:14:58,837 --> 00:15:00,126
make a bigger square...
