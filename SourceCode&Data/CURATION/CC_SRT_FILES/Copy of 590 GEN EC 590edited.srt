1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,110
[Background chatter]

2
00:00:01,119 --> 00:00:04,448
- [Voiceover] Well frogs do sink, they do.

3
00:00:04,448 --> 00:00:06,020
It's sinking.

4
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,665
- What do you think caused that to happen,

5
00:00:08,665 --> 00:00:11,351
what made it sink that time?

6
00:00:12,675 --> 00:00:14,466
- [Voiceover] I put it like that and...

7
00:00:14,466 --> 00:00:15,923
- And then it was sinking.

8
00:00:15,923 --> 00:00:19,621
Alright, but now we saw some pictures

9
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:23,162
where the real frogs got on
lily pads and didn't sink.

10
00:00:23,162 --> 00:00:25,108
So, what do you think is different?

11
00:00:26,506 --> 00:00:30,452
- It's like stuck to the ground and...

12
00:00:30,452 --> 00:00:32,590
- The lily pad is stuck to the ground?

13
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,679
- Yeah, I think there's something inside.

14
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:38,142
I think there's something
in like dirt, you know,

15
00:00:38,142 --> 00:00:42,261
like that causes the lily pad to grow.

16
00:00:43,423 --> 00:00:46,303
But with something in the lily pad seed.

17
00:00:46,303 --> 00:00:48,006
- [Voiceover] We were looking
at this the other day.

18
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,750
Do you girls remember about that?

19
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,939
Okay, what were you all thinking about that.

20
00:00:52,555 --> 00:00:53,829
- [Voiceover] They don't...

21
00:00:57,881 --> 00:00:59,636
- [Voiceover] But what
were you thinking Andrea?

22
00:00:59,636 --> 00:01:01,690
(mumbles)

23
00:01:07,024 --> 00:01:09,319
- You know these eyes right here,

24
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,829
we don't have eyes like this,

25
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:14,092
but frogs...

26
00:01:21,356 --> 00:01:24,449
But frogs jump really high.

27
00:01:24,449 --> 00:01:27,047
If they don't jump really the same,

28
00:01:27,047 --> 00:01:29,846
they probably

29
00:01:29,846 --> 00:01:33,456
just almost jump

30
00:01:35,576 --> 00:01:39,769
if the momma and daddy frogs turn into,

31
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:42,346
get some eggs

32
00:01:43,006 --> 00:01:46,373
and the tadpole comes out.

33
00:01:50,103 --> 00:01:52,272
- That tadpole right there,

34
00:01:52,272 --> 00:01:55,682
he was following it and then he stopped.

35
00:01:59,981 --> 00:02:03,500
What if they took the
flashlight, they might move.

36
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,724
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

37
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:06,244
- Like this, watch.

38
00:02:06,244 --> 00:02:07,692
When you take it off...

39
00:02:07,692 --> 00:02:09,259
I did this in my momma's.

40
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,490
When you take it off

41
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,975
and you turn it this
way he looks back at it,

42
00:02:12,975 --> 00:02:14,412
like this.

43
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,285
That's what he does.

44
00:02:16,285 --> 00:02:17,266
- [Voiceover] How come?

45
00:02:17,266 --> 00:02:21,328
- Because when tadpoles like eat things

46
00:02:21,328 --> 00:02:24,047
that glow, then when you take it off,

47
00:02:24,047 --> 00:02:26,356
you put it back on.

48
00:02:26,356 --> 00:02:28,111
- [Voiceover] How come, why?

49
00:02:28,111 --> 00:02:30,753
- I know, they just don't.

50
00:02:31,445 --> 00:02:33,950
- [Voiceover] But that's not fair.

51
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:39,835
- [Voiceover] What else
did you notice (mumbles)?

52
00:02:40,562 --> 00:02:42,261
We did the spots.

53
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:46,003
What else did you notice?
Jamal, look at it again.

54
00:02:49,991 --> 00:02:51,404
- Frog.

55
00:02:52,638 --> 00:02:54,846
- [Voiceover] What body parts do you see?

56
00:02:58,668 --> 00:03:00,669
- [Voiceover] Gray, polka dots.

57
00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:02,868
- You said the spots.

58
00:03:03,664 --> 00:03:05,312
- [Voiceover] The feet.

59
00:03:05,312 --> 00:03:07,824
- [Voiceover] The feet,
what about it (mumbles)?

60
00:03:10,936 --> 00:03:12,574
- [Voiceover] Lines on it.

61
00:03:12,574 --> 00:03:13,549
- [Voiceover] Some lines on it.

62
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:15,248
And what are you saying, Nikera?

63
00:03:15,248 --> 00:03:17,413
You said it had some things on it.

64
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:19,375
- [Voiceover] That white stuff.

65
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,200
- What is that?

66
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,047
What is that white stuff on it's feet?

67
00:03:26,963 --> 00:03:29,406
See if I can get a closer look.

68
00:03:29,406 --> 00:03:30,579
What is that?

69
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:32,797
Jamia, do you see that?

70
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:35,018
The white things on its feet.

71
00:03:37,652 --> 00:03:38,806
- [Voiceover] It's his foots.

72
00:03:38,806 --> 00:03:39,934
- It's his feet?

73
00:03:39,934 --> 00:03:41,629
Do you have that on your feet?

74
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:43,406
- [Voiceover] No.

75
00:03:43,834 --> 00:03:47,875
(class chatting)

76
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,405
- [Voiceover] They need peace and quiet.

77
00:03:52,405 --> 00:03:55,150
- If they don't have a calm river...

78
00:03:58,262 --> 00:04:00,752
Look, they live in ponds.

79
00:04:02,122 --> 00:04:04,337
Dude, listen, listen.

80
00:04:04,337 --> 00:04:05,821
- There are trees right here.

81
00:04:05,821 --> 00:04:07,890
There's flowers.

82
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,432
- Listen.

83
00:04:10,432 --> 00:04:12,667
Latan, be quiet.

84
00:04:14,207 --> 00:04:18,021
I'm thinking that this is very calm rivers

85
00:04:18,021 --> 00:04:21,688
and this is what you call
that ooey, gooey stuff

86
00:04:21,688 --> 00:04:23,971
that Ms. Robbie called it.

87
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:27,061
That's the lake and that's the pond

88
00:04:27,061 --> 00:04:30,351
and there I am (mumbles) frogs.

89
00:04:30,351 --> 00:04:33,104
- They need grass, they need flowers,

90
00:04:33,104 --> 00:04:34,958
they need little trees, they need...

91
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:37,809
- I was thinking Aleha,

92
00:04:37,809 --> 00:04:42,339
thinking about us living in houses.

93
00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:47,536
We live in houses because
can't breathe water.

94
00:04:49,892 --> 00:04:51,681
This is my house

95
00:04:52,062 --> 00:04:54,582
(mumbles)

96
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,208
and like there's dirt under there.

97
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:00,737
And there's dirt under there.

98
00:05:00,737 --> 00:05:03,672
Then under that runs the water,

99
00:05:03,672 --> 00:05:05,287
the blue water.

100
00:05:12,986 --> 00:05:14,757
- Let's add something to it.

101
00:05:15,334 --> 00:05:17,607
- So what made it work this time?

102
00:05:17,607 --> 00:05:21,034
- [Voiceover] It stands upside down.

103
00:05:21,468 --> 00:05:23,290
The frog floats.

104
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:27,677
It doesn't jump on any kind of one,

105
00:05:27,677 --> 00:05:30,844
it only jumps on the ones that are round.

106
00:05:30,844 --> 00:05:34,525
Because it needs something facing up

107
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:36,124
to make the walls.

108
00:05:36,124 --> 00:05:38,096
- [Voiceover] Because this is facing up,

109
00:05:38,096 --> 00:05:41,815
so you think maybe the lily pad faces up.

110
00:05:41,815 --> 00:05:46,244
- Right, if it does this
it needs like a shield

111
00:05:47,664 --> 00:05:49,362
so the water won't get in

112
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:51,622
because if the water touches it,

113
00:05:51,622 --> 00:05:54,125
it will tear and it will sink.

114
00:05:55,895 --> 00:05:57,778
- [Voiceover] Did you listen?

115
00:05:59,012 --> 00:06:02,552
- Because they need
something on it like rain.

116
00:06:02,552 --> 00:06:05,290
- [Voiceover] So you're
saying if water touches it,

117
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,500
what happens if water gets on top of it?

118
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,539
- It'll sink because it'll tear

119
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:13,227
the lily pad up and it'll sink,

120
00:06:13,227 --> 00:06:17,425
but with the flower on
it, it does not sink.

121
00:06:17,425 --> 00:06:18,972
- [Voiceover] So if it has the flower,

122
00:06:18,972 --> 00:06:21,281
you think the flower
keeps it from sinking.

123
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:22,838
- Because it's stuck.

124
00:06:22,838 --> 00:06:24,858
It's stuck and it's so hard,

125
00:06:24,858 --> 00:06:26,774
it makes it so hard and rainy

126
00:06:26,774 --> 00:06:28,919
and it dries up.

127
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:30,532
- [Voiceover] So, when
you dried the frog off

128
00:06:30,532 --> 00:06:32,828
did that make a difference?

129
00:06:34,114 --> 00:06:37,429
- [Voiceover] Well, it
doesn't make a difference.

130
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:39,104
Frogs like to be wet.

131
00:06:39,104 --> 00:06:41,063
- [Voiceover] Frogs are usually wet.

132
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:44,136
- [Voiceover] That frog is
an African swimming frog

133
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:45,467
because look at it's feet.

134
00:06:45,467 --> 00:06:47,572
- [Voiceover] It does look
like an African dwarf frog.

135
00:06:47,572 --> 00:06:49,137
- It jumps on the water.

136
00:06:49,137 --> 00:06:51,451
It can run and hop on water.

137
00:06:51,451 --> 00:06:54,218
- [Voiceover] Andrea, what
did you notice about this?

138
00:06:54,218 --> 00:06:56,432
What did you notice?

139
00:06:56,432 --> 00:07:00,341
- [Voiceover] I know
that we have (mumbles).

140
00:07:02,915 --> 00:07:04,563
- [Voiceover] It doesn't float.

141
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:22,838
(class chatting)

142
00:07:25,037 --> 00:07:26,880
- [Voiceover] Let me show you which one.

143
00:07:32,795 --> 00:07:34,478
- [Voiceover] Which one?

144
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:42,155
- [Voiceover] What about this one?

145
00:07:42,618 --> 00:07:45,782
- [Voiceover] He was growing legs.

146
00:07:45,782 --> 00:07:48,484
- [Voiceover] No, this one's growing legs.

147
00:07:48,484 --> 00:07:52,226
(class chatting)

148
00:08:00,888 --> 00:08:03,239
- [Voiceover] (mumbles)
but that's what tadpoles

149
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:04,602
swim in.

150
00:08:04,602 --> 00:08:07,201
Okay, you see them?

151
00:08:07,201 --> 00:08:08,142
- Shine it on it.

152
00:08:08,142 --> 00:08:09,343
- [Voiceover] No.

153
00:08:09,343 --> 00:08:11,043
You see they're moving because

154
00:08:11,043 --> 00:08:13,304
they're growing legs.

155
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:17,484
(class chatting)

156
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:20,769
- [Voiceover] If you yell really loud

157
00:08:20,769 --> 00:08:25,061
the glass will break and
then the tadpoles (mumbles).

158
00:08:26,183 --> 00:08:38,266
(class chatting)

159
00:08:39,074 --> 00:08:40,644
- [Voiceover] Frogs.

160
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,149
The frog's body.

161
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:59,222
(class chatting)

162
00:09:03,297 --> 00:09:35,552
(class chatting)

163
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,481
- [Voiceover] There's a water snake.

164
00:09:40,707 --> 00:09:42,115
There's a water snake.

165
00:09:42,955 --> 00:09:44,484
A water snake.

166
00:09:45,444 --> 00:09:52,928
(class chatting)

167
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,309
- What are you talking about over here?

168
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:01,975
- This thing has a frog in it.

169
00:10:04,756 --> 00:10:06,745
- And he just swam.

170
00:10:06,745 --> 00:10:09,951
- [Voiceover] Okay, so
we're talking over here.

171
00:10:12,261 --> 00:10:14,312
- Ms. Robbie, look.

172
00:10:15,552 --> 00:10:19,074
- So, you're comparing
the pond to your house.

173
00:10:19,074 --> 00:10:20,284
- Yeah.

174
00:10:20,626 --> 00:10:24,381
(class chatting)

175
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,932
- [Voiceover] Alright, did you
see this that she found out?

176
00:10:27,932 --> 00:10:30,776
It says the frog is pulling off its skin.

177
00:10:31,406 --> 00:10:33,421
I wonder why it's doing that.

178
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:37,550
- Because, so it can have different skin.

179
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,551
- Why would it make different skin?

180
00:10:40,551 --> 00:10:44,773
- It might need different
skin because of the way it lives.

181
00:10:44,773 --> 00:10:47,612
The way it lives, it has
to take off its own skin,

182
00:10:47,612 --> 00:10:51,240
just like a snake takes
off its whole skin.

183
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,118
Snakes take off their skin.

184
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,651
- Be a new frog.

185
00:10:59,864 --> 00:11:03,161
- The way they take off their
skin is they shred it off.

186
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:04,829
They don't have any arms.

187
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:07,351
Snakes shed their skin off
and they don't have no arms.

188
00:11:07,351 --> 00:11:08,859
- Snakes shed their skin?

189
00:11:08,859 --> 00:11:09,527
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

190
00:11:09,527 --> 00:11:12,124
- Do you think frogs shed their skin too?

191
00:11:12,124 --> 00:11:13,934
What do you think Aleha?

192
00:11:13,934 --> 00:11:16,878
You found the picture, tell
me what you're thinking.

193
00:11:16,878 --> 00:11:18,825
Let me hear Aleha.

194
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:21,702
- When it gets old they
have to take it off.

195
00:11:21,702 --> 00:11:23,222
- He has to take it off.

196
00:11:23,222 --> 00:11:25,996
Why do you think he needs
to take his skin off?

197
00:11:25,996 --> 00:11:27,315
- I was thinking...

198
00:11:27,315 --> 00:11:28,647
- Just a moment, Daniel,
let me hear Aleha,

199
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,226
I can't hear.

200
00:11:30,226 --> 00:11:34,280
- When it gets too rough
on him, he can take if off.

201
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,417
- [Voiceover] Maybe if
his skin feels rough.

202
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:37,984
Hmm, I'm wondering about that.

203
00:11:37,984 --> 00:11:40,328
That's giving me
something to wonder about.

204
00:11:40,328 --> 00:11:41,953
- Ms. Robbie, there's a water beetle.

205
00:11:41,953 --> 00:11:43,455
- Yes, but we're still looking at this

206
00:11:43,455 --> 00:11:45,826
about this frog coming off.

207
00:11:45,826 --> 00:11:48,524
She feels like maybe
when his skin is rough

208
00:11:48,524 --> 00:11:49,345
he takes it off.

209
00:11:49,345 --> 00:11:50,944
What did the page say?

210
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:54,554
It uses a word I'm not sure about, molt.

211
00:11:54,554 --> 00:11:57,926
It said frogs molt a few times every year.

212
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:00,487
- Because it's the way they live.

213
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:01,484
- [Voiceover] It's the way they live.

214
00:12:01,484 --> 00:12:04,135
- But we don't live that
way, the same way we do.

215
00:12:04,135 --> 00:12:06,407
We get bigger instead of shredding skin.

216
00:12:06,407 --> 00:12:07,772
- You're right.

217
00:12:07,772 --> 00:12:08,265
We get--

218
00:12:08,265 --> 00:12:09,287
What, what'd you say?

219
00:12:09,287 --> 00:12:09,807
Say that again.

220
00:12:09,807 --> 00:12:10,904
- We get bigger.

221
00:12:10,904 --> 00:12:12,175
- [Voiceover] We get bigger.

222
00:12:12,175 --> 00:12:13,711
- And they shred.

223
00:12:13,711 --> 00:12:15,887
- [Voiceover] And they shed their skin.

224
00:12:15,887 --> 00:12:17,817
- That's opposite.

225
00:12:17,817 --> 00:12:20,426
- Hmm, I'm going to write
down that word molt.

226
00:12:20,426 --> 00:12:21,615
We're going to talk
about that a little bit.

227
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:25,144
We're going to try to explore
that a little bit more.

228
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:44,782
(class chatting)

229
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:49,204
- The frogs are underground

230
00:12:50,764 --> 00:12:54,784
and they hatch out of the eggs
and turn into the tadpoles

231
00:12:55,644 --> 00:12:59,374
and they're going to grow up a little

232
00:12:59,374 --> 00:13:00,996
and they're going to lost their tail

233
00:13:00,996 --> 00:13:04,508
and they're going to
turn into an adult frog

234
00:13:04,508 --> 00:13:08,309
and then they are underground

235
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:10,251
when it's winter.

236
00:13:10,251 --> 00:13:11,582
- [Voiceover] When it's
winter they're undergound.

237
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,257
Okay, what have you all
found out about comparing?

238
00:13:14,257 --> 00:13:16,814
- [Voiceover] The frogs
protect their babies.

239
00:13:16,814 --> 00:13:19,184
- Do the frogs protect their babies?

240
00:13:19,184 --> 00:13:21,994
- No, they don't.

241
00:13:21,994 --> 00:13:23,520
What about your (mumbles)?

242
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,189
- They wait until they hatch.

243
00:13:25,189 --> 00:13:26,465
- [Voiceover] They wait till they hatch.

244
00:13:26,465 --> 00:13:28,468
- Frogs have bigger eyes than us

245
00:13:28,468 --> 00:13:31,122
because they have those eyes
like that on their heads

246
00:13:31,122 --> 00:13:32,180
and we don't.

247
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,511
- And we have eyes that are small.

248
00:13:33,511 --> 00:13:37,250
And when you were born did your mom or dad

249
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,579
take care of you or your grown up?

250
00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:40,417
- [Voiceover] Yes.

251
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:42,712
- [Voiceover] I went to my
grandma when I'm a baby.

252
00:13:42,712 --> 00:13:44,501
- Okay, did your grownup take care of you

253
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:46,041
when you were a baby, Andreas?

254
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:46,607
- [Voiceover] Yes.

255
00:13:46,607 --> 00:13:49,007
- Yeah, well what about the mother frogs?

256
00:13:49,007 --> 00:13:49,724
- No.

257
00:13:49,724 --> 00:13:50,771
- [Voiceover] I got a lot of food I love.

258
00:13:50,771 --> 00:13:51,596
- You got a lot of food.

259
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:54,325
- [Voiceover] I eat chicken
and rice, everything.

260
00:13:54,325 --> 00:13:55,981
- Andreas just think about our tadpoles.

261
00:13:55,981 --> 00:13:58,244
Is the momma frog in here
taking care of those tadpoles?

262
00:13:58,244 --> 00:13:59,735
- [Class] No.

263
00:14:01,395 --> 00:14:03,243
- [Voiceover] They wait till they hatch.

264
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:05,841
- Maybe the momma frog missed them.

265
00:14:05,841 --> 00:14:10,064
- [Voiceover] Probably if
they die after wintertime...
