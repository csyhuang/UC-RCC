1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,756
- [Voiceover] Today is Wednesday.

2
00:00:01,756 --> 00:00:03,665
- Yes, I would clone myself.

3
00:00:04,947 --> 00:00:07,118
- Good, why? Why would you clone yourself?

4
00:00:07,118 --> 00:00:11,477
- Because everybody deserves a second me.

5
00:00:11,704 --> 00:00:13,261
(several laughs)
- So you would just...

6
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:14,445
- And I would clone a woolly mammoth

7
00:00:14,445 --> 00:00:17,869
for my clone to ride on.
(several laughs) Honestly...

8
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:20,248
- What would some of the negatives

9
00:00:20,248 --> 00:00:22,438
to cloning something like that?

10
00:00:22,476 --> 00:00:25,194
- (straightens throat) Well,
it's another me (mumbles).

11
00:00:25,194 --> 00:00:27,608
But it's still good,
because, you know, I'm me,

12
00:00:27,608 --> 00:00:29,264
and I'm good and bad.

13
00:00:29,709 --> 00:00:31,068
- Do you know your clone
is not going to be, like,

14
00:00:31,068 --> 00:00:34,081
set, right? You're gonna have
to wait for it to grow up.

15
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,354
- So, I have to raise a
little baby clone of me?

16
00:00:37,593 --> 00:00:38,944
(several laughs)
- Yes.

17
00:00:39,032 --> 00:00:40,052
- And it'll look just
like me when I was a baby?

18
00:00:40,052 --> 00:00:42,365
- Pretty much.
- Oh, that's wrong!

19
00:00:42,365 --> 00:00:44,313
(several laughs)
Oh, my God.

20
00:00:44,313 --> 00:00:46,264
There are so many possibilities.

21
00:00:46,264 --> 00:00:48,413
- Alright. So, let's start off with...

22
00:00:51,043 --> 00:00:52,824
- I'll get it a baby (mumbles).

23
00:00:52,824 --> 00:00:54,204
- Raise your hand if
you can remind us, like,

24
00:00:54,204 --> 00:00:55,697
what is cloning?

25
00:00:58,745 --> 00:01:00,427
There's only one of you?

26
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:03,979
- Like taking the DNA, or,
like, I don't know, like,

27
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:07,939
whatever, out of one person,
like, trying to, like

28
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:09,807
duplicate it into another one?

29
00:01:09,807 --> 00:01:12,105
- Okay,great. We're all...
well, was there only,

30
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,992
like, one type of cloning?

31
00:01:15,205 --> 00:01:16,958
What were some of the different types?

32
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:21,031
- Well, one type of cloning

33
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:25,761
is only tissues and organs only,

34
00:01:25,761 --> 00:01:29,836
and another one is,

35
00:01:29,836 --> 00:01:34,836
let's see, animal and livestock cloning.

36
00:01:36,676 --> 00:01:40,194
- Anything else you want
to add to that? Gady?

37
00:01:41,348 --> 00:01:44,380
So, what's one way they do
the cloning? So, they take

38
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,585
the DNA from one animal, what do they do?

39
00:01:46,585 --> 00:01:48,745
- [Gady] (mumbles)

40
00:01:48,745 --> 00:01:51,298
- Do you remember what parts they used?

41
00:01:51,298 --> 00:01:52,959
Like what kind of cell they used?

42
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:53,841
- [Gady] Nucleus?

43
00:01:53,841 --> 00:01:55,627
- They did take the
nucleus. And they used?

44
00:01:55,627 --> 00:01:56,940
- [Another Student] (mumbles)

45
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,125
- The eggs of the other animal.

46
00:01:58,125 --> 00:01:59,401
Okay, it's kind of interesting.
You can take the egg

47
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:02,558
from one animal and
completely change its DNA.

48
00:02:02,558 --> 00:02:07,005
So, now when that turns into
a new organism, it's an

49
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:10,610
identical copy of the
animal that it came from.

50
00:02:11,184 --> 00:02:13,181
- And if you take... you can bring back

51
00:02:13,181 --> 00:02:17,050
endangered species, too.
Because remember that (mumbles)

52
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,413
or whatever, then they put in the cow?

53
00:02:19,413 --> 00:02:21,980
- Yeah.
- But they were, like,

54
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,155
related in some kind of way,
so it wasn't, like, weird.

55
00:02:25,557 --> 00:02:27,297
- That's true. It was
probably a decendent.

56
00:02:27,297 --> 00:02:29,231
Do you guys remember that from the video?

57
00:02:29,596 --> 00:02:34,029
They had tried to take an animal
that was almost extinct,

58
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:35,900
in fact, they couldn't actually
do the tests on the animal.

59
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,398
Remember, they were saying
that there were so few of them

60
00:02:37,398 --> 00:02:39,128
that they couldn't even
do the tests on them?

61
00:02:39,128 --> 00:02:41,876
Right? How long did (mumbles)
last? Does anyone remember?

62
00:02:41,876 --> 00:02:43,333
- [Several people] Three days.

63
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:44,727
- Yeah, it was about three days, right.

64
00:02:44,727 --> 00:02:47,062
But it was the first time.

65
00:02:47,062 --> 00:02:48,483
- So, when they couldn't open up that cow,

66
00:02:48,483 --> 00:02:50,428
the cow died, right?

67
00:02:50,957 --> 00:02:53,313
- I don't know that for sure,
but I'm guessing that they were

68
00:02:53,313 --> 00:02:55,931
not that interested in the cow medically.

69
00:02:56,192 --> 00:02:57,573
They were...
- Oh, no, I was just wondering

70
00:02:57,573 --> 00:03:00,116
because there's a cow sitting there

71
00:03:00,116 --> 00:03:04,046
with a giant gaping hole in its womb.

72
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:07,169
- That's true. That does happen.

73
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:09,740
- I mean, I don't care if
the cow died, honestly.

74
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:13,191
That's another hamburger for me.

75
00:03:13,191 --> 00:03:15,312
But that Goward? That
Goward? That's swole.

76
00:03:15,312 --> 00:03:17,436
You can't get any other animal like that.

77
00:03:17,436 --> 00:03:20,176
- Anybody else in here
agree that it's okay to do

78
00:03:20,176 --> 00:03:23,473
that testing to save endangered species?

79
00:03:23,473 --> 00:03:25,493
- Well yeah, because if
there's like a hundred million

80
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:30,493
cows and one... whatever
that thing was called...

81
00:03:31,576 --> 00:03:32,853
(several laughs)

82
00:03:32,853 --> 00:03:34,118
- So, we should probably
try and get more of them?

83
00:03:34,118 --> 00:03:35,395
- Yeah, why not?
- Okay.

84
00:03:35,395 --> 00:03:37,090
- We should clone pandas.

85
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,089
- Let's hear somebody else, though.

86
00:03:38,089 --> 00:03:39,389
Is there anybody else that has....

87
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,773
- (mumbles)
- I said, (mumbles) alligator.

88
00:03:43,773 --> 00:03:46,278
(mumbles) try and bring it back.

89
00:03:46,278 --> 00:03:47,894
- That's true. What happens
when there's so many?

90
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,027
I mean, how many of you have ever watched

91
00:03:50,027 --> 00:03:51,147
the movie Jurassic Park?

92
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,043
- Oh, my God, I've seen all
of them at least twice.

93
00:03:53,043 --> 00:03:54,561
- So, that's a good question.

94
00:03:54,561 --> 00:03:56,648
So, if we can bring back
something that looks like a cow,

95
00:03:56,648 --> 00:03:58,703
fabulous. What happens when you
want to bring something

96
00:03:58,703 --> 00:04:01,524
that looks just as cool,
but has bigger teeth?

97
00:04:01,524 --> 00:04:06,524
- Well, you see, it breaks
out of the cage, like in

98
00:04:06,527 --> 00:04:09,419
Jurassic Park the Lost World,
and it starts attacking

99
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:11,242
all the...
- Great.

100
00:04:11,242 --> 00:04:13,901
- Well, yeah, it kind of
started eating people.

101
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:16,187
- That was wrong.
- Fabulous, but what could be

102
00:04:16,187 --> 00:04:18,463
some of the downfalls on that?

103
00:04:18,463 --> 00:04:20,878
Like, any negatives to cloning animals

104
00:04:20,878 --> 00:04:22,972
that are endangered or almost extinct?

105
00:04:23,164 --> 00:04:25,265
- Well, hardly any of the (mumbles)

106
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,216
- You need to...
- The DNA might get messed up

107
00:04:27,216 --> 00:04:30,281
(mumbles)
- Yeah, but remember

108
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:31,860
that when we're messing
around with the DNA, yeah,

109
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,188
maybe there could be a
mistake. What happens then?

110
00:04:34,657 --> 00:04:38,094
- (several mumbles)
- It could die.

111
00:04:38,094 --> 00:04:41,185
- It could die, yes.
- I would say. One good thing

112
00:04:41,195 --> 00:04:43,976
about bringing dinosaurs
back is that you finally

113
00:04:43,976 --> 00:04:46,077
get to study them the way we want to.

114
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:49,676
- That's probably what
scientists are thinking.

115
00:04:49,676 --> 00:04:51,336
"Wouldn't that be great
if I could study something

116
00:04:51,336 --> 00:04:53,460
and actually be able to touch
it and see what it does?"

117
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,537
Because a lot of things they
tell you about, you know,

118
00:04:56,537 --> 00:04:59,125
dinosaurs, is what they think
they do. "Well, we think

119
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,378
they eat this," and, "We
think this is how they lived."

120
00:05:01,378 --> 00:05:04,315
Wouldn't it be great if we
could actually study those?

121
00:05:04,315 --> 00:05:06,055
- What if dinosaurs were never real?

122
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:09,121
- Well, they found skeleton remains,

123
00:05:09,121 --> 00:05:12,139
so they're pretty much
sure they were around.

124
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:14,781
- They also found (mumbles).
(another student coughs)

125
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:17,875
Because you can't just stick
an animal in an environment

126
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,779
and maybe it will survive, because it will

127
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:22,029
mess up the chain of life.

128
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:26,289
- Anthony has a really good
point, because what's going

129
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:28,669
to happen if we have dinosaurs?
We can't just stick them

130
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:31,269
somewhere for them to roam
around. Because they don't

131
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:34,802
have anything they can
naturally eat anymore.

132
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:36,785
And they don't have any
natural predators anymore.

133
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:39,209
- That's why you just bring
back T-rexes and velociraptors.

134
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:41,551
And what not. Then, you
just feed them cows.

135
00:05:41,551 --> 00:05:43,351
(several laughs)

136
00:05:43,351 --> 00:05:45,584
- You don't know if they
necessarily eat cows, though.

137
00:05:45,584 --> 00:05:47,243
You don't know that.
- Well, it's meat.

138
00:05:47,243 --> 00:05:50,830
- It is meat, but that's
also your food source.

139
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,908
- Well, that's not going to be (mumbles).

140
00:05:53,908 --> 00:05:58,121
Maybe eight or nine. Maybe 25 for a T-Rex.

141
00:05:58,121 --> 00:06:00,326
(several laughs)
- You're underestimating

142
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,729
the size of some of these animals.

143
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,749
But the same thing
applies to actual animals,

144
00:06:04,749 --> 00:06:08,499
instead of just dinosaurs.
What happens if we have animals

145
00:06:08,499 --> 00:06:10,740
that are going extinct because
we are building new houses,

146
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,199
and we're expanding our
cities? So, we're moving into

147
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,903
some areas where there are
some animals, and they start

148
00:06:16,903 --> 00:06:20,474
to die off because we are
taking over their land?

149
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,404
So yeah, we could make a
hundred copies of these animals,

150
00:06:23,404 --> 00:06:27,619
or whether it's plants, or
birds, or certain insects.

151
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:30,243
But that is a good question -
where are they going to live

152
00:06:30,243 --> 00:06:33,679
if we just bring them back?
- Wildlife park.

153
00:06:33,679 --> 00:06:36,477
- So, that is a good thing.
And again, remember that

154
00:06:36,477 --> 00:06:39,065
you all add (mumbles) because
if you put them somewhere

155
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,730
that (mumbles) a park, they
won't necessarily survive.

156
00:06:41,981 --> 00:06:43,779
So, you might need to think
about all the other stuff

157
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,770
that goes with that. So, yeah, the food chain.

158
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:49,008
Interesting, how everything's connected.

159
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:51,603
Raise your hand if you'd like to share

160
00:06:51,603 --> 00:06:53,988
one of your questions from yesterday.

161
00:06:57,177 --> 00:06:58,638
We'll start with Anthony.

162
00:06:58,638 --> 00:07:03,015
- Okay, so like say me
and this lady get married.

163
00:07:03,015 --> 00:07:08,015
We both can't have kids, so
they take my DNA and they make a

164
00:07:09,354 --> 00:07:13,463
clone of me. I'm married to this person.

165
00:07:13,463 --> 00:07:18,463
Would that be only my child,
or would that be our child?

166
00:07:18,932 --> 00:07:23,932
- (several mumbles)
- And if, why?

167
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:27,115
- (several mumbles)
- Maybe, yeah.

168
00:07:27,115 --> 00:07:31,643
- But what if you're married?
- (several mumbles)

169
00:07:31,643 --> 00:07:34,057
- Well, does it require two
people that has your DNA?

170
00:07:34,057 --> 00:07:38,439
I'm sorry I didn't hear you.
- (mumbles)

171
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:40,581
- Maybe, it is. Maybe it's
totally the environment.

172
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:42,113
Who's to say? Maybe if you
raise it, and you're like,

173
00:07:42,113 --> 00:07:43,774
"This is our kid..."

174
00:07:45,404 --> 00:07:48,644
- Well, because of that case,
then, there can't be any more

175
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:52,578
like if we depended on cloning,
there woudn't be any...

176
00:07:54,438 --> 00:07:57,049
(mumbles) well, there'd be
less drama in the world,

177
00:07:57,049 --> 00:08:01,321
because we wouldn't be...
doing stuff the natural way.

178
00:08:01,321 --> 00:08:03,701
And, like, people being
knocked up in bars and stuff,

179
00:08:03,701 --> 00:08:05,605
(several laughs)
and random places, and stuff,

180
00:08:05,605 --> 00:08:08,478
and, like, not knowing their
father in life, you know.

181
00:08:08,681 --> 00:08:10,590
But you know what I'm saying, right?

182
00:08:11,108 --> 00:08:13,597
- Do you think it would be hard?

183
00:08:14,706 --> 00:08:16,819
- Like, what if people
were 100% dependent on this?

184
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:20,030
There would be a lot less problems.

185
00:08:21,463 --> 00:08:24,319
- Eventually, if you
keep cloning yourself,

186
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,569
and then your clone cloned itself,

187
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:28,009
and your clone clones itself...

188
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:29,018
- You'd have the same group of people.

189
00:08:29,018 --> 00:08:30,460
- You'd have the best group ever.

190
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,316
- Yeah, but how would you know
because you wouldn't be here.

191
00:08:32,316 --> 00:08:34,702
- That's dumb, that's what that is.

192
00:08:35,008 --> 00:08:36,077
- That's interesting.

193
00:08:36,077 --> 00:08:39,908
- We can't have just a
bunch of the same people.

194
00:08:39,908 --> 00:08:43,912
That'd be one stupid...
That'd be dumb, man.

195
00:08:43,912 --> 00:08:45,793
(background chatter)
- I don't know.

196
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:46,769
Walking around seeing all the same people?

197
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:51,240
- That's stupid! You're
not going be like (mumbles)

198
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,512
- Like the Matrix, everything repeating?

199
00:08:54,512 --> 00:08:57,580
- Other questions. Let's get
one from a female this time.

200
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,482
We got the guys' questions.
Let's get a girl.

201
00:09:01,614 --> 00:09:03,355
Don't all shout out all at once.

202
00:09:03,355 --> 00:09:04,934
Mayra, what's one of your questions?

203
00:09:08,694 --> 00:09:12,316
- I said, like, if they clone
a sheep, and it's like, sick,

204
00:09:12,316 --> 00:09:16,578
wouldn't it... or let's say there's
 a regular sheep,

205
00:09:16,578 --> 00:09:19,405
and they clone that, wouldn't
the clone be sick, too?

206
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:23,983
- What did she say?
- Not necessarily.

207
00:09:23,983 --> 00:09:25,737
- No, because it's like you said,

208
00:09:25,737 --> 00:09:26,898
it's two entire different bodies of life.

209
00:09:26,898 --> 00:09:28,883
A lot of things can go
wrong in one person.

210
00:09:28,883 --> 00:09:31,900
So, how could it just be the same thing,

211
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,391
two different (mumbles)?

212
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,379
Unless it's like a problem
with an organ that the one had,

213
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:40,464
and then (mumbles).

214
00:09:42,757 --> 00:09:47,757
- Well, I want to say that,
like, a disesased kid (mumbles)

215
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:53,458
- Maybe. What about, remember, you
just did genetics, right?

216
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,717
If it's in your DNA, what would happen?

217
00:09:57,905 --> 00:09:59,746
- If it was in your DNA...
- (background crosstalk)

218
00:09:59,746 --> 00:10:01,965
- It probably would get
it. If it was something

219
00:10:01,965 --> 00:10:03,073
that it caught, it
probably wouldn't get it.

220
00:10:03,073 --> 00:10:05,984
- That's true. So it depends,
I guess, maybe what it is.

221
00:10:05,984 --> 00:10:09,816
Right? So you have this sheep,
just cloned it, and because

222
00:10:09,816 --> 00:10:12,822
it has something very serious
with it, and if it's genetic,

223
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:14,263
then yeah, there's probably
a chance that that clone

224
00:10:14,263 --> 00:10:16,899
would probably have the
exact same disorder later on.

225
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,193
I think they were showing...
Remember when they were doing Dolly

226
00:10:21,193 --> 00:10:23,306
and they showed some of the
animals they had cloned?

227
00:10:23,306 --> 00:10:26,254
I think they were talking
about the sheep, Dolly,

228
00:10:26,254 --> 00:10:29,087
and then they had some mice
that they had cloned.

229
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:32,164
They had said that the animals
 they had cloned...

230
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:34,059
does anyone remember what
any of the side effects...

231
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:35,480
what they've noticed?

232
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:37,167
- [Student] (mumbles)

233
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:39,419
- Sometimes they can't
breathe right. What else?

234
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:40,894
- [Student] (mumbles)

235
00:10:40,894 --> 00:10:42,332
- Sometimes they died really young.

236
00:10:42,332 --> 00:10:45,387
So, just because it's a clone...

237
00:10:45,387 --> 00:10:47,848
maybe we haven't quite figured it out yet.

238
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,367
Because it seems like
maybe there are some issues

239
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:53,612
with the animals actually
coming out healthy or normal,

240
00:10:53,872 --> 00:10:56,009
if they're dying younger or
having problems growing.

241
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:00,544
Other questions? Hector, what
is one of your questions?

242
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:05,455
Or, if you don't have your
questions ready, or you feel like 
your

243
00:11:05,455 --> 00:11:07,961
questions were answered,
maybe you just have a comment.

244
00:11:08,732 --> 00:11:12,233
(mumbles)

245
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:16,289
- You have none? What do
you think about cloning?

246
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:21,289
(fire engine siren)

247
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,025
Do you agree with it? Or are

248
00:11:24,025 --> 00:11:26,290
there are certain places or
times you would agree with it?

249
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,694
- Um, I agree with it.

250
00:11:28,694 --> 00:11:33,604
Like, the pros I would agree with it,

251
00:11:33,604 --> 00:11:35,925
 like, for food?
- For what?

252
00:11:35,925 --> 00:11:39,106
- Like cloning for more food?
- Oh, like the chickens?

253
00:11:39,106 --> 00:11:41,670
Right? Cloning to make more
chickens. Wouldn't it be great

254
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,564
if I have a perfect chicken,
and I could make a hundred

255
00:11:43,564 --> 00:11:45,943
copies of the same perfect chicken?

256
00:11:45,943 --> 00:11:47,869
(several background voices)

257
00:11:47,869 --> 00:11:50,402
- I've had all types of chickens.
They all taste the same.

258
00:11:50,402 --> 00:11:52,364
(several laughs)
- That's true.

259
00:11:52,364 --> 00:11:54,069
- Everything tastes like chicken.

260
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:56,102
- But have you ever gotten
like a really tiny drumstick,

261
00:11:56,102 --> 00:11:58,261
and then you got like
the nice meaty drumstick?

262
00:11:58,261 --> 00:12:01,464
- Well, like a tiny little
drumstick. They still taste good.

263
00:12:01,464 --> 00:12:03,066
(several laughs)

264
00:12:03,066 --> 00:12:05,191
- True, but what one gives you more food?

265
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,746
- You got a point there.
- Okay, so maybe, right...

266
00:12:07,746 --> 00:12:10,938
- But still, you could
put them together...

267
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,685
- In the case of KFC, the reason
why their chicken's so big

268
00:12:15,685 --> 00:12:18,088
is because they put hormones
in them to make them big.

269
00:12:18,088 --> 00:12:21,129
- Yes. That's the way they approach that.

270
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:22,732
- That's the best way
to do that right there.

271
00:12:22,732 --> 00:12:24,956
- Not really. People get cancer from that.

272
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:27,783
- So, would this be a good solution?

273
00:12:27,783 --> 00:12:30,649
So instead of making... eating... our cows

274
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:33,028
and feeding pigs, and
feeding chickens these extra

275
00:12:33,028 --> 00:12:35,548
vitamins and extra hormones,
to make them larger

276
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:39,309
and grow faster, would it better
to just take the large, big cows

277
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:43,060
and just clone them? Or make
chicken and make copies of it?

278
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,801
Yes? No?

279
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:51,265
- Does anyone see any... maybe.
This sounds really great,

280
00:12:51,265 --> 00:12:53,411
like we're going to make
these big meaty chickens

281
00:12:53,411 --> 00:12:56,466
so that everybody has a lot
of chicken that they can eat,

282
00:12:56,466 --> 00:12:59,442
but is there any downside to that?

283
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:06,368
- No. Honestly, no, I don't think so.

284
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,691
- Not for you. Great.
Is there anybody else?

285
00:13:07,691 --> 00:13:09,873
- Money.
- Money how?

286
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:12,207
- They could cost more to (mumbles),

287
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:14,145
but they could cost less
and be more affordable,

288
00:13:14,145 --> 00:13:16,131
which is what we want.

289
00:13:16,131 --> 00:13:17,303
- Good. Money is a good issue, right?

290
00:13:17,303 --> 00:13:19,310
People won't have to
think about money issues?

291
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,169
- I don't think there'd be a money issue

292
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:22,748
if you were cloning chickens,
because you can always

293
00:13:22,748 --> 00:13:26,742
just get, you know, take
a syringe and, like...

294
00:13:26,742 --> 00:13:28,263
- But that's what he was saying,
that maybe it'd be cheaper

295
00:13:28,263 --> 00:13:29,910
if they could make it
without using as much stuff.

296
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,460
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

297
00:13:32,105 --> 00:13:34,258
- It would take longer.

298
00:13:35,066 --> 00:13:38,112
- What do you guys think about
the cloning for body parts?

299
00:13:39,325 --> 00:13:42,285
- Can I go back to the chickens

300
00:13:42,285 --> 00:13:43,424
for a second?
- Sure, go for it.

301
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:47,171
- Wouldn't there be a lot less
farmers, so then there'd be

302
00:13:47,171 --> 00:13:51,081
a lot less jobs because,
you know, like the whole...

303
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,550
- That is true.
- Like a lot of companies

304
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:55,011
will go out of business
because, I don't know,

305
00:13:55,011 --> 00:13:58,193
I feel like there's like a monopoly on it,

306
00:13:58,193 --> 00:14:01,079
- More private
industries are going to go

307
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:03,819
out of business, and that's
going to destroy livelihoods.

308
00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:06,441
Because all the big livestock companies

309
00:14:06,441 --> 00:14:09,554
like KFC and McDonald's...
well, they're not

310
00:14:09,554 --> 00:14:11,493
a livestock company, they're fast food.

311
00:14:11,493 --> 00:14:12,817
- But they're going to be selling it

312
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:14,093
to those (mumbles), right?

313
00:14:14,093 --> 00:14:15,939
They're going to let it go off of...

314
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:19,060
- Just by show of hands, who
in here might have a problem

315
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,719
eating food if they knew that it had been

316
00:14:21,719 --> 00:14:24,964
genetically messed around with?

317
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:28,952
- That's just because you
guys are okay with dying.

318
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,670
(several laughs)

319
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:34,397
- Chris, not sure, or
does it just kind of...

320
00:14:35,437 --> 00:14:37,747
- I don't care, really.

321
00:14:38,157 --> 00:14:40,707
(several voices)
- What was the question?

322
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,716
- Oh, I said would you
be bothered if you ate

323
00:14:45,716 --> 00:14:47,178
genetically modified food?

324
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:50,687
- No, before that. The one
before Anthony started talking.

325
00:14:50,687 --> 00:14:52,217
- We were trying to see
if there was any downside

326
00:14:52,217 --> 00:14:55,543
of cloning chickens.
- We'll get there.

327
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,696
I know the question. We'll get there.

328
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:01,221
- I want to say something.
- We'll get there.

329
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:06,221
Alright. Erica.

330
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,000
Medical, the cloning the body parts, like

331
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,182
if people are sick and they
need a new heart, or new lungs,

332
00:15:11,182 --> 00:15:13,944
or a new kidney.
- Ms. Scott, I wrote the name

333
00:15:13,944 --> 00:15:16,580
of it. It's called Therapeutic Cloning.

334
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,783
They refer to it that way.
So, that's what it's called

335
00:15:19,783 --> 00:15:21,385
when you do that.

336
00:15:21,385 --> 00:15:26,181
- So when we're using it,
for cloning for the organs

337
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:29,395
for individuals who have
issues, whether it's,

338
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:32,821
like just a few cells, or
like nervous cells for people

339
00:15:32,821 --> 00:15:36,425
who had spinal cord injuries...
what do you think about that?

340
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,915
- I think it's a good idea.
- It's a good idea?

341
00:15:38,915 --> 00:15:43,915
Do you have any reasons
to be worried about that?

342
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:49,090
- (mumbles)

343
00:15:53,298 --> 00:15:56,699
- It would be better than nothing?

344
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:59,521
Any concerns. Anybody else?

345
00:15:59,521 --> 00:16:02,580
- Have you heard of of
a book called (mumbles)?

346
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,040
What was it called?
- (mumbles)

347
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,336
- I don't think I have. What's it about?

348
00:16:07,365 --> 00:16:12,224
- (mumbles)
- That's okay.

349
00:16:12,244 --> 00:16:14,453
(several laughs)

350
00:16:14,453 --> 00:16:15,127
Levon is going to have to read it now,

351
00:16:15,127 --> 00:16:17,043
because he'll be like, "What?"

352
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:19,597
- It's about, like, in
the future, will people,

353
00:16:19,597 --> 00:16:24,597
if parents don't want their
kids any more, they can, like,

354
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:27,131
they can give them a
(mumbles), like they can take

355
00:16:27,131 --> 00:16:30,950
their other body parts off
and... they can take their

356
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:35,950
other body parts off of them
and stuff, so they (mumbles)

357
00:16:40,602 --> 00:16:45,602
like your body parts are
still alive, (mumbles)

358
00:16:47,575 --> 00:16:49,129
so one arm could
be like your real arm,

359
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:51,463
and your other arm could be like (mumbles).

360
00:16:51,463 --> 00:16:54,993
- Interesting. I'll have
to read that book sometime.

361
00:16:56,423 --> 00:16:59,776
Now, when they're doing
the therapeutic cloning,

362
00:16:59,776 --> 00:17:02,980
they're not actually creating,
like, a whole new human,

363
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,800
and then (mumbles, video
disruption) the body parts up.

364
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,523
There's a couple of different
ways they were doing it.

365
00:17:09,399 --> 00:17:13,079
- (mumbles)

366
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,724
- Do you remember what
they were using to...

367
00:17:15,724 --> 00:17:17,293
how they were growing the organs?

368
00:17:17,293 --> 00:17:22,293
- (mumbles)

369
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:25,954
- That is true. But what
were they trying to do

370
00:17:25,954 --> 00:17:28,089
with the cloning? How are
they trying to avoid that?

371
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,045
Do you remember? Does anybody remember?

372
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:33,116
How is cloning supposed to help your body

373
00:17:33,116 --> 00:17:34,619
to keep from rejecting?

374
00:17:36,157 --> 00:17:39,455
Because...
- Do you guys remember what happened

375
00:17:39,455 --> 00:17:41,086
to the woman...

376
00:17:42,357 --> 00:17:44,794
- Close. Very close to that.
(indistinct voices)

377
00:17:44,794 --> 00:17:46,594
So, remember when you get a body organ,

378
00:17:46,594 --> 00:17:48,289
like the lady with the kidney, right?

379
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:49,612
Who'd she get the kidney from?

380
00:17:49,612 --> 00:17:50,761
- [Several Students] Her aunt.

381
00:17:50,761 --> 00:17:52,933
- Yeah, so she got it from her aunt.

382
00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:53,873
Somebody she was not even related to

383
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:55,452
that just happens to
be part of the family.

384
00:17:55,452 --> 00:17:59,248
Like, they were a match.
She had to take... remember

385
00:17:59,248 --> 00:18:01,696
all of those pills she had
to take? To make sure

386
00:18:01,696 --> 00:18:03,149
her body doesn't, like,
get rid of the kidney.

387
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:05,750
And then, unfortunately, it still did?

388
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,431
So, they're looking at
getting, making kidneys,

389
00:18:08,431 --> 00:18:11,479
and I think that they were
growing them inside of a cow.

390
00:18:13,015 --> 00:18:16,739
I think it was a cow. Might have
been a pig. It was a big animal.

391
00:18:16,739 --> 00:18:19,699
- So, you're going to grow human
kidneys that are functional?

392
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,557
- Mm hmm.
- On a cow?

393
00:18:21,557 --> 00:18:23,425
They were using another
animal, and they were actually

394
00:18:23,425 --> 00:18:26,676
growing it, like, not in
the animal. It wasn't part

395
00:18:26,676 --> 00:18:28,998
of the animal. They were
using the animal as a place

396
00:18:28,998 --> 00:18:31,504
to keep it growing and functioning.

397
00:18:31,504 --> 00:18:34,175
- So on the outside of a
cow, there'd be kidneys.

398
00:18:34,175 --> 00:18:38,400
- Underneath the skin. Yep.
And then they would take

399
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,445
take them out, and
transplant them into humans.

400
00:18:40,445 --> 00:18:43,138
- This is like that episode
of South Park where...

401
00:18:43,138 --> 00:18:45,855
it's a little bit
inappropriate, but not too much.

402
00:18:45,855 --> 00:18:47,921
- Then let's not go there.
It's a little too inappropriate,

403
00:18:47,921 --> 00:18:50,254
then let's not.
- Nevermind. Nevermind.

404
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,158
You're going to watch it for yourself.

405
00:18:52,158 --> 00:18:55,001
- Fabulous. But they are
also trying, by cloning,

406
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:58,113
because remember a lot of
times they're trying to find

407
00:18:58,113 --> 00:19:00,540
animal parts that might match.
Like for example, did you

408
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,359
know a pig heart is about
the same size as a human heart?

409
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,961
- So, you could have a pig heart?

410
00:19:05,961 --> 00:19:07,934
- They were thinking
about taking pig hearts

411
00:19:07,934 --> 00:19:10,953
and transplanting them into
people that needed new hearts.

412
00:19:10,953 --> 00:19:12,751
The problem is, of course,
is it's a pig's heart,

413
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:17,292
which means the outside of the
heart looks like, pig cells.

414
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:20,391
So, your body would know
that it's not a human heart.

415
00:19:20,391 --> 00:19:23,061
It would know that it's a pig heart.

416
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,452
And your body probably
won't want that in its body.

417
00:19:25,452 --> 00:19:27,658
So, they were trying,
remember they had, trying

418
00:19:27,658 --> 00:19:28,692
to grow new pigs?

419
00:19:28,692 --> 00:19:30,712
I think they had little
piglets running around?

420
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:34,090
The pigs had human DNA in
there to make the outside

421
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,398
of their hearts and the outside
of their lungs, and kidneys

422
00:19:37,398 --> 00:19:41,613
all kind of copy what a
human cell would look like

423
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,690
on the outside? So, that when
they keep those body parts,

424
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:46,709
if they put them in a human,
your body wouldn't recognize

425
00:19:46,709 --> 00:19:50,493
it as being something different.

426
00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:54,069
- (mumbles)

427
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:57,338
- Did you know they've
actually done that?

428
00:19:57,338 --> 00:20:02,338
- My dad's friend's
daughter has pig intestines.
