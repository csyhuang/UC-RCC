1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:08,200
- Okay. So if you're having trouble seeing
it, you can go back in with a regular

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:13,730
pencil brush. Visible enough for you? You
can go back in and make it lighter. But

3
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:18,500
right now, the mark makings you're doing
is really good. As you want to turn, if

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,440
you're having trouble making curved lines,
you can turn--

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,430
- Oh, okay. All right, that helps.

6
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:29,150
- Instead of turning the tool, turn the
plate and keep pulling towards you.

7
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:29,480
- Okay.

8
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,080
- It might make it a little bit easier to
make those curves.

9
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,956
- Yeah, they're really tough to do.

10
00:00:33,956 --> 00:00:35,280
Other than that, it's been fine.

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:35,652
- Good.

12
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,480
- Is that working now that you, what we
talked about yesterday with this little...

13
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,070
- Yeah.

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,140
- ...shadow?

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,800
- I thought it was kind of--

16
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,560
- Okay. And the same thing that I just
told Kim, if you're having trouble with

17
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:56,020
the curved lines, you can turn your plate
and keep pulling towards you instead of

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,310
using the tool to curve. All right, but so
far what you're doing is good. You're

19
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:05,150
adding all these different values.
Continue with that type of texture on the

20
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,200
edges because that's working.

21
00:01:08,025 --> 00:01:09,023
- I'm just going--

22
00:01:09,023 --> 00:01:13,120
- That's okay. Be patient. Have you
decided yet how you're gonna treat this

23
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,210
area in here?

24
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:19,260
- No, I'm probably gonna do what you
initially told me treating the light areas

25
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,990
from start from this bottom half
and doing--

26
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:27,440
- Okay, so adding a different texture. Are
you leaving the text?

27
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,824
- I never... I forgot to reprint it so
if I do decide...

28
00:01:31,824 --> 00:01:33,381
- You'll just have to reverse the text.

29
00:01:33,381 --> 00:01:35,300
- Yeah, I know, and I'll,
right, add it in.

30
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:35,936
- That's fine.

31
00:01:35,936 --> 00:01:37,980
- I think I'll just decide it later.

32
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,220
- Yeah, finish your whole overall design
first.

33
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:39,830
- Yes, exactly.

34
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,110
- And then if you want the text in it, as
long as it's reversed so you print it the

35
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:43,410
right way.

36
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,730
- Yeah.

37
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,750
- You can just reprint it. Okay, sounds
good.

38
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,140
- Awesome.

39
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,140
- Yeah.

40
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,680
- So you're just... [Background Chatter]

41
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:57,860
- [together] Yeah.

42
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,360
- All right, the way you're doing the
crosshatching here is really strong so

43
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,820
continue that to make sure that it's
consistent.

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,610
- Do I have to make it identical?

45
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,470
- No. Well, what do you think?
Are these identical persons?

46
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:15,574
- It's like supposed to be but I know I'm
not gonna be able to get the exact family

47
00:02:15,574 --> 00:02:19,650
on the other side but I think it would
look fine if it was different. I kinda

48
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,250
want it to look a little messy.

49
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,900
- You want there to be a little bit of a
different expressive line on each one. I

50
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,290
don't think there's anything wrong with
making them separate. I know that they're

51
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,310
trying to be echoing each other
symmetrically.

52
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:33,720
- Yeah.

53
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,160
- But all of the textures can be
different...

54
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:36,380
- Okay.

55
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,010
- ...to add some interest to it.

56
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,672
- I think it would be difficult to try to
get the exact same thing on the other

57
00:02:42,672 --> 00:02:42,905
side.

58
00:02:42,905 --> 00:02:46,420
- Right. Don't you think that it might be
more expressive to add different types of

59
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:46,900
textures anyway?

60
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,000
- Yeah, definitely.

61
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,610
- That's good. How did you decide that
you're going to treat the inside of the

62
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:56,490
mouth area? Are you gonna leave that dark
or do you want it to be light?

63
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,700
- Well, there's supposed to be some tongue
over here, but over here I'm gonna make it

64
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:06,777
like... I'm gonna try to go solid black
in some parts. Like I tried to do that

65
00:03:06,777 --> 00:03:07,636
inside the mouth.

66
00:03:07,636 --> 00:03:09,378
- Yeah! That's good. That's good.

67
00:03:09,378 --> 00:03:11,157
- I want mine to seem [inaudible].

68
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:12,590
- So then all of those areas then
will stay dark?

69
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:13,060
- Yeah.

70
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,990
- It'll create a nice shadow. Excellent,
that's really good. Are you gonna go off

71
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,455
the edge?

72
00:03:18,455 --> 00:03:18,896
- Yeah.

73
00:03:18,896 --> 00:03:28,600
- Nice, that's really good. Keep it up.
And Emily, how's yours coming? Yeah, the

74
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,260
same thing. All those little dark areas
that you're working on inside in between

75
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:37,820
teeth, now that you've carved out all that
area, it's gonna create a darkened tone.

76
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,380
And as I mentioned before, all the
different stippling areas, that's really

77
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,290
good. It's adding some more dimension and
more depth to the figure. If you're

78
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:50,280
finding that it's easier for you to pull
it off of your initial drawing, if you

79
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,320
wanna get a white piece of paper to put
underneath or use a separate sheet, it

80
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,962
might be a little bit easier to see than
using the table.

81
00:03:56,962 --> 00:03:57,612
- Okay.

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,789
- Good, good. This is good.

83
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:20,200
- I'm getting confused of where I'm going
because if I did the backgrounds, this is

84
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,053
the negative space that
I do the crosshatching.

85
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,723
Then it would have to
continue down here.

86
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,480
- So you want to decide all the different
types of textures that you're using in

87
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,120
between all of it.

88
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,150
- Yeah.

89
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,920
- All right, so you've got a little bit
of the crosshatching here, okay, and

90
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,560
you're using illustrative lines over here.
So you wanna try and find something in

91
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,050
between that's a little bit different.
Right?

92
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,270
- Uh-huh.

93
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,740
- Well, you haven't done any stippling
texture yet.

94
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,140
- I was working on...

95
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,560
- In here? Okay, so in here's gonna be
stippling. So right, then this can't be

96
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,520
the stippling because it's gonna be next
to it.

97
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:56,170
- I was thinking of here, kind of, moving
this pattern down and then maybe just,

98
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:56,790
sort of...

99
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,850
- Okay, I think that would be a good
solution to that.

100
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,800
- It's like this area in the background.

101
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:10,440
- Okay. Now what if you decided to leave
it for now by following just some of the

102
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,710
shadows that are there and creating
textures just where these shadows are and

103
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:20,740
then leaving that solid? And then you can
make a test print to see if you like the

104
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,910
way that looks keeping it solid. Then if
you really feel that it needs to have more

105
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,870
texture, you can go back
into it and add it again.

106
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,150
- Okay.

107
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:34,520
- Okay, so in here, like you said,
follow the movement of these

108
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:39,930
objects. Okay, this is all the chain
inside the bike. So following that

109
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:44,440
movement with your line would make a nice
gesture. And then in here just because you

110
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,480
have all this texture in here, you might
not need to put anything else there.

111
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:47,990
- Okay.

112
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:53,040
- What's your instinct as far as feeling
how busy it is now to add extra?

113
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,190
- Yeah, it's hard to tell because
I'm not sure how it's gonna look

114
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,770
when it's printed but I think that might
be good. Because it would get kind of

115
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,260
crazy. I think it might
be nice to have--

116
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,940
- And you wanna still have it have a focal
point. So if you go crazy with other

117
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,560
textures in here, you might be taking away
from the focal point of your art work.

118
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,070
- Okay.

119
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,630
- I'm having a hard time
seeing it so you--

120
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,100
- I might need to get one of those blue
sheets.

121
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,890
- Okay. The blue sheets are working? I
think, you know what? Emily's been using

122
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:27,920
the table. So maybe that helps her to see
her white lines. That has been helping. So

123
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,510
if you don't wanna use one of those blue
sheets, you can do what she's doing and

124
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:32,410
use the table.

125
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,690
- Yeah, I'll do that.

126
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,230
- I think I wanna lift
it off of the book.

127
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:40,410
- So you can keep it taped to this and
then flip the book out from underneath to

128
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:44,350
use it or get a darker sheet of paper to
help you see all your lines.

129
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,390
- Okay.

130
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,160
- Okay. You're still working on your
design right?

131
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:47,540
- Yeah.

132
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,440
- I think you might be ready to go on to
the plexiglass soon.

133
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:50,920
- Yeah.

134
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,860
- Because once you figure out what's going
on over here...

135
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,970
- Yeah, I just have to...

136
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:58,420
- Yeah and all of this positive and
negative space is really strong. So what

137
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,630
are you deciding to do with all of the
other areas? Are you gonna fill them in,

138
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:01,860
too?

139
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,880
- Yeah, I think so.

140
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,260
- Okay, then did you decide what kind of
texture that you wanna put in there when

141
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,770
you start etching it, engraving it?

142
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:13,350
- I don't know. I don't know if I should
do really fine crosshatching.

143
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:13,910
- Mm-hmm.

144
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,270
- But then should I put a new texture on
these?

145
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:22,700
- What do you think? Do you want it to be
solid or do you want to have the texture

146
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,767
when you make the print?

147
00:07:23,767 --> 00:07:27,087
- Because I think if I texture both of
them, it'll be a little confusing so maybe

148
00:07:27,087 --> 00:07:29,316
these should be plain and not have
texture.

149
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:33,357
- Okay, so you can texture crosshatching
in the background and then if you make a

150
00:07:33,357 --> 00:07:40,253
test print first, you can decide. If
they're too solid, then

151
00:07:40,253 --> 00:07:42,300
you can go back in with
a different texture.

152
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:42,901
- Okay.

153
00:07:42,901 --> 00:07:48,130
- Okay. So finish up the regular part of
your design first and start working on the

154
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:51,620
engraving part and then you can do a test
print and decide if you want to add more

155
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:51,920
later.

156
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,000
- Okay.
