1
00:00:00,655 --> 00:00:02,373
- And one more.

2
00:00:05,743 --> 00:00:10,743
- There's this one spider
and he's around all day

3
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,984
and then he comes and comes out.

4
00:00:12,984 --> 00:00:14,610
- [Teacher] Oh, so it's waiting for him.

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,606
You know, i'ts like a trap.

6
00:00:16,606 --> 00:00:18,534
- It covers itself in the flower

7
00:00:18,534 --> 00:00:22,504
and like it sets in the flower.

8
00:00:22,504 --> 00:00:24,315
It sits perfectly still in the flower

9
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:25,708
and then when something lands on it,

10
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:28,913
it attacks it and eats it.

11
00:00:28,913 --> 00:00:31,652
- Wonderful, so they're
not really attracted

12
00:00:31,652 --> 00:00:35,809
to flowers, they're
attracted to the insects

13
00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:37,295
in order to ambush them.

14
00:00:37,295 --> 00:00:37,991
Is that what you're telling me?

15
00:00:37,991 --> 00:00:38,827
- [Student] Yes.

16
00:00:38,827 --> 00:00:39,988
- Okay, all right.

17
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:42,496
So, and we talked about what is it

18
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:44,330
that attracts these?

19
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:49,322
Well, we see a lot of bugs,
we see humming birds,

20
00:00:49,322 --> 00:00:53,594
and Jack mentioned this word, pollen.

21
00:00:53,594 --> 00:00:56,840
Do you know what pollen is?

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,285
Do you know what pollen is?
- [Student] Ah...

23
00:00:58,285 --> 00:01:00,072
- [Teacher] Do you know what pollen is?
Are these things attracted to the pollen?

24
00:01:00,072 --> 00:01:01,373
- [Students] Yes.

25
00:01:01,373 --> 00:01:02,952
- [Student] Well, not really though.

26
00:01:02,952 --> 00:01:04,020
- [Teacher] No, not really?

27
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,993
- [Student] Sometimes.

28
00:01:05,993 --> 00:01:08,454
- [Teacher] Sometimes.
- [Student] I guess.

29
00:01:10,794 --> 00:01:12,355
- [Teacher] Say that again please?

30
00:01:12,355 --> 00:01:14,422
- [Student] It's an ingredient to make honey.

31
00:01:14,422 --> 00:01:17,069
- Pollen is an ingredient to make honey?

32
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:20,250
- [Student] Oh, nectar? Yeah.

33
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,129
- So bees are attracted to flowers

34
00:01:24,142 --> 00:01:26,142
because of their... blank.
- [Jimmy] Nectar.

35
00:01:27,437 --> 00:01:30,503
Go ahead, Jimmy. 
How would you fill this in?

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The bees are attracted to flowers
because of their... blank.

37
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,000
Go ahead and write your answer in.
- [Jimmy] Oh, okay.

38
00:01:42,893 --> 00:01:47,439
- I see some people writing pollen.

39
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,458
You have color.

40
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:53,499
They're definitely
attracted to their color.

41
00:01:53,499 --> 00:01:56,100
We have nectar.

42
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,326
And we have, we actually
have all of them here.

43
00:02:00,326 --> 00:02:03,019
So, which one is it?

44
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:04,807
Is it one of these or all of these?

45
00:02:04,807 --> 00:02:05,689
- [Student] All of these.

46
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:06,293
- [Student] All of them.

47
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:07,616
- All of them, tell me more.

48
00:02:07,616 --> 00:02:08,220
Tell me.

49
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,332
- [Student] I think it's pollen 
and nectar because

50
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:16,332
the nectar's in the
pollen and the bees take

51
00:02:16,718 --> 00:02:19,597
the pollen and then use
the pollen to make stuff,

52
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:20,758
or honey out of it.

53
00:02:20,758 --> 00:02:23,220
So, it's kind of like
taking it to its'...

54
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,586
- So, we say that flowers attract insects,

55
00:02:26,586 --> 00:02:31,586
so we can connect these two ideas here.

56
00:02:33,018 --> 00:02:37,430
And we've talked about their color.

57
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,587
The insects were attracted
because of their color

58
00:02:40,587 --> 00:02:42,909
and they're also attracted
because of their...

59
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:43,931
- [Student] Nectar.

60
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:47,734
- Nectar, okay, let's
put nectar right here.

61
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,870
And they're also attracted
because of their good smell?

62
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,892
- [Student] No.

63
00:02:53,892 --> 00:02:55,494
- [Student] Yeah.

64
00:02:55,494 --> 00:02:57,352
- [Student] Yeah.

65
00:02:57,352 --> 00:02:59,999
- [Teacher] No?

66
00:02:59,999 --> 00:03:02,460
- [Student] The nectar smells good,
that's why butterflies go to them.

67
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,805
- [Teacher] Maybe look that up on Google.

68
00:03:04,805 --> 00:03:06,686
Why do you think flowers
take all the trouble

69
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,520
to make them smell good?

70
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,447
- [Student] So bees will go to them.

71
00:03:10,447 --> 00:03:14,441
- Why do people go to trouble to smell good?
- [Student] (inaudible)

72
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:18,574
- Why not?
- [Student] Because, it would be gross.

73
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:19,526
- Say that again.

74
00:03:19,526 --> 00:03:20,106
- Attention?

75
00:03:20,106 --> 00:03:20,756
- You want attention?

76
00:03:20,756 --> 00:03:22,149
You want to be attractive
to other people too?

77
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:25,404
- [Student] Heck no.

78
00:03:25,404 --> 00:03:27,211
- Maybe you're too young for that.

79
00:03:27,211 --> 00:03:28,697
Yeah, when you get older, don't you want

80
00:03:28,697 --> 00:03:30,160
to attract other people?

81
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,298
- [Student] Sure.

82
00:03:31,298 --> 00:03:34,316
- Don't you want other
people to find you pleasant?

83
00:03:34,316 --> 00:03:35,129
- [Student] Yes.

84
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:37,474
- You know, it's not a big thing,

85
00:03:37,474 --> 00:03:42,474
but are these fragrances
signals to these insects?

86
00:03:45,898 --> 00:03:48,224
They're attractive right?

87
00:03:48,224 --> 00:03:51,777
And we'll talk about, I
agree, they are useful,

88
00:03:51,777 --> 00:03:55,376
but that's not going to fit
into my process just yet.

89
00:03:55,376 --> 00:04:00,376
But all of these things do
attract the insects, right?

90
00:04:01,482 --> 00:04:03,317
But what is it that keeps the insects

91
00:04:03,317 --> 00:04:06,126
coming back?

92
00:04:06,126 --> 00:04:10,004
It's sort of like the color, the smell,

93
00:04:10,004 --> 00:04:15,004
you know, the, maybe
the shape of the flower.

94
00:04:16,273 --> 00:04:18,688
All of these things
are like advertisements

95
00:04:18,688 --> 00:04:21,962
to the insects.

96
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:23,866
Why?

97
00:04:23,866 --> 00:04:24,864
- [Student] For the nectar?

98
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:25,979
- For the nectar.

99
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:29,276
It's the nectar that's going
to keep them coming back.

100
00:04:29,276 --> 00:04:31,783
All right, you see this bee here?

101
00:04:31,783 --> 00:04:33,943
What's all this yellow stuff on the bee?

102
00:04:33,943 --> 00:04:34,802
- [Students] Pollen?

103
00:04:34,802 --> 00:04:35,568
- Pollen.

104
00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:37,843
Does the pollen attract the bee?

105
00:04:37,843 --> 00:04:38,981
- [Students] No.

106
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:42,603
- Does the bee want the pollen?

107
00:04:42,603 --> 00:04:43,950
- [Students] No.

108
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,992
- [Student] Yes and
no because the pollen

109
00:04:46,992 --> 00:04:49,964
helps all of the flowers to stay alive.

110
00:04:49,964 --> 00:04:51,636
- [Teacher] The pollen is definitely

111
00:04:51,636 --> 00:04:54,704
important to the flower, right?

112
00:04:54,704 --> 00:04:57,765
- [Student] Mm-hm? The bees
just spread it around.

113
00:04:57,765 --> 00:04:59,089
- [Teacher] The bees spread it around?

114
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:03,361
How many people are aware
that bees spread pollen?

115
00:05:03,361 --> 00:05:05,381
I see just about all your hands go up.

116
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:10,381
So the insects are spreading,
let's put that up here,

117
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:18,790
they're going to spread
the stuff called pollen.

118
00:05:20,775 --> 00:05:21,960
Right?

119
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,510
Of course, the insects
are really getting what?

120
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,486
- [Students] Nectar.

121
00:05:27,486 --> 00:05:29,877
- Yeah, so let's put they are taking

122
00:05:29,877 --> 00:05:34,877
or they obtain this nectar here, right?

123
00:05:35,496 --> 00:05:38,166
And nectar is another word for what?

124
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,745
- [Students] Food.

125
00:05:39,745 --> 00:05:42,996
- You all understand that
nectar is their food?

126
00:05:42,996 --> 00:05:43,971
- [Student] For the bees.

127
00:05:43,971 --> 00:05:44,714
- [Teacher] For the bees?

128
00:05:44,714 --> 00:05:45,666
Just the bees?

129
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,431
- [Student] No, and hummingbirds.

130
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:48,615
- And insects?

131
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:49,242
- [Student] Us.

132
00:05:49,242 --> 00:05:50,101
- And hummingbirds?

133
00:05:50,101 --> 00:05:51,285
- [Student] Us, us, we have honey.

134
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:52,980
Nectar is technically honey.

135
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,256
- So, nectar is actually a food for us,

136
00:05:55,256 --> 00:05:57,299
because we steal it from the bees, right?

137
00:05:57,299 --> 00:05:58,111
- Yeah.

138
00:05:58,111 --> 00:05:59,992
- And we hide it from the bears, yes?

139
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:02,570
- [Student] Isn't there this one
point where it has saliva, or something

140
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,706
in the bottom of it, and it's in the shape

141
00:06:04,706 --> 00:06:07,562
of a picture, and all of
these flies and everything

142
00:06:07,562 --> 00:06:11,184
are attracted from the
sweet smell and everything,

143
00:06:11,184 --> 00:06:12,043
and they get into the water,

144
00:06:12,043 --> 00:06:14,295
they can't move and
everything, they're paralyzed?

145
00:06:14,295 --> 00:06:14,922
- Okay, it's a trap.

146
00:06:14,922 --> 00:06:17,244
- [Student] Yeah. 
- [Student] Like the venus fly trap.

147
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:18,684
- Just like the venus fly trap.

148
00:06:18,684 --> 00:06:19,612
- [Student] Yeah, I don't know what it's called.

149
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,330
- Do venus fly traps have flowers?

150
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,817
- [Student] No, they have clear white.

151
00:06:22,817 --> 00:06:24,906
- [Student] The mouth smells really sweet.

152
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:26,392
- [Student] That's because it catches flies.

153
00:06:26,392 --> 00:06:28,389
- Okay, we're going to talk
about that in a minute.

154
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:33,389
A lot of people, when I was
reading your paragraphs,

155
00:06:33,497 --> 00:06:35,471
a lot of people told
me that venus fly traps

156
00:06:35,471 --> 00:06:37,793
were one of the many kinds of plants

157
00:06:37,793 --> 00:06:38,931
that don't have flowers.

158
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:42,112
All right, but let's look
at this thing about pollen

159
00:06:42,112 --> 00:06:42,971
for a minute.

160
00:06:42,971 --> 00:06:47,971
Why is it that the
flowers want these insects

161
00:06:49,286 --> 00:06:52,212
to keep stealing their nectar?

162
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:53,582
What's going on here?

163
00:06:53,582 --> 00:06:56,972
They want them to spread
the pollen, but why?

164
00:06:56,972 --> 00:06:58,318
- [Student] To make more food?

165
00:06:58,318 --> 00:06:59,410
- [Teacher] To make what?

166
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,524
- [Student] To make more food?

167
00:07:00,524 --> 00:07:03,038
- [Teacher] You think
it's to make more food.

168
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:04,471
What do you think Olivia?

169
00:07:04,471 --> 00:07:06,745
- [Olivia] To make like honey.

170
00:07:06,745 --> 00:07:09,812
- [Teacher] The flowers
want the bees to make honey?

171
00:07:09,812 --> 00:07:14,279
- [Olivia] No, they like 
need it to make more food.

172
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:18,426
- [Student] Pollen is an
ingredient for nectar to make.

173
00:07:18,426 --> 00:07:20,330
- I understand that,
but why does the flower

174
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,279
go to all this trouble?

175
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,904
Do flowers just like bees?

176
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:25,717
- [Student] No.

177
00:07:25,717 --> 00:07:27,133
- They say hey, you're a nice guy.

178
00:07:27,133 --> 00:07:28,248
We'll make you some...

179
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:29,409
- [Student] To keep them alive, I think?

180
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:31,429
- To keep... the flowers
are making the food

181
00:07:31,429 --> 00:07:33,147
to keep the bees alive?

182
00:07:33,147 --> 00:07:35,465
- [Students] No.
- [Student]  I don't know.

183
00:07:35,465 --> 00:07:37,210
- [Teacher] That's okay, that's okay.

184
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,162
What do you think, Joe?

185
00:07:38,162 --> 00:07:39,695
- [Joe] To fertilize other flowers?

186
00:07:39,695 --> 00:07:41,320
- Fertilize?

187
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,411
What's fertilize?

188
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:46,173
You mean to like give them
like fertilizer on the ground?

189
00:07:46,173 --> 00:07:49,331
Or are you talking about a
different kind of fertilizer?

190
00:07:49,331 --> 00:07:50,422
- Different.

191
00:07:50,422 --> 00:07:52,001
- You're calling it a
different kind of fertilizer.

192
00:07:52,001 --> 00:07:52,674
Interesting.

193
00:07:52,674 --> 00:07:54,137
How many people understand that flowers

194
00:07:54,137 --> 00:07:56,087
are related to fertilization?

195
00:07:56,087 --> 00:07:58,339
How many people have heard that before?

196
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:01,079
Hands up here, okay.

197
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,935
So, if you want to ask what pollen is,

198
00:08:03,935 --> 00:08:07,302
you might want to ask what flowers do.

199
00:08:07,302 --> 00:08:10,529
All right and to answer
that, I first of all,

200
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:14,128
let's make sure, this
dandelion, is this a flower

201
00:08:14,128 --> 00:08:14,895
or is this a weed?

202
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,117
- [Students] Flower.

203
00:08:16,117 --> 00:08:17,348
- [Students] A weed.

204
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:19,043
- Okay, thumbs up or thumbs down.

205
00:08:19,043 --> 00:08:23,277
Who says it's a weed?

206
00:08:23,277 --> 00:08:25,056
Okay?

207
00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:27,401
I see most of you thumbs
up, a couple of you

208
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:29,050
have sideways or down.

209
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,652
Next, how about this one,
how many people think

210
00:08:30,652 --> 00:08:34,623
it's a flower?

211
00:08:34,623 --> 00:08:35,760
Okay.

212
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,588
How many people say it's
a weed and a flower?

213
00:08:40,588 --> 00:08:43,562
Now I see some people who don't know.

214
00:08:46,082 --> 00:08:49,506
Well, let me ask you this.

215
00:08:49,506 --> 00:08:52,037
If you're to look at this, here's a pretty

216
00:08:52,037 --> 00:08:55,613
good picture of it, what
makes you think it's a flower?

217
00:08:55,613 --> 00:08:57,633
Are there characteristics about this plant

218
00:08:57,633 --> 00:08:59,188
that make you think it's a flower?

219
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:00,001
- [Student] Yes.

220
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:00,860
- [Student] I don't think it's a flower...

221
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,834
- That's not my question.

222
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,248
Are there characteristics
about this that make you

223
00:09:05,248 --> 00:09:06,200
think it's a flower?

224
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,827
- [Student] Yes.

225
00:09:06,827 --> 00:09:07,965
- What would those be?

226
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:08,754
- The petals?

227
00:09:08,754 --> 00:09:10,566
- The petals? Excellent.

228
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:11,889
Anything else?

229
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:13,027
- [Student] It's color?

230
00:09:13,027 --> 00:09:15,651
- It's colorful?

231
00:09:15,651 --> 00:09:16,765
Anything else?

232
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,714
- [Student] It has some nectar, maybe?

233
00:09:19,714 --> 00:09:20,921
- You think it has nectar?

234
00:09:20,921 --> 00:09:21,850
- [Student] Maybe a little bit.

235
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,057
- Have you ever seen insects hovering

236
00:09:23,057 --> 00:09:24,102
around dandelions?

237
00:09:24,102 --> 00:09:24,985
- Yes.

238
00:09:24,985 --> 00:09:27,854
- Who have seen... who have seen?

239
00:09:27,854 --> 00:09:29,001
Yeah, it's very common.

240
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,788
Well, you can actually see bees on top of,

241
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:33,088
on top of flowers.

242
00:09:33,088 --> 00:09:37,407
Here's a close up of the dandelion.

243
00:09:37,407 --> 00:09:38,870
What do you notice there?

244
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,145
- [Student] That looks a lot more ugly?

245
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:42,445
- It looks ugly?

246
00:09:42,445 --> 00:09:43,815
- [Student] Yeah.

247
00:09:43,815 --> 00:09:45,603
- Really?

248
00:09:45,603 --> 00:09:46,996
- [Student] No it looks cool.

249
00:09:46,996 --> 00:09:49,861
- [Student] It looks like water spouts
goin' like...

250
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:51,106
- It does look like water.

251
00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:52,337
What do you see on the side here?

252
00:09:52,337 --> 00:09:53,405
- [Student] Pollen.

253
00:09:53,405 --> 00:09:54,287
- Does that look like pollen?

254
00:09:54,287 --> 00:09:55,796
What does pollen look like?

255
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:59,047
- [Student] Just tiny balls of... stuff.

256
00:09:59,047 --> 00:10:01,276
- Of stuff, yeah?

257
00:10:01,276 --> 00:10:03,737
- There those tiny little,
like, they look like

258
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:06,361
little leftover pieces
just hanging off the side

259
00:10:06,361 --> 00:10:09,194
of the stem and it's with the bees

260
00:10:09,194 --> 00:10:12,700
and it sticks to the bees
when they land on the flower,

261
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,927
so it stays with them for a while.

262
00:10:15,927 --> 00:10:17,552
A ball and then it sticks to the bee,

263
00:10:17,552 --> 00:10:19,387
like if you want to see the
bee, it's got all the yellow stuff

264
00:10:19,387 --> 00:10:20,408
on his leg?

265
00:10:20,408 --> 00:10:21,894
- [Voiceover] Yeah, we had
the picture earlier, yeah.

266
00:10:21,894 --> 00:10:25,052
- [Student] Yeah, I saw a bee on
a flower in the summer

267
00:10:25,052 --> 00:10:26,260
and he had a bunch of that yellow stuff

268
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,165
on his body?

269
00:10:27,165 --> 00:10:28,071
- [Teacher] Cool.

270
00:10:28,071 --> 00:10:29,441
- [Student] Actually, that's the pollen.

271
00:10:29,441 --> 00:10:31,902
- So the pollen, so it
is picking up pollen.

272
00:10:31,902 --> 00:10:34,665
So, it sounds to me that,
I guess what I want

273
00:10:34,665 --> 00:10:39,665
to convince you is that
dandelions are flowers.

274
00:10:40,284 --> 00:10:41,073
- [Students] They are?

275
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,256
- Yeah, they're definitely flowers.

276
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:46,460
Let me show you a picture of a dandelion.

277
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,386
A little video, it's
about one minute long,

278
00:10:49,386 --> 00:10:52,411
and let's go ahead and
turn the lights off.

279
00:10:52,411 --> 00:10:54,517
And as you're watching it, just tell me

280
00:10:54,517 --> 00:10:59,517
what you observe happening in the video.

281
00:10:59,556 --> 00:11:04,499
Just go ahead and shout it out.

282
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,261
- [Students] The flower is
opening, it's blossoming.

283
00:11:09,261 --> 00:11:11,003
- Okay, this is time
lapse, so this is happening

284
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,489
a lot faster than what it really normally,

285
00:11:12,489 --> 00:11:14,927
but you saw the flower open?

286
00:11:14,927 --> 00:11:17,782
- [Student] It's dormant, dying now.

287
00:11:17,782 --> 00:11:18,943
- [Teacher] And now it's closing up

288
00:11:18,943 --> 00:11:19,686
and it's dying.

289
00:11:19,686 --> 00:11:20,894
- [Student] It's going dormant.

290
00:11:20,894 --> 00:11:21,614
- [Teacher] It's dead.

291
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,494
How many people think it's dead?

292
00:11:23,494 --> 00:11:25,607
- [Student] No, it's still growing.

293
00:11:25,607 --> 00:11:28,969
- [Student] It's dormant.

294
00:11:28,969 --> 00:11:31,064
- [Student] It's growing
into that white stuff.

295
00:11:31,064 --> 00:11:31,969
- [Teacher] Say that again?

296
00:11:31,969 --> 00:11:33,734
- [Marissa] It's turning
into that thing in the ball.

297
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:37,054
- [Teacher] That's like,
Marissa's making a prediction.

298
00:11:37,054 --> 00:11:38,610
- [Student] It's gonna grow taller.

299
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,980
- [Student] No, it's going to break up.

300
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,816
- [Teacher] Do you see
the insects all over it?

301
00:11:40,816 --> 00:11:41,675
Every now and then you can kind of

302
00:11:41,675 --> 00:11:42,580
see an insect on it.

303
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,439
- [Student] Oh, yeah.

304
00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:44,345
- [Student] Yeah, there's
one down at the root.

305
00:11:44,345 --> 00:11:45,367
- [Teacher] At the very base of it.

306
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:47,363
- [Student] Yeah, something's happening.

307
00:11:47,363 --> 00:11:48,548
- [Teacher] Something's happening.

308
00:11:48,548 --> 00:11:49,918
- [Student] It got taller on the screen.

309
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:54,837
- [Teacher] Oh, the bottom
petals are starting to die.

310
00:11:54,837 --> 00:11:57,614
- [Student] (inaudible)
- [Teacher] What's that?

311
00:11:57,614 --> 00:12:00,436
- [Student] It's starting
to look like an onion.

312
00:12:00,436 --> 00:12:01,318
- [Teacher] What's
that thing on the top?

313
00:12:01,318 --> 00:12:04,496
- [Student] It's going to blow away.

314
00:12:04,496 --> 00:12:05,846
- [Student] It's going
to grow into a dandelion.

315
00:12:05,846 --> 00:12:07,030
- [Teacher] That was
the flower, wasn't it?

316
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,236
- [Student] That's
the thing you blow on.

317
00:12:09,236 --> 00:12:10,966
- [Teacher] What's that?

318
00:12:10,966 --> 00:12:13,113
- [Student] They're
seeds, they're seeds!

319
00:12:13,113 --> 00:12:15,180
- [Student] Yeah, you
blow on them and it's really fun.

320
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,085
- [Student] It's reproducing.

321
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:17,595
- [Teacher] I'm hearing
Steven say they're seeds.

322
00:12:17,595 --> 00:12:19,220
And Brandon, oh that thing disappeared.

323
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,263
That whole top blew away.

324
00:12:21,263 --> 00:12:22,842
- [Student] That's the
stuff that you like to blow.

325
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:25,048
- [Teacher] How many
people think these are seeds?

326
00:12:25,048 --> 00:12:25,977
- [Andrew] I know they are.

327
00:12:25,977 --> 00:12:27,439
- [Teacher] Ah, Andrew's thinking.

328
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:29,785
So the flower turned into what?

329
00:12:29,785 --> 00:12:30,620
- [Student] A seed.

330
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,898
- [Student] A reproducer.

331
00:12:31,898 --> 00:12:33,593
- [Teacher] A big seed?

332
00:12:33,593 --> 00:12:35,636
- [Student] No,
they're all little seeds.

333
00:12:35,636 --> 00:12:36,263
- [Student] No, they're all individual seeds.

334
00:12:36,263 --> 00:12:37,679
- [Teacher] Are they blowing?
- [Students] Yes.

335
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:39,188
- [Teacher] Make a wish.

336
00:12:39,188 --> 00:12:40,349
Can I have the lights on please.

337
00:12:40,349 --> 00:12:45,349
So you have... 
- [Student] Like a month period.

338
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:51,355
- [Teacher] Yeah, that took a while.
And I think you've seen dandelions,

339
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:53,259
you may not have, you've probably seen

340
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:54,699
the dandelions in two stages.

341
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:57,090
Sometimes they're like gel flowers

342
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:00,805
and later they turn into
these little white, puffy,

343
00:13:00,805 --> 00:13:03,488
seed pods, right?
- [Student] You puff on them and they

344
00:13:03,488 --> 00:13:06,053
blow in the wind.
- [Teacher] Yeah, what does the wind do?

345
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:07,864
- [Student] It blows them away

346
00:13:07,864 --> 00:13:09,559
and it starts reproducing.

347
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:11,370
- So each seed is like a little parachute?

348
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,415
- [Student] Yeah.

349
00:13:12,415 --> 00:13:14,017
- And it's dispersed to new lands?

350
00:13:14,017 --> 00:13:15,294
- [Student] Yes.

351
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:18,637
- All right, so if I were to say flowers,

352
00:13:18,637 --> 00:13:20,774
if I were to make a
connection between flowers

353
00:13:20,774 --> 00:13:23,629
and seeds, what would you say about that?

354
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:24,419
What will you say?

355
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:28,784
What is the connection
between flowers and seeds?

356
00:13:28,784 --> 00:13:29,690
McKenzie?

357
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,570
- [McKenzie] They both reproduce.

358
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,428
- [Teacher] They're both 
related to reproduction.

359
00:13:33,428 --> 00:13:35,936
Okay, uh-huh?

360
00:13:35,936 --> 00:13:38,188
- [Student] One makes another?

361
00:13:38,188 --> 00:13:42,065
- Okay, so one flowers make seeds

362
00:13:42,065 --> 00:13:46,059
or flowers produce seeds,
and there's that word

363
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:49,263
that McKenzie was using, reproduce

364
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:52,862
because seeds grow into...

365
00:13:52,862 --> 00:13:53,768
- [Student] Flowers?

366
00:13:53,768 --> 00:13:55,207
- Flowers which then...

367
00:13:55,207 --> 00:13:56,252
- [Student] Grow into seeds?

368
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,204
- [Teacher] Which then...

369
00:13:57,204 --> 00:13:58,319
- [Student] Grow into more plants?

370
00:13:58,319 --> 00:14:00,199
- [Teacher] What does that sound like?

371
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:02,243
- [All Students] Life cycles!

372
00:14:02,243 --> 00:14:04,727
- Wonderful, wonderful,
these are life cycles.

373
00:14:04,727 --> 00:14:06,027
What I'm going to ask you to do right now,

374
00:14:06,027 --> 00:14:07,699
is we're going to look at a seed

375
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:09,208
very, very closely.

376
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:10,810
I have some, you know what these are?

377
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:11,739
Lima beans?

378
00:14:11,739 --> 00:14:13,132
- [Student] Oh, I love lima beans.

379
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:14,131
- You do, really?

380
00:14:14,131 --> 00:14:14,665
- [Student] Yeah.

381
00:14:14,665 --> 00:14:17,289
- Oh, I don't like lima beans.

382
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,403
- [Student] I've never tried them.

383
00:14:18,403 --> 00:14:19,285
- [Student] I like
them in my favorite dish,

384
00:14:19,285 --> 00:14:20,237
chicken pot pie.

385
00:14:20,237 --> 00:14:22,002
- My dad loves lima beans, anyway.

386
00:14:22,002 --> 00:14:24,208
I have some. They have been soaking overnight

387
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,971
in some water, and they're going to look

388
00:14:26,971 --> 00:14:29,293
a little bit different
because they've been soaking

389
00:14:29,293 --> 00:14:30,454
under water.

390
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:32,636
What I want you to do
is, when you get one,

391
00:14:32,636 --> 00:14:37,118
I want you to open it up, like a book.

392
00:14:37,118 --> 00:14:40,415
Dig your thumbnails into
the side of the seed

393
00:14:40,415 --> 00:14:42,713
and open it up very
carefully, and I want you

394
00:14:42,713 --> 00:14:43,642
to look inside.

395
00:14:43,642 --> 00:14:46,127
That's what the magnifying
glasses are for.

396
00:14:46,127 --> 00:14:47,822
I want you to be able to tell me what

397
00:14:47,822 --> 00:14:51,026
do you find inside the seed?

398
00:14:51,026 --> 00:14:51,978
Everyone clear?

399
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:53,789
Go ahead, one person
from each table come up

400
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:56,255
and get a couple of seeds?

401
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,759
- [Student] How many?

402
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:59,227
- Oh, you know what?

403
00:14:59,227 --> 00:15:01,573
Get maybe three of them
in case one of them

404
00:15:01,573 --> 00:15:03,523
doesn't work.

405
00:15:03,523 --> 00:15:05,148
We have a spare.

406
00:15:05,148 --> 00:15:10,148
Three not unbroken, nice plump seeds.

407
00:15:10,321 --> 00:15:12,253
Take them to your seat.

408
00:15:12,253 --> 00:15:15,820
I just want you to look at them.

409
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,106
- [Student] They're bigger.

410
00:15:17,106 --> 00:15:18,894
- [Teacher] They are bigger, aren't they?

411
00:15:18,894 --> 00:15:19,730
What else are they?

412
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,518
- [Student] They're sort of hard.

413
00:15:21,518 --> 00:15:24,025
- [Student] They look
like mandarin oranges.

414
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:26,254
- [Teacher] (laughing) Why's that, 
what makes you think they're like oranges?

415
00:15:26,254 --> 00:15:28,298
- [Students] They're not hard anymore!

416
00:15:28,298 --> 00:15:29,296
- They're no what?

417
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:30,109
- [Student] They're not hard anymore.

418
00:15:30,109 --> 00:15:31,322
- They're not hard.

419
00:15:31,322 --> 00:15:32,717
- [Student] We grew them last year.

420
00:15:32,717 --> 00:15:33,303
- What's that?

421
00:15:33,303 --> 00:15:34,399
- [Student] We grew them last year.

422
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,421
- Oh, you grew these last year.

423
00:15:35,421 --> 00:15:37,092
What do these turn into?

424
00:15:37,092 --> 00:15:38,184
- [Voiceover] Farmer's (inaudible).

425
00:15:38,184 --> 00:15:39,298
- [Teacher] They turn into plants?

426
00:15:39,298 --> 00:15:41,040
- [Student] What are we
supposed to be looking for?

427
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,479
- [Teacher] Well, you tell me.

428
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:44,267
Don't break them open.

429
00:15:44,267 --> 00:15:45,149
Here's how I want you...

430
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:47,843
Can I borrow this?

431
00:15:47,843 --> 00:15:50,884
Okay, I want you to go
to the round part here,

432
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:54,135
and you notice it has like a seed coat?

433
00:15:54,135 --> 00:15:54,924
- [Students] Yeah.

434
00:15:54,924 --> 00:15:56,619
- Okay, you know kind of peel that back.

435
00:15:56,619 --> 00:15:57,107
- [Student] Oh cool?

436
00:15:57,107 --> 00:15:59,684
- And then open it up like a book.

437
00:15:59,684 --> 00:16:00,869
Okay?

438
00:16:00,869 --> 00:16:03,446
- [Student] I'm looking at the skin.

439
00:16:03,446 --> 00:16:08,091
- [Student] Like this?

440
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:10,458
- [Teacher] Yeah, open it up like a book

441
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,641
and look inside and see what you find.

442
00:16:12,641 --> 00:16:14,289
There's a little surprise there.

443
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:16,695
- [Students] What is this?

444
00:16:16,695 --> 00:16:18,858
- [Student] It's a bug!

445
00:16:20,117 --> 00:16:22,643
- [Teacher] It's located... yeah.

446
00:16:24,593 --> 00:16:26,399
- [Student] Oh, gross.
- [Student] Mine's already broken so.

447
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,524
- [Teacher] Well, you
have a good one right here.

448
00:16:27,524 --> 00:16:29,080
This is perfect.

449
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,055
- [Student] Oh I see it.

450
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:30,659
- [Teacher] Look at that.

451
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:32,028
That's a really good one.

452
00:16:32,028 --> 00:16:33,097
- [Student] I don't see it.

453
00:16:33,097 --> 00:16:33,956
- [Teacher] Yeah, go ahead break it.

454
00:16:33,956 --> 00:16:35,604
Just like you did.

455
00:16:35,604 --> 00:16:36,370
- [Student] I can't open it.

456
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,787
- And oh, yours is right here.

457
00:16:37,787 --> 00:16:39,250
Yours kind of fell apart.

458
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,640
Do you have another seed?

459
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,956
Be there in a second.
- [Student] Okay.

460
00:16:44,956 --> 00:16:46,355
- Oh, there it is right there.

461
00:16:46,355 --> 00:16:47,190
Do you see that?

462
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:47,980
- [Student] I don't have one.

463
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,207
- Look at it very carefully
with the magnifiers.

464
00:16:51,207 --> 00:16:51,718
What do you have?

465
00:16:51,718 --> 00:16:52,740
Let me see what you got.

466
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,413
Yeah, right there.

467
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:54,574
There's actually part of it right here,

468
00:16:54,574 --> 00:16:57,314
broke in half and that's attached,

469
00:16:57,314 --> 00:17:00,332
and there's also a little bit here.

470
00:17:00,332 --> 00:17:03,537
Perfect, look at this, Patrick.

471
00:17:03,537 --> 00:17:06,021
That's what you want to look at.

472
00:17:06,021 --> 00:17:07,786
- [Student] I can't open mine.

473
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:15,494
- [Teacher] See it, see it there?

474
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:17,027
What do you see?

475
00:17:17,027 --> 00:17:19,498
- [Student] I don't see it.

476
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:21,160
- [Teacher] Oh, there is
a little bit of green there,

477
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,926
isn't there?

478
00:17:21,926 --> 00:17:22,762
- [Student] Yeah.

479
00:17:22,762 --> 00:17:24,016
- [Teacher] Who else is having trouble?

480
00:17:24,016 --> 00:17:24,875
- [Student] Me.

481
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,848
- [Student] I already opened mine.

482
00:17:26,848 --> 00:17:31,495
- [Teacher] Yes you did.

483
00:17:33,435 --> 00:17:35,788
- [Student] Are they
supposed to smell bad?

484
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,599
- [Teacher] Yeah, they do
kind of smell, don't they?

485
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,108
- [Student] Yeah, they smell.

486
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:39,898
- Did you see that whole thing

487
00:17:39,898 --> 00:17:40,501
right on the tip?

488
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:41,802
Look at that under the magnifying glass.

489
00:17:41,802 --> 00:17:45,632
Okay, okay look at my photograph up here.

490
00:17:47,412 --> 00:17:49,324
Here we go.

491
00:17:49,324 --> 00:17:53,713
This is kind of what you're looking at.

492
00:17:53,713 --> 00:17:57,498
You have these two like
little half circles,

493
00:17:57,498 --> 00:18:01,863
little kidney shaped starchy figures,

494
00:18:01,863 --> 00:18:04,928
but what is this thing right here?

495
00:18:04,928 --> 00:18:07,203
- [Student] It's a seed. It's starting
to sprout.

496
00:18:07,203 --> 00:18:09,014
- What is it?

497
00:18:09,014 --> 00:18:11,359
- [Student] It's a start of a lima bean.

498
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:13,054
- I thought this whole thing right here.

499
00:18:13,054 --> 00:18:16,607
- [Student] It's the
start of a lima bean plant.

500
00:18:16,607 --> 00:18:18,882
- [Teacher] This is like
a plant sprouting out.

501
00:18:18,882 --> 00:18:20,415
Is that what you're trying to say Steven?

502
00:18:20,415 --> 00:18:21,808
What's that?

503
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:24,458
Is there anything about
this that makes you

504
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,637
look like a plant or
makes you think it might

505
00:18:26,637 --> 00:18:27,450
be a plant?

506
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:30,701
- [Steven] Like that, like the
big parts might be like,

507
00:18:30,701 --> 00:18:35,205
maybe like the soil or the stuff
that needs to get bigger?

508
00:18:35,205 --> 00:18:36,598
Like when we add water to stuff

509
00:18:36,598 --> 00:18:39,686
it starts to get bigger?

510
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:41,614
- [Teacher] Well, did you
notice there are two parts

511
00:18:41,614 --> 00:18:42,287
to it?

512
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:42,984
- [Steven] Yeah.

513
00:18:42,984 --> 00:18:44,748
- [Student] Yeah, it like goes down?

514
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,443
- [Teacher] There is,
what's this right here?

515
00:18:46,443 --> 00:18:49,090
- [Student] It's the sprout.

516
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,065
- [Teacher] Okay, I
heard you say it looks

517
00:18:50,065 --> 00:18:51,412
like a stem.

518
00:18:51,412 --> 00:18:53,850
Anybody think it looks like anything else?

519
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,387
Uh-huh?

520
00:18:55,387 --> 00:18:57,821
Go ahead, McKenzie?

521
00:18:57,821 --> 00:18:59,399
Why are these pointing here?

522
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:01,791
Why are these pointed?

523
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,463
- [McKenzie] It's kind of new.

524
00:19:03,463 --> 00:19:04,392
- [Teacher] That makes sense.

525
00:19:04,392 --> 00:19:05,367
- [Student] Looking to break through.

526
00:19:05,367 --> 00:19:06,319
- [Teacher] Break through the...

527
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,573
- [Student] The soil.

528
00:19:07,573 --> 00:19:09,291
- And what breaks through the soil?

529
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,986
What part of the plant
breaks through the soil?

530
00:19:10,986 --> 00:19:11,938
- [Student] The seed?
- [Student] The root?

531
00:19:11,938 --> 00:19:13,517
- Does it look like a root?

532
00:19:13,517 --> 00:19:14,399
- [Students] Yeah.

533
00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:15,328
- How many people think it looks

534
00:19:15,328 --> 00:19:17,232
a little bit like a root?

535
00:19:17,232 --> 00:19:19,391
And this looks a little bit like a stem.

536
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:20,552
What does this look like to you?

537
00:19:20,552 --> 00:19:22,363
- [Student] A flower.

538
00:19:22,363 --> 00:19:25,242
- Let me see, it looks like this

539
00:19:25,242 --> 00:19:28,028
and there's another one that
kind of looks like that.

540
00:19:28,028 --> 00:19:29,143
What does that look like to you?

541
00:19:29,143 --> 00:19:30,025
- [Student] Leaves.

542
00:19:30,025 --> 00:19:30,768
- Leaves.

543
00:19:30,768 --> 00:19:32,533
What do leaves, okay.

544
00:19:32,533 --> 00:19:34,205
Do you ever see anybody draw pictures?

545
00:19:34,205 --> 00:19:34,855
Whats that?

546
00:19:34,855 --> 00:19:35,459
- [Student] It looks like a carrot.

547
00:19:35,459 --> 00:19:37,386
- (laughing) It looks like a carrot, 
doesn't it?

548
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:40,776
Okay, look at those leaf like structures

549
00:19:40,776 --> 00:19:43,980
very carefully with your magnifier.

550
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,650
I want you to look for a detail.

551
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,252
You see a little characteristic.

552
00:19:48,252 --> 00:19:49,227
- [Student] Oh I see it, I see it!

553
00:19:49,227 --> 00:19:50,272
- What do you see?

554
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,689
- [Student] I see like the veins of a leaf.

555
00:19:51,689 --> 00:19:53,850
- Wonderful.

556
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,334
- [Student] I don't. Oh yeah, I do.

557
00:19:55,334 --> 00:19:58,283
- Wonderful, you have little veins there

558
00:19:58,283 --> 00:20:00,419
on the leaf?

559
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:01,120
Yeah, you can see.
