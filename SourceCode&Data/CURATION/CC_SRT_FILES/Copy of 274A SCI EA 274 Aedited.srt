1
00:00:00,551 --> 00:00:02,670
- Um, that one substance,

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,718
there's no other types
of substances laced into

3
00:00:05,718 --> 00:00:06,925
the main substance.

4
00:00:06,925 --> 00:00:07,877
- [Instructor] Okay.

5
00:00:07,877 --> 00:00:09,119
And what is yours?

6
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:12,167
- A substance that has nothing
mixed into it or added to it.

7
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:14,088
- [Instructor] Okay, so I hear

8
00:00:14,088 --> 00:00:16,259
three different things here, okay?

9
00:00:16,259 --> 00:00:20,021
I hear, pure means one
substance, not mixed

10
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:21,217
with anything else.

11
00:00:21,217 --> 00:00:24,793
I hear, pure is something
that's not altered

12
00:00:24,793 --> 00:00:26,506
or manipulated in any way.

13
00:00:26,685 --> 00:00:29,004
And then I hear something's that natural.

14
00:00:29,785 --> 00:00:31,585
I want to know what your thoughts are

15
00:00:31,585 --> 00:00:32,885
about those three definitions.

16
00:00:32,885 --> 00:00:35,126
So do you agree with those
three definitions or not?

17
00:00:35,126 --> 00:00:36,467
And tell me why.

18
00:00:36,588 --> 00:00:37,889
And tell them why.

19
00:00:37,889 --> 00:00:39,259
- Well I don't think it's natural because

20
00:00:39,259 --> 00:00:41,975
natural is stuff that can be mixtures.

21
00:00:42,445 --> 00:00:44,651
- [Instructor] Can you give me examples of

22
00:00:44,651 --> 00:00:47,036
natural things that
you think are mixtures?

23
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,509
- Um, like trees.

24
00:00:49,584 --> 00:00:50,223
- [Instructor] So what?

25
00:00:50,223 --> 00:00:53,236
And you're saying a tree
is a mixture because why?

26
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:56,446
- Because it like, has
different colors and

27
00:00:56,446 --> 00:00:58,257
different like, feels to it.

28
00:00:58,257 --> 00:01:01,159
- [Instructor] Oh, so different
colors, and different feels,

29
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:02,460
so like different textures?

30
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,818
Is that what you're saying?

31
00:01:03,818 --> 00:01:07,075
And why does that mean
that it's a mixture?

32
00:01:08,752 --> 00:01:10,285
- Cause it's not all the same.

33
00:01:10,285 --> 00:01:11,835
- How do you know?

34
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,807
- I don't know, I don't.

35
00:01:15,324 --> 00:01:16,694
- What do you guys think?

36
00:01:16,694 --> 00:01:17,785
Do you agree with her

37
00:01:17,785 --> 00:01:21,739
that a tree is something that's
natural, but it's a mixture?

38
00:01:21,953 --> 00:01:24,983
So and that was your definition,
that you got natural.

39
00:01:24,983 --> 00:01:26,086
- I would say it's natural.

40
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,257
Like, some things are natural,
some things aren't natural,

41
00:01:28,257 --> 00:01:29,877
I guess, 'cause...

42
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:32,518
Think about like when a diamond forms.

43
00:01:32,518 --> 00:01:35,386
It's a natural thing, and
it's only that substance.

44
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:38,675
- [Instructor] Sure, I agree
with you with that example.

45
00:01:38,675 --> 00:01:42,447
A diamond is a naturally
occurring substance

46
00:01:42,447 --> 00:01:43,705
that is pure.

47
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:46,260
But for your definition,
what I want you guys

48
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,808
to think about is a definition
that's true all of the time.

49
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:52,855
So, for a tree, I want
us to use that example

50
00:01:52,855 --> 00:01:54,510
about a tree really quick.

51
00:01:54,654 --> 00:01:57,116
'Cause you're saying
it's a mixture, right?

52
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:58,660
So you're saying it's a
mixture 'cause you have

53
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,510
different colors and different textures.

54
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,221
Why is that statement, "different colors"

55
00:02:04,221 --> 00:02:06,003
an indication that it's a mixture?

56
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:09,034
- Well it's, like it, (mumbles).

57
00:02:10,812 --> 00:02:11,625
- [Instructor] Okay.

58
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,424
And a difference between substances?

59
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,543
What is color an example of?

60
00:02:16,257 --> 00:02:16,861
Michelle?

61
00:02:16,861 --> 00:02:17,987
- [Michelle] Characteristic properties?

62
00:02:17,987 --> 00:02:19,485
- [Instructor] Characteristic
property, which we know

63
00:02:19,485 --> 00:02:21,476
what about characteristic properties?

64
00:02:21,748 --> 00:02:23,856
- [Michelle] It is characteristic
to that one substance.

65
00:02:23,856 --> 00:02:26,260
- It's characteristic
to that one substance.

66
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,154
Okay?

67
00:02:27,154 --> 00:02:28,454
So would you change your definitions

68
00:02:28,454 --> 00:02:30,434
based on what we just talked about?

69
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:31,110
- [Student] Yes.

70
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,679
- [Instructor] Okay.

71
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:33,385
So what I want you to
do is write down what

72
00:02:33,385 --> 00:02:35,789
you guys now agree is
the definition of pure

73
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,286
on this piece of paper.

74
00:02:37,286 --> 00:02:39,475
(student talking on the background)

75
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,472
Okay.

76
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:42,900
Hey you guys.

77
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,486
I know you're discussing
it, and I hope that you're

78
00:02:46,486 --> 00:02:48,228
kind of arguing against one another

79
00:02:48,228 --> 00:02:51,798
and defending your argument
for your definitions.

80
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,737
Here's what I'm going to have you do.

81
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,552
Based on your conversations, it is now

82
00:02:56,552 --> 00:03:01,521
your job to write one
definition for the word pure

83
00:03:01,521 --> 00:03:03,321
on this sheet of paper,

84
00:03:03,321 --> 00:03:05,335
that your whole group agrees on.

85
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,243
I'll then share all those
with the rest of the class

86
00:03:08,243 --> 00:03:10,107
to see if we're all on
the same page or not.

87
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,192
Okay?

88
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:12,690
We already had one discussion where we

89
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,884
had three different definitions.

90
00:03:14,884 --> 00:03:16,661
My guess is when I read
what they write down,

91
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:18,158
they're now going to have an agreement on

92
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:19,261
what a definition is.

93
00:03:19,261 --> 00:03:21,334
But, I may be wrong, so let's see.

94
00:03:21,351 --> 00:03:22,352
Write your definition.

95
00:03:22,352 --> 00:03:24,472
As soon as you have it
done, hold it up in the air.

96
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:26,791
Pure substance, same thing.

97
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,857
Pure, or pure substance.

98
00:03:28,857 --> 00:03:31,801
(students conversing)

99
00:03:44,322 --> 00:03:45,692
Okay, so what do you want to do?

100
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,138
What was your definition?

101
00:03:47,956 --> 00:03:50,330
- My definition, well, huh?

102
00:03:50,891 --> 00:03:52,191
- [Instructor] What did
you write, literally?

103
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:53,782
- First time, the first time?

104
00:03:53,782 --> 00:03:55,256
- [Instructor] Yeah, the first time.

105
00:03:55,256 --> 00:03:56,865
What did you write initially?

106
00:03:57,253 --> 00:04:00,420
- I wrote that a pure substance

107
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,259
is a substance that is like, clean.

108
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:06,155
It's not dirty or anything.

109
00:04:06,155 --> 00:04:08,042
- [Instructor] Good, and then
what did you change it to?

110
00:04:08,384 --> 00:04:12,621
- A pure substance is a substance
that has not been touched.

111
00:04:12,621 --> 00:04:15,275
- [Instructor] Okay, and why
did you change your definition to that?

112
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,027
Like, what made you?

113
00:04:19,027 --> 00:04:20,936
Did it happen because
you guys talked about it?

114
00:04:20,976 --> 00:04:21,556
- Yeah.

115
00:04:21,556 --> 00:04:23,309
- [Instructor] Okay, so what
did he say that made you

116
00:04:23,309 --> 00:04:25,492
think that you should change it to

117
00:04:25,492 --> 00:04:27,402
"something that hasn't been touched?"

118
00:04:27,953 --> 00:04:30,984
- He said like, a pure
substance is something that

119
00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:33,869
naturally comes from the Earth.

120
00:04:34,153 --> 00:04:35,419
- [Instructor] Okay.

121
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:38,275
So, you said it's
something that naturally

122
00:04:38,275 --> 00:04:39,761
comes from the Earth.

123
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:41,990
So is that what you mean
by "not been touched?"

124
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,289
- Yeah.

125
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:43,998
- [Instructor] So it's
just natural and not

126
00:04:43,998 --> 00:04:45,258
manipulated by people?

127
00:04:45,258 --> 00:04:45,723
- Yeah.

128
00:04:45,723 --> 00:04:48,126
- [Instructor] So it could
have been literally touched,

129
00:04:48,126 --> 00:04:49,217
but...

130
00:04:49,217 --> 00:04:50,285
- Unprocessed.

131
00:04:50,285 --> 00:04:52,027
- [Instructor] Unprocessed, okay.

132
00:04:52,027 --> 00:04:55,145
So, give me an example of

133
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:58,608
a pure substance that naturally exists.

134
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,837
- Um...

135
00:05:01,621 --> 00:05:02,707
Tree?

136
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:04,419
- [Instructor] Okay, so
tell my why you think

137
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:05,807
a tree is pure.

138
00:05:07,786 --> 00:05:09,051
- It hasn't been really,
been really processed

139
00:05:09,051 --> 00:05:10,619
or anything, it's in the forest.

140
00:05:10,619 --> 00:05:12,755
- [Instructor] Okay, so
then, what do you know

141
00:05:12,755 --> 00:05:14,665
about color of substances?

142
00:05:15,924 --> 00:05:17,010
- Um...

143
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,290
Sometimes it's a characteristic property.

144
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,925
- [Instructor] It is a
characteristic property, right?

145
00:05:22,925 --> 00:05:24,922
Which means each substance has it's,

146
00:05:24,922 --> 00:05:26,420
a certain color.

147
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,340
And for that substance it
will always be that color.

148
00:05:29,752 --> 00:05:31,656
When you think of a tree,
do you see one color,

149
00:05:31,656 --> 00:05:33,583
or do you see multiple colors?

150
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,558
- Sometimes multiple.

151
00:05:34,558 --> 00:05:36,857
- [Instructor] Multiple colors,
so what is that evidence of?

152
00:05:36,857 --> 00:05:38,338
Multiple colors?

153
00:05:39,051 --> 00:05:40,688
- Characteristic property?

154
00:05:40,688 --> 00:05:43,005
- [Instructor] It is a
characteristic property, but I mean,

155
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,431
how is having...

156
00:05:47,155 --> 00:05:48,276
Hey Brett?

157
00:05:50,023 --> 00:05:52,751
Can you please focus on
what you need to be doing?

158
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:54,318
Do you have your definition done?

159
00:05:54,318 --> 00:05:54,922
- [Brett] Yes.

160
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:56,350
- [Instructor] Okay, here's
what I would like the rest

161
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,795
of you guys to do,
including Brett's group.

162
00:05:59,752 --> 00:06:03,311
You now, if you have your
definition written down,

163
00:06:03,757 --> 00:06:06,771
I want you to go ahead and
start doing number two.

164
00:06:06,846 --> 00:06:09,441
Give me your examples of pure substances.

165
00:06:09,481 --> 00:06:11,403
And give me your explanations.

166
00:06:12,186 --> 00:06:14,572
I'm going to give five minutes for that.

167
00:06:14,717 --> 00:06:16,407
That means 10:38.

168
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:19,507
So...

169
00:06:21,451 --> 00:06:23,977
A tree has multiple colors.

170
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:26,635
Green is going to be an indication of,

171
00:06:27,558 --> 00:06:28,667
of what?

172
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,711
Would you be able to
say that green would be

173
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:35,668
an indication of one substance?

174
00:06:37,554 --> 00:06:38,390
- Not really.

175
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,300
- [Instructor] No, okay why not?

176
00:06:40,352 --> 00:06:42,488
- Because, leaves or grass.

177
00:06:42,488 --> 00:06:44,241
Bark is a tree.

178
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:45,855
- Okay, so you're saying that more than,

179
00:06:45,855 --> 00:06:49,118
there's more than one substance maybe

180
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:50,471
that can be green.

181
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,393
Okay?

182
00:06:51,393 --> 00:06:53,692
But, okay, so that's fine.

183
00:06:53,692 --> 00:06:55,654
If there are different colors of green,

184
00:06:55,654 --> 00:06:57,471
do you think that means
different substances?

185
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,538
No?

186
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,570
What about characteristic
properties though?

187
00:07:01,656 --> 00:07:03,810
What do you know about a
characteristic property?

188
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,952
- It never changes for a substance.

189
00:07:05,952 --> 00:07:09,226
- [Instructor] It never
changes for a substance.

190
00:07:09,226 --> 00:07:11,293
So if I have two different
greens, do you think

191
00:07:11,293 --> 00:07:13,075
I have two different substances?

192
00:07:13,417 --> 00:07:14,329
- No.

193
00:07:14,718 --> 00:07:15,728
- I would.

194
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:18,230
'Cause that's the definition
of a characteristic property.

195
00:07:18,352 --> 00:07:21,486
Right, one green would be
characteristic for that

196
00:07:21,486 --> 00:07:23,553
one substance, always.

197
00:07:23,553 --> 00:07:25,277
Never, ever something different.

198
00:07:25,422 --> 00:07:27,953
If I see a different color, that must mean

199
00:07:27,953 --> 00:07:29,805
I have a different substance.

200
00:07:30,728 --> 00:07:31,709
Okay?

201
00:07:35,418 --> 00:07:37,914
If I have two substances together,

202
00:07:37,914 --> 00:07:39,767
do you think that's a mixture or pure?

203
00:07:39,923 --> 00:07:40,654
- [Student] Mixture.

204
00:07:40,654 --> 00:07:41,723
- Mixture.

205
00:07:41,723 --> 00:07:43,754
So, a tree.

206
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,606
Do you see multiple colors on a tree?

207
00:07:45,624 --> 00:07:46,517
- Yeah.

208
00:07:46,517 --> 00:07:47,748
- What does that indicate?

209
00:07:47,748 --> 00:07:48,723
- A mixture.

210
00:07:48,723 --> 00:07:50,987
- A mixture of multiple substances.

211
00:07:50,987 --> 00:07:52,346
Is a tree natural?

212
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:52,984
- Yeah.

213
00:07:52,984 --> 00:07:57,038
- Yeah, so does that affect
your definition for pure?

214
00:07:58,658 --> 00:08:00,106
If you're saying it's a mixture,

215
00:08:00,106 --> 00:08:02,224
it can't be pure, but it's natural,

216
00:08:02,224 --> 00:08:04,471
so maybe our definition needs adjustment?

217
00:08:05,022 --> 00:08:07,123
So think about what you might change

218
00:08:07,123 --> 00:08:09,904
your definition to be now, okay?

219
00:08:11,059 --> 00:08:13,898
Okay, and write one down (mumbles).

220
00:08:14,391 --> 00:08:16,870
(students conversing in the background)

221
00:08:25,618 --> 00:08:26,936
Are you done with this problem?

222
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:28,503
(mumbles)

223
00:08:28,753 --> 00:08:30,129
(mumbles)

224
00:08:31,927 --> 00:08:32,967
It's anonymous.

225
00:08:37,152 --> 00:08:37,750
Okay, well then--

226
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,822
- [Student] Water isn't, is it?

227
00:08:39,822 --> 00:08:41,053
- [Instructor] Oh,
interesting, so you guys,

228
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,052
you don't know if water is or isn't.

229
00:08:43,052 --> 00:08:44,190
- You explained on the board that one time

230
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,178
that it was a mixture of oxygen and...

231
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:49,519
Something else.

232
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,767
- [Instructor] Okay, so let's...

233
00:08:51,713 --> 00:08:54,128
Okay, well what's the
chemical formula for water?

234
00:08:54,128 --> 00:08:54,592
- [Student] H two O.

235
00:08:54,592 --> 00:08:56,183
- H two O, so,

236
00:08:56,183 --> 00:09:00,206
what elements are combined to make water?

237
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,377
Hydrogen and oxygen, okay?

238
00:09:02,557 --> 00:09:04,960
So I agree with you
there, hydrogen and oxygen

239
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,318
are bonded together,

240
00:09:06,318 --> 00:09:08,937
which makes water, okay?

241
00:09:09,221 --> 00:09:12,675
So do you think water
is pure or a mixture?

242
00:09:13,424 --> 00:09:16,082
- [Student] Well, when they
do the water definition,

243
00:09:16,082 --> 00:09:18,671
we were trying to decide like,

244
00:09:18,671 --> 00:09:19,856
if something's straight,

245
00:09:19,856 --> 00:09:22,122
like we could some (mumbles)

246
00:09:22,122 --> 00:09:25,869
not a mixture (mumbles).

247
00:09:30,142 --> 00:09:30,583
- [Instructor] Okay.

248
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:31,913
- [Student] Then is it pure?

249
00:09:31,913 --> 00:09:35,197
Okay, I'm going to read your
definition really quick, okay?

250
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:37,490
So a pure substance is a raw substance.

251
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,649
Nothing inside of a pure
substance has been changed

252
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:42,192
or added, it came straight from nature.

253
00:09:42,192 --> 00:09:44,618
There is no trace of any other substance.

254
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:46,041
It is not a mixture.

255
00:09:46,917 --> 00:09:50,873
Okay, I see two definitions in there.

256
00:09:52,503 --> 00:09:53,554
Here's what I see.

257
00:09:53,554 --> 00:09:56,387
I see a definition that
talks about it being,

258
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,903
I see three.

259
00:09:58,489 --> 00:10:00,427
One, your definition is, "something that

260
00:10:00,427 --> 00:10:01,641
"comes from nature."

261
00:10:01,728 --> 00:10:04,386
Another one I see is, "Something that

262
00:10:04,386 --> 00:10:06,239
"has not been changed."

263
00:10:07,126 --> 00:10:11,527
Another one I see is, "no
trace of another substance."

264
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,565
So that sounds like one substance.

265
00:10:14,418 --> 00:10:16,734
Okay, those are the
three definitions I see.

266
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,387
- [Student] But is there
a substance from nature

267
00:10:19,387 --> 00:10:20,972
that hasn't been changed?

268
00:10:22,219 --> 00:10:23,236
- [Student] No.

269
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,155
- [Instructor] Water is
a substance from nature

270
00:10:26,155 --> 00:10:27,490
that hasn't been changed.

271
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,055
I mean, yeah, we add things to it.

272
00:10:29,055 --> 00:10:31,676
- It hasn't been changed,
but it is a mixture.

273
00:10:32,088 --> 00:10:34,068
- [Instructor] Is it a mixture though?

274
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:34,553
- Yeah.

275
00:10:34,553 --> 00:10:36,279
- But what about when like,

276
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:38,055
animal live in it and stuff,

277
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:39,518
does it change?

278
00:10:39,518 --> 00:10:40,679
- [Instructor] So you're
kind of thinking maybe

279
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:42,785
it gets contaminated that way?

280
00:10:42,785 --> 00:10:45,137
If it gets in contact with something else?

281
00:10:45,328 --> 00:10:47,505
- Yeah, if they're even
from nature (mumbles).

282
00:10:49,124 --> 00:10:51,028
- [Instructor] So here's what, today,

283
00:10:51,028 --> 00:10:53,559
we should be able to figure
out by the end of the period.

284
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:55,185
And you guys pretty
confidently should be able

285
00:10:55,185 --> 00:10:58,105
to tell me if water is or is not pure.

286
00:10:58,761 --> 00:11:00,137
Here is my hint.

287
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,486
My hint to you, is the way we can tell by

288
00:11:03,486 --> 00:11:06,284
looking at something, if
it's pure or a mixture,

289
00:11:06,284 --> 00:11:07,584
'cause you can,

290
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:10,928
or maybe not just by looking,
but experimenting with it.

291
00:11:10,928 --> 00:11:13,744
It's based on characteristic
properties of matter.

292
00:11:13,853 --> 00:11:15,601
That's what I want you to think about.

293
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,597
- So, it's just the primary colors, then?

294
00:11:18,857 --> 00:11:19,786
- [Instructor] What do you mean?

295
00:11:19,786 --> 00:11:21,017
- [Student] Primary colors?

296
00:11:21,017 --> 00:11:23,438
- Well, the primary colors, I don't know.

297
00:11:23,594 --> 00:11:25,684
It's just that color (mumbles).

298
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,228
- [Instructor] So is color
a characteristic property

299
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,424
of matter?

300
00:11:28,424 --> 00:11:29,575
Yes.

301
00:11:29,585 --> 00:11:31,431
What does that mean then?

302
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,335
- [Student] Wait, but can't you change it?

303
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:35,111
When something's a color?

304
00:11:35,151 --> 00:11:37,259
But when you add one color to...

305
00:11:37,828 --> 00:11:40,063
Something (mumbles).

306
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:41,926
Like if I add a color to the water,

307
00:11:41,926 --> 00:11:43,482
doesn't it change the water?

308
00:11:43,482 --> 00:11:45,560
- [Instructor] When you
add a color into water,

309
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,074
it mixes with the water.

310
00:11:48,126 --> 00:11:49,647
- So it's not still water?

311
00:11:49,647 --> 00:11:51,144
- It still tastes like water?

312
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:52,828
- [Instructor] I didn't say that.

313
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:54,325
I just said it was mixed.

314
00:11:55,435 --> 00:11:57,058
- [Student] It's a mixture, oh.

315
00:11:57,058 --> 00:11:59,726
- Okay, I didn't say that either, but,

316
00:11:59,726 --> 00:12:02,135
- [Student] If you put
the food coloring in it...

317
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,381
- So, and why are you saying that's

318
00:12:04,381 --> 00:12:05,751
all of a sudden a mixture?

319
00:12:05,751 --> 00:12:08,544
Because they're (mumbles).

320
00:12:08,552 --> 00:12:12,209
- [Instructor] So different
substances together, okay.

321
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:14,236
So what then does "pure" mean?

322
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:17,921
- Not mixed, a substance by itself.

323
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:19,936
- [Instructor] A substance by itself.

324
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:23,271
So you believe water is just a substance.

325
00:12:23,706 --> 00:12:24,537
Okay?

326
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:27,480
Alright.

327
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,774
Alright you guys!

328
00:12:29,117 --> 00:12:30,404
These crutches are going to kill me.

329
00:12:31,094 --> 00:12:32,075
Are you okay?

330
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:33,302
Those hurt, you're hurt.

331
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:34,550
Okay, you're okay.

332
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,809
(students conversing)

333
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,805
We're going to talk
about it right now, okay?

334
00:12:43,376 --> 00:12:45,472
Do I have everybody's piece of paper?

335
00:12:47,152 --> 00:12:47,968
Are you done?

336
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:48,886
Okay.

337
00:12:48,886 --> 00:12:51,029
(students conversing)

338
00:12:54,714 --> 00:12:56,044
This is not true.

339
00:12:56,978 --> 00:12:57,559
- [Student] Really?

340
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,360
- [Instructor] Yes.

341
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,705
Alright, turn here and
stop what you're doing.

342
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:06,201
Listen to what?

343
00:13:10,525 --> 00:13:12,487
What I want, I know
that you may not be done

344
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:14,200
with your examples yet.

345
00:13:14,275 --> 00:13:15,784
Because you're still struggling with your

346
00:13:15,784 --> 00:13:17,404
definition of pure.

347
00:13:21,021 --> 00:13:23,760
I want to show you what
other groups are thinking.

348
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,921
So I'm going to show you all these.

349
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:26,860
I'll ready them for you too so that,

350
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,660
you're going to see that
we have differences.

351
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,319
And the idea is, by the end of today,

352
00:13:31,319 --> 00:13:33,954
based on what we do, you should be able to

353
00:13:33,954 --> 00:13:36,236
change and finalize your definition.

354
00:13:36,555 --> 00:13:37,873
Okay?

355
00:13:38,157 --> 00:13:40,903
And competently be able
to give me examples.

356
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,791
Alright?

357
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:45,744
So, the first one, and
I'll try to move this.

358
00:13:48,513 --> 00:13:50,075
Let's make sure you can see this.

359
00:13:50,684 --> 00:13:52,855
If it's hard to see
Tim, will you turn off,

360
00:13:52,855 --> 00:13:54,724
actually why don't you go
ahead and do that now Tim?

361
00:13:54,724 --> 00:13:56,042
I think it will be better.

362
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:56,756
I don't know.

363
00:13:56,756 --> 00:13:58,091
But just the front set of lights?

364
00:13:58,091 --> 00:13:59,444
Thank you.

365
00:14:00,268 --> 00:14:01,070
We'll come down.

366
00:14:01,156 --> 00:14:02,265
Okay.

367
00:14:03,518 --> 00:14:05,103
The first definition.

368
00:14:05,991 --> 00:14:10,159
"An unprocessed material which is one

369
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:13,050
"substance by itself, instead of combining

370
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,273
"multiple substances to get the material."

371
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,554
I see two different definitions.

372
00:14:17,554 --> 00:14:20,800
I see one, "pure means to be unprocessed,"

373
00:14:20,921 --> 00:14:24,039
and then I see another,
"one substance by itself."

374
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,303
Okay?

375
00:14:26,691 --> 00:14:27,835
Here's another one.

376
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,024
"A pure substance is only one substance

377
00:14:30,024 --> 00:14:31,661
"that is not a mixture."

378
00:14:31,661 --> 00:14:33,890
So you're starting to see
that pure and mixture,

379
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,759
which I will agree with, are basically

380
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:37,541
opposites of one another.

381
00:14:37,849 --> 00:14:41,268
So you've got to explain
the difference between them.

382
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:43,317
So a pure substance is one substance

383
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:44,617
that is not a mixture.

384
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:47,805
So I'm wondering what your
definition of mixture is.

385
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:49,493
Who wrote, does anyone?

386
00:14:49,493 --> 00:14:51,369
Who wrote this one, are
you willing to share?

387
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,435
Do you have a definition for mixture then?

388
00:14:54,892 --> 00:14:59,652
- [Student] Um well,
multiple substances that are

389
00:14:59,652 --> 00:15:01,220
mixed together.

390
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,450
- [Instructor] Good so, you're saying,

391
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:05,422
so great, your definition for pure is

392
00:15:05,422 --> 00:15:08,058
one substance, while mixture would be

393
00:15:08,058 --> 00:15:09,678
more than one substance.

394
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,839
Okay.

395
00:15:13,085 --> 00:15:16,435
This one says "a substance
that has no mixture involved."

396
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:18,391
So you're saying that
there's a clear difference

397
00:15:18,391 --> 00:15:19,285
between the two.

398
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:22,222
I still don't quite see a
definition for the word "pure"

399
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:23,772
yet in this definition.

400
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:28,015
"A pure substance is a substance with

401
00:15:28,015 --> 00:15:30,007
"no other substances mixed in."

402
00:15:30,152 --> 00:15:32,160
"It is one single substance."

403
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,268
So I'm starting to see
a little bit of a trend.

404
00:15:38,325 --> 00:15:40,891
"A pure substance is a raw substance."

405
00:15:40,891 --> 00:15:43,213
"Nothing inside of a
pure substance has been

406
00:15:43,213 --> 00:15:44,861
"changed or added."

407
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,626
"It came straight from nature."

408
00:15:46,626 --> 00:15:49,070
"There's no trace of any other substance."

409
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,893
"It is not a mixture."

410
00:15:50,922 --> 00:15:53,650
So, we definitely have agreement that

411
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,113
mixture and pure are something different,

412
00:15:55,113 --> 00:15:56,826
but I see three definitions.

413
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,300
One,

414
00:15:58,956 --> 00:16:02,555
it's something that is
raw, or something that,

415
00:16:04,445 --> 00:16:06,620
and I think this is what this is saying.

416
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,256
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but you mean by "raw,"

417
00:16:09,256 --> 00:16:11,862
kind of, in some way connected to

418
00:16:12,588 --> 00:16:13,708
natural.

419
00:16:13,993 --> 00:16:15,299
Okay, so,

420
00:16:16,024 --> 00:16:18,277
something that is natural versus

421
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,691
something that has no trace of any other.

422
00:16:20,691 --> 00:16:24,541
So I kind of see the idea of
one substance versus multiple.

423
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,340
Okay, as a definition.

424
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,301
Okay, maybe I only saw two.

425
00:16:29,457 --> 00:16:30,311
Okay.

426
00:16:30,874 --> 00:16:32,522
Oh I thought this one was typed.

427
00:16:32,522 --> 00:16:33,620
I was like, "How did that happen?"

428
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:34,811
How did...

429
00:16:35,505 --> 00:16:37,056
Was that you, is that your handwriting?

430
00:16:37,056 --> 00:16:38,177
That's insane.

431
00:16:38,508 --> 00:16:40,000
Okay, I like it.

432
00:16:40,087 --> 00:16:41,277
It's like, prefect.

433
00:16:41,561 --> 00:16:42,577
- [Student] Woah.

434
00:16:42,885 --> 00:16:43,721
- [Instructor] Okay.

435
00:16:43,721 --> 00:16:45,039
- [Student] There you go.

436
00:16:45,555 --> 00:16:46,484
- [Instructor] Alright.

437
00:16:46,484 --> 00:16:49,351
"A pure substance is a
substance or material

438
00:16:49,351 --> 00:16:51,755
"that hasn't been mixed
with any other substance."

439
00:16:51,755 --> 00:16:53,166
"It is only one substance."

440
00:16:53,485 --> 00:16:55,441
Okay, um.

441
00:16:56,352 --> 00:16:57,328
Two.

442
00:16:57,328 --> 00:16:59,220
(students laughing)

443
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,503
Two more.

444
00:17:00,985 --> 00:17:03,249
"A substance is only one substance,

445
00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:05,867
"and it is not mixed with
any other substance," right?

446
00:17:07,184 --> 00:17:08,502
And our last one.

447
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:11,393
Oh, this one's actually different.

448
00:17:11,852 --> 00:17:14,099
"A pure substance is an element."

449
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:16,089
Okay that's a different definition than

450
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:17,500
the other things I've heard.

451
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:21,256
"They are made up of one atom."

452
00:17:21,256 --> 00:17:23,148
"They are not mixed with other substances

453
00:17:23,148 --> 00:17:25,569
"nor do they contain other substances within them."

454
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,827
So I hear two definitions in here.

455
00:17:27,827 --> 00:17:30,469
One, being pure means
that it's just an element.

456
00:17:31,182 --> 00:17:33,551
And then I see another one that it's

457
00:17:33,551 --> 00:17:34,938
a single substance.

458
00:17:35,652 --> 00:17:36,488
Okay?

459
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,055
So I want to hear some of the examples

460
00:17:38,055 --> 00:17:39,733
you're coming up with right now.

461
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,852
And I'm not going to say
if they're right or wrong,

462
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,936
I'm just going to try to

463
00:17:46,217 --> 00:17:47,976
probe you with some questions.

464
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,480
Okay?

465
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,861
Naud!

466
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,174
What is one of your examples?

467
00:17:52,174 --> 00:17:53,450
- [Student] Salt.

468
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,389
- [Instructor] Okay, so
you say salt is pure.

469
00:17:55,389 --> 00:17:56,756
Why do you say salt is pure?

470
00:17:56,756 --> 00:17:59,925
- Because we don't think
any other substance is

471
00:17:59,925 --> 00:18:03,280
combined with salt to make salt.

472
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,521
- [Instructor] So you're
saying that to be pure

473
00:18:05,521 --> 00:18:08,249
means one thing, one
thing in that container,

474
00:18:08,249 --> 00:18:10,188
and you're saying if it's just salt,

475
00:18:10,188 --> 00:18:11,349
that must be pure?

476
00:18:11,349 --> 00:18:12,220
- [Student] Mm hmm.

477
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,376
- [Instructor] Okay.

478
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:14,287
Miriam.

479
00:18:14,287 --> 00:18:15,912
- [Miriam] It has to be raw and like,

480
00:18:15,912 --> 00:18:17,921
like, plain, like raw salt.

481
00:18:17,921 --> 00:18:21,401
Like, not like mixed
with preservatives or...

482
00:18:21,627 --> 00:18:25,424
- [Instructor] Okay, so
literally just salt, that's it.

483
00:18:25,424 --> 00:18:26,086
- [Miriam] Yea.

484
00:18:26,086 --> 00:18:27,246
- Okay.

485
00:18:27,886 --> 00:18:30,902
Alright, so let's take another example.

486
00:18:31,116 --> 00:18:33,613
Or if you disagree with them, you can also

487
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,405
offer up your argument for that.

488
00:18:37,188 --> 00:18:38,500
Shaina, what do you think?
