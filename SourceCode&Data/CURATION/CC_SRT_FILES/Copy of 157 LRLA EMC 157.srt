1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,570
- Like a long A?
- Not long A.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,780
- Long O?

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,975
- No, I'll give you a hint. There's some
letters up on the front. What is

4
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:13,100
the sound?
- [together] "Er."

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,249
- It's "er."
- "Er. " Everybody say "er."

00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:15,853
- [together] "Er."

7
00:00:15,853 --> 00:00:18,850
- Okay. What we're going to do... If you
remember last week, we looked at some

8
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:23,731
pictures. And when you heard the "er"
sound, what sound did you make?

9
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:25,774
- "Er."
- No.

10
00:00:25,774 --> 00:00:26,471

00:00:26,471 --> 00:00:27,446

- Tweet, tweet.

13
00:00:28,235 --> 00:00:33,280
- Tweet, tweet because a bird says tweet,
tweet and a bird has "er." So my first

14
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,968
picture is a train. Do you hear it?

15
00:00:35,968 --> 00:00:36,944
- Yes, ma'am.

16
00:00:36,944 --> 00:00:37,618
- No.

17
00:00:37,618 --> 00:00:38,802

- Oh, no. No.

19
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,845
- So are you going to say tweet, tweet?

00:00:40,845 --> 00:00:41,700
- [together] No.

21
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,270

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,890

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,020

- Rope.

28
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,700
- No.

29
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,830

00:01:05,158 --> 00:01:06,435
- [together] Tweet, tweet.

35
00:01:06,435 --> 00:01:08,943
- Do you hear "er" in shark?

36
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:09,431
- No.

37
00:01:09,431 --> 00:01:15,240
- Do you hear the difference? What do you
hear? "Ar." That's different. Okay. Let's

38
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,840
look really quick, eyes up here. When I
have the word skirt, what two letters make

00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:33,646
- [together] E-R.

45
00:01:33,646 --> 00:01:38,530
- Very good. We're going to read some
words, okay? I want you to look at this

46
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:43,150

68
00:02:21,343 --> 00:02:22,923

70
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:27,410

00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,520
- [together] Term.

76
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:42,840
- Term. Eyes up here. Okay. Good. Now
we're going to go to our work mats and

77
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,255
we're going to build some words, okay?

78
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,080
Okay. You can give the students a point,
because you all did a very good job.

79
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,530
Everybody was paying attention and
participating. All right, watch how Miss

80
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,990
Dodd is doing this because you're going to
do the same thing. Get your word mat out

81
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:08,860
in front of you and put your letters
out so you can see them.

82
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,276
We have to go kind of quick.

83
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,620
I'm going to put this on top of this
just for now, okay?

84
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,120
- Thanks.

85
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:33,980
- You're welcome. All right. Let's see.
Let's see how fast we can get those out.

86
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,910
Let's see. I'm going to say we can do it
in 40 seconds.

87
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,916
Let me help you out. Let's put all
these out so you can see them.

88
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,714
- You have a lot of words.
- Shh.

89
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,880
- Okay. We're not putting them down on the
mat. We're going to put them up here and

90
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:04,910
then we're going to pull
them down to the mat.

91
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:11,277
There we go.
- Economics.

92
00:04:11,277 --> 00:04:12,200
- Shh.

93
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,280
- All right. Let's see if we made it. Are
we all done?

94
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,705
- Yes, ma'am.

95
00:04:15,705 --> 00:04:18,660
- All right. Give the students another
point because you did it in enough time.

96
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,750
Okay. Miss Dodd has the words up here,
also, the word parts. So first, let's look

97
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,030
at the ending parts, okay? What do you
think this says?

98
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,210
- [together] "Er."

99
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:33,690
- "Er." Very good. Look at this next one.
What does this say?

100
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,000
- [together] "Urt."

101
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:39,110
- "Urt." Eyes up here. Eyes up here. Good.

102
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,766
- What does this say?

103
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:42,800
- [together] "Er."

104
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,947
- Good. What does this say?

105
00:04:44,947 --> 00:04:45,806
- [together] "Urse."

106
00:04:45,806 --> 00:04:46,897
- And what does this say?

107
00:04:46,897 --> 00:04:47,580
- [together] "Erve."

108
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,360
- Okay. These are the same cards that you
have, so we're going to make some words, okay?

109
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,800
- Okay.

110
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:59,430
- First, we're going to start with "urt."
U-R-T. So let's pull that down to where it

111
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:12,360
says rhyme. U-R-T. Okay? And I want you to
make the word hurt. Hurt.

112
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,920
- Good job. All right. Let's spell hurt
together.

113
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,540
- [together] H-U-R-T. Hurt.

114
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:29,490
- Very good. All right. So Miss Dodd will
pull down my H and it looks like everybody

115
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:40,950
got that. Okay. Now I want you to take
your U-R. Pull down your U-R. Okay? And

116
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:47,830
this time, I'm going to give you a clue.
I want you to make the word that is

117
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:54,990
something that is on an animal. Covers an
animal. Keeps him warm. His what? We don't

118
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:59,990
want our H right now. Let's see
if you can figure it out.

119
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:05,070
You should have U-R right here, okay?
And now we're going to... So

120
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,212
what was the answer to my clue?

121
00:06:07,212 --> 00:06:09,082
- [together] Fur.
- Fur. Spell it.

122
00:06:09,082 --> 00:06:12,263
- [together] F-U-R. Fur.

123
00:06:12,263 --> 00:06:19,530
- Keep your U-R and I want you to make the
word spur. Spur. We talked about this word

124
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:28,200
last week. A spur. Okay? Yes.

125
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,800
- Who put the things out?

126
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,780
- I did. Okay. Who remembers
what a spur is?

127
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,120
- Something that you kick?

128
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,130
- Very good. Here's a picture of a spur.
Remember there was a thing that the cowboy

129
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:45,520
has on his boots that he kicks the horse
and it makes the horse go fast? Okay. So I

130
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,500
should pull down my S-P and this word is?

131
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,860
- [together] Spur.

132
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:59,510
- Very good. All right. I want you to pull
down your U-R-S-E. U-R-S-E. And you

133
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,150
shouldn't have anything in front of the
U-R-S-E. You should just have it just like

134
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:07,330
Madison has it here. She doesn't have
anything for onset. She only has her

135
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:12,875
rhyme. Okay? All right. What
does that part say?

136
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,082
- [together] "Urse."

137
00:07:15,082 --> 00:07:21,360
- "Urse." Okay. I want you to add a P and
see what word you get and if you have a D,

138
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:26,560
you might want to flip it over. It's also
a P. Okay? All right. What word is that?

139
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,290
- [together] Purse.

140
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:37,660
- Purse. Very good. Okay. I want you to
take your I-R and pull it down. And this

141
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,820
time, I want you to make your own word
with I-R. It might not be the same word

142
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,800
your neighbor makes. I want you to make
your own word with I-R. Look at all the

143
00:07:50,980 --> 00:08:03,130
onset parts that you have and see what you
can add to "ir." Good job.

144
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,070
- All right. Let's look at what we came up
with. What did you come up with?

145
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,249
- Sir.

146
00:08:16,249 --> 00:08:19,840
- Sir. Okay. So I'll pull down my S here.
This word is sir. That is correct and I

147
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:26,610
see a few people have sir. Let's see.
Let's look at this one. What did you make?

148
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,930
- Spir.

149
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:32,350
- But what two letters actually say "ur"
in spur?

150
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:35,570
- I-R?
- Not I-R. Remember?

151
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,550
- U-R.

152
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:42,690
- Yep. Let's put it up here so we remember
it. Spur is S-P-U-R.

153
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,000
- I've got another one.

154
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,530
- All right.
- Dirt.

155
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,350
- Okay.
- Oh, yeah.

156
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,630
- How do you spell dirt?

157
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,200
- Oh, yeah. Wait. Oh yeah.

158
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:59,240
- We might not have that ending, but do
you know how to spell dirt? D...

159
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,280
- I-R-T.

160
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,890
- Very good. All right. Let's move on to
another one. Oh, I see that you have

161
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:10,994
G-I-R. "Gir." What were you thinking when
you wrote that? Can you use that in a

162
00:09:10,994 --> 00:09:18,007
sentence? No? Okay. This one is not a
word, okay? Now we're going to pull out

163
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:22,095
our E-R-V-E. E-R-V-E. Let's see how
quickly we can get it up.

164
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:24,400
You all are doing a good job.
You're all probably going to

165
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:32,600
get another point. E-R-V-E.
Okay? And I want you to

166
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:39,045
fill in the blank. The ladies in the
cafeteria blank us our food. The ladies in

167
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:46,894
the cafeteria blank us our food. What can
we put in front of the E-R-V-E that would

168
00:09:46,894 --> 00:09:54,672
complete that sentence? It's got to make
sense. All right. What is this word?

169
00:09:54,672 --> 00:09:56,460
- "Erve."

170
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:01,894
- Let's see. What if I were to put an S?
What word would I have?

171
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:04,193
- Serve?

172
00:10:04,193 --> 00:10:07,421
- Serve. Does that make sense in my
sentence? Do the ladies in the cafeteria

173
00:10:07,421 --> 00:10:10,973
serve us our food? Yeah. So what word did
we come up with?

174
00:10:10,973 --> 00:10:11,647
- [together] Serve.

175
00:10:11,647 --> 00:10:15,780
- Serve. Very good. Okay. So this is what
I want you to do. I want you to take all

176
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,600
your cards just like Miss Dodd's doing
here and I'm just going to put them

177
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,348
together pretty quick. I don't have to
really take my time here and then I'm

178
00:10:24,348 --> 00:10:31,105
going to stick them on my page. We're
going to make a pile in the middle.

179
00:10:53,300 --> 00:11:02,635
Good job. All right. Good. And remember,
it doesn't have to be perfect. Good job.

180
00:11:02,635 --> 00:11:06,002
And let's take it all...

181
00:11:10,739 --> 00:11:11,691
- Is this yours?

182
00:11:11,691 --> 00:11:13,618
- Good job.

183
00:11:13,618 --> 00:11:14,501
- No.

184
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:21,671
- All right. I'm going to go ahead and
hand you our story. We're going

185
00:11:21,671 --> 00:11:26,645
to take what we've learned and take it to
text. We're going to read a story that

186
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:29,850
has lots of words that have the "er"
sound.

187
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,172
- This looks like [inaudible].

188
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:33,472
- I have one.

189
00:11:33,472 --> 00:11:35,631
- Yeah. That one's his.

190
00:11:35,631 --> 00:11:36,816
- Curls that swirl.

191
00:11:36,816 --> 00:11:39,091
- All right.

192
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:40,577
- I can't put it...

193
00:11:40,577 --> 00:11:42,226
- Whoa. It's got 12 pages.

194
00:11:42,226 --> 00:11:50,957
- Okay. All right. Let me go ahead and
take those so we can go ahead and start

195
00:11:50,957 --> 00:11:54,395
reading, okay? Okay. You can give the
students a point because you did a good

196
00:11:54,395 --> 00:11:58,922
job last time. Okay. I'm going to give
everybody a highlighter because as we're

197
00:11:58,922 --> 00:12:06,167
reading, I want you highlighting words
that have the "er" sound. Okay? So what's

198
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:07,189
my title?

199
00:12:07,189 --> 00:12:10,100
- [together] Curls that swirl.

200
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,738
- Very good. Do you see some words that
have the "er" sound?

201
00:12:12,738 --> 00:12:13,600
- Yes, ma'am.

202
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,014
- Let's highlight them. What's my first
word?

203
00:12:15,014 --> 00:12:17,522
- Curls.
- U-R.

204
00:12:17,522 --> 00:12:19,611
- Curls. What's my next word that has
"er"?

205
00:12:19,611 --> 00:12:22,119
- [together] Swirl.

206
00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:27,181
- Swirl. Very good. All right. Curls that
swirl. What are they talking about, about

207
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:30,240
curls? What kind of curls are they talking
about?

208
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,590
- Like curls in your hair.

209
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:35,110
- Curls in your hair. Very good. Okay. As
we're going, I'm going to be putting the

210
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:43,690
words up here, okay? So we have curls and
we have swirl and we will use these words

211
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:47,800
again tomorrow. Okay, so let's open up to
the first page.

212
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,230
- Miss Dodd? Miss Dodd?

213
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,710
- Highlight it again?

214
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,090
- No highlighting yet, okay?

215
00:12:53,270 --> 00:13:00,520
- Cheryl? Oh, okay. Well, come up. No, no.
We're on this page here. Page three at the

216
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,404
bottom, okay?

217
00:13:05,097 --> 00:13:06,760
- Okay.

218
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:12,274
- Okay. So let's see how quickly we can
get to page three. All right.

219
00:13:12,274 --> 00:13:15,897
What we're going to do is I want you
following along. Miss Dodd's going to

220
00:13:15,897 --> 00:13:21,539
model how we're going to read this page.
As I'm reading, you can highlight when I

221
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:24,300
say an "er" word. Does everybody
understand the directions?

222
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,300
- [together] Yes, ma'am.

223
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,720
- Okay, but you need to be listening
because after this, we're going to read it

224
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:37,160
all together, okay? Here we go. Once
there was a small girl who had hair that

225
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:42,273
curled and swirled and twirled.

226
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,777
Drop where you hand is.

227
00:13:46,777 --> 00:13:47,590
- I messed up.

228
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,797
- That's okay. We'll go
back and look at it.

229
00:13:48,797 --> 00:13:49,564
- This one?

230
00:13:49,564 --> 00:13:59,200
- We'll talk about it. It swirled over
her shirt and way past her skirt.

231
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:04,440
Okay. Now. Stop. No, no. We're going to
just look at that one page because I see

232
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:11,114
some things that make me ask some
questions. What word did you ask me about?

233
00:14:11,114 --> 00:14:12,437
- That wasn't me.

234
00:14:12,437 --> 00:14:15,131
- Did you ask me about a word? What word?

235
00:14:15,131 --> 00:14:15,897
- There.

236
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:24,349
- There. Okay. Let's look at the word
there. Okay. Now should we highlight

237
00:14:24,349 --> 00:14:26,903
there?
- Yes, ma'am.

238
00:14:26,903 --> 00:14:30,734
- Raise your hand if you say yes we
should. Raise your hand if you say no we

239
00:14:30,734 --> 00:14:35,500
shouldn't. Okay. Well, let's look at it.
Does it have E-R like we're looking for?

240
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,200
- [together] Yes.

241
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,885
- It does, but does it say "er"?

242
00:14:38,885 --> 00:14:39,060
- No.

243
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:45,640
- No. It has a different sound. Every E-R
isn't going to say "er." It's just going

244
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,070
to be special times, so in this case,
should we highlight it?

245
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:48,930
- [together] No.

246
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:55,070
- No, okay. And it's okay if you did,
okay? All right. Let's go ahead and read

247
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,660
it together now. Everybody follow along.
Let's put our finger under the first word

248
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,000
or your highlighter is fine.
