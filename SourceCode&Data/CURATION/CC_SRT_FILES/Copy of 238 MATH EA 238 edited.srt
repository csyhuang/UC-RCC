1
00:00:00,196 --> 00:00:01,150
- Okay, guys.

2
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:02,431
I see we'll be looking at investigating

3
00:00:02,431 --> 00:00:04,116
fraction multiplication.

4
00:00:04,116 --> 00:00:06,068
Okay, so can you read the
objective with me please?

5
00:00:06,068 --> 00:00:07,246
So, I ...

6
00:00:07,246 --> 00:00:11,722
- I will be able to
do fraction multiplication.

7
00:00:12,975 --> 00:00:14,743
- Okay. I've also put it in Spanish

8
00:00:14,743 --> 00:00:16,470
just in case that helps you.

9
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,253
Okay, so the first thing I
want to discuss with you today,

10
00:00:20,943 --> 00:00:24,420
is, what do you think about that?

11
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:26,872
Do you agree or disagree?

12
00:00:26,872 --> 00:00:27,949
And then, why?

13
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:31,247
So, one-half, does
one-half equal one-half?

14
00:00:31,252 --> 00:00:32,683
Why or why not?

15
00:00:32,683 --> 00:00:35,501
And then, give me some examples.

16
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:37,153
Okay, Raul.

17
00:00:37,153 --> 00:00:41,010
- It's becuase it is one-half.

18
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,288
They're the same.

19
00:00:42,288 --> 00:00:44,392
- Okay.  Abraham.

20
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:47,027
- It's like you cut a pear in half,

21
00:00:47,027 --> 00:00:50,277
it's gonna be in equal parts.

22
00:00:50,277 --> 00:00:52,370
- Okay, so you guys are
saying it's equal?

23
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,510
- Yes. [Background Chatter]

24
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,310
- Okay.

25
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,152
What do you think?

26
00:01:04,152 --> 00:01:08,226
Eddie believes he thinks
the same thing.

27
00:01:09,317 --> 00:01:10,718
Taleah, what do you think?

28
00:01:10,718 --> 00:01:12,751
- I think it's the same.

29
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:14,031
- You think it's the same?

30
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:15,675
Does everyone think it's the same?

31
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:16,883
- I do.

32
00:01:16,883 --> 00:01:20,553
- Until you think,
why wouldn't it be the same.

33
00:01:20,553 --> 00:01:22,766
- Okay, so Jose is saying

34
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:25,639
why wouldn't they be the same.

35
00:01:25,639 --> 00:01:28,394
Okay, so one thing Jose says is

36
00:01:28,394 --> 00:01:30,894
he's trying to think of
are there any examples

37
00:01:30,894 --> 00:01:33,373
why it wouldn't be the same.
Joe.

38
00:01:33,373 --> 00:01:36,550
- It's not the same because
[Background Chatter]

39
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,288
- No, that's just the board point.

40
00:01:38,288 --> 00:01:39,508
- Is there a times?

41
00:01:39,508 --> 00:01:42,414
- Nope, it's just one over two

42
00:01:42,414 --> 00:01:43,734
equals one over two.

43
00:01:43,734 --> 00:01:47,898
- I was thinking it
was a half times a half.

44
00:01:48,418 --> 00:01:50,215
- Okay, so sounds to me like you guys

45
00:01:50,215 --> 00:01:52,532
all agree that it's the same.

46
00:01:52,532 --> 00:01:53,445
Right?

47
00:01:53,445 --> 00:01:54,299
- Yeah.

48
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,513
- So now, how do you explain to me

49
00:01:56,513 --> 00:01:59,649
why you think it's the same?

50
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,284
Why you think it's the same?
Joe?

51
00:02:02,284 --> 00:02:04,254
- Because they have equal parts.

52
00:02:04,254 --> 00:02:06,644
- Okay. Equal parts.

53
00:02:06,644 --> 00:02:08,671
What do you mean by equal parts?

54
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:11,101
- They have the same fraction.

55
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:13,499
- Okay. Jose.

56
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:15,489
- They're both practically the same thing.

57
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:17,195
- What do you mean by
practically the same thing?

58
00:02:17,195 --> 00:02:20,041
- That once you cut a square in half,

59
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,885
you have equal parts, and
they're gonna be the same thing.

60
00:02:22,885 --> 00:02:25,248
- Okay.

61
00:02:27,365 --> 00:02:28,896
Who is someone we haven't heard from?

62
00:02:28,896 --> 00:02:32,080
Madeline, what do you think?

63
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,673
So I heard you say they
are the same, right?

64
00:02:33,673 --> 00:02:34,323
- Yeah.

65
00:02:34,323 --> 00:02:36,599
- So why do you think
they are the same?

66
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:41,086
- 'Cause they're
both equal parts and

67
00:02:44,336 --> 00:02:47,901
the same 'cause half equals a half.

68
00:02:48,444 --> 00:02:52,537
- Okay. Antonio,
what do you think?

69
00:02:55,344 --> 00:02:56,896
Think it's the same?

70
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:00,613
So, sounds like we're all thinking

71
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:02,422
it's the same, okay.

72
00:03:02,422 --> 00:03:03,640
Abraham, what do you think?

73
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,009
- I think they
equal the same thing.

74
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:09,188
- Equals the same thing.

75
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,565
Okay, so now let's take a look at ...

76
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:14,775
maybe, 'cause it sounds
like we're all on the same

77
00:03:14,775 --> 00:03:16,339
path here.

78
00:03:16,339 --> 00:03:20,396
So let's take a look at something else.

79
00:03:20,396 --> 00:03:23,625
Are they really the same?

80
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,238
Is that half of a ...

81
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,064
- Cookie.

82
00:03:26,064 --> 00:03:29,129
- Cookie. Half of a cookie.

83
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:30,621
Half a ...

84
00:03:30,621 --> 00:03:32,551
- Pizza.

85
00:03:32,551 --> 00:03:33,547
- Are they the same?

86
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,540
- No.
- Yes.

87
00:03:42,446 --> 00:03:44,133
- One at a time, 'cause I'm hearing

88
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:45,738
a lot of good stuff, but you guys are all

89
00:03:45,738 --> 00:03:47,180
saying it at the same time.

90
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,090
Okay. Miguel.

91
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,020
- They're the same,
'cause if they weren't,

92
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,576
[Background Chatter] the same is just half.

93
00:03:54,576 --> 00:03:56,912
- So I'm hearing, they're the same,

94
00:03:56,912 --> 00:03:58,761
but one's bigger than the other one,

95
00:03:58,761 --> 00:04:00,447
'cause one's a pizza and one's a cookie.

96
00:04:00,447 --> 00:04:02,682
- Yeah.

97
00:04:06,152 --> 00:04:07,549
- Tina, you're kind of
shaking your head.

98
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:10,317
What do you think about that?

99
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:11,459
- I think they're both the same,

100
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,791
'cause they're still one-half
they are just different size.

101
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:17,532
- Victoria, what do you think?

102
00:04:17,532 --> 00:04:18,752
Same or not the same?

103
00:04:18,752 --> 00:04:22,024
- Same 'cause it's still half.

104
00:04:22,024 --> 00:04:25,487
- Okay, so let me ask you this:

105
00:04:26,857 --> 00:04:27,957
I'm hearing a couple things,

106
00:04:27,957 --> 00:04:29,662
and it's kind of contradicting itself.

107
00:04:29,662 --> 00:04:31,064
Meaning you're saying one thing,

108
00:04:31,064 --> 00:04:33,884
but you're also saying the opposite.

109
00:04:33,884 --> 00:04:37,603
Like I heard it's the same
because it's one-half,

110
00:04:37,603 --> 00:04:41,717
but it's different because it's ..

111
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,154
- Different sizes?

112
00:04:43,154 --> 00:04:44,828
- different sizes.

113
00:04:44,848 --> 00:04:46,343
You just told me it's the same,

114
00:04:46,343 --> 00:04:49,878
but now you're telling
me it's different sizes.

115
00:04:49,878 --> 00:04:53,115
[Background Chatter]

116
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:57,193
- They are both fattening!
- Oh, cookies and pizza

117
00:04:57,193 --> 00:04:58,675
are both fattening? Okay.

118
00:04:58,675 --> 00:04:59,835
Felice.

119
00:04:59,835 --> 00:05:02,766
- Why I think they're
still the same is because

120
00:05:02,766 --> 00:05:04,757
a half is a half no matter

121
00:05:04,757 --> 00:05:07,473
whether it's big or small

122
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,548
because it's still chopped in half.

123
00:05:09,548 --> 00:05:13,812
- Okay. So if a half of a half,

124
00:05:13,812 --> 00:05:17,407
so would you rather have half of $10,

125
00:05:17,407 --> 00:05:19,663
or half of $100?

126
00:05:19,663 --> 00:05:20,403
- Half of a $100!

127
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,403
- Why?

128
00:05:21,403 --> 00:05:22,763
- Because it's bigger!

129
00:05:22,763 --> 00:05:23,745
- Because it's bigger.

130
00:05:23,745 --> 00:05:25,129
But I thought it was the same?

131
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:27,139
- No.

132
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:29,008
- No, 'cause it's the same thing.

133
00:05:29,008 --> 00:05:32,514
- It's still half,
but you're commenting,

134
00:05:32,514 --> 00:05:34,050
half of a hundred ...

135
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,714
- It has to be the same thing.

136
00:05:36,714 --> 00:05:40,175
Like the pizza, a whole
pizza, and you cut it in half.

137
00:05:40,175 --> 00:05:43,526
- Okay, you say
it has to be the same thing

138
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:45,473
for what to happen?

139
00:05:45,473 --> 00:05:47,430
- For it to be half.

140
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,529
- For it to be half.

141
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:50,586
But here, it's not the same thing.

142
00:05:50,586 --> 00:05:53,227
You're saying to me that it is equal.

143
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,035
So which is it?

144
00:05:55,035 --> 00:05:57,886
[Background Chatter]

145
00:06:02,206 --> 00:06:03,223
- So now you're saying

146
00:06:03,223 --> 00:06:04,259
you don't think they're the same.

147
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:06,609
- No. You get more
pieces than a cookie.

148
00:06:06,609 --> 00:06:07,979
- They're still the same.

149
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:10,029
- They're still half.
- Okay, so who still agrees that

150
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:12,379
the one-half equals one-half?

151
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:14,838
Raise your hand. Okay.

152
00:06:14,838 --> 00:06:18,562
Alright now, who says that one-half

153
00:06:18,562 --> 00:06:22,408
maybe, sometimes doesn't equal one-half?

154
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:25,145
Okay. So we got a couple.

155
00:06:25,145 --> 00:06:27,209
Alright. So, Delphina,
what's your thinking?

156
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:28,290
I haven't heard from you.

157
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,479
What's your thinking?

158
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,029
- I think it depends on
what you are looking at.

159
00:06:36,848 --> 00:06:38,940
- So, in case you didn't hear her,

160
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,419
Delphina said it depends, okay.

161
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:42,435
Hear what she said?

162
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,406
It depends on what you're looking at.

163
00:06:44,406 --> 00:06:46,234
'Cause she said with the money example,

164
00:06:46,234 --> 00:06:49,688
that you guys, well
all of you unanimously,

165
00:06:49,688 --> 00:06:54,219
chose half of a hundred, that's $50,

166
00:06:54,219 --> 00:06:58,038
as opposed to $5, half of $10.

167
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:01,532
So it does matter.

168
00:07:01,532 --> 00:07:02,894
So now we just go back to the question,

169
00:07:02,894 --> 00:07:04,844
does one-half equal one-half?

170
00:07:04,844 --> 00:07:05,921
Okay, Raul?

171
00:07:05,921 --> 00:07:10,168
- I think one-half equals one-half.

172
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:11,487
I think it's still the same.

173
00:07:11,487 --> 00:07:13,479
It's not talking about how big it is,

174
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:17,421
it's just talking about a half.

175
00:07:17,421 --> 00:07:20,340
- But it didn't say
in the question what it was.

176
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:24,368
I think the question is
supposed to say what it was

177
00:07:24,368 --> 00:07:28,168
[inaudible] to say if
it's the same or not.

178
00:07:28,168 --> 00:07:30,119
- Okay, so
what Dallas is saying,

179
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:32,516
what Dallas is saying,
that it needs to tell you

180
00:07:32,516 --> 00:07:34,298
what one-half is.

181
00:07:34,298 --> 00:07:35,644
'Cause she's saying here,

182
00:07:35,644 --> 00:07:37,696
the previous question
just had the number,

183
00:07:37,696 --> 00:07:41,858
one over two, one over two. Equal.

184
00:07:41,858 --> 00:07:44,401
Alright, here, she's
saying well all of a sudden

185
00:07:44,401 --> 00:07:46,331
yeah, the numbers are gone, but you have

186
00:07:46,331 --> 00:07:49,013
half of a pizza and a half of a cookie.

187
00:07:49,013 --> 00:07:50,566
So now it's not the same.

188
00:07:50,566 --> 00:07:52,676
- But it's the same question.

189
00:07:52,676 --> 00:07:53,684
What Dallas is saying,

190
00:07:53,684 --> 00:07:56,008
in the question it should tell you

191
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:57,425
what is it.

192
00:07:57,425 --> 00:08:00,964
- It's actually like 10 fives ...

193
00:08:03,804 --> 00:08:06,365
five-tenths and and one-half.

194
00:08:06,365 --> 00:08:08,173
- So what do you think?

195
00:08:08,173 --> 00:08:10,853
What's your final thought
as far as one-half

196
00:08:10,853 --> 00:08:12,053
equals one-half?

197
00:08:12,053 --> 00:08:13,496
What's your final thought?

198
00:08:13,496 --> 00:08:14,878
- They're still
the same, it's a half.

199
00:08:14,878 --> 00:08:16,237
- It's still the same ...

200
00:08:16,237 --> 00:08:17,365
- because it's half.

201
00:08:17,365 --> 00:08:18,318
- Okay.

202
00:08:18,318 --> 00:08:20,805
- It's the same and different.

203
00:08:20,805 --> 00:08:22,798
- It's the same and different.

204
00:08:22,798 --> 00:08:24,335
Miguel.

205
00:08:24,335 --> 00:08:29,014
- [inaudible] and
they tell you it's different.

206
00:08:30,683 --> 00:08:32,926
- Okay, so, good question.

207
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:35,242
Good question.

208
00:08:35,242 --> 00:08:37,103
I like the look of that.

209
00:08:37,103 --> 00:08:37,834
Yes.

210
00:08:37,834 --> 00:08:40,477
- If they are, are they the same?

211
00:08:40,477 --> 00:08:44,105
They're the same, it's
one-half or something.

212
00:08:44,105 --> 00:08:45,961
One is bigger than the other one.

213
00:08:45,961 --> 00:08:47,322
- Okay. Rodrigo.

214
00:08:47,322 --> 00:08:48,908
What about you, bud?

215
00:08:48,908 --> 00:08:51,548
What's your thoughts on this?

216
00:08:51,548 --> 00:08:53,723
- I'm still thinking.

217
00:08:53,723 --> 00:08:54,637
- You're still thinking?

218
00:08:54,637 --> 00:08:56,872
Or are you still, will you compete?

219
00:08:56,872 --> 00:08:59,964
- I'm still basically undecided.

220
00:09:03,425 --> 00:09:05,404
- Okay.  You think they're
basically the same?

221
00:09:05,404 --> 00:09:06,848
So, you added that 'basically'.

222
00:09:06,848 --> 00:09:08,534
Why don't you just put they're the same?

223
00:09:08,534 --> 00:09:10,903
Why did you put 'basically'?

224
00:09:10,903 --> 00:09:12,821
- Because one's bigger than the other.

225
00:09:12,821 --> 00:09:16,163
- It will obviously still be different.

226
00:09:18,043 --> 00:09:19,314
Where we're going with this is,

227
00:09:19,314 --> 00:09:20,517
you have to understand that

228
00:09:20,517 --> 00:09:22,674
it depends on what your unit is.

229
00:09:22,674 --> 00:09:24,097
Your whole unit.

230
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:26,067
Okay? Alright?

231
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:29,165
So that's why sometimes
you have to be careful,

232
00:09:29,165 --> 00:09:32,115
what it's asking you to do. Okay?

233
00:09:32,115 --> 00:09:35,044
Let's go on to the next one.

234
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,066
Okay, so what does
one-half look like to you?

235
00:09:40,066 --> 00:09:42,118
So just think right now in your head,

236
00:09:42,118 --> 00:09:45,958
when you think of one-half, okay?

237
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:46,712
What do you see?

238
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:47,905
- Half a dollar.

239
00:09:47,905 --> 00:09:49,250
- Half of a dollar.

240
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,252
- Half a fifty.

241
00:09:50,252 --> 00:09:51,942
- Half a fifty.

242
00:09:51,942 --> 00:09:53,515
- Half a gallon of juice.

243
00:09:53,515 --> 00:09:54,897
- Half a gallon of juice.

244
00:09:54,897 --> 00:09:56,056
- Half a body.

245
00:09:56,056 --> 00:09:57,922
- Half of a body.

246
00:09:57,922 --> 00:09:59,050
Half of a cake.

247
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,300
- Half of a cake.

248
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,922
Okay, Guadalupe, what do you see?

249
00:10:08,162 --> 00:10:09,260
- Half a paper.

250
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,338
- Half a paper, okay.

251
00:10:10,338 --> 00:10:12,960
So let me take it to the next step.

252
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,532
So what if we said the half a paper

253
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,140
times

254
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,705
half of a juice.

255
00:10:19,705 --> 00:10:20,600
Does it make sense?

256
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,941
- No.

257
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:27,508
- Does it make sense?

258
00:10:27,508 --> 00:10:28,400
- No!

259
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,741
- It doesn't make sense.

260
00:10:29,741 --> 00:10:34,008
So we have to make sure that we know what?

261
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,976
- You have to make sense.

262
00:10:37,286 --> 00:10:38,378
- Well, it makes sense,

263
00:10:38,378 --> 00:10:39,372
but how is it gonna make sense?

264
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:40,245
It's what?

265
00:10:40,245 --> 00:10:41,824
- If they're the same.

266
00:10:41,824 --> 00:10:42,904
- If they're the same.

267
00:10:42,904 --> 00:10:44,024
But what's the same?

268
00:10:44,024 --> 00:10:45,385
- The object!

269
00:10:45,385 --> 00:10:46,991
- The object, or the whole unit, right?

270
00:10:46,991 --> 00:10:48,372
Like, what is it we're talking about?

271
00:10:48,372 --> 00:10:49,348
We talking about pizza?

272
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:51,400
We talking about cookies?
- Paper.

273
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,473
- Paper. Juice.

274
00:10:53,473 --> 00:10:54,531
- People.

275
00:10:54,531 --> 00:10:56,033
- People.

276
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:57,304
- Eggs.

277
00:10:59,144 --> 00:11:01,534
- Alright, so the other thing

278
00:11:01,534 --> 00:11:03,587
I wanna talk to you about is,

279
00:11:03,587 --> 00:11:07,588
does multiplication
always make things larger?

280
00:11:07,588 --> 00:11:08,299
Bigger?

281
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:11,577
- Yes!
- No!

282
00:11:13,136 --> 00:11:15,573
- So I heard yes, yes, yes
and then ...

283
00:11:15,573 --> 00:11:17,179
- No.

284
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:21,242
- So now then, what?

285
00:11:21,242 --> 00:11:24,546
- 'Cause sometimes it makes it smaller.

286
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:29,503
If you do nine times
one, it's gonna be nine

287
00:11:29,503 --> 00:11:32,691
and if you do nine times
zero, it makes it zero.

288
00:11:36,591 --> 00:11:38,695
- Jessie.

289
00:11:38,695 --> 00:11:39,700
Did you hear her example?

290
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,081
- No.

291
00:11:41,081 --> 00:11:42,809
- Okay, so what she said was,

292
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:43,844
'cause it's important.

293
00:11:43,844 --> 00:11:45,022
I want you to make sure you understood.

294
00:11:45,022 --> 00:11:47,278
She said that no, because
nine times one is nine.

295
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:49,817
Then when you go nine
times zero, it's zero.

296
00:11:49,817 --> 00:11:53,374
So it actually made it less, right?

297
00:11:55,954 --> 00:12:00,017
What do you think though?

298
00:12:00,017 --> 00:12:01,459
When you multiply in general,

299
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:02,354
when you multiply,

300
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:03,979
does it make things larger?

301
00:12:03,979 --> 00:12:05,503
When you multiply two things together?

302
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,965
- Yes.

303
00:12:06,965 --> 00:12:08,693
- Okay. Abraham

304
00:12:08,693 --> 00:12:12,056
- It gets bigger, because like
six times two,

305
00:12:12,056 --> 00:12:16,237
it's 12, and it gets bigger.

306
00:12:16,514 --> 00:12:18,323
- Okay.  Raul, what do you think?

307
00:12:18,323 --> 00:12:19,603
Raul V.

308
00:12:21,113 --> 00:12:24,926
When you multiply, does
it always get bigger?

309
00:12:24,926 --> 00:12:27,425
- It depends on the number.

310
00:12:27,425 --> 00:12:28,640
- What?

311
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,850
- It depends on the number.

312
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,120
- It depends on the number

313
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,909
so give me an example.

314
00:12:34,738 --> 00:12:39,072
- Zero times 8100,

315
00:12:39,072 --> 00:12:40,042
is gonna be zero.

316
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:41,991
- Okay. So can we ...

317
00:12:41,991 --> 00:12:43,557
so I'm hearing kind of like,

318
00:12:43,557 --> 00:12:46,970
a lot of you are saying
yes, it makes it larger.

319
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,534
But there's still like

320
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,764
some of you who are like saying

321
00:12:51,764 --> 00:12:53,512
maybe not always.

322
00:12:53,512 --> 00:12:56,030
Like if we go back to,

323
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,754
if we go back to that one-half,

324
00:12:58,754 --> 00:13:02,431
if we go back to that
one-half and that dollar.

325
00:13:02,431 --> 00:13:07,220
Gino, what's 100 times one-half?

326
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,178
- Times one-half is ...

327
00:13:11,414 --> 00:13:12,847
a hundred and a half?

328
00:13:12,847 --> 00:13:16,923
- A hundred and a half?

329
00:13:19,213 --> 00:13:23,194
- 50?
- 50.

330
00:13:27,434 --> 00:13:28,684
I got 150.

331
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:31,259
- 150?

332
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:32,378
Taylor, do you agree?

333
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:36,894
One hundred times one-half is 150?

334
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,958
Raul B.

335
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:40,816
- 500?

336
00:13:40,816 --> 00:13:41,919
- Five hundred?

337
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,561
How'd you get five hundred?

338
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:45,415
- I thought it was half of a thousand.

339
00:13:45,415 --> 00:13:46,552
- A hundred though.

340
00:13:46,552 --> 00:13:47,693
No more thousand, one hundred.

341
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:50,582
One hundred times one-half.

342
00:13:50,582 --> 00:13:52,573
- Is it 110?

343
00:13:52,573 --> 00:13:54,299
Half of 10 is five.

344
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:57,110
[Background Chatter]

345
00:13:58,342 --> 00:14:00,869
Half of 10 is five.

346
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:02,996
- So what is your answer?

347
00:14:02,996 --> 00:14:04,585
The one hundred times one-half?

348
00:14:04,585 --> 00:14:05,665
- Five hundred.

349
00:14:05,665 --> 00:14:07,902
- Five hundred?

350
00:14:07,902 --> 00:14:11,758
Okay, so one hundred times
one-half is five hundred?

351
00:14:12,675 --> 00:14:13,520
Tina?

352
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,861
- We don't know
because we don't know

353
00:14:15,861 --> 00:14:17,345
what one-half equals.

354
00:14:17,345 --> 00:14:20,164
- Okay, so Tina's saying now,

355
00:14:20,164 --> 00:14:22,232
you don't know what the one-half is.

356
00:14:22,232 --> 00:14:24,813
What if we're just talking about numbers?

357
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:28,840
One hundred times one-half,
what would that be?

358
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,716
One hundred times one-half.

359
00:14:30,716 --> 00:14:33,375
[Background Chatter]

360
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:34,218
Let's say it's money.

361
00:14:34,218 --> 00:14:36,658
A hundred dollars times one-half.

362
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:39,187
[Background Chatter]

363
00:14:39,187 --> 00:14:41,273
- It could be five or 50.

364
00:14:41,273 --> 00:14:43,671
If we're talking about $100,

365
00:14:43,671 --> 00:14:47,344
then it's gonna be one-half of $100
is 35.

366
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,853
- Okay, so,
- 45.

367
00:14:50,233 --> 00:14:50,964
there was a lot of people talking,

368
00:14:50,964 --> 00:14:53,405
so you couldn't hear, but Louis is saying

369
00:14:53,405 --> 00:14:55,272
it depends, but if you're
talking about money,

370
00:14:55,272 --> 00:14:57,852
if it was hundred dollars times one-half,

371
00:14:57,852 --> 00:15:01,923
it'd be half of $100, which is $50.

372
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:04,719
Let's take that example.

373
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:07,075
One hundred times one-half

374
00:15:07,075 --> 00:15:08,376
is 50.

375
00:15:08,376 --> 00:15:10,184
So then when we multiply that,

376
00:15:10,184 --> 00:15:11,769
did it get larger?

377
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:13,624
- No.
- Yeah.

378
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:15,751
- It got smaller.

379
00:15:15,751 --> 00:15:16,747
Didn't it?

380
00:15:16,747 --> 00:15:18,453
You start with a hundred,

381
00:15:18,453 --> 00:15:21,216
and you multiply and you got 50,

382
00:15:21,216 --> 00:15:22,495
which is less.

383
00:15:22,495 --> 00:15:24,081
So what do you think now?

384
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:26,376
Do you think it always
makes things bigger?

385
00:15:26,376 --> 00:15:27,819
- No.

386
00:15:27,819 --> 00:15:29,953
- Sometimes it makes it smaller.

387
00:15:29,953 --> 00:15:32,431
- So, let's ...

388
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,036
can you give me another example then?

389
00:15:34,036 --> 00:15:36,677
That's just ... make sure we prove it.

390
00:15:36,677 --> 00:15:38,059
Is there another example you can give me

391
00:15:38,059 --> 00:15:40,862
that makes it smaller then?

392
00:15:42,082 --> 00:15:44,236
- Like five times four?

393
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:45,272
- Five times four?

394
00:15:45,272 --> 00:15:46,775
We start with five times four,

395
00:15:46,775 --> 00:15:47,668
you get what?

396
00:15:47,668 --> 00:15:50,880
- 20. It's a bigger number.

397
00:15:52,362 --> 00:15:53,573
- Okay, so that's if you multiply it

398
00:15:53,573 --> 00:15:55,085
times a half, right?

399
00:15:57,105 --> 00:15:59,940
- Ten times one-half?

400
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,728
- Ten times one-half would be?

401
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:03,262
- Five.

402
00:16:04,712 --> 00:16:07,584
- Raise your hand if you think

403
00:16:07,584 --> 00:16:10,282
it doesn't always make it bigger.

404
00:16:10,282 --> 00:16:12,903
It depends on what you multiply it by.

405
00:16:12,903 --> 00:16:15,855
Alright. Very good.

406
00:16:16,092 --> 00:16:19,018
So, we're gonna use the area model

407
00:16:19,018 --> 00:16:21,476
to show one-half times one-half.

408
00:16:21,476 --> 00:16:23,589
- That's a whole.

409
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:25,519
- One-half times one-half

410
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,888
Abraham says it's a whole,
but let's go ahead and ...

411
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:30,842
let's take a look.

412
00:16:30,842 --> 00:16:33,735
I'm gonna go ahead and
shade in one-half, okay.

413
00:16:33,735 --> 00:16:37,805
And then we'll take a look to see

414
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:40,656
what it actually equals.

415
00:16:40,656 --> 00:16:43,814
Here's a half.

416
00:16:44,763 --> 00:16:47,186
There's a half.

417
00:16:59,178 --> 00:17:02,846
How many squares are
shaded both colors?

418
00:17:02,846 --> 00:17:04,222
- One.
- Two.

419
00:17:04,222 --> 00:17:06,197
- One out of how many total?

420
00:17:06,197 --> 00:17:07,863
- Four.

421
00:17:07,863 --> 00:17:09,082
- One-fourth.

422
00:17:09,082 --> 00:17:12,637
So, one-half times one-half is one-fourth.

423
00:17:12,637 --> 00:17:15,360
Is one fourth smaller than one-half?

424
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,904
- Yes.

425
00:17:16,904 --> 00:17:20,094
- That's another proof
that when you multiply,

426
00:17:20,094 --> 00:17:22,389
it doesn't always get bigger.

427
00:17:22,389 --> 00:17:24,576
- You could make it into money.

428
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:28,134
Like one-fourth is 25 cents.

429
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:33,359
- Alright, very good.
- A hundred divided by...

430
00:17:34,366 --> 00:17:37,332
- So, let's take a look
at another example.

431
00:17:51,902 --> 00:17:54,616
If we're to use an area models for this,

432
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:58,561
what would that look like?
- Three-fourth.

433
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:09,687
It'd be one-half, right?

434
00:18:09,687 --> 00:18:12,924
We'd see one-half times one-fourth.

435
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,956
So what do you think?

436
00:18:17,956 --> 00:18:21,187
- Half of a fourth? One-eighth?

437
00:18:21,187 --> 00:18:23,097
- Half of a fourth,

438
00:18:23,097 --> 00:18:24,885
which is one eighth, he said.

439
00:18:24,885 --> 00:18:27,000
One-half of one-fourth is
one-eighth, do you agree?

439
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,300
- Yeah.
- Okay.
