1
00:00:00,879 --> 00:00:02,174
- It's probably three.

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,229
Because five to the third is 125.

3
00:00:05,229 --> 00:00:07,638
- [Voiceover] Alright,
so let's test that out.

4
00:00:08,828 --> 00:00:10,246
- Can I use my calculator?

5
00:00:10,246 --> 00:00:12,720
- [Voiceover] You can have
your guy test it out here.

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,799
- Oh.

7
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,446
- The other thing to work on
is the pronunciation of this.

8
00:00:16,446 --> 00:00:18,199
This is something that is unusual

9
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:20,279
because it's got that subscript.

10
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,297
Read that first line up at the top

11
00:00:22,297 --> 00:00:24,950
where it says "pronouncing
logarithmic equations".

12
00:00:26,595 --> 00:00:29,031
- Log base b of x equals y.

13
00:00:29,031 --> 00:00:31,748
- Yeah, so can you
transfer that pronunciation

14
00:00:31,748 --> 00:00:34,453
to, for example, the one in example six?

15
00:00:34,453 --> 00:00:36,947
How would you say that out loud?

16
00:00:36,949 --> 00:00:41,248
- Log base two of eight

17
00:00:41,248 --> 00:00:43,954
equals...

18
00:00:43,954 --> 00:00:45,149
- [Male Student] It's three.

19
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:45,918
- [Male Instructor] Equals three.

20
00:00:45,918 --> 00:00:47,431
So, that's how we say
these things out loud.

21
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:48,731
Log base two of eight.

22
00:00:48,731 --> 00:00:51,111
The little number, this
subscript, is the base.

23
00:00:51,111 --> 00:00:52,603
Keep going, you guys are doing fantastic.

24
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:56,852
- [Instructor] Speak up.

25
00:00:57,089 --> 00:00:58,802
- The log of 10,000 is four.

26
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,984
Forgot, I don't have a pencil.

27
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:04,642
- [Male Instructor] You're off. No pencil.

28
00:01:10,116 --> 00:01:12,345
- In number nine, is it one?

29
00:01:12,345 --> 00:01:13,762
- For number nine?
- [Voicever] Yeah.

30
00:01:14,862 --> 00:01:18,690
- When the log, when
the base is equal to X.

31
00:01:19,858 --> 00:01:22,295
- [Male Student White
Shirt] When B is equal to X

32
00:01:22,295 --> 00:01:24,454
it will be one.

33
00:01:25,284 --> 00:01:28,354
- [Male Student Green Shirt]
So would 10 be negative one?

34
00:01:30,136 --> 00:01:32,929
- Uh, 10, yeah negative one.

35
00:01:33,665 --> 00:01:35,436
- [Male Student Green Shirt]
Oh, I think I get it now.

36
00:01:35,464 --> 00:01:36,997
- And then 11 would be...

37
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:38,379
- [Male Student Green
Shirt] Negative three.

38
00:01:38,379 --> 00:01:39,987
- Negative three yeah.

39
00:01:40,596 --> 00:01:42,913
It's like the power
stable thing, you know?

40
00:01:43,115 --> 00:01:43,661
- [Male Student Green Shirt]: Yeah.

41
00:01:43,661 --> 00:01:45,518
- It's like four to the y

42
00:01:45,518 --> 00:01:47,143
would be equal to this?

43
00:01:47,143 --> 00:01:47,921
- [Male Student White Shirt]: Yeah.

44
00:01:47,921 --> 00:01:49,222
- [Male Student Green
Shirt]: So, 12 and 13

45
00:01:49,222 --> 00:01:51,555
would be zero?

46
00:01:51,555 --> 00:01:53,034
- Let's see.

47
00:01:53,034 --> 00:01:54,231
- Yeah.

48
00:01:55,471 --> 00:01:56,750
- Yep.

49
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,750
- [Voiceover] : Okay.

50
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,576
- Pretty easy.

51
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:03,491
- Yeah and...

52
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:06,507
- [Male Voiceover] : What's 14?

53
00:02:06,507 --> 00:02:07,817
- 14 is one-half.

54
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:10,576
- [Voiceover] : So again
what you're saying is...

55
00:02:10,576 --> 00:02:12,923
- If it's a fraction or if like,

56
00:02:12,923 --> 00:02:14,426
like for 14,

57
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,066
49 is bigger than like seven.

58
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:16,944
- [Voiceover] : Yeah.

59
00:02:16,944 --> 00:02:18,965
It'd be a fraction.

60
00:02:18,965 --> 00:02:20,618
So 14 came out a fraction

61
00:02:20,618 --> 00:02:21,948
or a decimal of half.

62
00:02:22,023 --> 00:02:23,295
- [Female voiceover]: Yeah.

63
00:02:24,681 --> 00:02:27,502
- So that, what about that one

64
00:02:27,502 --> 00:02:29,081
made you think it's going to

65
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:30,323
come out a fraction

66
00:02:30,323 --> 00:02:32,048
versus the other ones that were all integers?

67
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:37,099
- The other ones were integers because

68
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:40,745
in the log, the little exponent there

69
00:02:40,745 --> 00:02:41,813
- Mmhm.

70
00:02:41,813 --> 00:02:43,590
- is less than the actual number.

71
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,352
- Okay, let's work on the pronunciation

72
00:02:46,352 --> 00:02:47,722
because this is something that's brand new

73
00:02:47,722 --> 00:02:49,185
as far as how to say this thing out loud.

74
00:02:49,185 --> 00:02:50,369
Let's go back up to the top,

75
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:52,888
where it says "read this out loud".

76
00:02:52,888 --> 00:02:53,806
So, Matt, I'll have you...

77
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:55,384
Are you the, what is your role here?

78
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:56,627
- We're professors here.

79
00:02:56,627 --> 00:02:57,752
- Oh, so that's a good role for you.

80
00:02:57,752 --> 00:02:59,622
So, why don't you speak that out loud.

81
00:02:59,622 --> 00:03:01,862
- Log base root of x equals y.

82
00:03:01,862 --> 00:03:03,801
- Yeah, now I want you to say

83
00:03:03,801 --> 00:03:06,974
the first example out loud.

84
00:03:06,974 --> 00:03:10,069
- Log base of, log base five

85
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:12,043
of 25 equals 2.

86
00:03:12,043 --> 00:03:13,927
- Yeah, so it's hard to pronounce it.

87
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:14,693
- Yeah.

88
00:03:14,693 --> 00:03:17,242
- But the little number, that's down

89
00:03:17,242 --> 00:03:18,620
is what?

90
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,839
- Uh, base.

91
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:21,314
- Yeah, so it's the base.

92
00:03:21,314 --> 00:03:22,138
So when we say it,

93
00:03:22,138 --> 00:03:23,902
we're gonna say base little number,

94
00:03:23,902 --> 00:03:24,854
whatever it is.

95
00:03:24,854 --> 00:03:27,254
Alright, so now say what
you were saying before,

96
00:03:27,254 --> 00:03:29,821
either of you guys.

97
00:03:29,821 --> 00:03:32,781
You told me why it comes out a fraction.

98
00:03:32,781 --> 00:03:35,044
How will you recognize it comes out

99
00:03:35,044 --> 00:03:37,377
a negative number?

100
00:03:37,386 --> 00:03:41,383
- When the y, or when the x is

101
00:03:41,383 --> 00:03:45,194
a fraction, and the log base is

102
00:03:45,194 --> 00:03:47,404
a whole number.

103
00:03:47,404 --> 00:03:48,403
- Okay, yeah, so like,

104
00:03:48,403 --> 00:03:50,398
which examples do that?

105
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:51,509
- Ten and eleven.

106
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:53,167
- Alright, that's good.

107
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:54,597
How, will you recognize if it

108
00:03:54,597 --> 00:03:56,296
comes out as zero?

109
00:03:56,296 --> 00:03:58,470
See any patterns for the ones that log?

110
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,219
- If the x is a 1.

111
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:03,148
- [Instructor] : Alright, yeah.

112
00:04:03,148 --> 00:04:04,891
Why does that make sense?

113
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:05,758
Have you figured it out?

114
00:04:05,758 --> 00:04:07,139
- [Female voiceover]: Like, any number

115
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:10,091
to the power of 1 is itself,

116
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:12,601
or no, it's zero.

117
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:15,221
Or I mean, not any number to the power

118
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:16,301
of zero is one.

119
00:04:16,301 --> 00:04:18,044
- [Male Voiceover] : Exactly. Alright,

120
00:04:18,044 --> 00:04:19,483
you're very, you're getting right to

121
00:04:19,483 --> 00:04:22,031
the idea of what a log is.

122
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:22,955
How will you recognize the ones

123
00:04:22,955 --> 00:04:26,067
that will come out one,
without calculating?

124
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:29,403
- X equals the base.

125
00:04:29,423 --> 00:04:31,509
- [Male voiceover] : Okay, well said.

126
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:32,404
Why does that make sense

127
00:04:32,404 --> 00:04:34,289
in terms of exponents?

128
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:37,973
- 'Cause if you divide
itself, it'll equal one.

129
00:04:37,973 --> 00:04:39,084
- [Male voiceover] : Can
you give me an example

130
00:04:39,084 --> 00:04:40,303
of an exponential equation

131
00:04:40,303 --> 00:04:42,713
that might look like this one?

132
00:04:42,713 --> 00:04:43,551
Because that's the next thing

133
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:45,138
we're going to try to do...

134
00:04:45,138 --> 00:04:46,017
- Seven to the fifth power.

135
00:04:46,017 --> 00:04:49,442
- Seven to the one equals seven.

136
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:52,153
Good, having done all of this,

137
00:04:52,153 --> 00:04:53,848
can you say what a log is in one word?

138
00:04:53,848 --> 00:04:56,647
- A single word.

139
00:04:56,647 --> 00:04:57,437
- It's like the power of...

140
00:04:57,437 --> 00:04:59,758
- [Male Voiceover] :
Mmhm, it's the exponent.

141
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:00,325
- Yeah.

142
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:02,578
- [Male Voiceover] : Good,
a log is an exponent.

143
00:05:02,578 --> 00:05:05,071
Now, what I'd like you to do is

144
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,361
try to do the bottom ones

145
00:05:06,361 --> 00:05:08,079
based on what your understanding

146
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,774
of log is, yeah.

147
00:05:09,774 --> 00:05:11,678
- [Male student voiceover]:
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh...

148
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:19,601
- It would be.

149
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:23,081
- Don't stop.

150
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:25,744
- So it's gotta be two.

151
00:05:25,744 --> 00:05:28,017
Take the,

152
00:05:28,017 --> 00:05:30,291
so the first one would be 32

153
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,268
because

154
00:05:32,268 --> 00:05:34,409
basically the base

155
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:36,141
is the actual number

156
00:05:36,141 --> 00:05:38,916
and the answer to the logarithm

157
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:41,214
is the actual number.

158
00:05:41,214 --> 00:05:44,012
- [Male Student Voiceover]:
So right to the there...

159
00:05:44,015 --> 00:05:45,611
- Yeah, so 32.

160
00:05:52,298 --> 00:05:54,074
- Something with...

161
00:05:54,074 --> 00:05:55,618
- [Male Voiceover] :
Something to the fourth...

162
00:05:55,618 --> 00:05:58,051
- Yeah.

163
00:05:58,051 --> 00:05:59,939
- Maybe five, five to the fourth.

164
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:01,366
- [Female voiceover]: Five, to the...

165
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:03,583
- Execuse you.

166
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:06,350
- So 59 is...

167
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,683
- [Female Voiceover]: One, 52 equals one.

168
00:06:08,683 --> 00:06:10,634
- So it'd be 59.

169
00:06:10,634 --> 00:06:13,200
- Yeah.

170
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,746
- 18 would be...

171
00:06:19,076 --> 00:06:20,005
- [Male Voiceover] : Just three.

172
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:23,232
- [Female Voiceover]: Is it a thousand?

173
00:06:23,232 --> 00:06:25,167
- Yeah, a thousand.

174
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:28,662
You put ten thousand.

175
00:06:28,662 --> 00:06:30,100
- [Female Voiceover]: I have a question.

176
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,118
- Yeah.

177
00:06:31,118 --> 00:06:32,174
- For this one, what's the,

178
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:34,900
for this one, what's the log?

179
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,324
No, well, yeah, I don't know.

180
00:06:37,324 --> 00:06:38,914
- [Male Voiceover] : The log of what?

181
00:06:38,914 --> 00:06:40,512
- [Instructor] : I think
I understand your question,

182
00:06:40,512 --> 00:06:42,194
but you first have to

183
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:43,832
figure out the way to read these things.

184
00:06:43,832 --> 00:06:46,664
Read that part, that first,

185
00:06:46,664 --> 00:06:48,169
because the pronunciation is challenging

186
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:48,871
at first.

187
00:06:48,871 --> 00:06:52,076
- Log base b of x equals y.

188
00:06:52,076 --> 00:06:54,386
- [Instructor] : Alright,
so now read example...

189
00:06:54,386 --> 00:06:57,752
Well, we know example four is three.

190
00:06:57,752 --> 00:07:01,026
So, the log is three.

191
00:07:01,026 --> 00:07:02,717
So read example four out loud.

192
00:07:02,717 --> 00:07:06,669
- So log three of 27 equals three?

193
00:07:06,989 --> 00:07:08,305
- [Male Voiceover] :
Good, except I want you

194
00:07:08,305 --> 00:07:09,856
to say the word base in there.

195
00:07:10,113 --> 00:07:13,360
- Okay log base three of 27

196
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,539
equals three.

197
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:15,549
- [Instructor] : Perfect, so I think

198
00:07:15,549 --> 00:07:16,791
your question was about examples

199
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:17,497
seven and eight?

200
00:07:17,497 --> 00:07:19,621
- So, what's the base?

201
00:07:19,621 --> 00:07:20,418
- [Female Voiceover]: Wouldn't the base be

202
00:07:20,418 --> 00:07:21,887
one, it's just not there?

203
00:07:22,387 --> 00:07:24,463
- [Male Voiceover] : It's not there.

204
00:07:25,963 --> 00:07:28,647
Here's the question,

205
00:07:28,647 --> 00:07:31,875
the answers, the logs came out two

206
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:35,379
for number seven and
four for number eight.

207
00:07:37,168 --> 00:07:39,082
Go back to what you guys were saying about

208
00:07:39,082 --> 00:07:40,510
an exponential equation.

209
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,571
What's equivalent to that?

210
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:42,686
- [Male Voiceover] :
Oh, if it's not there,

211
00:07:42,686 --> 00:07:44,129
the base is ten.

212
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:44,727
- [Instructor] : Alright, so can you

213
00:07:44,727 --> 00:07:47,072
write the equivalent exponential equation

214
00:07:47,072 --> 00:07:48,797
for example seven?

215
00:07:49,615 --> 00:07:51,157
- Ten squared equals 100.

216
00:07:51,157 --> 00:07:52,258
- [Male Voiceover] :
Ten squared equals 100.

217
00:07:52,258 --> 00:07:54,363
Does it still work for that? Is that void?

218
00:07:54,363 --> 00:07:57,026
- Mmhm. Because it would
be ten to the fourth

219
00:07:57,026 --> 00:07:58,530
equals...

220
00:07:59,163 --> 00:08:00,137
- [Female Voiceover]: But
I thought he just said

221
00:08:00,137 --> 00:08:01,230
the base was one.

222
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,899
- Well, he said the base was one.

223
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,109
He thought it might be.

224
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:04,965
- Oh, it's not.

225
00:08:04,965 --> 00:08:06,579
- [Instructor] : It turns out it's ten.

226
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:07,178
- Okay.

227
00:08:07,178 --> 00:08:08,513
- [Instructor] : So the
base, if not written,

228
00:08:08,513 --> 00:08:09,396
is ten.

229
00:08:09,396 --> 00:08:11,108
I want you to check this two ways.

230
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,019
Who's our calculator person here?

231
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:14,517
Alright, so Brandon I want you just to

232
00:08:14,517 --> 00:08:16,960
type in the log, but just use this button.

233
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,831
It's next to the seven.

234
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:22,928
Just type in log of 100.

235
00:08:22,928 --> 00:08:25,674
So if he doesn't use any base,

236
00:08:25,674 --> 00:08:27,095
it comes out as two.

237
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,678
Now, try it with the log base,

238
00:08:29,678 --> 00:08:31,315
on the new operating system

239
00:08:31,315 --> 00:08:33,445
log base ten of 100.

240
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:44,147
- Log base ten of 100?

241
00:08:44,147 --> 00:08:44,826
- [Instructor] : Mmhm.

242
00:08:44,826 --> 00:08:45,982
See if that still works.

243
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:47,722
- Two.

244
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,034
- [Instructor] : It turns out,

245
00:08:50,034 --> 00:08:52,997
it's sort of optional. If there's no base

246
00:08:52,997 --> 00:08:55,437
what is the base?

247
00:08:57,807 --> 00:08:58,675
- Nothing.

248
00:08:58,675 --> 00:09:01,085
- No, it's a certain thing.

249
00:09:01,085 --> 00:09:02,543
So, if there's no base written,

250
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:03,449
like all of the other ones

251
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:04,453
had a base written...

252
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:05,534
- [Female Voiceover]: Okay.

253
00:09:05,534 --> 00:09:07,113
- [Male Voiceover] : If
there's no base written

254
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:09,212
it's saying

255
00:09:09,212 --> 00:09:12,288
what's the number

256
00:09:12,288 --> 00:09:15,545
to raise a certain base to, to get 100?

257
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:18,226
And this one came out two.

258
00:09:18,226 --> 00:09:19,921
So, what's the number,

259
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:21,407
that you can use as a base,

260
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:25,336
squared to get 100?

261
00:09:25,336 --> 00:09:25,963
- Ten.

262
00:09:25,963 --> 00:09:28,701
- [Instructor] : Yeah, so if there's

263
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:31,279
no base, the base applied is ten.

264
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,087
And it turns out, you can write it or not.

265
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,452
So, what I'd like you guys to do is

266
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,008
as you're working through these,

267
00:09:39,008 --> 00:09:41,051
also consider what would be

268
00:09:41,051 --> 00:09:44,544
an equivalent exponential equation

269
00:09:44,544 --> 00:09:46,421
for each of the ones that you're taught.

270
00:09:48,074 --> 00:09:49,277
- So just do all of the ones at the bottom

271
00:09:49,277 --> 00:09:50,219
and then go back and do it again.

272
00:09:50,219 --> 00:09:51,999
- [Instructor] Yeah, sure.

273
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:53,757
And the one's at the bottom,

274
00:09:53,757 --> 00:09:55,228
you can't just type into the calculator.

275
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:57,501
So you got to kind of
think a little bit about

276
00:09:57,501 --> 00:09:59,484
what would be the relationship there.

277
00:09:59,484 --> 00:10:00,211
- [Male Student Voiceover]: Then for like,

278
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:02,830
29 couldn't we put like
any number in there?

279
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,696
- That's a really good insight.

280
00:10:03,696 --> 00:10:05,351
How come that's the case?

281
00:10:05,351 --> 00:10:08,722
- Because anything to
the zero power is one.

282
00:10:08,722 --> 00:10:10,279
- [Instructor] : You got it. Yeah.

283
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,168
Except for one number.

284
00:10:11,168 --> 00:10:12,694
There's one number you can't put there.

285
00:10:12,694 --> 00:10:13,433
- Zero.

286
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:15,056
- [Instructor] : Yeah, good job.

287
00:10:15,056 --> 00:10:17,975
You got it, good job.

288
00:10:19,825 --> 00:10:20,969
- Thank you.

289
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:26,380
- 20 would be 81...

290
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,973
- I wasn't even close.

291
00:10:33,503 --> 00:10:36,717
- So, ten, alright so ten to the third

292
00:10:36,717 --> 00:10:37,826
would be 1000?

293
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,390
- [Male Voiceover] :
For 18, wouldn't it be

294
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,337
a thousand,

295
00:10:43,337 --> 00:10:47,043
supposed to be base, is implied to be ten.

296
00:10:47,043 --> 00:10:48,593
Ten to the third would be 1000.

297
00:10:53,016 --> 00:10:54,792
- I'm not sure.

298
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:58,968
- [Male Voiceover] : For 18.

299
00:10:58,968 --> 00:11:00,324
- [Male Voiceover] : I don't know.

300
00:11:00,324 --> 00:11:02,322
(chuckle)

301
00:11:02,322 --> 00:11:03,739
- [Male Voiceover] : Alright.

302
00:11:14,044 --> 00:11:15,291
- [Instructor] : Alright, say it again,

303
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,224
except this time include the word base.

304
00:11:17,648 --> 00:11:21,873
- Log base of, log base of eight.

305
00:11:23,273 --> 00:11:27,191
Wait, log base of eight

306
00:11:27,191 --> 00:11:28,695
equals zero?

307
00:11:28,695 --> 00:11:30,761
- [Instructor] : Close. Log base eight...

308
00:11:30,761 --> 00:11:32,888
- Log base eight of one equals zero.

309
00:11:32,888 --> 00:11:33,938
- [Instructor] That's it exactly, yeah.

310
00:11:33,938 --> 00:11:34,509
- Okay.

311
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:36,633
- [Instructor] : So we
say base, where's the base

312
00:11:36,633 --> 00:11:39,269
always on a log equation?

313
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:41,597
- [Female Voiceover]: Under the exponent.

314
00:11:41,597 --> 00:11:43,833
- [Instructor] : Yeah its
a subscript, it's down.

315
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,702
- A subscript...

316
00:11:45,702 --> 00:11:47,148
- [Instructor] : So I'd like you to

317
00:11:47,148 --> 00:11:50,560
pronounce number 12.

318
00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:54,454
- Log three of one equals zero.

319
00:11:54,454 --> 00:11:56,095
- [Instructor] : Close. I want you

320
00:11:56,095 --> 00:11:58,393
to get the word base in there.

321
00:11:58,393 --> 00:12:00,795
- Log base three of one equals zero.

322
00:12:00,795 --> 00:12:02,398
- [Instructor] : Yeah, and that way,

323
00:12:02,398 --> 00:12:04,151
if you're always saying what the base is,

324
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:05,717
when you create an equivalent

325
00:12:05,717 --> 00:12:07,448
exponential function,

326
00:12:07,448 --> 00:12:08,934
it's going to be a lot easier.

327
00:12:08,934 --> 00:12:10,792
So next to each one of these,

328
00:12:10,792 --> 00:12:12,196
let's do a few together.

329
00:12:12,196 --> 00:12:15,411
Let's do the top row, going one, six, 11.

330
00:12:15,411 --> 00:12:18,476
I want you to write an
exponential equation

331
00:12:18,476 --> 00:12:21,105
using 5, 25, and 2.

332
00:12:22,895 --> 00:12:25,610
- [Female Voiceover]: So it would just be,

333
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,191
five squared equals 25.

334
00:12:27,191 --> 00:12:28,851
- [Instructor] : Exactly.

335
00:12:28,851 --> 00:12:31,591
What's the base in that equation?

336
00:12:31,591 --> 00:12:32,758
- [Female Voiceover]: It's five.

337
00:12:32,758 --> 00:12:34,418
- Yeah.

338
00:12:37,738 --> 00:12:42,738
So, you did two cubed equals eight. Yeah.

339
00:12:44,045 --> 00:12:48,688
Yeah, so now you recognize,
you guys correctly

340
00:12:48,688 --> 00:12:52,007
identified that a log can be summarized as

341
00:12:52,007 --> 00:12:54,847
an exponent. Yeah, that's good.

342
00:12:54,847 --> 00:12:56,906
Each of these numbers is an exponent.

343
00:12:56,906 --> 00:12:57,927
What'd you notice about the ones

344
00:12:57,927 --> 00:12:59,193
that came up zero?

345
00:12:59,193 --> 00:13:01,411
Would you be able to recognize those

346
00:13:01,411 --> 00:13:04,052
and predict...

347
00:13:04,052 --> 00:13:05,752
- [Male Voiceover] :
Any number works for it.

348
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:06,994
Really.

349
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,543
- What do you mean any
number works for it?

350
00:13:08,543 --> 00:13:09,288
- For this one...

351
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,606
- Oh, I see for that last one.

352
00:13:10,606 --> 00:13:13,497
- You could put any number here other than zero.

353
00:13:13,497 --> 00:13:14,381
- [Instructor] : Yes.

354
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:15,496
- [Female Voiceover]: I thought it was one,

355
00:13:15,496 --> 00:13:17,710
but they had got it.

356
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,580
- [Instructor] : One
works, but so does two.

357
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,520
- [Male Voiceover] : So does, two, three,

358
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,333
four and five.

359
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,993
- [Instructor] : I'm wondering about the ones

360
00:13:24,993 --> 00:13:26,873
like 12 and 13.

361
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:30,031
How would you predict or
recognize in the future,

362
00:13:30,031 --> 00:13:32,573
that the log is going to be zero?

363
00:13:32,573 --> 00:13:34,373
- If it has a one for the...

364
00:13:34,373 --> 00:13:35,569
- [Male voiceover] : X

365
00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:37,576
- For the X, yeah.

366
00:13:37,576 --> 00:13:39,815
- [Instructor] : Mmhm, yep.

367
00:13:39,815 --> 00:13:41,883
I think there's a fancy mathy word,

368
00:13:41,883 --> 00:13:44,436
called a characteristic for that.

369
00:13:44,436 --> 00:13:46,369
But we don't use that word very often.

370
00:13:46,369 --> 00:13:47,900
But yeah, you could say the x

371
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,977
'cause that's how it showed up

372
00:13:48,977 --> 00:13:51,041
in our first equation. Sure.

373
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,434
How will you recognize that it's going to

374
00:13:52,434 --> 00:13:54,798
come out a negative number?

375
00:13:54,798 --> 00:13:56,154
- [Female Voiceover]: If
it has a fraction in it.

376
00:13:56,154 --> 00:13:57,160
- [Instructor] : Mmhm.

377
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,606
- As the X.

378
00:13:58,606 --> 00:14:00,677
- [Instructor] : Okay, well said, yeah.

379
00:14:00,677 --> 00:14:02,001
Why does that make sense in terms of

380
00:14:02,001 --> 00:14:04,672
what you know about exponents?

381
00:14:04,672 --> 00:14:07,377
- On the green chart,

382
00:14:07,377 --> 00:14:08,948
whatever is on the left side

383
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:09,672
and whatever's left...

384
00:14:09,672 --> 00:14:10,039
- [Instructor] : Yeah.

385
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,546
Our powers table.

386
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:13,051
You're talking about all of our

387
00:14:13,051 --> 00:14:15,849
fractions here. Yeah.

388
00:14:15,849 --> 00:14:17,381
How about the ones that came out

389
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:21,040
with one as the log. The log was one.

390
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,490
- [Female Voiceover]:
They have the same base

391
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,899
and the same x value.

392
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,854
- And what about this one?

393
00:14:30,854 --> 00:14:32,079
This is a fraction, so...

394
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,879
- [Intructor] : Yeah, how come it had

395
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:36,011
a negative log?

396
00:14:36,011 --> 00:14:39,762
- Well, I know it's because it's a fraction.

397
00:14:39,762 --> 00:14:40,263
- [Instructor] : Can you write an

398
00:14:40,263 --> 00:14:43,790
equivalent exponential equation?

399
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:50,918
- Two to the, no, two to the negative one

400
00:14:50,918 --> 00:14:51,524
- [Instructor] : Mmhm.

401
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:54,444
- equals, it doesn't equal this right?

402
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:55,398
- [Instructor] : Actually it does.

403
00:14:55,398 --> 00:14:58,614
Two to the negative one, equals half.

404
00:14:58,614 --> 00:14:59,665
- Okay.

405
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:00,136
- [Instructor] : Yep.

406
00:15:00,136 --> 00:15:00,862
- Okay, so that's correct.
