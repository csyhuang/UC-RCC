1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,486
(kids talking)

2
00:00:01,486 --> 00:00:03,618
- Yeah, I wanna
talk to you some more.

3
00:00:03,618 --> 00:00:05,093
- This is cool, that's probably how you

4
00:00:05,093 --> 00:00:07,782
attract them is start doing this.

5
00:00:07,782 --> 00:00:11,570
(kids talking)

6
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,428
- Hey, tell
me why you think, Adam,

7
00:00:15,428 --> 00:00:17,195
he's able to do this again.

8
00:00:17,195 --> 00:00:20,136
- Because he has these legs,

9
00:00:20,136 --> 00:00:22,462
like his legs stick to the ground

10
00:00:22,462 --> 00:00:24,545
so I think they can do it

11
00:00:24,545 --> 00:00:27,468
because they stick to the
ground to get the strength,

12
00:00:27,468 --> 00:00:29,358
then he pulls it up and he does it again.

13
00:00:29,358 --> 00:00:31,191
- Hey, that
sounds like a connection

14
00:00:31,191 --> 00:00:32,571
to what we've been learning about

15
00:00:32,571 --> 00:00:34,963
the structures and the functions.

16
00:00:34,963 --> 00:00:37,906
Yeah, so when it's time to
start making those connections,

17
00:00:37,906 --> 00:00:40,707
I really want you to write
that down with your team.

18
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,845
Just make sure that
that gets on your paper.

19
00:00:42,845 --> 00:00:44,379
Okay, I want you writing out,

20
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:47,240
how many paper clips
is this beetle pulling?

21
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,494
- Two grams.

22
00:00:48,494 --> 00:00:52,669
- Two grams, right
now mathematician get busy.

23
00:00:52,669 --> 00:00:54,127
(kids chattering)

24
00:00:54,127 --> 00:00:55,707
- Okay.

25
00:00:55,707 --> 00:00:58,402
I'm gonna keep putting another
one on here to make sure.

26
00:00:58,402 --> 00:00:59,960
- Put four on there,

27
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,088
let's see if he can do it with four.

28
00:01:02,088 --> 00:01:05,231
Hey little buddy, don't, don't, don't.

29
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,731
No, no, no, no, pull him away.

30
00:01:09,037 --> 00:01:09,960
- What am I doing?

31
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,413
- He's making a sound!

32
00:01:11,413 --> 00:01:12,760
He's making a sound!
- He's making a hiss--

33
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,347
- He's making a hissing sound.
- You think?

34
00:01:14,347 --> 00:01:15,726
Why do you think he's hissing?

35
00:01:15,726 --> 00:01:18,696
- Maybe because he thinks
we're trying to hurt him.

36
00:01:18,696 --> 00:01:21,304
- Yeah, for self defense.

37
00:01:21,304 --> 00:01:22,616
- Yeah, alright.

38
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,530
Let me go check in with some other teams.

39
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:25,993
You all keep working on your beetle.

40
00:01:25,993 --> 00:01:26,826
- Okay.

41
00:01:26,826 --> 00:01:29,409
(kids talking)

42
00:01:30,842 --> 00:01:33,649
- What's going on
at your all's beetle team?

43
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:34,482
- He's pulling-
- The beetle

44
00:01:34,482 --> 00:01:36,721
is pulling two times its weight.

45
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,208
- Two times right now?

46
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:39,041
- Yeah.

47
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:40,035
- So how many paper clips

48
00:01:40,035 --> 00:01:41,270
is that that he's pulling?

49
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,103
- Two.

50
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:43,561
- Three, three.

51
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:47,206
(kids talking loudly)

52
00:01:47,206 --> 00:01:48,916
- He's pulling three.

53
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:52,732
(kids talking)

54
00:01:52,732 --> 00:01:54,781
(giggling and laughing)

55
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,031
(coughing)

56
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,814
- Your beetle's not moving.

57
00:02:00,814 --> 00:02:02,253
You think it's because of the loudness?

58
00:02:02,253 --> 00:02:03,086
- Yeah.

59
00:02:03,086 --> 00:02:04,860
- Class city class,

60
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,292
should you be going to
other team's beetles?

61
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:09,714
I know it's fun, and I
know it's interesting,

62
00:02:09,714 --> 00:02:12,948
but should you be going to
other team's experiments?

63
00:02:12,948 --> 00:02:14,019
- No, ma'am.

64
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:17,649
- You need to
be engaged with your team.

65
00:02:17,649 --> 00:02:19,249
Okay.

66
00:02:19,249 --> 00:02:21,015
- We're trying to--
- Okay.

67
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,432
Did he pull two?

68
00:02:22,432 --> 00:02:23,265
- He's pulled two

69
00:02:23,265 --> 00:02:24,380
and then we're gonna--
- He has pulled two?

70
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,213
Okay.

71
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:26,833
So let's see, let's just give him

72
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,995
a little nudge in the rear.

73
00:02:28,995 --> 00:02:31,471
- When I put a pencil right
here, he'll go after it.

74
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:33,271
- Oh, well see if that
works, do you think--

75
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:35,462
- I know, like earlier he was trying

76
00:02:35,462 --> 00:02:37,545
to get out of the bucket.

77
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:43,252
- Let's see if he
can pull it? He's doing it.

78
00:02:43,252 --> 00:02:44,085
He's moving.

79
00:02:44,085 --> 00:02:45,847
- Oh my gosh.

80
00:02:45,847 --> 00:02:50,014
(kids talking)

81
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,553
- I see he's moving
some, but I haven't seen

82
00:02:54,553 --> 00:02:56,224
the paper clips move yet,

83
00:02:56,224 --> 00:02:58,503
that's what we have to wait and see.

84
00:02:58,503 --> 00:03:01,336
Are the paper clips going to move?

85
00:03:03,297 --> 00:03:05,673
- Wait, I have to do my job.

86
00:03:05,673 --> 00:03:07,691
(gasp)

87
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:09,924
- They're moving!

88
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:11,031
They're moving!

89
00:03:11,031 --> 00:03:13,531
So he just pulled three grams?

90
00:03:15,557 --> 00:03:17,140
Okay, so...

91
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,226
Did the beetle pull three grams?

92
00:03:20,226 --> 00:03:21,589
Beth, where's your sheet?

93
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:22,864
Go ahead, help.

94
00:03:22,864 --> 00:03:26,697
(kids talking and chattering)

95
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:30,937
Talk to each other about what's happening.

96
00:03:30,937 --> 00:03:32,594
- Woah, you can't hold him,

97
00:03:32,594 --> 00:03:35,511
you have to leave him on the table.

98
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:39,303
- Wrecking ball!

99
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:41,594
- Somebody pick these up.
- I got it.

100
00:03:41,594 --> 00:03:43,749
- You hold
him up, good, teamwork.

101
00:03:43,749 --> 00:03:44,739
You hold him up.

102
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:46,058
- You're hurting
him, you're hurting him.

103
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:47,571
(kid yelling)

104
00:03:47,571 --> 00:03:50,495
There we go, now we've got
four paper clips on there.

105
00:03:50,495 --> 00:03:53,522
Now, lets put the paper clips behind him.

106
00:03:53,522 --> 00:03:54,730
Now...

107
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,080
Talk to each other.

108
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,947
Talk to each other.

109
00:03:57,947 --> 00:04:00,405
- I think he's, I think he'll be able

110
00:04:00,405 --> 00:04:02,755
to pull many, many, many.

111
00:04:02,755 --> 00:04:03,588
Right now.

112
00:04:03,588 --> 00:04:05,654
- I think the
beetle may be able to pull--

113
00:04:05,654 --> 00:04:06,487
(kids talking louder)

114
00:04:06,487 --> 00:04:07,935
- Eight, eight.

115
00:04:07,935 --> 00:04:09,398
- That's how many we have.

116
00:04:09,398 --> 00:04:11,794
- Oh, this
team over here has eight,

117
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:13,687
I might need to go over...

118
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:17,754
(kids talking loudly over each other)

119
00:04:17,754 --> 00:04:20,658
- Woah, wait, wait, wait.
- Get a green.

120
00:04:20,658 --> 00:04:22,825
- Let's see him in action.

121
00:04:24,282 --> 00:04:25,980
- I am noticing that

122
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,188
we underestimated our beetles, didn't we?

123
00:04:29,188 --> 00:04:30,021
(kid yelling in victory)

124
00:04:30,021 --> 00:04:31,809
(kids talking)

125
00:04:31,809 --> 00:04:34,788
We underestimated our beetles, didn't we?

126
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:35,997
- Yeah.

127
00:04:35,997 --> 00:04:37,668
- Our beetles may be able to

128
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:39,862
pull more than we anticipated.

129
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,904
- We can do nine.

130
00:04:41,904 --> 00:04:42,976
- Okay.
- Not yet, not yet.

131
00:04:42,976 --> 00:04:47,143
- Keep working,
mathematicians keep track.

132
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:49,923
- He's going.

133
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:52,506
(kids talking)

134
00:04:55,694 --> 00:04:57,125
- Talk to me team

135
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,555
about what's going on.
- He can talk.

136
00:04:58,555 --> 00:05:00,596
- It can pull nine times...
- It pulled eight.

137
00:05:00,596 --> 00:05:01,751
- Its body weight.

138
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:05,801
- It is pulling
nine times its body weight?

139
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:07,180
Wow, how many paper clips is

140
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,918
nine times its body weight?

141
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:09,802
- Nine grams.

142
00:05:09,802 --> 00:05:11,920
- Nine grams?

143
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,587
Holy moly.

144
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:17,676
Did any of you all
predict that this beetle

145
00:05:17,676 --> 00:05:19,583
would be able to pull nine grams?

146
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,416
- No, we only did

147
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:21,794
all four.
- We only

148
00:05:21,794 --> 00:05:23,595
thought four, he'd pull four.

149
00:05:23,595 --> 00:05:25,400
- We only thought four.

150
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,024
We only thought four.

151
00:05:27,024 --> 00:05:29,165
Okay, are you all making any connections?

152
00:05:29,165 --> 00:05:31,288
How in the world is this beetle

153
00:05:31,288 --> 00:05:35,283
able to pull nine grams of paper clips?

154
00:05:35,283 --> 00:05:36,647
Nine times its body weight.

155
00:05:36,647 --> 00:05:37,788
What do you think--

156
00:05:37,788 --> 00:05:41,129
Oh now look, when it's on
the desk is it able to do it?

157
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:43,583
- No, its harder for
him to do it on the desk.

158
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,667
- Why can't
it do it on the desk?

159
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:47,449
- I think he might have a better grip

160
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:48,981
on the construction paper.

161
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,480
- What grips better?

162
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,945
What structure is gripping better

163
00:05:51,945 --> 00:05:53,674
on that construction paper?

164
00:05:53,674 --> 00:05:54,678
- Because it has--
- It's because

165
00:05:54,678 --> 00:05:56,918
it's got,
it's got like suction cups

166
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:00,126
and I guess it's not used
to the slippery desk.

167
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:02,236
- It has claws to pull it.

168
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,743
- It's pulling it.

169
00:06:03,743 --> 00:06:05,056
- I think it looks really--

170
00:06:05,056 --> 00:06:06,894
- It's what, Abby?

171
00:06:06,894 --> 00:06:10,547
- Even though it's really loud
in here its still moving.

172
00:06:10,547 --> 00:06:11,933
- It's still moving even though

173
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:13,588
it's loud in here, that's right.

174
00:06:13,588 --> 00:06:16,059
- I think it just wants to go to Justice.

175
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:17,357
- You think the beetle's trying

176
00:06:17,357 --> 00:06:18,190
to go to Justice?

177
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,911
I don't know about that.

178
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:22,055
Are you gonna try a tenth paper clip?

179
00:06:22,055 --> 00:06:22,888
- Yep.
- Yes.

180
00:06:22,888 --> 00:06:24,364
- Look, look ten.

181
00:06:24,364 --> 00:06:26,716
- Ten paperclips?

182
00:06:26,716 --> 00:06:27,621
Let's see.

183
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,346
(kids talking)

184
00:06:29,346 --> 00:06:30,754
(squealing)

185
00:06:30,754 --> 00:06:33,763
(kids talking loudly)

186
00:06:33,763 --> 00:06:35,777
- He's taking your pencil.

187
00:06:35,777 --> 00:06:37,315
- He's wants to get your pencil.

188
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:39,305
- Oh, why do you think?
- Because it's

189
00:06:39,305 --> 00:06:40,276
 wood.

190
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:41,762
- Because he likes wood.

191
00:06:41,762 --> 00:06:44,254
- And what type
of animal is the beetle?

192
00:06:44,254 --> 00:06:45,800
- Bess, Betsy beetle.

193
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,084
- But what do they do?

194
00:06:47,084 --> 00:06:48,441
Why do they eat wood?

195
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:51,219
- They are...

196
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:54,225
(kids talking at the same time)

197
00:06:54,225 --> 00:06:56,970
- It's pulling ten!

198
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,494
- Why does the
bess beetle eat wood?

199
00:06:59,494 --> 00:07:01,357
- Look at him, I don't know

200
00:07:01,357 --> 00:07:02,875
if he's pulling ten or not.

201
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:03,784
Look at him.

202
00:07:03,784 --> 00:07:05,309
- Because he's a decomposer!

203
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:06,142
- He is a de--

204
00:07:06,142 --> 00:07:07,244
He is barely pulling ten.

205
00:07:07,244 --> 00:07:09,549
He's having to work really, really hard.

206
00:07:09,549 --> 00:07:10,382
- Yeah.

207
00:07:10,382 --> 00:07:11,825
- I think it's probably time to

208
00:07:11,825 --> 00:07:14,206
stop adding them to the beetle, you think?

209
00:07:14,206 --> 00:07:15,541
- I put max.

210
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,691
- Maximum is ten.

211
00:07:17,691 --> 00:07:18,683
- Do you think we can add--

212
00:07:18,683 --> 00:07:21,883
- Class city class,
if your beetle is struggling

213
00:07:21,883 --> 00:07:24,081
and, like, arching its back and, like,

214
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:26,666
flipping its legs, but
it's barely pulling it,

215
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,752
it may be time for you to give the beetle,

216
00:07:28,752 --> 00:07:29,809
we don't wanna be mean

217
00:07:29,809 --> 00:07:31,246
to the beetle.
- Our max was ten.

218
00:07:31,246 --> 00:07:33,714
- Okay. So, we're left on,

219
00:07:33,714 --> 00:07:35,521
thank you for taking them off.

220
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:39,949
(kids talking)

221
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:42,517
- Alright class city class.

222
00:07:42,517 --> 00:07:45,102
- Yes, baby, yes.

223
00:07:45,102 --> 00:07:47,296
- Put your eyes on me.

224
00:07:47,296 --> 00:07:48,911
Oh, I'm waiting.

225
00:07:48,911 --> 00:07:50,717
I'm waiting.

226
00:07:50,717 --> 00:07:51,862
Thank you.

227
00:07:51,862 --> 00:07:53,871
Most of us have come to the point

228
00:07:53,871 --> 00:07:56,987
where the beetle is struggling, okay?

229
00:07:56,987 --> 00:08:00,126
And having a hard time pulling the weight.

230
00:08:00,126 --> 00:08:03,055
At this point, if your
beetle is struggling

231
00:08:03,055 --> 00:08:07,490
it is time to start the
summarizer and the connector job.

232
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,606
Okay, so I wanna hear
you talking, summarizing,

233
00:08:11,606 --> 00:08:15,482
connecting what has happened.

234
00:08:15,482 --> 00:08:18,541
(kids talking)

235
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,457
- Let's give him a rest.

236
00:08:20,457 --> 00:08:21,290
- Yeah, let's give him--

237
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,730
- Wait, don't pull that.

238
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,813
- Oh my gosh.

239
00:08:25,563 --> 00:08:27,034
- How many is he pulling?

240
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:27,867
- Seven.

241
00:08:27,867 --> 00:08:29,393
- Okay, here,
I'll bring you some more.

242
00:08:29,393 --> 00:08:32,069
Where are the rest of your paper clips?
- Right there.

243
00:08:32,069 --> 00:08:32,902
- Get off.

244
00:08:36,777 --> 00:08:37,743
- He's starting pulling.

245
00:08:37,743 --> 00:08:40,691
- Okay, oh be nice

246
00:08:40,691 --> 00:08:42,968
to my beetle friend.
- I'm trying to.

247
00:08:42,968 --> 00:08:45,342
He keeps on getting his foot

248
00:08:45,342 --> 00:08:47,022
stuck to my hand.
- Hi little buddy.

249
00:08:47,022 --> 00:08:49,150
Oh, I almost touched it!

250
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,733
(kids talking)

251
00:08:53,722 --> 00:08:57,110
- We learned
before that beetles...

252
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,362
- Hang on, you're
learning that beetles what?

253
00:08:59,362 --> 00:09:01,355
- That beetles are really strong,

254
00:09:01,355 --> 00:09:04,675
but with their little legs
and their thorax maybe.

255
00:09:04,675 --> 00:09:05,850
- Their thorax you think

256
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,708
is what makes them really strong?

257
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,967
- Because the thorax, it may be

258
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:12,070
the biggest part in their body.

259
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,129
- Yeah, it is
probably the biggest part.

260
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:15,479
What else on their legs,

261
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:18,048
what on their legs are helping it?

262
00:09:18,048 --> 00:09:19,300
- Their...

263
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,145
Look at it.

264
00:09:20,145 --> 00:09:21,524
I know what it is.

265
00:09:21,524 --> 00:09:24,704
Their...

266
00:09:24,704 --> 00:09:27,573
- The thing that's sticking to the table

267
00:09:27,573 --> 00:09:30,240
and helping it move faster.

268
00:09:33,491 --> 00:09:37,517
- Okay, so the
sticky part on their feet?

269
00:09:37,517 --> 00:09:38,788
- Here, let me do it.

270
00:09:38,788 --> 00:09:39,871
- Yeah, okay.

271
00:09:44,248 --> 00:09:46,925
- You all have
done a really nice job

272
00:09:46,925 --> 00:09:49,847
noticing what structures of this beetle

273
00:09:49,847 --> 00:09:52,386
are helping it to be so strong.

274
00:09:52,386 --> 00:09:55,298
How do you think it uses that in the wild?

275
00:09:55,298 --> 00:09:56,685
Like out in nature?

276
00:09:56,685 --> 00:09:58,664
How do you think it uses that?

277
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:01,226
- It's functional and it almost--

278
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:05,393
(student talking drowns out speech)

279
00:10:06,368 --> 00:10:08,817
- You may even think it's cool,

280
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,980
but he could use his wings to fly away.

281
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,565
- Some beetles
do have wings to fly away,

282
00:10:13,565 --> 00:10:15,468
but what do you think is,

283
00:10:15,468 --> 00:10:17,188
I need you in your seat Nathan,

284
00:10:17,188 --> 00:10:20,472
what do you think it's using to move?

285
00:10:20,472 --> 00:10:21,810
Its, that's a lot of

286
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,562
strength.
- Its abdomen?

287
00:10:23,562 --> 00:10:26,623
- Right, okay, its
abdomen is, but in nature.

288
00:10:26,623 --> 00:10:28,873
What might it use that for?

289
00:10:29,995 --> 00:10:32,694
- It might use it to catch its prey maybe.

290
00:10:32,694 --> 00:10:34,345
- Okay, what does it...

291
00:10:34,345 --> 00:10:35,288
What does it do?

292
00:10:35,288 --> 00:10:36,855
What does it eat?

293
00:10:36,855 --> 00:10:38,473
- It may eat...

294
00:10:38,473 --> 00:10:40,612
- Casey, say
it again to your team.

295
00:10:40,612 --> 00:10:42,949
- Organic
and it breaks it down.

296
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:44,805
- It breaks it down.

297
00:10:44,805 --> 00:10:46,239
What is that called?

298
00:10:46,239 --> 00:10:48,243
What type of insect would--

299
00:10:48,243 --> 00:10:49,566
- It's a, it's a d...

300
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,036
- A d...

301
00:10:51,036 --> 00:10:51,869
A d...
(laughs)

302
00:10:51,869 --> 00:10:52,702
- A d...

303
00:10:54,135 --> 00:10:55,437
- A D.

304
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:56,600
- A disposer.

305
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,154
- Not a disposer, close.

306
00:10:58,154 --> 00:10:59,256
- A decomposer.

307
00:10:59,256 --> 00:11:02,251
- That's it!
(clapping)

308
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:05,019
Not a disposer, but a decomposer, good.

309
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:07,320
And so okay think, it's okay.

310
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,657
Think about if it was trying to

311
00:11:09,657 --> 00:11:12,134
dig into the wood of a tree.

312
00:11:12,134 --> 00:11:15,340
Wouldn't it have to be really strong?

313
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,392
- It can make a hole.

314
00:11:17,392 --> 00:11:20,392
- In the wood of the tree.

315
00:11:21,712 --> 00:11:24,596
- That little thing, the little...

316
00:11:24,596 --> 00:11:27,289
might be to decompose the wood.

317
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:30,372
- So it can bite and then break down.

318
00:11:31,267 --> 00:11:33,817
- It's really gonna have
to be biting harder.

319
00:11:33,817 --> 00:11:37,984
- Yeah, that mouth
part is really strong to bite.

320
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,431
Okay, so now may I have your attention,

321
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:42,729
how many do you have?

322
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:43,604
- We have 10.

323
00:11:43,604 --> 00:11:44,687
- You have 10 and it's pulling it,

324
00:11:44,687 --> 00:11:46,978
let's send him home.
- I want 11.

325
00:11:46,978 --> 00:11:49,069
(squeals)

326
00:11:49,069 --> 00:11:50,600
- They're moving, look at his legs

327
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,606
how hard they're trying to pull.

328
00:11:52,606 --> 00:11:56,058
You might, he might be able to pull 11.

329
00:11:56,058 --> 00:11:58,515
- I'm gonna give him one extra.

330
00:11:58,515 --> 00:11:59,874
- No!

331
00:11:59,874 --> 00:12:01,845
- No 12.

332
00:12:01,845 --> 00:12:04,128
- Okay, you
all keep working on that,

333
00:12:04,128 --> 00:12:05,845
you're doing a great job.

334
00:12:05,845 --> 00:12:06,926
- Thank you.

335
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,434
- I wanna come
back to my very first team.

336
00:12:09,434 --> 00:12:10,271
- Carrying 10.

337
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,237
- 10?

338
00:12:11,237 --> 00:12:12,745
- Ours can carry 11.

339
00:12:12,745 --> 00:12:14,216
- Yeah.

340
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:15,560
- It did?

341
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,393
- Yeah.

342
00:12:17,767 --> 00:12:20,029
- And he pooped on the paper.

343
00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:22,539
- Okay, it pooped?

344
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:23,964
- Twice.

345
00:12:23,964 --> 00:12:25,106
- It pooped twice?

346
00:12:25,106 --> 00:12:27,096
- Yeah, twice.

347
00:12:27,096 --> 00:12:29,471
- Okay, let me put this here.

348
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:30,820
I don't know where to put it.

349
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,524
There we go.

350
00:12:32,524 --> 00:12:33,507
So what are you doing?

351
00:12:33,507 --> 00:12:35,146
Are you adding 11?

352
00:12:35,146 --> 00:12:36,967
- We're gonna see our 11 puller.

353
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:38,112
- You're gonna do 11?

354
00:12:38,112 --> 00:12:40,612
What connections can you make?

355
00:12:42,836 --> 00:12:44,980
- The legs are like a crayfish.

356
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,711
- The legs are like a crayfish?

357
00:12:46,711 --> 00:12:48,692
- Yeah.
- How?

358
00:12:48,692 --> 00:12:49,700
- They have joints.

359
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,839
- They're jointed.

360
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,467
How do you think those
joints help that beetle

361
00:12:53,467 --> 00:12:56,033
to pull 11 times its body weight?

362
00:12:56,033 --> 00:12:59,783
11 times, how do those joints help it?

363
00:13:01,987 --> 00:13:05,356
- The beetle is like a, able to grab on.

364
00:13:05,356 --> 00:13:08,769
- Yes, so, Tim's saying
something, say it loud.

365
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:10,461
- It helps it walk.

366
00:13:10,461 --> 00:13:12,096
- It helps it walk, but--

367
00:13:12,096 --> 00:13:13,890
- And escape from predators.

368
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:16,309
- And escape from predators, how?

369
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:17,142
- Because--

370
00:13:17,142 --> 00:13:20,468
- What might it do with
those powerful legs?

371
00:13:20,468 --> 00:13:22,835
What did we notice them
doing in their containers?

372
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,168
They get under the what?

373
00:13:24,168 --> 00:13:26,264
(noise drowns out kids)

374
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,846
- They get under the rocks and the dirt.

375
00:13:28,846 --> 00:13:31,310
- Like, Tim, like when
he was on the corner

376
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,754
Tim was, like, picking him up,

377
00:13:32,754 --> 00:13:34,688
and he was holding on to the paper.

378
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:35,985
- He was holding the paper?

379
00:13:35,985 --> 00:13:37,213
- Tim lift him up.

380
00:13:37,213 --> 00:13:38,331
- Okay.

381
00:13:38,331 --> 00:13:39,717
- Oh yeah, it's neat.

382
00:13:39,717 --> 00:13:41,130
- I can make a connection.

383
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,224
- What's your connection?

384
00:13:43,224 --> 00:13:46,345
- If we didn't have jointed legs

385
00:13:46,345 --> 00:13:51,049
we couldn't walk up stairs, if
we didn't have jointed legs.

386
00:13:51,049 --> 00:13:52,498
- If we didn't have jointed legs,

387
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,509
we couldn't walk upstairs, right?

388
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:56,076
Is that what you said Coner?

389
00:13:56,076 --> 00:13:57,764
- You're okay.

390
00:13:57,764 --> 00:13:58,764
You're okay.

391
00:14:00,477 --> 00:14:02,557
Alright, I want you talking to each other.

392
00:14:02,557 --> 00:14:05,675
Help Halle, she's writing
down some of your connections.

393
00:14:05,675 --> 00:14:07,513
Help her, team, help her.

394
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,096
(kids talking)

395
00:14:12,271 --> 00:14:14,521
- Talk to Halle.

396
00:14:15,512 --> 00:14:17,058
- What's another thing?

397
00:14:17,058 --> 00:14:20,887
- The aphid's have pincers
and the bess just have...

398
00:14:20,887 --> 00:14:22,862
- Tim's telling you something.

399
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:23,697
- It has little

400
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:24,530
like claws.
- Hang on,

401
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,573
Tim's telling you something.

402
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,460
Listen to Tim.

403
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:30,411
- The aphids have pincers and
the beetle has these things,

404
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,694
that helps it eat out the wood.

405
00:14:32,694 --> 00:14:35,262
- They look like little--

406
00:14:35,262 --> 00:14:37,872
- They look like pinchers.

407
00:14:37,872 --> 00:14:40,289
- The beetle has....

408
00:14:41,467 --> 00:14:43,634
a pincher like a crayfish.

409
00:14:45,228 --> 00:14:47,395
A pincher

410
00:14:50,165 --> 00:14:53,155
like a...

411
00:14:53,155 --> 00:14:55,155
- Oh, this could pull 11.

412
00:14:57,649 --> 00:14:59,953
- Good
connecting, keep connecting.
