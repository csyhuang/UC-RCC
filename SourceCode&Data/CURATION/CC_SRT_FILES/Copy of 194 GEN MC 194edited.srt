1
00:00:02,281 --> 00:00:06,041
- Okay, so for social needs,

2
00:00:06,041 --> 00:00:09,059
we said that their social
needs are being met

3
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:11,564
because they...

4
00:00:11,564 --> 00:00:13,330
(inaudible)

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,183
- They look like the slave
traders can talk to each other

6
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:19,831
because they speak the same language,

7
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:21,873
but the slaves don't,
so their social needs

8
00:00:21,873 --> 00:00:25,078
with each other aren't.

9
00:00:25,078 --> 00:00:26,331
- So you feel

10
00:00:26,331 --> 00:00:28,793
your social needs are being met?

11
00:00:28,793 --> 00:00:29,397
- Yeah.

12
00:00:29,397 --> 00:00:31,045
- And how so?

13
00:00:31,045 --> 00:00:37,673
- Because our person can talk to...

14
00:00:37,673 --> 00:00:38,527
- 'Cause you have people

15
00:00:38,527 --> 00:00:39,798
to talk to, don't you?

16
00:00:39,798 --> 00:00:41,641
- Yeah.

17
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,197
- Anybody agree with that?

18
00:00:43,197 --> 00:00:45,681
- I agree, because our person--

19
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:48,258
- You. I am. You're that person.

20
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:51,207
Don't say my person, 'cause that's you.

21
00:00:51,207 --> 00:00:54,431
- I can talk to other people.

22
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:58,727
- So, you do have some social interaction?

23
00:00:58,727 --> 00:01:00,213
So, there's some disagreement there

24
00:01:00,213 --> 00:01:03,709
as social needs are being met or not.

25
00:01:03,709 --> 00:01:06,356
- No hands, Nita, jump in.

26
00:01:06,356 --> 00:01:07,888
- We cannot

27
00:01:07,888 --> 00:01:10,976
(inaudible)

28
00:01:10,976 --> 00:01:11,928
- So your social needs

29
00:01:11,928 --> 00:01:13,252
are not being met?

30
00:01:13,252 --> 00:01:14,854
- Yes, our social needs

31
00:01:14,854 --> 00:01:19,382
are not being met because we...

32
00:01:19,382 --> 00:01:20,659
- They do not understand each other

33
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:23,190
meaning, like, deaf?

34
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,046
Or they cannot talk?

35
00:01:26,046 --> 00:01:27,416
- So how does that make you feel?

36
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:28,460
Go ahead and talk about

37
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,761
your emotional needs now

38
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:31,549
being met or not being met.

39
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,569
- Our emotional needs

40
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:35,960
are not being met right now.

41
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,865
- I think I disagree.

42
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:40,674
I think ours are kind of being met.

43
00:01:40,674 --> 00:01:42,578
- I agree with Lauren's.

44
00:01:42,578 --> 00:01:44,296
Ours are being met

45
00:01:44,296 --> 00:01:46,734
because they're more happy

46
00:01:46,734 --> 00:01:48,940
that they're gonna get a lot of money.

47
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,356
- You're the person.

48
00:01:50,356 --> 00:01:53,564
- But our person is kinda serious...
- like he doesn't really want...[inaudible]
49
00:01:53,564 --> 00:02:00,828
(background chatter)

50
00:02:00,828 --> 00:02:01,710
- So as far as

51
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,916
what Nita's already talked about?

52
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,286
Emotionally?

53
00:02:05,286 --> 00:02:08,606
So are your emotional needs being met?

54
00:02:08,606 --> 00:02:10,742
- He looks angry.

55
00:02:10,742 --> 00:02:11,810
- You feel safe,

56
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,832
you're good to go.

57
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:13,552
- Yeah, 'cause

58
00:02:13,552 --> 00:02:14,573
we know we're--

59
00:02:14,573 --> 00:02:17,454
- She's like, I don't
really want to go, but...

60
00:02:17,454 --> 00:02:19,241
- They want the money.

61
00:02:19,241 --> 00:02:21,725
- But we want money.

62
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:23,769
We want all the money.

63
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,464
Well, it's the physical needs anyway.

64
00:02:25,464 --> 00:02:27,600
Ours--
- Ours are not being met.

65
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,179
- Ours are being met

66
00:02:29,179 --> 00:02:32,825
'cause we get weapons and everything,

67
00:02:32,825 --> 00:02:34,752
all good food.

68
00:02:34,752 --> 00:02:36,075
- I agree.

69
00:02:36,075 --> 00:02:38,815
And ours are also being met.

70
00:02:38,815 --> 00:02:39,836
- You don't want to mess with them.

71
00:02:39,836 --> 00:02:41,159
- Yeah.
- I disagree

72
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:43,435
with both of you guys because

73
00:02:43,435 --> 00:02:45,502
ours are not being met at all.

74
00:02:45,502 --> 00:02:46,408
- Definitely not.

75
00:02:46,408 --> 00:02:47,777
We are, like--

76
00:02:47,777 --> 00:02:50,928
- We're starving.
- Starving.

77
00:02:50,928 --> 00:02:53,161
- My needs are not
being met if I'm Ashley,

78
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:54,949
because I'm scrunched together,

79
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:56,574
I'm uncomfortable.

80
00:02:56,574 --> 00:02:58,827
My physical needs aren't being met

81
00:02:58,827 --> 00:03:00,638
because it's crowded

82
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:04,190
and my muscles ache.

83
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,094
Does anyone agree with that?

84
00:03:06,094 --> 00:03:07,998
That their physical
needs are not being met?

85
00:03:07,998 --> 00:03:10,041
- I agree that Ashley's physical needs

86
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,597
aren't being met

87
00:03:11,597 --> 00:03:14,766
because they are scrunched together

88
00:03:14,766 --> 00:03:19,259
and it looks like they're in chains

89
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:20,676
and they don't have much--

90
00:03:20,676 --> 00:03:22,091
- [Teacher] Are your
physical needs being met?

91
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:22,904
- Yes.
- Our physical needs

92
00:03:22,904 --> 00:03:24,367
are being met because--

93
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:26,341
(multiple children talking)

94
00:03:26,341 --> 00:03:27,456
- I disagree with you

95
00:03:27,456 --> 00:03:32,122
because I think you have space.

96
00:03:32,122 --> 00:03:34,143
- Our physical needs are being met.

97
00:03:34,143 --> 00:03:35,604
We're not, like...

98
00:03:35,604 --> 00:03:36,999
(inaudible)

99
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:39,157
- You're in good shape?

100
00:03:39,157 --> 00:03:42,664
(background chatter)

101
00:03:42,664 --> 00:03:44,591
- With your physical needs being met

102
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,866
how does that link to

103
00:03:46,866 --> 00:03:50,094
emotional and social needs?

104
00:03:50,094 --> 00:03:52,114
How do those kind of all go together?

105
00:03:52,114 --> 00:03:55,178
Talk about how those
all go together overall

106
00:03:55,178 --> 00:03:57,060
and how does that make you feel,

107
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,337
based on this picture.

108
00:03:58,337 --> 00:03:59,312
You're that person,

109
00:03:59,312 --> 00:04:01,679
so use first-person point of view,

110
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:05,581
and discuss how those are all intertwined.

111
00:04:05,581 --> 00:04:08,321
And then add to your conversation,

112
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:09,203
as far as I know,

113
00:04:09,203 --> 00:04:10,643
some of you did the bottom two

114
00:04:10,643 --> 00:04:11,896
as far as not--

115
00:04:11,896 --> 00:04:13,151
These are what are being met

116
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:14,450
and these are not being met.

117
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,144
So make sure you cover those two, okay?

118
00:04:17,144 --> 00:04:18,468
How they all intertwine

119
00:04:18,468 --> 00:04:20,163
or if they do.

120
00:04:20,163 --> 00:04:21,138
And then you can discuss

121
00:04:21,138 --> 00:04:22,507
these bottom questions, too.

122
00:04:22,507 --> 00:04:24,574
Even if you didn't get to
them with your partner,

123
00:04:24,574 --> 00:04:27,100
jump in now with each other.

124
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,820
I'll be right back.

125
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,444
- Alright, so...

126
00:04:32,444 --> 00:04:37,528
(inaudible)

127
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:40,525
My emotional needs are being met.

128
00:04:40,525 --> 00:04:44,240
I'm earning the money that I should be

129
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,584
and I feel confident...

130
00:04:46,584 --> 00:04:50,555
(background chatter)

131
00:04:50,555 --> 00:04:52,181
- All of our emotional needs,

132
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:55,673
all of our needs are being met.

133
00:04:55,673 --> 00:04:58,809
(background chatter)

134
00:04:58,809 --> 00:05:00,656
- Why are
the clothes taken off

135
00:05:00,656 --> 00:05:03,976
and why are the--?

136
00:05:03,976 --> 00:05:06,587
Just in case
- Emotional needs are not

137
00:05:06,587 --> 00:05:11,829
- they do jump overboard?
- being met.

138
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:17,901
It looks like they're sad because,

139
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:22,198
because we look depressed.

140
00:05:22,198 --> 00:05:24,192
And you can just tell it by the faces

141
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:26,539
and what they look like.

142
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:28,396
Our faces and their--

143
00:05:28,396 --> 00:05:30,509
and our body language.

144
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:31,924
And there was--

145
00:05:31,924 --> 00:05:36,244
and we're scared because
we see the weapons and

146
00:05:36,244 --> 00:05:40,283
we don't know what they're
gonna do with it to us.

147
00:05:40,283 --> 00:05:43,256
- So think about the cause and 
effect of that.

148
00:05:43,256 --> 00:05:49,919
- Our emotional kinda was being met.

149
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,312
- Are the people standing up--

150
00:05:52,312 --> 00:05:53,448
- No.

151
00:05:53,448 --> 00:05:55,330
- But how are they not chained?

152
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,023
- Still all of our emotional
needs are being met.

153
00:05:58,023 --> 00:05:59,212
- They're running away.

154
00:05:59,212 --> 00:05:59,978
- They don't look worried,

155
00:05:59,978 --> 00:06:01,959
they look kind of like they're looking at

156
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,298
the scenery kind of.

157
00:06:03,298 --> 00:06:05,526
- They look calm.
- In their expression

158
00:06:05,526 --> 00:06:08,181
they look calm, yeah.

159
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:11,982
They don't look worried or anything.

160
00:06:11,982 --> 00:06:15,101
- These people, but the people
that are sitting down...

161
00:06:15,101 --> 00:06:16,936
(inaudible)

162
00:06:16,936 --> 00:06:19,908
- I disagree with Alan,

163
00:06:19,908 --> 00:06:23,274
'cause they look calm and confident.

164
00:06:23,274 --> 00:06:26,061
- I kinda disagree with that

165
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:28,568
because they look like--

166
00:06:28,568 --> 00:06:30,890
That's why they're all
facing different directions.

167
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,721
They're watching for anything suspicious.

168
00:06:34,721 --> 00:06:39,851
(multiple children talking)

169
00:06:39,851 --> 00:06:41,777
They're all looking in
different directions.

170
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:42,721
- They aren't smiling like

171
00:06:42,721 --> 00:06:44,657
they're looking at beautiful scenery.

172
00:06:44,657 --> 00:06:47,885
- There's like little sections in between,

173
00:06:47,885 --> 00:06:50,879
so like Grayson said, if
they do jump overboard

174
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,386
they don't all fall over and tip the boat.

175
00:06:54,386 --> 00:06:58,286
- Do you think these people
are all in one group?

176
00:06:58,286 --> 00:07:02,141
No, let me rewind and
say my question again.

177
00:07:02,141 --> 00:07:07,086
Do you feel that these people

178
00:07:07,086 --> 00:07:09,363
all everybody in this boat

179
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:12,589
was represented by a perspective

180
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:15,516
from your discussion you just had?

181
00:07:15,516 --> 00:07:16,513
Do you understand my question?

182
00:07:16,513 --> 00:07:18,835
I'm not saying it very well.

183
00:07:18,835 --> 00:07:22,225
Were roles of all these people in the boat

184
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:25,197
given to at least somebody in this group?

185
00:07:25,197 --> 00:07:28,542
- Yeah.
- You think so?

186
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:31,537
How were the roles different?

187
00:07:31,537 --> 00:07:36,088
- I think there's bosses
and then there was slaves.

188
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:38,480
Like slave traders and them.

189
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,935
- Kind of serious, like
they just got their reward,

190
00:07:40,935 --> 00:07:43,936
and these people, they
look kind of like chained--

191
00:07:43,936 --> 00:07:46,537
- I don't think they're running away.

192
00:07:46,537 --> 00:07:48,070
- I think they're running away.

193
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,993
- I think they're going to a bigger boat,

194
00:07:51,993 --> 00:07:53,920
'cause these people look like--

195
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,474
- I think they're like--
- That's not the full canoe.

196
00:07:56,474 --> 00:08:00,120
- And they're just taking
the slaves to the big boat.

197
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,627
- So let me say my question again.

198
00:08:02,627 --> 00:08:04,021
Let me say my question again.

199
00:08:04,021 --> 00:08:06,505
- Why would slaves take slaves?

200
00:08:06,505 --> 00:08:10,127
- They're slave traders.
- They're not slaves.

201
00:08:10,127 --> 00:08:12,333
- How do you know they could be slaves

202
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,446
or they could be slave traders?

203
00:08:14,446 --> 00:08:16,466
- Let me say my question again.

204
00:08:16,466 --> 00:08:20,251
I want you to think about your role

205
00:08:20,251 --> 00:08:22,201
and what was just said.

206
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,733
Do you think that all roles

207
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:29,125
that I gave this group were,

208
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,610
I'm sorry, are on this picture?

209
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,284
- No.

210
00:08:32,284 --> 00:08:34,026
- Oh, you're changing your mind?

211
00:08:34,026 --> 00:08:35,325
Discuss that.

212
00:08:35,325 --> 00:08:36,696
At first you said yes.

213
00:08:36,696 --> 00:08:39,690
Discuss that, why maybe not all the roles

214
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,734
that I gave you were on this picture.

215
00:08:41,734 --> 00:08:43,869
No, do not say your role yet.

216
00:08:43,869 --> 00:08:47,652
Ladies and gentlemen, we
have about one minute.

217
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:51,304
- I think that they
are people in the tribe

218
00:08:51,304 --> 00:08:58,043
and they're giving their slaves as slaves.

219
00:08:58,043 --> 00:09:01,156
- You know how we were
doing that worksheet,

220
00:09:01,156 --> 00:09:03,662
the graphic organizer?

221
00:09:03,662 --> 00:09:05,521
It said that most of the time,

222
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:08,190
they would just trade other villages

223
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,767
for their slaves and take those ones.

224
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:12,207
- Well, I think--
- 'Cause they could still

225
00:09:12,207 --> 00:09:13,437
have their own slaves.

226
00:09:13,437 --> 00:09:18,499
- I think this is a slave trader...

227
00:09:18,499 --> 00:09:21,565
well, not really like a
slave trader, but like

228
00:09:21,565 --> 00:09:24,606
- 'Cause the slave traders
- a slave boss kind of?

229
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,276
- were from England, so I
think they'd have white skin.

230
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:30,341
- I think they're with the other people--

231
00:09:30,341 --> 00:09:31,480
- But remember

232
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,465
African-Americans were also slave traders.

233
00:09:36,465 --> 00:09:39,419
- Because they're not
chained and they're standing

234
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:41,928
and the other people, like slaves,

235
00:09:41,928 --> 00:09:49,997
are all tucked together and depressed.

236
00:09:49,997 --> 00:09:53,386
- I think that...

237
00:09:53,386 --> 00:09:56,364
some European traders tried to

238
00:09:56,364 --> 00:10:00,935
persuade other slave people

239
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:02,919
to say, like

240
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:07,272
"go get your crime people,

241
00:10:07,272 --> 00:10:09,687
go get your crime people..."

242
00:10:09,687 --> 00:10:11,916
- Slaves.
- Yeah, "your slaves

243
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:15,422
"in your own tribe, and
then we'll trade you--"

244
00:10:15,422 --> 00:10:16,811
- Gold.

245
00:10:16,811 --> 00:10:20,666
- A bag of tobacco.

246
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,756
- And those helped capture...

247
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:28,096
So even though they don't have white skin,

248
00:10:28,096 --> 00:10:32,298
they might be slave traders
and they give, like,

249
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,552
(inaudible)

250
00:10:33,552 --> 00:10:37,430
- So we have two different
maybe perspectives

251
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,076
of slave traders, is that
what I'm hearing you say?

252
00:10:40,076 --> 00:10:41,817
One being?

253
00:10:41,817 --> 00:10:44,163
- They could have also
been threatened to work.

254
00:10:44,163 --> 00:10:45,138
- Europeans.

255
00:10:45,138 --> 00:10:45,905
- Hold that thought, David.

256
00:10:45,905 --> 00:10:46,555
One being?

257
00:10:46,555 --> 00:10:48,547
- Europeans and one being African.

258
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,195
- Well not really African-American...

259
00:10:50,195 --> 00:10:56,699
- 'Cause in the book it said
that the African slaves,

260
00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:00,693
not the European slaves,
but the African slaves,

261
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:04,408
their slaves were kinda like maids.

262
00:11:04,408 --> 00:11:06,196
- So I want you to think about the role

263
00:11:06,196 --> 00:11:08,982
that you were given.

264
00:11:08,982 --> 00:11:11,560
And I asked you to look at that picture

265
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,115
from that perspective.

266
00:11:13,115 --> 00:11:17,782
Is it possible that that
specific role I gave you

267
00:11:17,782 --> 00:11:20,035
has many different perspectives itself?

268
00:11:20,035 --> 00:11:21,196
- Yes.

269
00:11:21,196 --> 00:11:22,449
- Alright.

270
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:24,191
I want you to wrap up your conversation

271
00:11:24,191 --> 00:11:25,607
if you have anything else to add,

272
00:11:25,607 --> 00:11:27,929
and then we're gonna continue tomorrow.

273
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:29,136
- You're not gonna tell?

274
00:11:29,136 --> 00:11:31,040
- Not yet, no.

275
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,712
I changed my mind.

276
00:11:32,712 --> 00:11:34,152
You think you know.

277
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,336
You think you know.

278
00:11:35,336 --> 00:11:36,009
- We still have the cards.

279
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:36,706
- Aw, rats.

280
00:11:36,706 --> 00:11:38,073
- They did it.
