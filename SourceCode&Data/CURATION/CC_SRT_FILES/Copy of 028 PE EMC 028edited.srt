1
00:00:00,537 --> 00:00:01,792
- How's everybody today?

2
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:02,972
- [All] Good.
- Good.

3
00:00:02,972 --> 00:00:07,042
- Okay, we are gonna work
our bodies real hard today,

4
00:00:07,042 --> 00:00:10,997
and we are gonna play a
game called Wellness Uno.

5
00:00:10,997 --> 00:00:13,359
How many people, raise your
hand if you've ever played Uno.

6
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:15,172
Absolutely, put your hands down.

7
00:00:15,172 --> 00:00:17,729
Do you know that there
are four colors in Uno?

8
00:00:17,729 --> 00:00:19,154
Who knows what one color is?

9
00:00:19,154 --> 00:00:21,206
Alexis, what is it?

10
00:00:21,206 --> 00:00:21,954
- Blue.

11
00:00:21,954 --> 00:00:24,573
- [Ms. Miller] What's another one?

12
00:00:24,573 --> 00:00:25,596
- Um, red.

13
00:00:25,596 --> 00:00:26,774
- Red. What's another one Nate?

14
00:00:26,774 --> 00:00:28,221
- Yellow.
- Yellow.

15
00:00:28,221 --> 00:00:29,477
- Green.

16
00:00:29,477 --> 00:00:30,760
- Green, absolutely.

17
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,117
Okay, we've got the Uno cards spread

18
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:35,717
all around the circle here, first graders.

19
00:00:35,717 --> 00:00:38,983
And what we're gonna do
is, in just a minute,

20
00:00:38,983 --> 00:00:40,339
you're gonna come up here,

21
00:00:40,339 --> 00:00:42,415
and you're gonna get an Uno card.

22
00:00:42,415 --> 00:00:45,213
I might pick this one right
here, this one is a...

23
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:47,535
- [All] Green four.
- Green four.

24
00:00:47,535 --> 00:00:51,837
Okay I look at it and
then I put it right back.

25
00:00:51,837 --> 00:00:53,527
If you notice the gym is set up

26
00:00:53,527 --> 00:00:55,129
in four different color zones.

27
00:00:55,129 --> 00:00:57,329
Point to where the green color zone is.

28
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,173
Boom, you got a green cone over there,

29
00:00:59,173 --> 00:01:01,280
stay right there, watch Ms. Miller.

30
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,485
The green color zone is
the muscular strength

31
00:01:03,485 --> 00:01:05,285
and muscular endurance station.

32
00:01:05,285 --> 00:01:06,841
So if this is, you have choices

33
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:08,651
when you come over here first graders.

34
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:12,785
Choice number one, you can get a rope,

35
00:01:12,785 --> 00:01:14,932
and you can swing, how many times?

36
00:01:14,932 --> 00:01:16,062
- [All] Four.

37
00:01:16,062 --> 00:01:17,142
- Four.

38
00:01:17,142 --> 00:01:18,496
Swing four times.

39
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:22,765
Which rope would be easier
to swing on, Alexis?

40
00:01:22,765 --> 00:01:24,712
- [Alexis] The knot one.

41
00:01:24,712 --> 00:01:26,375
- The knot one, 'cause you can

42
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:27,839
hang on to it better, that's right.

43
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:31,558
So you can swing, or can come over here,

44
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:34,015
and you can do those bicep curls

45
00:01:34,015 --> 00:01:35,280
that we've been working on

46
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,801
in muscular strength and endurance.

47
00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:38,326
Stand right here to the wall,

48
00:01:38,326 --> 00:01:41,753
and do that four times, nice and what?

49
00:01:41,753 --> 00:01:42,617
- [All] Slow.

50
00:01:42,617 --> 00:01:44,333
- Slow, absolutely.

51
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:46,321
And here's your last choice
at the muscular strength

52
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:48,514
and endurance station, if I got,

53
00:01:48,514 --> 00:01:49,816
what was my number again?

54
00:01:49,816 --> 00:01:51,212
- [All] Four.
- Four.

55
00:01:51,212 --> 00:01:54,613
Look there's four hula
hoops on the rock wall.

56
00:01:54,613 --> 00:01:56,968
You would start here and you would go

57
00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:00,114
through hula hoop one, then hula hoop--

58
00:02:00,114 --> 00:02:03,745
- [All] Two, three, four.

59
00:02:03,745 --> 00:02:05,986
- What happens if I had a green two,

60
00:02:05,986 --> 00:02:08,667
how many hula hoops would
I go through, Paige?

61
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:09,886
How many would I go through?

62
00:02:09,886 --> 00:02:11,138
- Two.
- Just two.

63
00:02:11,138 --> 00:02:15,165
Okay, so it's either four,
whatever number that is,

64
00:02:15,165 --> 00:02:17,370
that's the number of hula
hoops you go through.

65
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,773
Then I come back over here
and I pick another card.

66
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:23,106
Hmm, did I pick this one,
oh I just picked that one.

67
00:02:23,106 --> 00:02:24,846
Let's pick this one, what color's that?

68
00:02:24,846 --> 00:02:27,029
- [All] Yellow three.
- Yellow three

69
00:02:27,029 --> 00:02:28,877
Point to the yellow color zone.

70
00:02:28,877 --> 00:02:30,757
Absolutely, the yellow color zone

71
00:02:30,757 --> 00:02:33,440
is the cardiorespiratory zone,

72
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,606
and guess what you have
to do here, first grade?

73
00:02:36,606 --> 00:02:41,113
There is a cone here and it says yellow--

74
00:02:41,113 --> 00:02:42,608
- [All] Add zero.

75
00:02:42,608 --> 00:02:43,989
- What was my number?

76
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:45,498
- [All] Three.

77
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,497
- Three, and if I add a zero to that,

78
00:02:47,497 --> 00:02:48,786
what does that make that number?

79
00:02:48,786 --> 00:02:50,037
- [All] Thirty.
- Thirty.

80
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:51,452
That's what we're gonna have to do.

81
00:02:51,452 --> 00:02:53,696
I have my choice, I have to do

82
00:02:53,696 --> 00:02:55,444
thirty of something over here.

83
00:02:55,444 --> 00:02:58,483
Here are my choices, I'm gonna do thirty,

84
00:02:58,483 --> 00:03:02,096
oh gonna work my heart, thirty step-boxes.

85
00:03:02,096 --> 00:03:05,890
Or if I don't wanna do that, I can do

86
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:10,166
the ball on the stick.

87
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:13,026
How many times?

88
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,175
- [All] Thirty.
- Thirty.

89
00:03:14,175 --> 00:03:17,950
And if I'm really good,
and if I really wanna try,

90
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,484
I can get a jump rope
right there on the wall,

91
00:03:20,484 --> 00:03:22,794
and I can try jump roping thirty times.

92
00:03:22,794 --> 00:03:24,930
Now I'm gonna run back here and I'm gonna

93
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,553
get another card, and I'm
gonna get this one right here.

94
00:03:27,553 --> 00:03:29,690
This one is a--

95
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,257
- [All] Red six.

96
00:03:31,257 --> 00:03:32,453
- Uh oh.

97
00:03:32,453 --> 00:03:33,613
- [All] Red nine.

98
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:37,153
- Red nine, it's a red
nine, see where that line is

99
00:03:37,153 --> 00:03:39,070
under there, so that means it's a nine.

100
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,788
Red nine, point to the red color zone.

101
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,509
Woo you guys are so smart.

102
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:45,593
I come over here to the red color zone,

103
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:49,029
and look, what does the
red color zone have on it?

104
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:50,218
- [All] Times two.

105
00:03:50,218 --> 00:03:53,421
- [Ms. Miller] Times two,
so what was my number?

106
00:03:53,421 --> 00:03:54,744
- [All] Nine.
- Nine.

107
00:03:54,744 --> 00:03:56,673
What's nine times two?

108
00:03:56,673 --> 00:03:58,144
Say it Alexis.
- Eleven?

109
00:03:58,144 --> 00:04:00,695
- Not eleven, this is hard.

110
00:04:00,695 --> 00:04:04,002
What's nine plus nine?

111
00:04:04,002 --> 00:04:06,637
What is it Nathan?

112
00:04:06,637 --> 00:04:07,945
Do you know?

113
00:04:07,945 --> 00:04:08,953
What is it Ethan?

114
00:04:08,953 --> 00:04:10,132
- 18.
- It's 18.

115
00:04:10,132 --> 00:04:12,061
So we're gonna do 18,

116
00:04:12,061 --> 00:04:15,824
Ms. Miller will help you with
the math if you don't know,

117
00:04:15,824 --> 00:04:17,621
so we're gonna times that one by two,

118
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:20,454
and here are my choices,
I'm gonna come over here,

119
00:04:20,454 --> 00:04:23,253
and I'm gonna get a paddle, and I'm gonna,

120
00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:27,616
this is a hand-eye, I'm gonna
use my hands and my eyes,

121
00:04:27,616 --> 00:04:29,882
I'm gonna put my safety strap on,

122
00:04:29,882 --> 00:04:31,936
and I'm gonna do how many of these?

123
00:04:31,936 --> 00:04:34,733
- [All] 6, 9, 18.

124
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,300
- 18 that's right, 18.

125
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,125
And first grade, how can I
challenge myself at this station?

126
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,476
If I wanted to make this
station harder for myself,

127
00:04:42,476 --> 00:04:43,903
how would I do that, Courtney?

128
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:48,303
- Um, use your left hand?

129
00:04:48,303 --> 00:04:49,802
- Use your other hand.

130
00:04:49,802 --> 00:04:51,950
Ms. Miller is left-handed
so if I use my left hand,

131
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,283
I would use my right hand.

132
00:04:53,283 --> 00:04:55,017
So if you want to challenge yourself,

133
00:04:55,017 --> 00:04:57,125
you'd use your other hand, so you're gonna

134
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,868
do that how many times?

135
00:04:58,868 --> 00:05:00,643
- [All] 18.
- 18, okay.

136
00:05:00,643 --> 00:05:03,440
So that's, you could either
do that at this station,

137
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,060
or I love these, these are the,

138
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,808
I call them the ice cream cones.

139
00:05:10,808 --> 00:05:12,900
Look, you throw that ball

140
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,725
and you're gonna catch that ball.

141
00:05:14,725 --> 00:05:16,460
Do it again, that's how many?

142
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,902
- [All] Two.
- Two.

143
00:05:17,902 --> 00:05:19,858
And you're gonna do that all the way 'til

144
00:05:19,858 --> 00:05:22,667
you get to whatever number
you have at that station.

145
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:24,419
That was using your hands and your eyes,

146
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:26,359
watching that ball right into that cup.

147
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,735
And now I'm gonna come over
here and I'm gonna get one more,

148
00:05:29,735 --> 00:05:33,207
and oh, I just grabbed
that one, let's see what's,

149
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:34,909
oh, what's this number?

150
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:38,044
- [All] Blue...
- Blue six.

151
00:05:38,044 --> 00:05:39,602
Where's the blue color zone, point,

152
00:05:39,602 --> 00:05:41,415
where's the blue color zone, over there.

153
00:05:41,415 --> 00:05:44,573
Hey, the blue color zone is balancing,

154
00:05:44,573 --> 00:05:46,562
watch Ms. Miller over here.

155
00:05:46,562 --> 00:05:48,393
You're gonna come over
here, and if you don't

156
00:05:48,393 --> 00:05:51,618
wanna touch the gym floor,
Ethan sit down for me,

157
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:54,159
you're gonna step on the stepping stones,

158
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,331
and you can either step on
the sides of the ladder,

159
00:05:56,331 --> 00:05:57,898
or if you wanna make
it harder for yourself,

160
00:05:57,898 --> 00:06:01,567
you can step on these rungs, and balance

161
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:05,109
all the way to the bleachers, step up,

162
00:06:05,109 --> 00:06:07,940
come across, and then we're
gonna go on this balance beam.

163
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,494
Hey first graders, when we're balancing,

164
00:06:10,494 --> 00:06:11,957
do we go fast or slow?

165
00:06:11,957 --> 00:06:13,118
- [All] Slow.

166
00:06:13,118 --> 00:06:16,263
- Slow, we go slow, we don't
wanna go fast at this station,

167
00:06:16,263 --> 00:06:19,420
because we wanna have good
balance, and we don't wanna fall.

168
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,788
We wanna make sure we
don't touch the gym floor.

169
00:06:21,788 --> 00:06:25,403
So that's, wait, what was
my number again I forgot!

170
00:06:25,403 --> 00:06:26,871
- [All] Nine.

171
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:29,937
- It was a nine red, how
many times would I go then?

172
00:06:29,937 --> 00:06:30,972
- [All] Nine.

173
00:06:30,972 --> 00:06:32,698
- Nine times around there.

174
00:06:32,698 --> 00:06:35,729
Or your choice is the hippity hops,

175
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,749
Now Ms. Miller's a little
big for this hippity hop,

176
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:42,113
but you kinda get the idea,
you just use the boing, hop hop

177
00:06:42,113 --> 00:06:46,166
to the black line it's one,
and then back is how many?

178
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,430
- [All] Two.

179
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,230
- So I would do that nine times.

180
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:52,572
Okay, those are your choices,
so there's four stations,

181
00:06:52,572 --> 00:06:56,764
yellow, red, excuse me, green, and blue.

182
00:06:56,764 --> 00:06:58,864
Turn around and face Ms. Miller now.

183
00:06:58,864 --> 00:07:01,371
I wanna talk to you about
something really quick,

184
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:04,610
it's something called personal integrity.

185
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,388
You ready back there Ethan?

186
00:07:06,388 --> 00:07:08,626
Everybody sit on your
bottoms, sit on your bottoms.

187
00:07:08,626 --> 00:07:12,166
Personal integrity, and
first does anybody know

188
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,546
what personal integrity
is, do you think you know?

189
00:07:14,546 --> 00:07:18,069
Maddie, when you hear that,
what do you think that means?

190
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:19,122
- Listening

191
00:07:19,122 --> 00:07:22,040
- Listening, okay, what
do you think Maria?

192
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,087
- If you wanna go to one
station that you really like

193
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:27,258
and you get a different
card, you can't put it back

194
00:07:27,258 --> 00:07:29,545
and get the one you want.

195
00:07:29,545 --> 00:07:31,600
- Ah! Wow, do I like that definition.

196
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,318
Absolutely, personal integrity,

197
00:07:34,318 --> 00:07:37,808
this is the way I think of
it, is doing the right thing

198
00:07:37,808 --> 00:07:39,877
when nobody else is watching.

199
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:42,002
You said it Maria, you
know what my favorite,

200
00:07:42,002 --> 00:07:44,278
I really like those
swing ropes over there,

201
00:07:44,278 --> 00:07:45,880
I really like to do that.

202
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,027
Would I have personal
integrity, if I came over

203
00:07:49,027 --> 00:07:52,386
here and I did this, I
got a card and it's like,

204
00:07:52,386 --> 00:07:56,294
ooh blue, I don't wanna go to
blue, I wanna put that back.

205
00:07:56,294 --> 00:07:58,792
Ooh there's another
blue, I don't want that.

206
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:02,624
Would I have personal integrity if I kept

207
00:08:02,624 --> 00:08:04,888
picking cards until I got what I wanted?

208
00:08:04,888 --> 00:08:05,689
- [All] No.

209
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:08,429
- Can Ms. Miller watch
every person get a card?

210
00:08:08,429 --> 00:08:09,508
- [All] No.

211
00:08:09,508 --> 00:08:11,424
- No, so you have to have
some personal integrity.

212
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,128
Whatever card you get, that's the one,

213
00:08:14,128 --> 00:08:16,601
what happens if I just got a blue card,

214
00:08:16,601 --> 00:08:18,563
and I come over here and
I pick another blue one?

215
00:08:18,563 --> 00:08:22,400
What am I gonna do, what
am I gonna do, Paige?

216
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,609
- You put it back down
and you get another one

217
00:08:25,609 --> 00:08:27,107
but not the same one.

218
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:29,105
- No, no no, we're not
gonna get another one,

219
00:08:29,105 --> 00:08:31,216
we're going to what, it's okay.

220
00:08:31,216 --> 00:08:34,500
- You just go back to the blue station.

221
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,467
- That's right, you're just gonna go back

222
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:38,178
to the blue station, and just maybe

223
00:08:38,178 --> 00:08:39,581
if you did the hippity hops,

224
00:08:39,581 --> 00:08:41,360
maybe do the balance drill next time.

225
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,703
Outstanding, okay,
we're gonna get started,

226
00:08:43,703 --> 00:08:44,656
this is what I want you to do.

227
00:08:44,656 --> 00:08:47,244
Oh I forgot one more
rule, when you get a card,

228
00:08:47,244 --> 00:08:49,001
do you ever run across the Indian?

229
00:08:49,001 --> 00:08:49,794
- [All] No.

230
00:08:49,794 --> 00:08:51,509
- Do we ever run across
her because we wanna stay

231
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:53,316
spread out, we don't
wanna bump into anybody.

232
00:08:53,316 --> 00:08:55,338
Nelson, do you have a question?

233
00:08:55,338 --> 00:08:57,349
Do you have a question about something?

234
00:08:57,349 --> 00:08:59,537
- You'd probably rip the card.

235
00:08:59,537 --> 00:09:01,384
- You would absolutely rip the card

236
00:09:01,384 --> 00:09:03,219
if you were to step on them or actually

237
00:09:03,219 --> 00:09:05,401
you might slide on them and
you could hurt yourself.

238
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:07,223
Hands down, let's get started.

239
00:09:07,223 --> 00:09:10,497
I'm gonna call months of the year.

240
00:09:10,497 --> 00:09:12,481
And if I call your month of the year

241
00:09:12,481 --> 00:09:14,455
that your birthday is in,
then you're gonna get up,

242
00:09:14,455 --> 00:09:15,809
and you're gonna go get a card.

243
00:09:15,809 --> 00:09:17,020
Are you ready?

244
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,017
If you have a birthday in January,

245
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:22,302
February, or March, go get a card.

246
00:09:22,302 --> 00:09:26,527
How 'bout April, May, and June.

247
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:30,367
July, August, September.

248
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:34,803
October, November, and December, let's go.

249
00:09:34,803 --> 00:09:41,560
(dance music)

250
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,159
What'd you get Chris, let's see man.

251
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:46,004
What is that, talk to me.

252
00:09:46,004 --> 00:09:46,778
- Red eight.

253
00:09:46,778 --> 00:09:50,905
- Red eight, do you know
what eight plus eight is?

254
00:09:50,905 --> 00:09:57,613
Eight plus eight, think about that.

255
00:09:57,613 --> 00:10:05,694
Almost, 16, go do 16 of
those, good job buddy.

256
00:10:05,694 --> 00:10:08,708
Hey Paige, you wait on the end of the mat

257
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,455
there until Alexis is done.

258
00:10:10,455 --> 00:10:12,262
What's your number Alexis?

259
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:15,105
Four, don't hold the
bottom, grab up at the top

260
00:10:15,105 --> 00:10:18,554
like Brian is doing,
that's perfect, yeah.

261
00:10:18,554 --> 00:10:20,480
What was your number?

262
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,361
- [Brandon] One

263
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:22,326
- [Ms. Miller] What was it?

264
00:10:22,326 --> 00:10:25,682
- [Brandon] One.
- One, did you do one?

265
00:10:25,682 --> 00:10:27,662
Do you think you can do
one then come back here

266
00:10:27,662 --> 00:10:29,934
and go get another card.

267
00:10:29,934 --> 00:10:33,386
Ooh Steven, Steven what'd you get, man?

268
00:10:33,386 --> 00:10:35,364
What is it?
- Blue seven.

269
00:10:35,364 --> 00:10:40,526
- It's a blue seven, go!

270
00:10:40,526 --> 00:10:44,582
Hey Ethan, what'd you get?

271
00:10:44,582 --> 00:10:47,856
Now remember the line means what?

272
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,493
- A yellow six.

273
00:10:49,493 --> 00:10:52,233
- Okay, what are you gonna
do with that yellow six?

274
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:54,357
Wait come here, look at me, 
you're gonna put a?

275
00:10:54,997 --> 00:10:59,210
(music drowning out voice)

276
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:02,519
No, you're gonna add a
what to the end of that?

277
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:04,287
A zero, and that makes it what number?

278
00:11:04,287 --> 00:11:07,735
- 60.
- Yeah, let's go.

279
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:10,695
Woo, look at these people over here

280
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:12,958
at the cardiorespiratory station,

281
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,877
they are going up-up-down-down,

282
00:11:15,877 --> 00:11:18,460
they are getting their heart rates up.

283
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,898
What number did you have Maddie?

284
00:11:20,898 --> 00:11:22,896
- Um, 50.

285
00:11:22,896 --> 00:11:26,423
- 50, holy moly.

286
00:11:26,423 --> 00:11:32,867
Keep counting.

287
00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:37,524
It goes like this Maddie, up,
up, down, down, that's one.

288
00:11:37,524 --> 00:11:41,319
Every time you hit the
ground that's one, okay?

289
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:45,108
Woo! Be careful.

290
00:11:45,108 --> 00:11:48,940
That's okay, just hold it up like this.

291
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,787
Watch, watch, you see how it
whirls like this at the bottom?

292
00:11:52,787 --> 00:11:55,864
There you go like that,
it can get pretty hard.

293
00:11:55,864 --> 00:11:57,849
Yeah, Chris?

294
00:11:57,849 --> 00:12:01,730
- [Chris] I saw one card that was um,

295
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,880
um it was turned over.

296
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,339
- [Ms. Miller] Oh did you?

297
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:07,483
- [Chris] So I flipped it over.

298
00:12:07,483 --> 00:12:10,338
- Oh really, thank you
so much, I appreciate you

299
00:12:10,338 --> 00:12:11,825
taking care of the cards for me.

300
00:12:11,825 --> 00:12:16,074
Here you go, five times
two, what's five plus five?

301
00:12:16,074 --> 00:12:16,845
- Ten.

302
00:12:16,845 --> 00:12:23,766
- Ten, that's what it is.

303
00:12:23,766 --> 00:12:25,513
Jamie, what'd you get?

304
00:12:25,513 --> 00:12:26,836
- Forty
- Forty?

305
00:12:26,836 --> 00:12:30,855
Did you get four yellow? Go.

306
00:12:30,855 --> 00:12:34,153
Woo look at these hippity hops over here

307
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:37,555
Outstanding.

308
00:12:37,555 --> 00:12:39,597
Man are you guys doing a good job,

309
00:12:39,597 --> 00:12:41,970
I like how you're going
really slow at this station,

310
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,690
that's good balancing.

311
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,126
Ooh Chris, way to get your balance back.

312
00:12:47,126 --> 00:12:50,616
Slow down buddy, woah Nelson, I know.

313
00:12:50,616 --> 00:12:52,682
Can you put one foot
in front of the other?

314
00:12:52,682 --> 00:12:55,561
Can you bring your other foot in front?

315
00:12:55,561 --> 00:12:57,516
Wanna try it?

316
00:12:57,516 --> 00:13:01,376
Ms. Miller's right here in
case you have to grab onto me.

317
00:13:01,376 --> 00:13:07,561
Yeah, look at that, what
a good balancer you are.
