1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
- [Girl 3] And the climax is when

2
00:00:05,002 --> 00:00:12,388
(Background Chatter)

3
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:16,679
Andy he throw the rubber ball

4
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,081
and told Bouncer to go and fetch it

5
00:00:23,351 --> 00:00:26,101
but he just sit there

6
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:30,004
(Background Chatter)
and then

7
00:00:30,004 --> 00:00:34,814
yeah, Then Andy called

8
00:00:36,854 --> 00:00:41,151
Toby to go and show him how 
to pitch the ball

9
00:00:41,771 --> 00:00:42,949
- [Girl 1] Okay

10
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:47,279
- [Girl 2] (mumbles)

11
00:00:47,349 --> 00:00:50,119
(Background Chatter)

12
00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:56,309
- [Girl 2] Oh, almost part of the end is when

13
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:00,924
the puppy

14
00:01:00,924 --> 00:01:05,104
that is Bouncer becomes crying

15
00:01:05,104 --> 00:01:10,104
and then Andy

16
00:01:10,113 --> 00:01:15,113
took the puppy to Toby

17
00:01:18,499 --> 00:01:23,080
- [Girl 1] Yeah, in the beginning

18
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,087
I was getting like selfish.

19
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:30,917
(Background Chatter)

20
00:01:31,277 --> 00:01:33,512
- [Teacher] May I interrupt for
a second, so you guys

21
00:01:33,512 --> 00:01:36,338
it looks like you've developed
the beginning pretty well

22
00:01:36,338 --> 00:01:38,078
and you found examples, right?

23
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:39,821
Have you talked about the ending yet?,

24
00:01:39,821 --> 00:01:42,560
and how he was at the end? I
see you're on the back page.

25
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,028
How does Toby change at the end?

26
00:01:44,028 --> 00:01:46,036
Have you guys talked about that part yet?

27
00:01:46,036 --> 00:01:49,298
What's his character trait
at the end of the story?

28
00:01:49,298 --> 00:01:51,637
- [Girl 1] We talked about the--

29
00:01:51,637 --> 00:01:53,637
- [Teacher] Okay, so who was working on that part?

30
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:55,133
Was somebody working on that part?

31
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:58,248
Yeah, was there a trait that
you picked for him, at the end?

32
00:01:58,538 --> 00:02:01,601
- [Girl 2] When...

33
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:06,201
the little puppy Bouncer

34
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:08,526
started crying

35
00:02:08,526 --> 00:02:12,606
and Andy took the little puppy

36
00:02:13,146 --> 00:02:15,734
Bouncer when Toby (mumbles)

37
00:02:16,834 --> 00:02:21,465
- [Teacher] How did Toby change then?
How do we describe Toby then?

38
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:23,313
- [Girl 2] Happy

39
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:25,818
- [Teacher] Happy?, yeah can you give an example

40
00:02:25,818 --> 00:02:27,499
of now that he's happy?

41
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:29,642
He's happy why?

42
00:02:29,642 --> 00:02:34,135
- [Girl 2] Because he just (mumbles)

43
00:02:34,135 --> 00:02:39,135
thinks anymore that (mumbles)

44
00:02:40,825 --> 00:02:42,015
- [Teacher] Ohhh.(nods in approval)

45
00:02:42,015 --> 00:02:45,025
Can you come up with another
reason, maybe together

46
00:02:45,025 --> 00:02:46,773
if you guys can look for
another example as to why

47
00:02:46,773 --> 00:02:48,793
at the end of the story Toby is happy?

48
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:51,469
Can you look and see if you can find one?

49
00:02:51,469 --> 00:02:54,195
- [Girl 3] I think that Toby, 
in the ending is kind

50
00:02:54,195 --> 00:02:57,172
- [Teacher] Is kind? Okay, can you
come up with an example

51
00:02:57,182 --> 00:02:58,542
and share it with them in the scene?

52
00:02:58,542 --> 00:03:00,607
And then maybe you guys can
come up with a consensus

53
00:03:00,607 --> 00:03:03,536
on one that you agree? Or you
can write two different things,

54
00:03:03,536 --> 00:03:05,440
right? You don't all have
to write the same thing.

55
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,752
One of you can write he's kind

56
00:03:06,752 --> 00:03:08,168
and one of you can write he's happy

57
00:03:08,168 --> 00:03:10,826
as long as you have what?
(Pauses for an answer)

58
00:03:10,826 --> 00:03:11,793
as long as you have what?

59
00:03:11,793 --> 00:03:12,641
- [Girl 2] Your reason.

60
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:15,411
- [Teacher] Your reason, absolutely.
So share that other example.

61
00:03:15,411 --> 00:03:17,125
Share that other example, too.

62
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:22,125
- [Girl 3] I think I've got he's kind.
Maybe because he's going

63
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:27,058
to be kind to Bouncer because
he's still like a little puppy

64
00:03:27,058 --> 00:03:31,896
and he doesn't know how
to do stuff. I think.

65
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:40,036
- [Girl 1] Yeah, in the end

66
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:44,276
when he said
(Background Chatter)

67
00:03:44,286 --> 00:03:49,216
(Background Chatter)

68
00:03:49,676 --> 00:03:52,636
for me at the end

69
00:03:52,636 --> 00:03:54,864
he was getting kind of happy

70
00:03:54,864 --> 00:03:58,074
because...

71
00:03:58,074 --> 00:04:01,284
Andy told Bouncer to--

72
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:04,725
Andy told Toby to

73
00:04:05,305 --> 00:04:09,466
to get the yellow ball.

74
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:11,403
You know the yellow ball.

75
00:04:11,403 --> 00:04:12,447
- [Girl 3] Yeah

76
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:16,814
- [Girl 1] And Bouncer was 

77
00:04:16,814 --> 00:04:18,924
kind of tired and everything.

78
00:04:18,924 --> 00:04:22,738
because he's-- he's small

79
00:04:22,738 --> 00:04:27,738
and Toby, he catched it and
they were playing, yeah,

80
00:04:28,282 --> 00:04:29,964
and they were getting happy

81
00:04:29,964 --> 00:04:34,218
and Toby in the end at that part

82
00:04:35,648 --> 00:04:38,582
he was used to liking Bouncer now.

83
00:04:38,582 --> 00:04:43,108
- [Girl 3] Mm-hm

84
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:46,268
- [Girl 1] At the climax--

85
00:04:46,268 --> 00:04:50,127
- [Girl 2] At the climax, it was when

86
00:04:50,127 --> 00:04:51,967
(Pauses)

87
00:04:51,967 --> 00:04:54,827
(Background Chatter)

88
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:58,747
It was when Toby...

89
00:04:59,227 --> 00:05:03,632
When Andy told Toby

90
00:05:05,622 --> 00:05:07,942
to show Bouncer how to fetch the ball

91
00:05:09,482 --> 00:05:11,788
and then started fetching the ball

92
00:05:11,788 --> 00:05:15,478
(Mumbles)

93
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:23,797
(Background Chatter)

94
00:05:23,797 --> 00:05:27,242
and then he started to play

95
00:05:27,242 --> 00:05:30,148
and Bouncer and

96
00:05:30,148 --> 00:05:34,698
Bouncer danced on his bed

97
00:05:34,698 --> 00:05:38,232
Bouncer tried

98
00:05:38,723 --> 00:05:40,107
- [Girl 3] Okay

99
00:05:40,523 --> 00:05:44,392
(Background Chatter)
