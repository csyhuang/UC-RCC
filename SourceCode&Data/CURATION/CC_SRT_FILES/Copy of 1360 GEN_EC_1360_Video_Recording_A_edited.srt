1
00:00:01,279 --> 00:00:02,301
- [Voiceover] What?

2
00:00:02,301 --> 00:00:03,346
- It's a dark color.

3
00:00:03,346 --> 00:00:04,553
- [Voiceover] So what does that mean?

4
00:00:04,553 --> 00:00:08,720
- We think the sun might hit
it or light might hit it faster

5
00:00:09,569 --> 00:00:12,332
so it might melt faster.

6
00:00:12,332 --> 00:00:13,423
- [Voiceover] Keegan, how
are you going to figure out

7
00:00:13,423 --> 00:00:15,006
how much it weighs?

8
00:00:16,187 --> 00:00:20,104
- Maybe, it will melt
faster because the water.

9
00:00:25,521 --> 00:00:27,262
- [Voiceover] What about
that, explain your thinking.

10
00:00:27,262 --> 00:00:28,262
- Because...

11
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,300
- You've stolen her even.

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,227
Now we got to count it.

13
00:00:35,227 --> 00:00:36,060
One, two.

14
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,081
- No, now you're taking them all.

15
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:42,581
- Three, we got to count, four, five, six.

16
00:00:44,214 --> 00:00:45,142
- Here.

17
00:00:45,142 --> 00:00:47,809
- Seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12

18
00:00:54,407 --> 00:00:55,657
13, 14, 15, 16,

19
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,180
17, 18, 19, 20.

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,106
- [Voiceover] Freeze for just one second.

21
00:01:08,106 --> 00:01:09,407
Let's switch and have the boys keep on.

22
00:01:09,407 --> 00:01:10,730
You stopped at 20.

23
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,147
Boys, finish counting.

24
00:01:12,147 --> 00:01:14,840
They stopped at 20, finish counting.

25
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,722
21.

26
00:01:15,722 --> 00:01:17,139
- 21, 22, 23, 24.

27
00:01:22,712 --> 00:01:24,732
- But they're not counting,
they're just putting it in.

28
00:01:24,732 --> 00:01:26,172
It's not working.

29
00:01:26,172 --> 00:01:27,913
- They're just putting
it in in the same time.

30
00:01:27,913 --> 00:01:29,794
- [Voiceover] So freeze gentlemen.

31
00:01:29,794 --> 00:01:32,209
So how do you think you could fix that?

32
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:33,602
- Put it back in.

33
00:01:33,602 --> 00:01:35,459
- [Voiceover] You might
want to try to remeasure.

34
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:37,042
Definitely want to.

35
00:01:40,589 --> 00:01:42,756
- [Voiceover] Miss T look.

36
00:01:48,639 --> 00:01:50,380
- [Voiceover] Guys, we need
to take a bunch of it out

37
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,713
because it's not really getting weighed.

38
00:01:55,047 --> 00:01:58,681
- You might need to use something heavier.

39
00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:00,713
- [Voiceover] Oh, remember,
you're not supposed to touch

40
00:02:00,713 --> 00:02:02,501
that nob on the back.

41
00:02:02,501 --> 00:02:04,869
That's not how you, how
would you figure out

42
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:06,123
how to weigh it?

43
00:02:06,123 --> 00:02:07,377
- What happened?

44
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,260
- [Voiceover] What's going on Daniel?

45
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,628
Tell me what the problem is.

46
00:02:10,628 --> 00:02:12,787
- It has too much, oh sorry.

47
00:02:12,787 --> 00:02:14,273
It has too much water in it.

48
00:02:14,273 --> 00:02:15,106
- Yeah.

49
00:02:15,106 --> 00:02:16,502
- [Voiceover] Well, can we
change that scientists?

50
00:02:16,502 --> 00:02:17,872
- No.

51
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:20,009
- [Voiceover] What can we change?

52
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:22,009
- We can take out a lot.

53
00:02:25,351 --> 00:02:26,768
- It's too heavy.

54
00:02:27,973 --> 00:02:30,390
It was reaching on that side.

55
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,483
- Six halves.
- This is heavier.

56
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:38,107
- [Voiceover] Wait, say that again Brayden.

57
00:02:38,107 --> 00:02:39,268
What did I just hear you say?

58
00:02:39,268 --> 00:02:40,870
- I said it's heavier.

59
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,587
- This is heavier than the
blocks, so we put more in.

60
00:02:43,587 --> 00:02:45,004
- [Voiceover] Oh.

61
00:02:46,048 --> 00:02:49,461
- Yeah, we're going to put more in.

62
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,714
- Oh way too much, way too much.

63
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:52,797
- Whoa, look.

64
00:02:55,754 --> 00:02:56,587
- Uh-uh.

65
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:02,220
- Ms. Teacher, Ms. T, I
think it's six and a half.

66
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,762
- [Voiceover] What is six and a half?

67
00:03:05,762 --> 00:03:07,226
- The measure.

68
00:03:07,226 --> 00:03:10,220
- [Voiceover] Oh, is that your
predication, that's your what?

69
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,985
- That's my hypothesis.

70
00:03:11,985 --> 00:03:13,448
- [Voiceover] Oh, how
are you going to find out

71
00:03:13,448 --> 00:03:14,531
if it's true?

72
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:18,347
- What do we do?

73
00:03:18,347 --> 00:03:19,438
- [Voiceover] Can you
maybe explain to Teagan

74
00:03:19,438 --> 00:03:21,188
what she needs to do?

75
00:03:24,477 --> 00:03:25,977
- Just balance it.

76
00:03:32,697 --> 00:03:35,414
They're like working on it.

77
00:03:35,414 --> 00:03:36,830
- There we go, got it.

78
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:37,663
- Got it.

79
00:03:37,663 --> 00:03:38,966
- [Voiceover] Daniel,
what were you saying?

80
00:03:38,966 --> 00:03:41,219
- We were going to like...

81
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:45,219
- We just figured out how
much blocks it weighs.

82
00:03:48,115 --> 00:03:49,266
- Hang on, it'll get there.

83
00:03:49,266 --> 00:03:50,427
- [Voiceover] So what did you discover?

84
00:03:50,427 --> 00:03:54,594
- We discovered we had, we
discovered we had to take...

85
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:59,656
- We had to take one, two,
three, four of the blocks out.

86
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,526
- Five.

87
00:04:01,526 --> 00:04:04,545
- Five of the blocks out to make it weigh.

88
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:06,124
- [Voiceover] So how much does it weigh?

89
00:04:06,124 --> 00:04:07,053
- So let me count the blocks.

90
00:04:07,053 --> 00:04:08,886
One, two, three, four.

91
00:04:11,534 --> 00:04:13,067
- Do you want me to hold the
balloon so it doesn't fall?

92
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:14,650
- Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

93
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,422
- How many does it weigh?

94
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,890
- Okay, I'll start wearing this.

95
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,375
I mean I'll start writing it.

96
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,625
- [Voiceover] No, I got it.

97
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:31,805
- [Voiceover] What are
you doing there Abigail?

98
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:35,805
- Well, I'm weighing and
it's not showing up yet.

99
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:39,955
- [Voiceover] What are
you using that tool for?

100
00:04:39,955 --> 00:04:41,232
- What tool?

101
00:04:41,232 --> 00:04:42,115
This tool?

102
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,115
- To see how cold it is.

103
00:04:52,842 --> 00:04:54,746
- [Voiceover] So did you already weigh it?

104
00:04:54,746 --> 00:04:56,790
- We have to hold it from the top.

105
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,299
- [Voiceover] Oh, so
do you think it's going

106
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,435
to weigh more now that
you taped that to it?

107
00:05:00,435 --> 00:05:01,945
What's your prediction with that?

108
00:05:01,945 --> 00:05:03,036
Do you have a prediction?

109
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:06,380
- I have a prediction that
it might be really cold.

110
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,935
- [Voiceover] And that's
going to tell you that?

111
00:05:07,935 --> 00:05:09,561
But have you weighed yours yet?

112
00:05:09,561 --> 00:05:10,394
- [Voiceover] No.

113
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:12,695
- And it's going to turn to ice.

114
00:05:12,695 --> 00:05:14,971
- [Voiceover] So, but should
you keep that thermometer on

115
00:05:14,971 --> 00:05:16,318
it while you weigh it or
do you think it'll change

116
00:05:16,318 --> 00:05:17,966
how much it weighs?

117
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:21,613
- I think it will actually
change how much it weighs.

118
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,166
- [Voiceover] Can you
explain your thinking.

119
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:28,083
- Because, because the
thermometer is heavy too

120
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:33,854
and it would change how much...

121
00:05:35,474 --> 00:05:36,474
- One pound.

122
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:41,545
- ...it was so we should
probably get the thermometer.

123
00:05:46,782 --> 00:05:47,615
- One pound.

124
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:49,532
- So we can, so we can,

125
00:05:52,216 --> 00:05:56,383
so we can weigh it and
then we can put it back on.

126
00:06:02,088 --> 00:06:06,005
- My hypothesis is it's
going to be 20 degrees.

127
00:06:07,962 --> 00:06:11,863
- My hypothesis is this
is going to change it

128
00:06:11,863 --> 00:06:13,977
because it's only one pound.

129
00:06:13,977 --> 00:06:18,144
- [Voiceover] Oh, so what are
you going to do to test that?

130
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,965
- Weigh it.

131
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:22,548
- [Voiceover] Okay.

132
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:31,999
- Put it here, put it here.

133
00:06:36,453 --> 00:06:38,473
- [Voiceover] Oh, are you guys discussing?

134
00:06:38,473 --> 00:06:40,168
What are you guys discussing?

135
00:06:40,168 --> 00:06:42,606
- Where we are going to put our balloons.

136
00:06:42,606 --> 00:06:44,767
- [Voiceover] So first talk
to me about your balloon.

137
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:46,531
Why did you choose this color?

138
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,874
- Because it was a
light color and we think

139
00:06:49,874 --> 00:06:51,624
it might melt faster.

140
00:06:53,171 --> 00:06:56,945
- We will think it will melt slower.

141
00:06:56,945 --> 00:06:59,592
We think it will melt slower.

142
00:06:59,592 --> 00:07:00,915
- [Voiceover] Why?

143
00:07:00,915 --> 00:07:02,410
- Because.

144
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,059
- Because it's a light color.

145
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:06,800
- The sun is attracted to the dark colors

146
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,217
so that's why we picked pink.

147
00:07:13,115 --> 00:07:15,065
- [Voiceover] So what
are you doing right now?

148
00:07:15,065 --> 00:07:16,815
- Doing a hypothesis.

149
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,358
- [Voiceover] Oh, can you
explain what's your hypothesis,

150
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:22,191
Teagan?

151
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:26,629
- It will be warm because
we're going to put it

152
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:28,534
next to the heater.

153
00:07:28,534 --> 00:07:30,297
- That's what I was going to say too.

154
00:07:30,297 --> 00:07:32,201
- [Voiceover] And so
what's your hypothesis?

155
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:35,429
How will that change the balloon?

156
00:07:35,429 --> 00:07:37,171
- Because maybe you said
we're going to put it in

157
00:07:37,171 --> 00:07:40,212
the freezer and then when we take it out

158
00:07:40,212 --> 00:07:43,695
we'll put it in the heater and
we think it'll melt faster.

159
00:07:43,695 --> 00:07:45,278
- [Voiceover] Okay.
- What about us?

160
00:07:54,781 --> 00:07:58,614
- It's almost in the
middle, take out one more.

161
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:06,766
- [Voiceover] Now I'm going to count.

162
00:08:06,766 --> 00:08:09,135
- [Voiceover] What were you
guys just doing down there?

163
00:08:09,135 --> 00:08:11,876
- [Voiceover] She was
thinking about the weight.

164
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:15,265
- [Voiceover] What does that mean?

165
00:08:15,265 --> 00:08:17,015
- Like in the middle.

166
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,530
- [Voiceover] Okay, so
how will you figure out

167
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,179
how much it weighs?

168
00:08:25,179 --> 00:08:28,624
- We need to take this
out and we'll count them

169
00:08:28,624 --> 00:08:31,707
and then we'll write it on the paper.

170
00:08:36,032 --> 00:08:37,782
- [Voiceover] 32, 32.
- 12, 13, 14.

171
00:08:49,406 --> 00:08:51,156
- [Voiceover] Brayden?

172
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,903
Brayden?

173
00:09:00,552 --> 00:09:02,061
- Hi.

174
00:09:02,061 --> 00:09:03,811
- [Voiceover] Hayden?

175
00:09:04,731 --> 00:09:05,799
- [Voiceover] Is there
any group that's measuring

176
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,632
the length of their's?

177
00:09:08,725 --> 00:09:10,475
- 28, 29, 30, 31, 32,

178
00:09:16,132 --> 00:09:17,715
33, 34, 35, 36, 37.

179
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:36,775
- Almost there. 43, 44, 45, 46, 47.

180
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:38,692
It's there, it's there.

181
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:42,092
- [Voiceover] What does that mean?

182
00:09:42,092 --> 00:09:46,411
- So it means that they
weigh the same thing.

183
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:47,503
- Okay.

184
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:48,989
- Now we have to count them.

185
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:50,846
- Let's let Will only do it.

186
00:09:50,846 --> 00:09:53,929
- Two, three, four, five, six, seven,

187
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:02,196
eight, nine, 10, 11,

188
00:10:07,332 --> 00:10:08,582
12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

189
00:10:20,312 --> 00:10:21,145
- 64, 64.

190
00:10:24,863 --> 00:10:28,780
- [Voiceover] Teagan, be
working in your group.
- 23, 24, 25.

191
00:10:34,337 --> 00:10:38,006
- I measured my balloon by using tiles,

192
00:10:38,006 --> 00:10:40,506
like tiles when I measured it.

193
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,345
Tiles.

194
00:10:44,345 --> 00:10:46,845
What should we do now, Mrs. T?

195
00:10:51,226 --> 00:10:54,585
My balloon is filled with matter.

196
00:10:54,585 --> 00:10:55,932
- [Voiceover] Why do you say that?

197
00:10:55,932 --> 00:10:58,695
- Because everything is matter.

198
00:10:58,695 --> 00:11:01,737
Well, there's water inside the balloon

199
00:11:01,737 --> 00:11:04,237
so it's like solid and liquid.

200
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,867
- [Voiceover] Why is it solid and liquid?

201
00:11:11,512 --> 00:11:15,095
What were you saying?
What were you saying?

202
00:11:15,947 --> 00:11:17,735
No, keep explaining your thinking.

203
00:11:17,735 --> 00:11:18,568
- [Voiceover] I have a question.

204
00:11:18,568 --> 00:11:19,401
- [Voiceover] One second.

205
00:11:19,401 --> 00:11:23,151
- Water is a liquid and
pushes on the weight.

206
00:11:25,073 --> 00:11:27,435
- [Voiceover] Oh, so is
that kind of tying in

207
00:11:27,435 --> 00:11:28,526
to your hypothesis?

208
00:11:28,526 --> 00:11:31,995
- Light turns into water,
solids and liquids.

209
00:11:31,995 --> 00:11:34,995
- My hypothesis is, my hypothesis is

210
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:38,445
if we like, if we...

211
00:11:45,765 --> 00:11:49,932
If we lose the like point
it will not melt faster.

212
00:11:54,844 --> 00:11:56,121
- [Voiceover] Why?

213
00:11:56,121 --> 00:11:57,954
- It's a darker color.

214
00:11:58,954 --> 00:12:02,669
- And when you think about
it, dark colors will melt

215
00:12:02,669 --> 00:12:04,336
faster on their own.

216
00:12:08,381 --> 00:12:12,398
- Is that cubes, the
(mumbles) has the cubes?

217
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,395
- [Voiceover] No, that's the weight.

218
00:12:14,395 --> 00:12:15,312
Pass it on.

219
00:12:25,773 --> 00:12:27,700
Have you all measured yours yet?

220
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,675
- [Voiceover] Yes.

221
00:12:29,675 --> 00:12:31,392
- [Voiceover] How'd you measure it?

222
00:12:31,392 --> 00:12:33,309
- With the tape thingy.

223
00:12:34,201 --> 00:12:35,130
- [Voiceover] Would you
mind showing me what you

224
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,640
decide to do?

225
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,912
- My hypothesis is that
it will melt faster

226
00:12:40,912 --> 00:12:43,048
because we're putting it by the sun.

227
00:12:43,048 --> 00:12:47,500
- [Voiceover] Did you make a
hypothesis by the length of it?

228
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,333
No?

229
00:12:51,361 --> 00:12:53,822
- Ours was six and a half inches.

230
00:12:53,822 --> 00:12:55,517
- [Voiceover] How do you know?

231
00:12:55,517 --> 00:12:59,859
- Because we measured it
with the measuring tape.

232
00:12:59,859 --> 00:13:02,019
- [Voiceover] Can you
show me how you did it?

233
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:04,782
Oh, there's an extra one Will.

234
00:13:04,782 --> 00:13:06,431
- Did you say not to touch the balloon

235
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,567
without the thermometer?

236
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:10,401
- [Voiceover] Now do we
draw a picture of what it

237
00:13:10,401 --> 00:13:12,561
looks like right now?

238
00:13:12,561 --> 00:13:15,533
- [Voiceover] These have
bigger numbers you know.

239
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:18,251
- [Voiceover] So what are
you thinking there Abigail?

240
00:13:18,251 --> 00:13:20,814
- I'm thinking that not really.

241
00:13:20,814 --> 00:13:21,905
- [Voiceover] But what were
you saying there with

242
00:13:21,905 --> 00:13:22,904
the bigger numbers?

243
00:13:22,904 --> 00:13:25,272
I didn't understand.

244
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:28,871
You held up the number line and you said

245
00:13:28,871 --> 00:13:31,038
those have bigger numbers.

246
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,923
- I mean like you can see them very well

247
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,753
and you also can tell. 30.

248
00:13:51,116 --> 00:13:51,949
- 30?

249
00:13:51,949 --> 00:13:54,692
- 30, he should start now.

250
00:13:54,692 --> 00:13:56,898
- [Voiceover] So how big is your balloon?

251
00:13:56,898 --> 00:13:58,981
- We got to start at one.

252
00:14:00,056 --> 00:14:01,704
- [Voiceover] Oh why
did you change it Julia,

253
00:14:01,704 --> 00:14:03,283
from your first measurement?

254
00:14:03,283 --> 00:14:06,209
- Because we accidentally
started from the 30.

255
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:07,042
- [Voiceover] Oh.

256
00:14:07,042 --> 00:14:08,531
- And now we have it upside down.

257
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:10,366
- [Voiceover] Okay, you got it?

258
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:14,359
It was, it is, move your finger for me.

259
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:15,192
It is...

260
00:14:16,217 --> 00:14:18,884
- Now let's send this back here.

261
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:25,993
- Okay, I think we should
do my idea for taking

262
00:14:25,993 --> 00:14:27,743
that thermometer off.

263
00:14:28,895 --> 00:14:29,728
- Yeah.

264
00:14:29,728 --> 00:14:32,561
- Yeah, I'll hold the thermometer.

265
00:14:34,514 --> 00:14:36,847
- I'm trying to take it off.

266
00:14:39,808 --> 00:14:43,059
- My hypothesis is it's going to be warm,

267
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:46,059
but then not attracted to the light.
- Cold water is in there.

268
00:14:51,096 --> 00:14:54,429
- Because sunlight can only make warmth.

269
00:14:58,779 --> 00:14:59,612
Right?
