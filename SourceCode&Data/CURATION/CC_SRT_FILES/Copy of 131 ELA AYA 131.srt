1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,640
- [Instructor] Inner circle number two.
Again, this was a question that was asked

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:16,700
in a multitude of ways and this is where
we're going with this: Why did the accident

3
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:26,280
happen? The accident of May 10th, 1996.
Why did it happen? Any questions?

4
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,540
- [Background Chatter]

5
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,060
- Yes, the May 10th, 1996,
thank you for clarifying, where everybody

6
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,880
died, well not everybody, but a lot of
people died. Why did it happen?

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:52,330
- [male student] Because... [Background Chatter] 
- Okay, so, I think the reason the accident

8
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:56,800
happened was maybe those people just
weren't prepared for for the climb.

9
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,240
They thought it was going to be they're just
going to go up with a guide and some other people

10
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,801
they were just going to go to the top and
come back down and it was gonna be an easy thing

11
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:07,161
and they didn't expect the challenges that
they were going to face.

12
00:01:07,161 --> 00:01:10,660
- [male student] I agree. They probably
thought it was gonna be a walk in the

13
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:17,840
park. Turns out that they weren't ready
and it was no cake walk and it turned out

14
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,721
that some of them it was their last
day on the mountain.

15
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:26,701
- [female student] You were talking
about they

16
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:32,741
weren't prepared and all that. But they
also said that the guide had never been

17
00:01:32,741 --> 00:01:40,490
through a storm like that and that that wasn't normal.
And I was kind of taken aback by that, because I was like,
if there's a guide who's going

18
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:45,240
to be guiding me on a life-threatening
thing I would want them to be, seasoned trainer you know...

19
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:50,330
- [male student] Exactly, I would think
the same thing. That the guide should be

20
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:55,631
prepared for that kind of storm unlike how
he was and it turned out fatally

21
00:01:55,631 --> 00:01:57,211
for the rest of the crew.

22
00:01:57,661 --> 00:02:04,071
- [female student] I agree with all of you,
but during reading the article, Krakauer

23
00:02:04,071 --> 00:02:08,161
also mentioned that he said that it
wasn't really anyone's fault...

24
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:15,371
because people were so... not in their
right minds. They were tired and injuries

25
00:02:15,371 --> 00:02:17,982
and how thin the air was, they couldn't
breath very well

26
00:02:17,982 --> 00:02:34,330
So when they looked at the sky and saw the storm coming, 
they didn't expect it to be as bas as it was, so nobody could
really prevent it. Anything to add to that? [Background Chatter]

27
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:45,000
- I agree, and I think that they were just having so much fun
that they weren't really paying attention. 

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:57,000
- [male student] I think that they would've all been prepared
if they had been watching the clouds...
[Background noises] 

27
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:03,161
- [female student] I know you mentioned the
clouds but why weren't they watching them?

28
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:04,801
Why do you think they weren't watching them?
- [male student][inaudible]

29
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:30,101
...they didn't think that they were actually serious enough
to actually [inaudible]

30
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:33,651
- [male student] I agree with Matt, that
they were so... they wanted to get

31
00:03:33,651 --> 00:03:37,651
to the top so much they weren't too
worried about looking at the

32
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:44,011
clouds, 'Oh okay, we can make it back up and 
make it back down, maybe before.' Not expecting 
trouble along the way. 

33
00:03:48,181 --> 00:03:53,570
- [female student] Yeah I agree. I think
that they weren't really prepared. They

34
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:59,261
were too wrapped up in what was going on to think 
about the downfall and what was happening.

35
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:07,000
They're tired and probably weak, they didn't have
safe... they weren't really all there to think 

36
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,750
about what are the consequences of this and what
would happen. Like the guide, if it were me,  

37
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:21,252
I would have made sure they had this... that you're 
gonna help me out more than not really being able to.

38
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
- [male student] Anything you wanna say, Krystin?

39
00:04:29,692 --> 00:04:37,122
- [Krystin] Well, I said that this quote at the top
it says that, "Ambition has a steep price." And I think

40
00:04:37,122 --> 00:04:43,000
part of like how you guys were talking about how like the
guides weren't too prepared and weren't qualified

41
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,952
but, I think that, well and the author mentions this too,
that climbing this mountian is... it's taking a risk and

42
00:04:51,952 --> 00:04:57,900
your ambition for going up this mountain already when 
you're putting your life on the line, there's nothing

43
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,900
really anybody can do to tell you the qualifications that
you have to have to survive, it's just basically putting

44
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:08,462
your life to chance, and so... that's what I really got 
out of it... what do you think?

45
00:05:08,462 --> 00:05:17,892
- [male student] I agree, I think that [inaudible], then 
not as many people would've died. They should just listen 

46
00:05:17,892 --> 00:05:23,892
to what they're told and and not risk their lives 
to do something that [inaudible].

47
00:05:23,892 --> 00:05:33,302
- [female student] I agree with that

48
00:05:33,302 --> 00:05:40,802
No, but I think that what Krystin said makes a lot of sense
that people were just too tired and [inaudible]

49
00:05:40,802 --> 00:05:49,092
- [male student] I agree but I think it's understandable because
just the thought of climbing the biggest mountain in the world is

50
00:05:49,092 --> 00:05:59,432
extremely... cool. and I would definitely want to go up there
soon as possible, and not worry about the weather,

51
00:05:59,432 --> 00:06:02,172
like go all in or don't go at all

52
00:06:02,172 --> 00:06:09,012
- [female student] I agree with [inaudible]
 lost or injured I mean but I'm like half

53
00:06:09,012 --> 00:06:15,262
way there [inaudible] go ahead and accomplish
what I set out to do and I think that 

54
00:06:15,262 --> 00:06:21,032
would've caused anybody to not really notice the weather
and the risks involved in what we're doing. 

55
00:06:21,032 --> 00:06:24,822
- [male student] I agree with what Ellie
said a little while ago heard they should

56
00:06:24,822 --> 00:06:28,102
have turned around, but they probably
thought that this was going to be

57
00:06:28,102 --> 00:06:33,752
probably what could have been a once
in a lifetime chance to be at Mount Everest

58
00:06:33,752 --> 00:06:37,672
I mean it says that they caught about [inaudible]
safely

59
00:06:37,672 --> 00:06:46,692
but they should have have taken it more serious and
not kept going risking their life... [inaudible]

60
00:06:47,002 --> 00:06:52,122
- [female student] One thing I noticed is that they relied
a lot on each other but they didn't go

61
00:06:52,122 --> 00:06:55,892
back and check themselves and I didn't
understand why they didn't go back and

62
00:06:55,892 --> 00:07:00,362
and like, when the one guy says, "there's no oxygen
here, there's no full tanks." Why didn't

63
00:07:00,362 --> 00:07:04,882
they go back and check that themselves? I mean
I would trust that person but yet again,

64
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:07,562
if my life on the line. I would be
checking it.

65
00:07:07,562 --> 00:07:10,692
Does anyone else think the same way?

66
00:07:10,692 --> 00:07:17,823
[Background Chatter]
- [male student] If my life were at risk, I
wouldn't be relying too much on other

67
00:07:17,823 --> 00:07:20,823
- [male student] If my life were at risk, I
wouldn't be relying too much on other

68
00:07:20,823 --> 00:07:24,303
people. I'd be a little weary about
something like that.

69
00:07:26,433 --> 00:07:31,803
- [female student] I don't so much
disagree but I came up with something a

70
00:07:31,803 --> 00:07:35,903
little bit different. I didn't really think that
people relied on each other that

71
00:07:35,903 --> 00:07:40,343
much at all. Who knows if all the deaths that happened
could have been prevented but people were too

72
00:07:40,343 --> 00:07:44,283
tired or too injured or, there was always
something and everybody was more

73
00:07:44,283 --> 00:07:48,943
concerned about getting themselves down the
mountain. In a way I would say that it was

74
00:07:48,943 --> 00:07:54,033
selfish mission but in another way... I
mean if it was my own life, I would be out

75
00:07:54,033 --> 00:08:00,733
for myself rather than trying to help somebody else and I think
we saw that, at least I saw that a lot happen throughout

76
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:04,823
the story. It's a choice between am I
going to help that person and risk my life

77
00:08:04,823 --> 00:08:09,763
and they might not really pull through this, does it matter?
Or am I going to get down this mountain and survive?

78
00:08:11,293 --> 00:08:15,583
- [male student] Some people were relying on others, like
at the end, someone was trying to

79
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:23,403
help [inaudible] was trying to help [inaudible],
he tried to help her down, 

80
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:29,293
she grabbed his arm, and he tried to pull her down. But
she just let go and died. 

81
00:08:29,293 --> 00:08:34,363
- [male student] I agree with Erin too. I mean
I think that right now

82
00:08:34,363 --> 00:08:37,873
wouldn't be able to. You would think about
yourself more. Whenever you're out there and

83
00:08:37,873 --> 00:08:44,483
and you're with the same people for that long of
a time, and you're doing the same thing, that you become 
sort of closer...

84
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:49,143
They would mean more to you then than they do

85
00:08:49,143 --> 00:08:54,143
right now. You'd be more willing to
sacrifice something, to survive, to help them

86
00:08:54,143 --> 00:08:57,543
give them another chance to get out alive too. 

87
00:08:57,543 --> 00:09:01,933
- That's definitely shown at the end of the article when he's 
talking about how he can't live a day without thinking about the

88
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:11,203
lives of those people that he was so close to that were lost 
and how he couldn't even come to grips with their deaths

89
00:09:11,203 --> 00:09:12,843
for a very long time.

90
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:21,883
- [female student] I agree with Erin, I think there was a lot of,
at the end, I think he was talking about the [inaudible] there 
was a lot of blame involved and

91
00:09:21,883 --> 00:09:28,223
why couldn't we prevent this, and it brings me back to what
you guys said, I think they really wanted

92
00:09:28,223 --> 00:09:32,833
to help each other and I think that they
wanted to do something but there was

93
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:39,553
nothing that could be done in some cases. I thought it
was kind of sad actually

94
00:09:39,553 --> 00:09:45,300
dealing with that kind of grief where you couldn't prevent
someone's terrible death. 

95
00:09:46,963 --> 00:09:53,163
- [female student] Tyler, what do you think about this? Like
did he grieve, or even just the fact that... who they were 
relying on.

96
00:09:53,163 --> 10:21,533
- [male student] Well, what strikes me [inaudible]
[Bell Rings] [Background Chatter]

97
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:25,633
- [Instructor] All right, outer circle,
what'd you notice?

98
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:28,243
What'd you notice?

99
00:10:28,243 --> 00:10:36,543
- [female student] I noticed that people were [inaudible] 
and books and just kind of [inaudible]in inner circle and I felt 
that that really helped

100
00:10:36,543 --> 00:10:38,603
them to get the instructions.

101
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:40,404
- [Instructor] Okay. Blake, what did
you notice?

102
00:10:40,404 --> 00:10:50,995
- I just thought that it was more and more, like Erin really led
the conversation and Krystin really led the conversation and

103
00:10:50,995 --> 00:10:57,705
I think that those were like the two main ones, but like Levi and 
Elliot and Alex, they all also communicated a lot but there wasn't

104
00:10:57,705 --> 00:11:00,125
just one person who was talking. 
- [Instructor] Okay, so there were definitely two leaders, but

105
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:03,615
there were other people that were
contributing as they went along. Okay, good. Anthony.

106
00:11:03,615 --> 00:11:05,825
- [Anthony] There were some well-developed
conversations.

107
00:11:05,825 --> 00:11:08,886
- [Instructor] Well-developed
conversations, what do you mean by that?

108
00:11:08,886 --> 00:11:18,446
- Like Erin would say something and someone would build on it,
then someone else would and then another topic and new questions
and another topic. 

109
00:11:18,446 --> 00:11:25,000
- [Instructor] Yeah, did you notice- what was the question 
they started with?

110
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,476
- [male student] Yeah, we got a little off-topic.
- [Instructor] No you didn't. What, what was the question 
you started with?

110
00:11:27,476 --> 00:11:34,186
What caused the disaster? And then you went into
something totally different but, did you

111
00:11:34,186 --> 00:11:38,556
have good conversation about that?
Absolutely! You guys really started

112
00:11:38,556 --> 00:11:43,576
focusing in on that life and death and
relying on somebody else for your own

113
00:11:43,576 --> 00:11:49,576
life. Okay, I really like how-- I mean it
wasn't like you were talking about cookies

114
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:52,086
and then all of a sudden you were talking
about climbing Mount Everest. It was

115
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:56,647
definitely very connected to what you were
saying. Dorothy, what'd you notice?

116
00:11:56,647 --> 00:12:02,637
- I noticed the conversation just kept
going and it didn't stop or anything

117
00:12:02,637 --> 00:12:05,717
it just kept going from one
thing to another.

118
00:12:05,717 --> 00:12:08,807
- [Instructor] Right it kept bouncing from
one thing to another. You could see, like

119
00:12:08,807 --> 00:12:11,457
steam coming out of your ears, they were
all impulsive. Blake?

120
00:12:11,457 --> 00:12:19,317
- I thought that also, remember Erin said, "you're relying on
someone," and Krystin's like, "well I don't agree."

121
00:12:19,317 --> 00:12:28,687
backed up Erin and other people backed up Krystin and there
was people who didn't [inaudible]

122
00:12:28,907 --> 00:12:30,767
- [Instructor] Yeah. Is it okay to
disagree with the people that are sitting

123
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:35,048
around you? Absolutely! But you need to do
it respectfully. Like Krystin did.

124
00:12:35,048 --> 00:12:38,728
Krystin said, "I don't exactly agree with
you Erin.""

125
00:12:38,728 --> 00:12:44,818
then she proceeded to say, 'Why?'  And Levi was over here, he was
nodding his head and shaking, 'yeah.' All right, great.

126
00:12:44,818 --> 00:12:53,088
- [male student] I thought they did a good job of not having any
dramatic pauses, they always had something, someone would pass
on to someone else [inaudible]

127
00:12:53,088 --> 00:12:58,388
- [Instructor] They paused occasionally but it was not pregnated
pauses. You guys ever heard that before?

128
00:12:58,388 --> 00:13:04,208
It wasn't a pregnant pause, it wasn't a
big spacey gap, okay, Anthony?

129
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:07,419
- [Anthony] Pretty much everyone talked
- [Instructor] Pretty much everyone talked. Yeah, pretty much.

130
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:12,719
- [inaudible]

131
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:16,039
- [Instructor] Yeah, did you notice that?
They built on to what other people were

132
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:21,229
saying, okay? They agreed, I still heard
I agree a lot; but then they

133
00:13:21,229 --> 00:13:27,369
told us why they agree with what they
said. All right? Anything else you guys

134
00:13:27,369 --> 00:13:28,999
noticed? Yes?

135
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:34,189
- I think that we looked at our [inaudible] more, because they 
had wider subject that they talked

136
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:38,899
about. Eventually it became narrowed
down that is was kind of like you have to look for

137
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:44,849
specific details. It wasn't the whole
story, it was more like a paragraph or two

138
00:13:44,849 --> 00:13:48,699
