1
00:00:00,429 --> 00:00:01,848
- Let's talk about the advantages

2
00:00:01,848 --> 00:00:03,543
and disadvantages of each company.

3
00:00:03,543 --> 00:00:05,005
Let's start with T-Shirts R Us.

4
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,605
Okay, who can explain
to me what's going on

5
00:00:06,605 --> 00:00:08,226
with T-Shirts R Us?

6
00:00:08,226 --> 00:00:10,274
Devon?

7
00:00:10,274 --> 00:00:12,994
- [Devon] You have
to pay a 50 dollar copay

8
00:00:12,994 --> 00:00:15,105
and you have to pay six dollars per shirt.

9
00:00:15,105 --> 00:00:20,105
- Okay, so you've got to pay
50 dollars up front, right?

10
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:22,486
And then what do you pay per shirt?

11
00:00:22,486 --> 00:00:23,180
- [Devon] Six.

12
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:27,457
- Six dollars per shirt.

13
00:00:27,457 --> 00:00:30,987
Okay, what are the advantages of that?

14
00:00:30,987 --> 00:00:33,696
How is this one in some way
better than top of the line?

15
00:00:33,696 --> 00:00:35,787
Allegra, what's better about this company?

16
00:00:35,787 --> 00:00:38,251
- [Allegra] You only have
to pay six dollars per shirt.

17
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:40,714
- You only have to pay
six dollars per shirt.

18
00:00:40,714 --> 00:00:42,272
So, you're telling me six dollars per shirt

19
00:00:42,272 --> 00:00:45,685
is definitely better than
eight dollars per shirt?

20
00:00:45,685 --> 00:00:46,474
Right?

21
00:00:46,474 --> 00:00:49,077
Okay, what's the
disadvantage to this plan?

22
00:00:49,077 --> 00:00:51,284
Who can tell me the
disadvantage to this one, Sarah?

23
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:53,162
- [Sarah] You have
to pay 50 dollars first.

24
00:00:53,162 --> 00:00:56,948
- You have to pay 50
dollars up front, okay?

25
00:00:56,948 --> 00:01:01,609
So, if I were going to buy a lot of shirts,

26
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:04,681
let's say I was going to buy 200 shirts,

27
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:06,857
which company do you
think would be the best

28
00:01:06,857 --> 00:01:07,838
for 200 shirts?

29
00:01:07,838 --> 00:01:08,627
Taylor?

30
00:01:08,627 --> 00:01:12,126
- [Taylor] I think the
T-Shirts R Us would be better,

31
00:01:12,126 --> 00:01:14,174
because you only have to pay 50 dollars

32
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:17,171
and the shirts are only
six dollars per shirt.

33
00:01:17,171 --> 00:01:20,467
- Yeah, for this one
the more shirts you buy,

34
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:23,485
the better deal it becomes, right?

35
00:01:23,485 --> 00:01:24,829
But for this one, if
you're not going to buy,

36
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:27,986
if we were only going to
buy for say 10 people,

37
00:01:27,986 --> 00:01:29,842
would we want to pay
that 50 dollars up front?

38
00:01:29,842 --> 00:01:31,421
Are we probably going to buy enough shirts

39
00:01:31,421 --> 00:01:32,978
to make up that difference?

40
00:01:32,978 --> 00:01:34,002
Probably not, okay.

41
00:01:34,002 --> 00:01:36,508
So for top of the line
tees, our initial charge,

42
00:01:36,508 --> 00:01:37,884
the nice thing about top of the line,

43
00:01:37,884 --> 00:01:39,463
what's the advantage of top of the line?

44
00:01:39,463 --> 00:01:40,839
- [Students] They're eight dollars.

45
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:42,343
- That it, raise you hand.

46
00:01:42,343 --> 00:01:42,951
Kevin?

47
00:01:42,951 --> 00:01:44,252
- [Kevin] They're only eight dollars.

48
00:01:44,252 --> 00:01:47,718
- They're already eight dollars
but is that their advantage?

49
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:49,856
- [Students] Yes.
- [Patrick] No.

50
00:01:49,856 --> 00:01:51,174
- [Teacher] Patrick says no.

51
00:01:51,174 --> 00:01:53,105
Patrick, is their advantage
that they're eight dollars

52
00:01:53,105 --> 00:01:54,267
per shirt?

53
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:59,148
What's the advantage for top of the line?

54
00:02:00,818 --> 00:02:02,085
- [Patrick] Isn't it because the design

55
00:02:02,085 --> 00:02:03,248
is free?

56
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,200
- Is free, so do we have
to pay anything up front?

57
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,925
- [Students] No.

58
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:08,848
- No, so if Cameron, if you
and I were the only people

59
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:11,375
that wanted to get shirts,
that would probably

60
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:14,767
be a good place to go,
right, because for eight plus

61
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:17,820
eight we pay 16 dollars,
but up here two shirts

62
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,442
is going to be expensive, right?

63
00:02:20,442 --> 00:02:21,145
Right?

64
00:02:21,145 --> 00:02:21,935
- [Students] Yeah.

65
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:25,487
- Yeah, it would be
over 60 dollars, right?

66
00:02:25,487 --> 00:02:26,063
- [Patrick] 62.

67
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,993
- That's not a very good
price for shirts, okay.

68
00:02:27,993 --> 00:02:29,944
Brett?

69
00:02:29,944 --> 00:02:32,195
- [Brett] I kind of
brought this kind of up

70
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:34,073
in my group even though
it like wasn't really part

71
00:02:34,073 --> 00:02:36,827
of the data.
- [Teacher] Okay?

72
00:02:36,827 --> 00:02:38,467
- [Brett] Another thing I kind of thought whenever

73
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:41,784
I was working on this last
night, was if they're charging

74
00:02:41,784 --> 00:02:44,760
money for the graphic,
couldn't it possibly be

75
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,893
like a better graphic, but...

76
00:02:46,893 --> 00:02:49,986
- It could be.

77
00:02:49,986 --> 00:02:51,725
It doesn't necessarily mean that it is,

78
00:02:51,725 --> 00:02:53,858
and I think for this we
would probably be assuming

79
00:02:53,858 --> 00:02:56,301
that the quality would
be at least comparable,

80
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:59,340
maybe not identical but
at least close, okay.

81
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,079
All right.

82
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:05,185
So, let's look at a couple
of different things, okay?

83
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,137
Let's start with these tables.

84
00:03:07,137 --> 00:03:09,281
You guys have had a minute
to look at these tables.

85
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:13,196
What, the first question
says, which of the following

86
00:03:13,196 --> 00:03:15,201
tables represents T-Shirts R Us?

87
00:03:15,201 --> 00:03:17,003
With this being our given information,

88
00:03:17,003 --> 00:03:18,891
which one of these
tables is T-Shirts R Us?

89
00:03:18,891 --> 00:03:20,310
Tell me how you know, Amanda.

90
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,507
- [Amanda] The first
one because the cost

91
00:03:22,507 --> 00:03:25,621
starts at 50 before you even buy any shirts?

92
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:29,664
- Okay, so Amanda says that
this one is T-Shirts R Us,

93
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,624
and how did you know that?

94
00:03:30,624 --> 00:03:32,544
You explained that in a
really interesting way.

95
00:03:32,544 --> 00:03:33,248
How did you say that?

96
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,477
- [Amanda] Because the
costs are 50 before you

97
00:03:35,477 --> 00:03:36,778
buy any of the shirts.

98
00:03:36,778 --> 00:03:38,677
- Yeah, Amanda says this one has to be

99
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:42,250
T-Shirts R Us because
you can see in the table

100
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,042
the initial charge of 50 dollars.

101
00:03:44,042 --> 00:03:45,695
Do you guys agree that you
can see the initial charge

102
00:03:45,695 --> 00:03:46,623
of 50 dollars?

103
00:03:46,623 --> 00:03:47,455
- [Students] Yes.

104
00:03:47,455 --> 00:03:49,823
- Okay, that's one way to say it.

105
00:03:49,823 --> 00:03:50,611
Is there another way?

106
00:03:50,611 --> 00:03:52,627
Lindsay, you had something
interesting on your paper.

107
00:03:52,627 --> 00:03:54,259
What's the other way that we can tell

108
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:55,998
whether or not that's T-Shirts R Us?

109
00:03:55,998 --> 00:04:00,008
- [Lindsay] I divided 30,
divided by five equals six.

110
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:04,243
- Can you tell me where you
got the number 30 and five?

111
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:05,352
- [Lindsay] In t-shirts there were

112
00:04:05,352 --> 00:04:08,018
a five dollar difference.

113
00:04:08,018 --> 00:04:11,069
The t-shirts goes up by five.

114
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:12,807
- Yeah, so this one goes up.

115
00:04:12,807 --> 00:04:16,668
- [Lindsay] And the cost up by 30.

116
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:18,738
And I just divided the two numbers

117
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:22,865
and it told me which
of the companies sells

118
00:04:22,865 --> 00:04:25,607
the shirts for six dollars.

119
00:04:25,607 --> 00:04:27,324
- So she said that she found that the cost

120
00:04:27,324 --> 00:04:30,438
was going up 30 every time
the shirts went up five.

121
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:32,806
So, then to figure out
how much each shirt was,

122
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:35,451
she divided the 30 by six and figured out...

123
00:04:35,451 --> 00:04:38,651
Oh no, not by six, 30 by five

124
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:41,414
and figured out that each shirt was

125
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:44,155
six dollars per shirt.

126
00:04:44,155 --> 00:04:47,589
So, one way to figure it out
is look at the rate of change,

127
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:49,541
right, and another way to figure it out

128
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,101
is to look at the initial cost.

129
00:04:52,101 --> 00:04:54,351
Like, what is it that you
have to pay up front.

130
00:04:54,351 --> 00:04:57,071
So, in this problem can we see both?

131
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:59,364
Can we look at this table and see

132
00:04:59,364 --> 00:05:01,199
here's what you have to pay up front

133
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,314
and then here's what you
have to pay per shirt?

134
00:05:04,314 --> 00:05:05,587
Can you see that?

135
00:05:05,587 --> 00:05:06,297
- [Students] Yes.

136
00:05:06,297 --> 00:05:08,825
- Okay.

137
00:05:11,635 --> 00:05:14,035
Write that down.

138
00:05:17,635 --> 00:05:19,961
All right, so look at
the table and let's talk

139
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:22,051
about the original question that we asked.

140
00:05:22,051 --> 00:05:23,555
The original question that I asked you,

141
00:05:23,555 --> 00:05:25,624
and this was just a pick.

142
00:05:25,624 --> 00:05:27,181
Which company did you think would be

143
00:05:27,181 --> 00:05:30,616
the better option for our 25 students?
- [Student] T-Shirts R' Us.

144
00:05:30,616 --> 00:05:31,960
- What did you find out when you really,

145
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,888
really investigated?

146
00:05:32,888 --> 00:05:33,656
Casey?

147
00:05:33,656 --> 00:05:34,818
- [Casey] They're both 200 each.

148
00:05:34,818 --> 00:05:37,559
- You really find out
for exactly 25 students

149
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:38,786
they both cost...?

150
00:05:38,786 --> 00:05:39,437
- [Students] 200 dollars.

151
00:05:39,437 --> 00:05:40,162
- 200 dollars.

152
00:05:40,162 --> 00:05:43,479
So, if we were just buying
t-shirts for our class,

153
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:45,100
would it matter which company we chose?

154
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:45,708
- [Students] No.

155
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:46,402
- No.

156
00:05:46,402 --> 00:05:48,151
What if we decided we wanted to do all

157
00:05:48,151 --> 00:05:49,932
of my math students?

158
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:53,644
If we decided we wanted to
do all of my math students,

159
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:55,649
which one of these tables would favor

160
00:05:55,649 --> 00:06:00,523
the option of buying it for all 100?

161
00:06:00,523 --> 00:06:03,702
Bree, what do you think?

162
00:06:06,512 --> 00:06:10,475
If we were going to buy
t-shirts for all 100 students,

163
00:06:10,475 --> 00:06:14,624
because at 25, the cost
is the same, right?

164
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,952
Which one of these is
going up more quickly?

165
00:06:17,952 --> 00:06:19,253
- [Bree] The one on the left.

166
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:23,317
- The one on the left's
going up more quickly?

167
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:24,031
What do you think?

168
00:06:24,031 --> 00:06:25,332
Nahla says she disagrees.

169
00:06:25,332 --> 00:06:25,887
Nahla?

170
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:26,815
- [Nahla] The one
on the right is going up

171
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,863
more quickly because it's going up by 40.

172
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,647
- Yeah, this one's going up
how much every five shirts?

173
00:06:31,647 --> 00:06:32,692
- [Students] 40.

174
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,548
- Yeah, this one's going up 40,

175
00:06:34,548 --> 00:06:36,969
and at that same time,
this one's only going up?

176
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:38,217
- [Students] 30.

177
00:06:38,217 --> 00:06:39,444
- 30, right Bree?

178
00:06:39,444 --> 00:06:41,783
So, Bree, which one's going up faster?

179
00:06:41,783 --> 00:06:42,829
- [Bree] The right one.

180
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:44,343
- Yeah, so they're the same here.

181
00:06:44,343 --> 00:06:46,338
Do you guys see they're the same here?

182
00:06:46,338 --> 00:06:47,500
You see that Bree?

183
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,431
But if this one's going up faster,

184
00:06:49,431 --> 00:06:51,689
if I'm going to buy a
whole, if I'm going to buy

185
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:53,409
a lot more shirts, what's
going to eventually

186
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:55,201
happen with this one?

187
00:06:55,201 --> 00:06:56,961
- [Bree] It will increase.

188
00:06:56,961 --> 00:07:00,769
- It's going to get increasingly
more expensive, okay.

189
00:07:00,769 --> 00:07:02,347
So, somebody summarize this for me.

190
00:07:02,347 --> 00:07:04,374
What did we just figure out about tables?

191
00:07:04,374 --> 00:07:06,849
What did we just explain about tables?

192
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:09,227
What can you find on tables?

193
00:07:09,227 --> 00:07:10,635
Sierra, tell me what we can find

194
00:07:10,635 --> 00:07:11,798
by looking at a table?

195
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:12,640
- [Sierra] Y-intercept.

196
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,144
- [Teacher] We can definitely
find the Y-intercept.

197
00:07:14,144 --> 00:07:16,533
Can you tell me how we can
find the Y-intercept?

198
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:19,370
- [Sierra] When the X value is zero.

199
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,941
- When the X value is zero, that's going

200
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:22,784
to be our Y-intercept.

201
00:07:22,784 --> 00:07:24,565
That was an excellent explanation.

202
00:07:24,565 --> 00:07:26,847
Guys, what else can we
find from the graph?

203
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:30,815
We can find the Y-intercept,
what else can we find?

204
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,679
Samantha?

205
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:32,788
- [Samantha] We can find the slope.

206
00:07:32,788 --> 00:07:33,620
- [Teacher] We can find the slope,

207
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,828
and can you summarize
how we found the slope?

208
00:07:35,828 --> 00:07:38,612
- [Samantha] We found the
differences between the y column

209
00:07:38,612 --> 00:07:41,129
and the x column and then
we put in the rise over run.

210
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:43,444
- Yeah, we found the
differences between the y column

211
00:07:43,444 --> 00:07:45,811
and the x column and then
wrote them as the ratio

212
00:07:45,811 --> 00:07:47,390
rise over run.

213
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,065
Excellent job, okay.

214
00:07:49,065 --> 00:07:49,928
So, that's tables.

215
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:50,664
Cameron, question?

216
00:07:50,664 --> 00:07:52,456
- [Cameron] Is it okay
on the table where it says,

217
00:07:52,456 --> 00:07:55,987
like, t-shirts in the
columns, is it okay to put

218
00:07:55,987 --> 00:07:58,099
x and y over them?

219
00:07:58,099 --> 00:07:59,859
- Cameron, if that helps
you understand it then yes,

220
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:02,600
that's completely fine.

221
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,770
But you need to understand that
x and y represent something.

222
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:07,463
Right?

223
00:08:07,463 --> 00:08:08,978
It's okay for you to
think about it as x and y,

224
00:08:08,978 --> 00:08:11,804
but just keep in mind that x represents

225
00:08:11,804 --> 00:08:16,657
the number of t-shirts and
y represents cost, okay?

226
00:08:16,657 --> 00:08:18,428
That's a good question.

227
00:08:18,428 --> 00:08:20,444
All right, now let's look at the graph.

228
00:08:20,444 --> 00:08:25,340
Okay, suppose these two
graphs were given to you.

229
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,291
Okay, look at the graph.

230
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:28,411
Is everything on the graph the same

231
00:08:28,411 --> 00:08:30,214
in terms of the way the graph's set up?

232
00:08:30,214 --> 00:08:31,569
Does the scale set look the same?

233
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:32,027
- [Students] Yeah.

234
00:08:32,027 --> 00:08:35,771
- The x-axis is identical
and the y-axis is identical.

235
00:08:35,771 --> 00:08:37,435
So, let's talk about
the graph for a second.

236
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:38,395
Look at the graph.

237
00:08:38,395 --> 00:08:40,709
Adam, can you look at
that graph and tell me

238
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:43,248
which thing, which one of these two graphs

239
00:08:43,248 --> 00:08:45,957
do you think is top of the line?

240
00:08:45,957 --> 00:08:46,938
- [Adam] The one on the right?

241
00:08:46,938 --> 00:08:47,685
- The one on the right.

242
00:08:47,685 --> 00:08:49,583
Can you tell me why,
because top of the line,

243
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,090
keep in mind, the initial charge was zero

244
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,511
and the cost per shirt was
eight dollars per shirt.

245
00:08:54,511 --> 00:08:58,500
How did you pick this one
to be top of the line?

246
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,452
- [Adam] Because it started at zero?

247
00:09:00,452 --> 00:09:01,892
- Okay, so one of the
things that's important

248
00:09:01,892 --> 00:09:05,070
was that you realized it started at zero.

249
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,620
So, he looked at this and recognized

250
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:12,620
that my, he said starts... at zero.

251
00:09:15,192 --> 00:09:16,728
Okay?

252
00:09:16,728 --> 00:09:17,891
That's important.

253
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,832
How else could we figure
out that that was,

254
00:09:19,832 --> 00:09:21,304
how else could we figure that out?

255
00:09:21,304 --> 00:09:22,627
Allegra?

256
00:09:22,627 --> 00:09:27,627
- [Allegra] I said that
since it was five times eight,

257
00:09:29,037 --> 00:09:31,842
well, that's the first
coordinate it would be.

258
00:09:31,842 --> 00:09:34,626
- Oh, okay so the first
coordinate was five, 40,

259
00:09:34,626 --> 00:09:36,876
so you said five times eight is...?

260
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:37,666
- [Allegra] 40.

261
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,479
- 40, okay, what about this one?

262
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:42,657
- [Allegra] That is 80.

263
00:09:42,657 --> 00:09:44,097
- 10 times eight is 80?

264
00:09:44,097 --> 00:09:47,233
Okay, is that an interesting
way of thinking about it?

265
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:47,980
- [Students] Yes.

266
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,260
- And does that also work?

267
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,945
Does that make sense with this problem?

268
00:09:50,945 --> 00:09:53,409
Starts at zero and every
shirt costs eight dollars,

269
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:55,265
so she said five times
eight, 10 times eight,

270
00:09:55,265 --> 00:09:57,217
and that pattern would
work all the way up.

271
00:09:57,217 --> 00:09:59,168
Is there other ways that I
could identify that this

272
00:09:59,168 --> 00:10:02,742
is top of the line, Amanda?

273
00:10:02,742 --> 00:10:04,021
- [Amanda] I went
down there on the table,

274
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:08,917
that the rate of the pulse goes up faster,
- Uh-Huh?

275
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:11,893
- [Amanda] so, like, when you said how...

276
00:10:11,893 --> 00:10:14,421
- Did you guys here the word
she used to describe that?

277
00:10:14,421 --> 00:10:18,346
She said she recognized
that this rate is going up

278
00:10:18,346 --> 00:10:20,692
faster than this rate.

279
00:10:20,692 --> 00:10:21,503
Do you guys agree with that?

280
00:10:21,503 --> 00:10:22,527
- [Student] The line's more steep.

281
00:10:22,527 --> 00:10:25,940
- Yeah, the line has greater
steepness is the word

282
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,708
you used, steep, right?

283
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:30,142
Yeah, so this one, not
only does it start at zero,

284
00:10:30,142 --> 00:10:31,913
so we can recognize it that way,

285
00:10:31,913 --> 00:10:34,836
but we also recognize that
it's going up more quickly.

286
00:10:34,836 --> 00:10:36,969
This one's going up
eight dollars each shirt

287
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:41,224
and this one's only going
up six dollars each shirt,

288
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,656
because, let's look at the
rate of change for this one.

289
00:10:43,656 --> 00:10:48,648
If we went from zero to five,
that went over five, right?

290
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,899
And then from 50 up to 80, is what?

291
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:52,826
- [Student] 30?

292
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:53,970
- That's... from 50 to 80 is...?

293
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:54,717
- [Student] 30?

294
00:10:54,717 --> 00:10:59,261
- 30, and so 30 over
five gives me how much?

295
00:10:59,261 --> 00:11:00,402
- [Students] Six.

296
00:11:00,402 --> 00:11:03,186
- Six per shirt, okay?

297
00:11:03,186 --> 00:11:04,423
Nahla, you had your hand up?

298
00:11:04,423 --> 00:11:05,138
- [Nahla] Yeah.

299
00:11:05,138 --> 00:11:06,002
- Go ahead.

300
00:11:06,002 --> 00:11:10,810
- [Nahla] I was gonna say, that I understand
that it started at 50?

301
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:15,810
So, that would be T-Shirts R Us?

302
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:16,934
So, if that was T-Shirts R Us,

303
00:11:16,934 --> 00:11:20,347
then the other one had
to be top of the line.

304
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,097
- Guys, did you hear what Nahla said?

305
00:11:22,097 --> 00:11:23,600
Nahla said she looked at this graph

306
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,318
and noticed that this one started at 50,

307
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:29,456
so, because that one started
at 50 it had to be what?

308
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:30,107
- [Students] T-Shirts R Us.

309
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:32,197
- [Teacher] T-Shirts R Us, okay?

310
00:11:32,197 --> 00:11:35,354
So, so what're we talking about?

311
00:11:35,354 --> 00:11:36,933
We're talking about looking at a graph

312
00:11:36,933 --> 00:11:38,021
and finding two things.

313
00:11:38,021 --> 00:11:40,015
What are the two things that
we need to be able to find

314
00:11:40,015 --> 00:11:40,902
from our graph?

315
00:11:40,902 --> 00:11:41,633
Greg tell me one.

316
00:11:41,633 --> 00:11:42,123
- [Greg] Slope.

317
00:11:42,123 --> 00:11:43,051
- We need to do our final slope.

318
00:11:43,051 --> 00:11:46,351
Emanuel tell me the other one.

319
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:47,568
- [Emanuel] The Y?

320
00:11:47,568 --> 00:11:48,533
- We need to be able to find the slope

321
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:49,803
and the y-intercept, okay?

322
00:11:49,803 --> 00:11:51,659
Emanuel, can you summarize for me how

323
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:52,874
to find the y-intercept?

324
00:11:52,874 --> 00:11:54,282
How do you look at a graph and find

325
00:11:54,282 --> 00:11:55,776
the y-intercept?

326
00:11:55,776 --> 00:11:59,050
- [Emanuel] Where the
line crosses the y-axis?

327
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,607
- Where the line crosses the y-axis.

328
00:12:00,607 --> 00:12:02,762
So ,Sierra told us when we're on our table,

329
00:12:02,762 --> 00:12:06,836
we're looking for where...? 
- [Students] the x is zero,

330
00:12:06,836 --> 00:12:10,015
- The x is zero, but on the graph that
means that it crosses

331
00:12:10,015 --> 00:12:10,761
the y-axis.

332
00:12:10,761 --> 00:12:11,689
Okay, nice.

333
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,983
Can somebody tell me from a graph,

334
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,796
how to find slope?

335
00:12:15,796 --> 00:12:17,470
Stella, I haven't heard
from you for a minute.

336
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,403
How do we find slope from a graph?

337
00:12:20,403 --> 00:12:23,486
- [Stella] You use the slope triangle.

338
00:12:23,486 --> 00:12:26,248
- You use the slope triangle.

339
00:12:26,248 --> 00:12:30,838
- [Stella] Uh-huh.
Then it leads your eyes, for example,

340
00:12:30,838 --> 00:12:31,848
can we talk about this one?

341
00:12:31,848 --> 00:12:33,773
- It doesn't matter, you pick
whichever one you'd like.

342
00:12:33,773 --> 00:12:36,998
- [Stella] So, it will
be the rise and speed,

343
00:12:36,998 --> 00:12:38,305
it's going up.

344
00:12:38,305 --> 00:12:39,965
- Yeah, so this is our rise, okay.

345
00:12:39,965 --> 00:12:41,938
- [Stella] And the run
is how far it's going out.

346
00:12:41,938 --> 00:12:43,698
- And the run is how far it's going out.

347
00:12:43,698 --> 00:12:45,437
- [Stella] It's rise over run.

348
00:12:45,437 --> 00:12:48,807
- And then you write it as
a ratio, rise to run, okay?

349
00:12:48,807 --> 00:12:50,738
Excellent.

350
00:12:50,738 --> 00:12:54,748
Guys, I have one final
question on the graph.

351
00:12:54,748 --> 00:12:58,694
So, we picked these, we
did our slope triangles

352
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:02,577
from those blue ones that are drawn right?

353
00:13:02,577 --> 00:13:05,617
And for this one we got 30 over five

354
00:13:05,617 --> 00:13:08,219
and figured out that that was six, right?

355
00:13:08,219 --> 00:13:13,219
Would it matter if I did...,
went too far I think.

356
00:13:18,117 --> 00:13:19,834
Would it matter if I did that?

357
00:13:19,834 --> 00:13:21,466
- [Student] No.

358
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:22,160
- I heard no.

359
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,557
Can someone raise your
hand and explain to me

360
00:13:23,557 --> 00:13:24,741
why that's no?

361
00:13:24,741 --> 00:13:27,034
So, why does it not matter? Sydney?

362
00:13:27,034 --> 00:13:30,543
- [Sydney] Because it's the
same shape, it's just larger.

363
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:31,514
It's a similar figure.

364
00:13:31,514 --> 00:13:33,626
So, I guess if you were
finding rise over run

365
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:37,391
and once you simplify
it, it would be the same?

366
00:13:37,391 --> 00:13:39,225
- Did you guys hear what Sydney said?

367
00:13:39,225 --> 00:13:44,078
Sydney used the word
similar, or used the phrase,

368
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:45,145
similar figures.

369
00:13:45,145 --> 00:13:47,278
What do similar figures mean?

370
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:49,905
What does that mean, Greg?

371
00:13:49,905 --> 00:13:53,998
- [Greg] Like, two
figures that have the,

372
00:13:53,998 --> 00:13:58,998
like they're, they
don't exactly have to be

373
00:13:59,013 --> 00:13:59,992
the same size?

374
00:13:59,992 --> 00:14:03,426
It's like, basically a
dilation of the other.

375
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,517
- It's essentially a dilation.

376
00:14:05,517 --> 00:14:10,517
Okay, so the first one we
did went up 30, over five.

377
00:14:10,861 --> 00:14:12,140
Right?

378
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,559
Well what about the red one?

379
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:16,780
The red one went from five to 20.

380
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:20,311
How much did it go over, if
it went from five to 20? 

381
00:14:20,311 --> 00:14:21,399
Cameron?
- [Cameron] 15?

382
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:23,350
- It went over 15.

383
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:28,350
So, if this one goes over 15,
you sort of used that word,

384
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:31,414
dilation, right?

385
00:14:31,414 --> 00:14:34,475
What's the scale factor from five to 15?

386
00:14:34,475 --> 00:14:35,403
- [Student] Positive 3.

387
00:14:35,403 --> 00:14:38,795
- That's times by positive 3, right?

388
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,323
So, likewise, what should this be?

389
00:14:41,323 --> 00:14:43,413
If my run was 15, what should my rise be?

390
00:14:43,413 --> 00:14:46,357
Raise your hand if you know.

391
00:14:46,357 --> 00:14:46,965
Jaylynn?

392
00:14:46,965 --> 00:14:47,754
- [Jaylynn] 90?

393
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:49,546
- It should be 90.

394
00:14:49,546 --> 00:14:52,031
Okay, so let's check and see if it is.

395
00:14:52,031 --> 00:14:56,927
So, we went from five, so that went 15,

396
00:14:56,927 --> 00:15:00,159
and then we went from 80 up to 170.

397
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:02,891
Now, what's the difference from 80 to 170?

398
00:15:02,891 --> 00:15:04,217
- [Jaylynn] 80 to what?

399
00:15:04,217 --> 00:15:10,774
- 80 to 170.

400
00:15:12,604 --> 00:15:13,240
- [Jaylynn] I don't know.

401
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:13,833
- That's okay.

402
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:14,345
What's the difference?

403
00:15:14,345 --> 00:15:16,360
Who can tell me the
difference from 80 to 170?

404
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:16,968
Sierra?

405
00:15:16,968 --> 00:15:17,779
- [Sierra] 90?

406
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:19,635
- The difference is 90.

407
00:15:19,635 --> 00:15:23,069
So, if I looked at those two ratios,

408
00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:25,256
so, if I looked at those two ratios,

409
00:15:25,256 --> 00:15:28,509
one would give me 90 over 15

410
00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:33,509
and the other one would
give me 30 over five.

411
00:15:33,543 --> 00:15:34,589
Are those equal?

412
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:35,047
- [Student] Yep.

413
00:15:35,047 --> 00:15:36,306
- Yes, that is, let's check it.

414
00:15:36,306 --> 00:15:38,791
Are each of those giving
you six dollars per shirt?

415
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:39,303
- [Students] Yes.

416
00:15:39,303 --> 00:15:42,204
- Yeah, so how do we
find slope from a graph?

417
00:15:42,204 --> 00:15:45,617
Taylor said we make the slope triangle,

418
00:15:45,617 --> 00:15:47,175
and does it matter
which triangle you pick?

419
00:15:47,175 --> 00:15:47,846
- [Student] Nope.

420
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,521
- No, because they should be proportional.

421
00:15:49,521 --> 00:15:51,857
They should be dilations
of one another.

422
00:15:51,857 --> 00:15:53,371
Okay, it be a good reference to something

423
00:15:53,371 --> 00:15:54,395
that we learned.

424
00:15:54,395 --> 00:15:55,249
- [Student] Can you
show us how to start out

425
00:15:55,249 --> 00:15:57,894
like the first one?

426
00:15:57,894 --> 00:15:59,590
Or the first few pages?

427
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:02,214
- So, the question was,
do you have to start out

428
00:16:02,214 --> 00:16:04,400
at the first one?

429
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,467
- [Sydney] No.

430
00:16:05,467 --> 00:16:07,237
- Sydney, why no?

431
00:16:07,237 --> 00:16:10,335
- [Sydney] Because,
if the pretense is that

432
00:16:10,335 --> 00:16:14,522
the initial charge is 50
dollars, then you don't have to.

433
00:16:14,522 --> 00:16:17,306
Unlike the other one, it started at zero.

434
00:16:17,306 --> 00:16:19,375
- [Teacher] Mm-hm?

435
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,719
- Are you talking about
the final slope, Nahla?

436
00:16:20,719 --> 00:16:21,860
- [Nahla] Yes.

437
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,652
- Okay, Nahla, you can
start at the first point,

438
00:16:23,652 --> 00:16:28,548
but you don't have to,
because if it's linear,

439
00:16:28,548 --> 00:16:30,617
should the pattern ever change?
- [Nahla] No.

440
00:16:30,617 --> 00:16:32,708
So, if the pattern never changes,

441
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,585
does it matter which two points you pick?

442
00:16:34,585 --> 00:16:35,624
- [Nahla] No.

443
00:16:35,624 --> 00:16:37,326
- Any two exact points you pick,
should still give you

444
00:16:37,326 --> 00:16:39,395
the same rate of change.

445
00:16:39,395 --> 00:16:41,091
That was a great question.

446
00:16:41,091 --> 00:16:43,928
Okay, all right.

447
00:16:43,928 --> 00:16:45,763
So now, this is a different one.

448
00:16:45,763 --> 00:16:48,099
So, on the last one, I gave you the verbal.

449
00:16:48,099 --> 00:16:50,563
Right, I did, I said T-Shirts R Us

450
00:16:50,563 --> 00:16:53,837
and gave you the verbal expression.

451
00:16:53,837 --> 00:16:55,672
This time I'm not giving you that.

452
00:16:55,672 --> 00:16:58,327
This time, we've got a
third t-shirt company.

453
00:16:58,327 --> 00:17:00,642
The third t-shirt company Tee Time,

454
00:17:00,642 --> 00:17:04,355
they explain to us, this
is their function cost.

455
00:17:04,355 --> 00:17:09,355
Cost is equal to 4.50x, plus 25.

456
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:12,152
My question is, what does that mean?

457
00:17:12,152 --> 00:17:14,936
Who can tell me what it means to do 4.5x,

458
00:17:14,936 --> 00:17:16,056
plus 25?

459
00:17:16,056 --> 00:17:17,101
Samantha, start me.

460
00:17:17,101 --> 00:17:18,978
- [Samantha] We would charge
25 dollars for the graphic,

461
00:17:18,978 --> 00:17:21,208
and 4.50 per each t-shirt.

462
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,554
- Okay, so what do we have
to pay no matter what?

463
00:17:23,554 --> 00:17:25,805
Patrick, what is the one
thing we have to pay?

464
00:17:25,805 --> 00:17:28,546
If we ordered a shirt,
what's the one thing

465
00:17:28,546 --> 00:17:30,284
they're going to charge us?

466
00:17:30,284 --> 00:17:31,095
- [Patrick] For the design?

467
00:17:31,095 --> 00:17:32,791
They're going to charge
us that 25 dollars for

468
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:36,231
the design, right? But then...
- [Student] Each time?

469
00:17:36,231 --> 00:17:38,095
- Huh?
- [Student] Each time?

470
00:17:38,095 --> 00:17:39,366
- Well, that's a great question.

471
00:17:39,366 --> 00:17:41,580
Do they charge us 25 dollars every time?

472
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:45,270
That's a great, great,
great, great, great question.

473
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,155
No, why not?

474
00:17:46,155 --> 00:17:48,715
What's the 25 dollars for?

475
00:17:48,715 --> 00:17:51,712
- [Student] It's for
the design on every shirt.

476
00:17:51,712 --> 00:17:55,360
- It's for the design, and that
is the design that we're

477
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,715
going to use for all of our shirts.

478
00:17:56,715 --> 00:17:57,621
So, that's an important question.

479
00:17:57,621 --> 00:18:01,930
Does the y-intercept explain
anything about change?

480
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,093
Will the y-intercept change?

481
00:18:03,093 --> 00:18:05,045
Will it move up or down?

482
00:18:05,045 --> 00:18:08,714
No, the initial cost is whatever
the initial cost is, okay?

483
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:10,453
That was a great question.

484
00:18:10,453 --> 00:18:12,244
Who can tell me a little
bit about what this graph

485
00:18:12,244 --> 00:18:15,636
would look like?

486
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,055
What would the graph look like?

487
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:19,743
- [Student] It looks like a zero,
 but I think

488
00:18:19,743 --> 00:18:22,089
it'd start at 25 here.

489
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:24,222
- It would start at 25.

490
00:18:24,222 --> 00:18:27,657
So, it's go to start somewhere
right in here, okay?

491
00:18:27,657 --> 00:18:29,374
And I'm not sure why those numbers are

492
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:32,489
on the table, but they shouldn't be there.

493
00:18:32,489 --> 00:18:33,779
Okay, but that's okay.

494
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,262
We can move forward from it.

495
00:18:35,262 --> 00:18:36,051
We can do this.

496
00:18:36,051 --> 00:18:38,739
What should the cost be initially?

497
00:18:38,739 --> 00:18:39,389
- [Students] 25.

498
00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:43,860
- The cost should initially
be 25 dollars, okay.

499
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,037
Then if we buy five shirts,
how can we figure that out?

500
00:18:47,037 --> 00:18:49,149
Who can tell me how to figure that out?

501
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:50,247
Ah, (inaudible)?

502
00:18:50,247 --> 00:18:52,754
- [Student] You can
plug in the value of five

503
00:18:52,754 --> 00:18:55,346
in the equation thing.

504
00:18:55,346 --> 00:18:57,255
- You can plug into the equation?

505
00:18:57,255 --> 00:19:00,017
Ooh, I know what we can use.

506
00:19:00,017 --> 00:19:05,017
Oh, we can use...

507
00:19:05,361 --> 00:19:07,004
I heard somebody say this earlier.

508
00:19:07,004 --> 00:19:09,958
We can use a calculator right?

509
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,558
Where would I put this
information in the calculator?

510
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:12,326
- [Student] Y equals.

511
00:19:12,326 --> 00:19:15,014
- I'd go to y equals, excellent.

512
00:19:15,014 --> 00:19:17,851
Okay, and I put it in there my function.

513
00:19:17,851 --> 00:19:22,851
Right, so I've got 4.50x, plus 25.

514
00:19:24,795 --> 00:19:26,096
- [Student] And then you press second?

515
00:19:26,096 --> 00:19:27,589
- Yeah, what am I trying to look at?

516
00:19:27,589 --> 00:19:29,498
I'm trying to look at my table.

517
00:19:29,498 --> 00:19:30,981
Let's go back for just a second.

518
00:19:30,981 --> 00:19:32,997
Look at the table that's
already given to us.

519
00:19:32,997 --> 00:19:34,789
What do they do in their table?

520
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:35,994
- [Students] It increases by five.

521
00:19:35,994 --> 00:19:38,639
- They increase their x values by five.

522
00:19:38,639 --> 00:19:41,028
So, do I want to set
mine up to go by fives?

523
00:19:41,028 --> 00:19:41,871
- [Students] Yes.

524
00:19:41,871 --> 00:19:43,492
- Yeah, so how do, didn't I,

525
00:19:43,492 --> 00:19:44,751
how do I set up a table?

526
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:45,561
- Where do I do that?

527
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:49,390
- [Student] It's a
second and it's on top of a window?

528
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:52,505
- Yeah, it's second and
it's on top of a window,

529
00:19:52,505 --> 00:19:54,931
we've got a table set up.

530
00:19:54,931 --> 00:19:55,929
Where do we want to start our table?

531
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:57,230
What's the first number we need?

532
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:57,827
- [Students] Five.

533
00:19:57,827 --> 00:20:00,291
- Okay, because we
already know zero, right?

534
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,755
And then how much do we
want to increase each time?

535
00:20:02,755 --> 00:20:03,406
- [Students] Five.

536
00:20:03,406 --> 00:20:08,184
- We want to increase
each time by fives, okay.

537
00:20:08,184 --> 00:20:09,368
Are we okay with that?

538
00:20:09,368 --> 00:20:11,416
Now, where do I go to
actually have the calculator

539
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:12,546
give me the information?

540
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:13,570
Sydney, where do I go?

541
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:14,829
- [Sydney] You press second and then

542
00:20:14,829 --> 00:20:16,429
you press the graph button?

543
00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:19,095
- Second, graph, which
will give me the table.

544
00:20:19,095 --> 00:20:20,791
So, I will give you a minute to make sure

545
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,252
that your table is still being corrected,

546
00:20:22,252 --> 00:20:24,508
because I'm going to need
you to help me with mine.

547
00:20:25,943 --> 00:20:28,166
I don't know why I put
the wrong table up there.

548
00:20:31,084 --> 00:20:32,172
Okay, we good?

549
00:20:32,172 --> 00:20:33,846
All right so we used the
calculator to help us

550
00:20:33,846 --> 00:20:34,742
get our table.

551
00:20:34,742 --> 00:20:36,299
What was it in fives?

552
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:37,974
Who can help me with this?

553
00:20:37,974 --> 00:20:39,275
Help me with this, Cameron, real quick.

554
00:20:39,275 --> 00:20:40,619
- [Cameron] 47.5.

555
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:43,040
- That's 47.5, or 47.50, right?

556
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,384
What about tens?

557
00:20:44,384 --> 00:20:45,376
- [Cameron] 70.
