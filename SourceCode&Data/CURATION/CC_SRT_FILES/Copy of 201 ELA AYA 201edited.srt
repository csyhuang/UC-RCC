1
00:00:00,155 --> 00:00:00,898
- Let's go.

2
00:00:00,898 --> 00:00:02,186
- Okay.
- (Teacher) Continue.

3
00:00:03,186 --> 00:00:06,007
- Yes. All right scholars,
here's my question.

4
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:08,514
What do you think...actually, let me start

5
00:00:08,514 --> 00:00:10,093
by quoting the passage.

6
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:13,135
So it says, they can
either trust or predict

7
00:00:13,135 --> 00:00:16,153
what Chacko's attitude
would be, and they were

8
00:00:16,153 --> 00:00:18,266
trying to hide that, get rid of it all,

9
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:19,520
before Chacko returned.

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,633
So, what do you think Chacko's opinion

11
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:25,696
of all of this chaos would be?

12
00:00:25,696 --> 00:00:27,112
- Could you just be particular with...

13
00:00:27,112 --> 00:00:30,038
the chaos you were talking
about? What's that?

14
00:00:30,038 --> 00:00:33,439
- The entire situation,
the steamy love affair,

15
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,038
and the reaction on Baby Kochamma's part.

16
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:38,175
And Mammachi's part.

17
00:00:38,175 --> 00:00:38,779
- Got it.

18
00:00:38,779 --> 00:00:40,033
- I don't think he'd be happy

19
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:42,424
about the love affair,
cause as it says, it's like,

20
00:00:42,424 --> 00:00:44,584
she had defiled generations of breeding

21
00:00:44,584 --> 00:00:47,007
like the little blessed
one, blessed personally by

22
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:48,771
the Patriarch of...

23
00:00:48,771 --> 00:00:49,514
- [Teacher] Antioch.

24
00:00:49,514 --> 00:00:51,697
- Antioch, an imperial
entomologist, and Rhodes Scholar

25
00:00:51,697 --> 00:00:54,413
from Oxford, so it's like
she had taken what their family

26
00:00:54,413 --> 00:00:55,783
had worked for for so long, and just...

27
00:00:55,783 --> 00:00:57,246
thrown it out the window.

28
00:00:57,246 --> 00:00:59,359
- I'm gonna have to
disagree with that Becca,

29
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,134
I mean, I think that
Chacko is a liberal type.

30
00:01:03,134 --> 00:01:05,241
He is very progressive, he's a Marxist,

31
00:01:05,241 --> 00:01:09,111
he didn't allow his father
to beat his mother as

32
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:13,175
most Indians...Traditionalists,
probably would be OK with.

33
00:01:13,175 --> 00:01:15,613
I think that Chacko would be
no more angry about the whole

34
00:01:15,613 --> 00:01:17,679
affair than anybody would be if,

35
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:22,541
some guy was having an
affair with his sister.

36
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:26,929
As a social ideal, I think he
would be fine with everything.

37
00:01:26,929 --> 00:01:30,923
- I agree because I feel
like, oh God I had this

38
00:01:30,923 --> 00:01:32,827
whole plan of something to
say and I can't remember.

39
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:33,801
Sorry.

40
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:35,033
- No, it's not your fault.

41
00:01:35,033 --> 00:01:37,355
- (Teacher) Well, what is the
only thing that made Chacko

42
00:01:37,355 --> 00:01:40,338
upset at Mammachi?

43
00:01:40,338 --> 00:01:44,253
- Was it that she abandoned her children?

44
00:01:44,253 --> 00:01:45,291
Oh, I got it.

45
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:49,399
Yeah, I feel like the
most of this passage,

46
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:50,886
though it's third person narration,

47
00:01:50,886 --> 00:01:52,813
it really feels like it's coming out of

48
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:54,189
Baby Kochamma's mouth, and it's like

49
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:58,833
her diction throughout all
of the italicized stuff.

50
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:01,782
The whole central paragraph
where it uses a lot of

51
00:02:01,782 --> 00:02:05,288
dirty diction like mud and
filthy and coarse and black.

52
00:02:05,288 --> 00:02:07,122
To quote the passage once again.

53
00:02:07,122 --> 00:02:11,116
So, I feel like that all
really Baby Kochamma's words

54
00:02:11,116 --> 00:02:12,555
and not necessarily Baba's beliefs,

55
00:02:12,555 --> 00:02:14,645
and I feel like they have
really contrasted beliefs.

56
00:02:14,645 --> 00:02:16,851
- (Teacher) Yeah, I mean I
feel like all the diction

57
00:02:16,851 --> 00:02:19,219
you were talking about,
for instance, when it says,

58
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:22,702
"Mammachi's rage at the old
one-eyed Paravan standing

59
00:02:22,702 --> 00:02:25,372
in the rain, drunk, dribbling
and covered in mud..."

60
00:02:25,372 --> 00:02:27,926
And it repeats mud a
lot, and I think it's...

61
00:02:27,926 --> 00:02:32,384
that's just kind of dirty and
the action is really impure

62
00:02:32,384 --> 00:02:35,426
and they're trying... and almost
like mud covers things up.

63
00:02:35,426 --> 00:02:37,307
So it's almost like it
should be covered up.

64
00:02:37,307 --> 00:02:38,700
And they were trying to cover it up.

65
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,588
- But don't you feel like they
used Chacko not being there

66
00:02:41,588 --> 00:02:43,935
and coming back as an excuse
to do everything they do.

67
00:02:43,935 --> 00:02:46,418
Oh, he's coming back
so we have to do this.

68
00:02:46,418 --> 00:02:48,927
They kind of use him
as the excuse to do it.

69
00:02:48,927 --> 00:02:51,158
- Well, it's sort of like
Chacko could intervene,

70
00:02:51,158 --> 00:02:52,574
and so we have to do it now

71
00:02:52,574 --> 00:02:54,733
so we can't miss our
chance to do it again.

72
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:56,126
- I think that's important, actually.

73
00:02:56,126 --> 00:02:59,964
I think that a theme of

74
00:02:59,964 --> 00:03:01,874
unintended consequences

75
00:03:01,874 --> 00:03:04,212
like it says here, "It wasn't
their fault when the whole

76
00:03:04,212 --> 00:03:06,511
"thing spun like a deranged top."

77
00:03:06,511 --> 00:03:08,532
I think the theme of
unintended consequences is

78
00:03:08,532 --> 00:03:13,623
really crucial to both
the book and the movie.

79
00:03:13,623 --> 00:03:18,035
In the movie, for example,
when Mahuditi says

80
00:03:18,035 --> 00:03:20,217
she thinks she knows what
the consequences will be

81
00:03:20,217 --> 00:03:23,747
if Kayani gets married, but
the unintended consequences

82
00:03:23,747 --> 00:03:26,068
confound the defilement that she commits by

83
00:03:26,068 --> 00:03:29,298
him being around.

84
00:03:29,298 --> 00:03:33,249
- I think that's... this
book and movie is really

85
00:03:33,249 --> 00:03:35,780
trying to say, is this is
what happens when you set

86
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,427
up rules and don't adapt
to social conditions

87
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:44,225
which are inevitably bound to change.

88
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:45,121
(laughter)

89
00:03:45,121 --> 00:03:50,613
- I'll just go. (laughter)

90
00:03:50,613 --> 00:03:53,357
In the fourth paragraph, they
talk about having a plan.

91
00:03:53,357 --> 00:03:56,491
It's very orderly, and
they said that Kochu Maria

92
00:03:56,491 --> 00:04:00,233
was a midget lieutenant.

93
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:02,534
They had this very
organized and planned out,

94
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:05,088
even though in the second paragraph,

95
00:04:05,088 --> 00:04:07,526
"she shuddered with a
school-girl shudder."

96
00:04:07,526 --> 00:04:10,707
It's like her childish
emotions are being turned into

97
00:04:10,707 --> 00:04:13,587
or coming out through her adult form where

98
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,744
she has the power to do stuff.

99
00:04:16,744 --> 00:04:19,298
- Yeah, on that I really
want to say cause it says,

100
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:20,854
"school-girl shudder" at the beginning.

101
00:04:20,854 --> 00:04:23,431
And then it back in the fourth paragraph,

102
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:24,940
when it's talking about their plan,

103
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,844
they're referred to as,
"the two old ladies".

104
00:04:26,844 --> 00:04:29,445
So that's contrasting in
a way to be described,

105
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:33,415
which obviously it's important.

106
00:04:33,415 --> 00:04:38,369
- Yeah, I think that's one
of the themes of the passage.

107
00:04:38,369 --> 00:04:42,362
Conflicts between age and
which one is ultimately...

108
00:04:42,362 --> 00:04:46,734
I don't want to say better,
but a better advantage.

109
00:04:46,734 --> 00:04:48,359
I guess.

110
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:49,195
- Like in authority?

111
00:04:49,195 --> 00:04:50,542
- Between age and youth, you mean?

112
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:52,980
- Between old and young.

113
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,069
- Yeah, age and youth.

114
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:57,639
Which one

115
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:02,795
can have a better life according to them.

116
00:05:02,795 --> 00:05:03,876
- They also play with age.

117
00:05:03,876 --> 00:05:05,989
When they locked Ammu
up, it's kind of like

118
00:05:05,989 --> 00:05:07,034
putting her in time out,

119
00:05:07,034 --> 00:05:08,682
like they tricked her in to her room,

120
00:05:08,682 --> 00:05:10,516
which is also a parallel
I saw in the movie

121
00:05:10,516 --> 00:05:13,837
when they locked Kalyani up
so she couldn't get married.

122
00:05:13,837 --> 00:05:18,333
It was to keep them from doing stuff.

123
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:23,569
- I just want to bring up
another theme of the passage.

124
00:05:23,569 --> 00:05:25,073
Where it's the very
beginning where it's before

125
00:05:25,073 --> 00:05:27,813
we are completely ruined
by the (inaudible).

126
00:05:27,813 --> 00:05:33,444
It kind of presents this idea that

127
00:05:33,444 --> 00:05:34,744
society is not built

128
00:05:34,744 --> 00:05:39,237
on the basis of individual
needs, what you do.

129
00:05:39,237 --> 00:05:43,243
In this society, at least,
affects everybody around you.

130
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:46,680
And it kind of contrasts

131
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,780
Ammu's individualism with

132
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,073
what societal hierarchy,

133
00:05:52,073 --> 00:05:54,255
and how these two women

134
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:56,090
are higher on the hierarchy,

135
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,554
so they have authority over her,

136
00:05:57,554 --> 00:06:00,037
and so they're telling her not to do this.

137
00:06:00,037 --> 00:06:03,427
And they're presenting
their authority over her.

138
00:06:03,427 --> 00:06:05,076
And Chacko's even higher than them,

139
00:06:05,076 --> 00:06:07,862
just cause he's a guy.

140
00:06:07,862 --> 00:06:11,159
- When the passage lists
the life cycle events,

141
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:14,131
the weddings, the funerals, baptisms,

142
00:06:14,131 --> 00:06:17,707
and birthday parties, it
says for generations to come,

143
00:06:17,707 --> 00:06:19,912
so I feel like what Peter was saying,

144
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:22,188
it affects all of society.

145
00:06:22,188 --> 00:06:25,949
That also ties in with the
age because the weddings

146
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:27,877
are for younger people.

147
00:06:27,877 --> 00:06:29,967
The funerals are when you die.

148
00:06:29,967 --> 00:06:32,521
The baptisms are when you are just born.

149
00:06:32,521 --> 00:06:35,632
So it's saying it will affect everybody

150
00:06:35,632 --> 00:06:40,532
at all parts of their life,
that's how profound it is.

151
00:06:40,532 --> 00:06:42,557
- And even
that sentence that Peter

152
00:06:42,557 --> 00:06:44,786
was talking about, before
it goes any further.

153
00:06:44,786 --> 00:06:46,551
Before we are completely ruined,

154
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:49,802
I think that's also
just family selfishness

155
00:06:49,802 --> 00:06:52,240
because they're just
projecting what her...

156
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,978
the consequences of her
actions will be for them.

157
00:06:55,978 --> 00:06:57,464
Not necessarily for her.

158
00:06:57,464 --> 00:07:01,202
And in the movie, where
the leader of that house

159
00:07:01,202 --> 00:07:04,778
of she's just really
concerned about herself.

160
00:07:04,778 --> 00:07:07,060
She'll sacrifice all of the other women

161
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,941
just so she's comfortable.

162
00:07:08,941 --> 00:07:11,333
- But does she also use a we.

163
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:14,769
I think both Baby Kochamma and Diti

164
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:16,215
say the same thing.

165
00:07:16,215 --> 00:07:18,979
We're gonna be ruined by this.

166
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:20,209
We we we.

167
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:23,831
(laughter)

168
00:07:23,831 --> 00:07:25,781
- In regards to that, I think...

169
00:07:25,781 --> 00:07:28,915
In water, you know how all the widows

170
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:32,234
they sorta put them together, and they
sort of create this unity.

171
00:07:32,234 --> 00:07:36,855
It's all out of despair because
they all lost something.

172
00:07:36,855 --> 00:07:40,430
In a sense, Mammachi lost her former love,

173
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,847
and so did Ammu.

174
00:07:41,847 --> 00:07:44,658
Ammu had babies without...

175
00:07:44,658 --> 00:07:47,960
It wasn't a formal tradition.

176
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,215
The way she had her babies.

177
00:07:49,215 --> 00:07:51,586
And so in a sense, she has...

178
00:07:51,586 --> 00:07:55,925
She's in grievance,

179
00:07:55,925 --> 00:08:00,130
and so those two aspects
unites these women.

180
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,829
- Yeah, they're all widows.

181
00:08:01,829 --> 00:08:02,850
- Yeah, they're all widows.

182
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,824
and that really...

183
00:08:04,824 --> 00:08:06,519
- But does that give them right to be...

184
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,955
- Oh understand, that's why
I feel like it says, "we".

185
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:12,232
Not "we", like our
family, but more of like,

186
00:08:12,232 --> 00:08:15,366
"we" women who are widowed.

187
00:08:15,366 --> 00:08:17,618
- (Teacher) Austin, what do you think?

188
00:08:17,618 --> 00:08:21,217
Do you think that gives
them the right to...

189
00:08:21,217 --> 00:08:24,165
because they've also lost and because

190
00:08:24,165 --> 00:08:26,487
Baby Kochamma and Mammachi
has also experienced

191
00:08:26,487 --> 00:08:29,668
trauma, so that also means Diti, as well.

192
00:08:29,668 --> 00:08:31,898
Her husband died when she was young.

193
00:08:31,898 --> 00:08:39,044
Does that give them the
right to take that...?

194
00:08:39,044 --> 00:08:39,681
- I don't think so,

195
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:42,398
cause that was actually
one of my questions.

196
00:08:43,938 --> 00:08:52,401
Especially when it says,

197
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:54,692
"Her tolerance immense
needs, as far as her son

198
00:08:54,692 --> 00:08:56,660
"was concerned became the fuel for

199
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,494
"unimaginable fury at her daughter".

200
00:08:58,494 --> 00:08:59,907
And then just my question was,

201
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,927
is Baby Kochamma's actions motivated by

202
00:09:01,927 --> 00:09:07,564
Indian society or her own emotions?

203
00:09:07,564 --> 00:09:10,478
So I don't think that
they should be able to

204
00:09:10,478 --> 00:09:12,683
from their past experience...

205
00:09:12,683 --> 00:09:15,354
take it out on everybody else.

206
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,559
- I think that what we're
talking about right now,

207
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:19,835
maybe be reason that Ghandi
appears at the end of the film.

208
00:09:19,835 --> 00:09:23,364
Because Ghandi, as he is
portrayed in water is a symbol

209
00:09:23,364 --> 00:09:24,757
of rationalism.

210
00:09:24,757 --> 00:09:30,497
And it's... when he shows up,

211
00:09:30,497 --> 00:09:33,331
nice Diti sees that (inaudible)
may have a refuge from

212
00:09:33,331 --> 00:09:39,354
cycles of hatred and
of tradition conceived

213
00:09:39,354 --> 00:09:43,933
for the purpose of
basically personal gain.

214
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:46,456
Ghandi's existence in the movie is

215
00:09:46,456 --> 00:09:50,185
indictments of almost every
action taken in this passage

216
00:09:50,185 --> 00:09:52,925
by the scheming old women.

217
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,920
- I think that Ghandi, in
the movie, represents more

218
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,401
of rebirth because they talk about how

219
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:03,304
much society will change
once Ghandi takes power.

220
00:10:03,304 --> 00:10:08,938
The widows will gain power.

221
00:10:08,938 --> 00:10:12,760
The untouchables won't
be untouchable anymore.

222
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,526
They'll gain more rights.

223
00:10:14,526 --> 00:10:19,054
So I think they look at him
as, not really rationalism,

224
00:10:19,054 --> 00:10:22,417
because some people think
that he's just crazy.

225
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:26,359
The Brahmin caste

226
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:27,909
don't see him as rational,

227
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:33,065
so I think it's more of a
hope in an idealized society.

228
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:36,404
- Building off of what she said,

229
00:10:36,404 --> 00:10:39,547
how Ghandi represents re-birth,

230
00:10:39,547 --> 00:10:43,898
I think coincides with

231
00:10:43,898 --> 00:10:45,221
the movie's title, "Water".

232
00:10:45,221 --> 00:10:47,296
For me, at least, the way I saw it.

233
00:10:47,296 --> 00:10:52,032
I felt like water was
rebirth throughout the movie.

234
00:10:52,032 --> 00:10:55,864
They washed themselves... it
was washing away their sins.

235
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:59,555
Being reborn. I thought who's the girl?

236
00:10:59,555 --> 00:11:00,832
The one who killed herself.

237
00:11:00,832 --> 00:11:02,457
- Kalyani

238
00:11:02,457 --> 00:11:05,229
- I thought that it was
symbolic when she drown herself.

239
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:07,736
Because the way she was killing herself,

240
00:11:07,736 --> 00:11:09,872
she was submersing herself in water,

241
00:11:09,872 --> 00:11:11,799
and I thought since
water was clearing away

242
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:13,820
your sins and stuff, she in a sense,

243
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,515
she was clearing away her sins.

244
00:11:15,515 --> 00:11:19,772
And so she would go to
the next life sinless.

245
00:11:19,772 --> 00:11:24,082
- I think that the drowning
of Kalyani parallels to how

246
00:11:24,082 --> 00:11:25,422
Sophie Mol drowned.

247
00:11:25,422 --> 00:11:29,166
How it's like the innocent life

248
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,866
was taken by the water.

249
00:11:31,866 --> 00:11:33,781
Which isn't really... innocence, too.

250
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:37,194
- But was Kalyani innocent?

251
00:11:37,194 --> 00:11:42,782
- I think that if she hadn't
been forced to do things 
she would have been...

252
00:11:42,782 --> 00:11:45,367
she didn't feel right
about what she had done.

253
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:46,830
- I'm gonna take the
opposite view point to

254
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,205
the water that symbols of
inescapability in the movie

255
00:11:49,205 --> 00:11:54,499
because of the way... in
both the movie and the book.

256
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:56,843
It says the fisherman had
already found Sophie Mol.

257
00:11:56,843 --> 00:11:58,353
She...

258
00:11:58,353 --> 00:12:01,047
They drowned trying to cross the river,

259
00:12:01,047 --> 00:12:04,274
and Kalyani loses everything
when she crosses the river

260
00:12:04,274 --> 00:12:07,715
and realizes who Norian really is.

261
00:12:07,715 --> 00:12:10,201
The river is important in both works.

262
00:12:10,201 --> 00:12:12,361
It's an inescapable wall.

263
00:12:12,361 --> 00:12:21,472
So I don't think water is
portrayed as a good image.

264
00:12:21,472 --> 00:12:26,301
- I mean, it could possibly be both.

265
00:12:26,301 --> 00:12:28,932
I think Peter made a
pretty good point about it.

266
00:12:28,932 --> 00:12:34,032
Sam did with Kalyani's death
and Sophie Mol's death.

267
00:12:34,032 --> 00:12:35,362
But I think it could be both.

268
00:12:35,362 --> 00:12:37,336
- I think it's a duality thing.

269
00:12:37,336 --> 00:12:39,613
And then going on combining
what both ya'll said,

270
00:12:39,613 --> 00:12:41,238
where you said it's an inescapably,

271
00:12:41,238 --> 00:12:44,256
and the way they view it
as washing away their sins.

272
00:12:44,256 --> 00:12:47,204
View it as a cleansing
thing also, for example,

273
00:12:47,204 --> 00:12:49,573
emphasizes the irrationality
of all their beliefs.

274
00:12:49,573 --> 00:12:51,476
And they're cleaning themself in this...

275
00:12:51,476 --> 00:12:53,962
if water is just viewed a symbol,

276
00:12:53,962 --> 00:12:56,538
they're cleaning themselves
with something that's bad.

277
00:12:56,538 --> 00:12:57,885
I also don't think that...

278
00:12:57,885 --> 00:12:59,651
- They depend on the water, too,

279
00:12:59,651 --> 00:13:00,787
to get their food from it.

280
00:13:00,787 --> 00:13:01,693
They wash themselves in it.

281
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:05,013
Yet, it's also... it creates
this... it's something that

282
00:13:05,013 --> 00:13:07,359
the Paravans are trying to overcome.

283
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:10,029
A lot of people are trying
to overcome this barrier,

284
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:11,214
but they depend on it.

285
00:13:11,214 --> 00:13:12,490
They still need it.

286
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:16,179
So it's contrasting what they believe...

287
00:13:16,179 --> 00:13:16,768
- Just like a duality thing.

288
00:13:16,768 --> 00:13:17,349
- Yeah.

289
00:13:17,349 --> 00:13:19,532
- It's the family and God's talkings.

290
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,064
Their immediate family.

291
00:13:21,064 --> 00:13:22,805
They depend on each other

292
00:13:22,805 --> 00:13:25,197
because when you're a child,

293
00:13:25,197 --> 00:13:29,771
you have to have an older
figure to help you grow up.

294
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:32,372
But, they are also...

295
00:13:32,372 --> 00:13:36,156
They cause the turmoil with each other.

296
00:13:36,156 --> 00:13:41,503
They create their own
problems, pretty much.

297
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,338
- It's like you can't live with them,

298
00:13:42,338 --> 00:13:43,872
but you can't live without them.

299
00:13:43,872 --> 00:13:45,497
- (Teacher) Susan, did
you have a question?

300
00:13:45,497 --> 00:13:49,082
- (Susan) Yes, I did.

301
00:13:49,082 --> 00:13:51,406
Well, a lot of them are about similarities

302
00:13:51,406 --> 00:13:52,892
between characters.

303
00:13:52,892 --> 00:13:58,408
But one thing that I thought about was how

304
00:13:58,408 --> 00:14:02,864
Norian dealt with his lover's loss,

305
00:14:02,864 --> 00:14:06,532
and how Velutha was able to

306
00:14:06,532 --> 00:14:10,931
deal with being separated from...

307
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:13,271
Ammu.

308
00:14:13,271 --> 00:14:16,938
And do you think that
their status influenced

309
00:14:16,938 --> 00:14:19,678
how they were able to
deal with the situations?

310
00:14:19,678 --> 00:14:21,513
- Sorry, I missed all this.

311
00:14:21,513 --> 00:14:25,231
(laughter)

312
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:30,212
- So she
- (boy student) I heard

313
00:14:30,212 --> 00:14:33,176
- Well, Norian, because he was a Brahmin,

314
00:14:33,176 --> 00:14:34,592
the highest caste,

315
00:14:34,592 --> 00:14:38,296
I think he said we'll either
going to Calcutta or India,
?
316
00:14:38,296 --> 00:14:40,014
to start his life.

317
00:14:40,014 --> 00:14:43,337
- You mean Kolkata?

318
00:14:43,337 --> 00:14:45,544
- Or, I'm sorry, or England.

319
00:14:45,544 --> 00:14:47,239
To become a lawyer.

320
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:50,072
So he had the option of completely

321
00:14:50,072 --> 00:14:52,649
starting his life over
wherever he wanted to go

322
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:54,228
because he had education,

323
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:55,784
and he could provide for himself.

324
00:14:55,784 --> 00:14:58,848
Velutha was an untouchable,

325
00:14:58,848 --> 00:15:00,915
so he had no opportunity.
