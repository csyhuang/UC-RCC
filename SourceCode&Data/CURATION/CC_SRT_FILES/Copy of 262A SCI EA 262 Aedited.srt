1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,615
- A lot of people thought the
mass of the water in the bag

2
00:00:02,615 --> 00:00:05,877
would be less than the mass
of the ice cubes in the bag.

3
00:00:05,877 --> 00:00:07,294
How many people?

4
00:00:08,234 --> 00:00:10,869
One, two, just three of you.

5
00:00:10,869 --> 00:00:11,867
Okay.

6
00:00:11,867 --> 00:00:14,503
Cameron, do you want to start
us off with your reason why?

7
00:00:16,203 --> 00:00:21,196
- Because the, 'cause you can
put water in a water bottle

8
00:00:21,196 --> 00:00:23,935
to put in the freezer,
then that water bottle

9
00:00:23,935 --> 00:00:28,335
will like, explode, because
it has so much ice in it.

10
00:00:28,335 --> 00:00:29,717
- Okay.

11
00:00:31,027 --> 00:00:36,020
So because the water,
when it freezes, expands,

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,272
then therefore, you're
saying it has more mass?

13
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:39,073
- Yeah.

14
00:00:39,073 --> 00:00:40,071
- When it's frozen.

15
00:00:40,071 --> 00:00:41,210
- Yes.

16
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,227
- But when it melts, it doesn't take up

17
00:00:42,227 --> 00:00:44,269
so much space, so it has less mass.

18
00:00:44,269 --> 00:00:44,989
- Yes.

19
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:46,499
- Okay. Michael.

20
00:00:46,499 --> 00:00:49,581
Do you or are you on the
same idea as far as more,

21
00:00:49,581 --> 00:00:51,625
as far as thinking there's less?

22
00:00:52,745 --> 00:00:54,851
Was your reason the same
as his or do you have

23
00:00:54,851 --> 00:00:58,242
a different reason why
it's going to be less?

24
00:00:59,762 --> 00:01:01,051
- Mine was the same.

25
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:02,142
- [Voiceover] Same idea?

26
00:01:02,142 --> 00:01:02,855
- Yeah.

27
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:04,095
- [Voiceover] Okay.

28
00:01:04,095 --> 00:01:05,986
Hannah, you got a thought or something?

29
00:01:05,986 --> 00:01:08,655
- Well, isn't it like, the same?

30
00:01:09,635 --> 00:01:12,382
Isn't it, like, the same thing
because it's the same thing.

31
00:01:12,382 --> 00:01:15,018
It's just expanding, but it's
going to have the same mass.

32
00:01:15,018 --> 00:01:16,928
- [Voiceover] When you're
saying it's the same thing,

33
00:01:16,928 --> 00:01:18,727
what do you mean by the same thing?

34
00:01:18,727 --> 00:01:21,350
- Like, if you have
water in a water bottle,

35
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,963
like it does expand or
whatever, but it still

36
00:01:23,963 --> 00:01:27,365
has the same amount of water
so it still has the same mass.

37
00:01:27,365 --> 00:01:28,966
- [Voiceover] Okay, so Hannah's saying it

38
00:01:28,966 --> 00:01:30,429
doesn't matter that it expands.

39
00:01:31,779 --> 00:01:34,348
It's still the same amount
of stuff, and therefore

40
00:01:34,348 --> 00:01:36,285
it should still have
the same amount of mass.

41
00:01:36,285 --> 00:01:37,284
Is that correct?

42
00:01:37,284 --> 00:01:38,004
'Kay.

43
00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:39,641
Houston, idea on that?

44
00:01:40,431 --> 00:01:42,462
- Well, about the water bottle thing,

45
00:01:42,462 --> 00:01:44,459
it would be opposite to this 'cause

46
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:47,362
when you start with water, it
takes up the entire bottle.

47
00:01:47,362 --> 00:01:49,951
But the bag, the ice is the one taking up

48
00:01:49,951 --> 00:01:53,021
the minimum space of when
it freezes an entire bag.

49
00:01:53,021 --> 00:01:54,511
So it wouldn't.

50
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:56,225
- So are you saying if we
let the ice cubes melt,

51
00:01:56,225 --> 00:01:59,324
are you saying the mass is going to go up?

52
00:01:59,324 --> 00:02:00,638
It's going to increase?

53
00:02:00,638 --> 00:02:01,402
- Yeah.

54
00:02:01,402 --> 00:02:02,680
- Okay.

55
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,259
Colby?

56
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:08,449
- I'd say that when a
solid turns into a liquid,

57
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:11,456
its form changes, but not its mass.

58
00:02:11,456 --> 00:02:15,223
- [Voiceover] Okay, so kind
of the same idea as Hannah.

59
00:02:15,223 --> 00:02:17,053
Only you're talking about
the actual forms then.

60
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,212
It can change form without changing mass.

61
00:02:20,452 --> 00:02:23,297
Hannah says it's okay to expand

62
00:02:23,297 --> 00:02:25,190
because it's still the
same amount of stuff.  Okay.

63
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,121
Michael's got another
thing thing to talk about.

64
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:31,134
- Well when you put, like, the
water in the bottle,

65
00:02:31,134 --> 00:02:34,790
and then you, like, freeze it,

66
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,355
then you unfreeze it,
then there's less water

67
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:39,154
than what you started with,

68
00:02:39,154 --> 00:02:41,697
and it probably would change the mass.

69
00:02:43,177 --> 00:02:46,063
- [Voiceover] Why is it,
so you're saying the amount

70
00:02:46,063 --> 00:02:48,406
of water you put in first
before you freeze it

71
00:02:48,406 --> 00:02:52,020
is more than the amount of water
after you thaw it back out?

72
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,076
- Yeah.

73
00:02:53,076 --> 00:02:55,258
- [Voiceover] Do you have a
reason why that might be?

74
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:58,324
- Well, no. it's just (mumbles).

75
00:02:58,324 --> 00:03:01,585
- [Voiceover] Okay, any
other ideas on this one?

76
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:06,072
Okay, how many people thought the
mass would increase, then?

77
00:03:06,072 --> 00:03:08,917
How many people said
the mass would increase?

78
00:03:08,917 --> 00:03:09,753
A couple of you.

79
00:03:09,753 --> 00:03:11,076
Jared, why don't you tell us why

80
00:03:11,076 --> 00:03:12,806
you think the mass would increase.

81
00:03:14,356 --> 00:03:17,237
- I thought the mass
would increase because

82
00:03:17,237 --> 00:03:20,058
water weighs more than ice.

83
00:03:20,058 --> 00:03:23,115
Like if you pick up a bottle
of water that's frozen, it

84
00:03:23,115 --> 00:03:26,117
doesn't weigh as much as a
bottle of water with water in it.

85
00:03:26,117 --> 00:03:26,908
- Okay.

86
00:03:27,738 --> 00:03:31,859
So Jared says that water
weighs more than ice.

87
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:32,902
Correct?

88
00:03:32,902 --> 00:03:35,318
Anybody else have a different idea?

89
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:36,479
Anna?

90
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,939
- [Voiceover] Well,
because ice floats on water

91
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:41,563
so that means it has less mass,

92
00:03:41,563 --> 00:03:44,641
so if it thawed back out, then it'd weigh more.

93
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,855
- Okay. So Anna's using the example

94
00:03:47,855 --> 00:03:50,143
that she's seen ice floating on water,

95
00:03:50,143 --> 00:03:54,323
therefore she's saying the ice must
have less mass than water.

96
00:03:54,323 --> 00:03:55,239
Correct?

97
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:56,843
Is that what your'e saying?
- [Anna] Mm-hmm.

98
00:03:56,843 --> 00:03:58,417
- Colby, you got something
to say about that?

99
00:03:58,417 --> 00:04:01,352
- I have something to say
about that. It will stay

100
00:04:01,352 --> 00:04:03,752
the same going off of what she's saying.

101
00:04:03,752 --> 00:04:05,161
- Oh, going off of what she's saying.

102
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,873
Okay, go ahead, then.

103
00:04:08,943 --> 00:04:12,434
- Ice is pretty much
the same as, it's water,

104
00:04:12,434 --> 00:04:15,471
it's frozen water, so
it still has the same

105
00:04:15,471 --> 00:04:19,875
density as water, it's just colder.

106
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,348
So, if it's colder, it floats.

107
00:04:26,868 --> 00:04:29,517
Ice because it's cold,
it floats in the water.

108
00:04:29,517 --> 00:04:30,824
- [Voiceover] So you're
saying the floating of ice

109
00:04:30,824 --> 00:04:33,099
has nothing to do with
its density or its mass,

110
00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:34,783
it has to do with its temperature.

111
00:04:34,783 --> 00:04:36,280
'Kay. Houston?

112
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,711
- Well, I think the only reason ice floats

113
00:04:39,711 --> 00:04:42,113
is because an ice would weigh less

114
00:04:42,113 --> 00:04:44,469
because ice isn't completely full.

115
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:46,187
There's some air in there.

116
00:04:46,187 --> 00:04:47,766
- Okay.

117
00:04:47,766 --> 00:04:50,529
So Houston's saying there's
some air trapped in there

118
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:53,976
that was not in the water beforehand.

119
00:04:53,976 --> 00:04:55,579
Okay. Anybody else?

120
00:04:56,289 --> 00:04:57,436
Anybody want to have any other arguments

121
00:04:57,436 --> 00:04:59,594
about why the mass should stay the--

122
00:04:59,594 --> 00:05:00,484
Oh, sorry. Anna.

123
00:05:00,484 --> 00:05:01,163
- [Voiceover] Oh, okay.

124
00:05:01,163 --> 00:05:04,437
I disagree with Colby how he said that

125
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:08,163
it floats because it's
cold when heat rises,

126
00:05:08,163 --> 00:05:10,021
and so if it's cold, wouldn't it sink

127
00:05:10,021 --> 00:05:12,029
if it had to do with the temperature?

128
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:13,910
- Okay, so Anna's saying that heat rises

129
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,046
and cold sinks, so you don't think

130
00:05:16,046 --> 00:05:17,486
it has to do with temperature?

131
00:05:17,486 --> 00:05:18,182
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

132
00:05:18,182 --> 00:05:19,365
- Okay.

133
00:05:20,155 --> 00:05:21,886
Colby, response to that or are you...?

134
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:25,686
- Well, in water, it works differently.

135
00:05:25,686 --> 00:05:29,424
Warm water actually
sinks more to the bottom actually,

136
00:05:29,424 --> 00:05:32,583
and cold water's more on the top.

137
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,279
- [Voiceover] Alright.

138
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:38,279
- So if you put cold in
ice, it will float above.

139
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:39,502
- [Voiceover] Okay.

140
00:05:39,502 --> 00:05:41,533
Oh, I have some hands up now. Michael?

141
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:44,507
- Well, when you're in
the lake for example,

142
00:05:44,507 --> 00:05:48,791
the warm part's on top,
and the deeper you go

143
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:52,611
the colder it gets because heat rises.

144
00:05:52,611 --> 00:05:55,907
- [Voiceover] So you're using
your experience in swimming

145
00:05:55,907 --> 00:05:57,375
or something in a lake.

146
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:57,881
- Yeah.

147
00:05:57,881 --> 00:05:58,682
- [Voiceover] It's
colder the deeper you go,

148
00:05:58,682 --> 00:06:00,075
warmer towards the surface, you're saying?

149
00:06:00,075 --> 00:06:03,697
- Yeah, so the ice cube
must have oxygen in it

150
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:07,173
because when we hold
our breath, we float up.

151
00:06:07,173 --> 00:06:08,193
- [Voiceover] Okay.

152
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:09,467
- When we have no air, we go down.

153
00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:11,524
- [Voiceover] Okay, so
you're saying an ice cube has

154
00:06:11,524 --> 00:06:14,319
air trapped in it, that's
what's causing it to float.

155
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,538
Is that what you're saying?

156
00:06:15,538 --> 00:06:16,839
And Hannah, were you gonna agree with her

157
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:19,383
as far as the lake
water temperature thing?

158
00:06:19,383 --> 00:06:21,567
- Yeah, so when you put
your sweater or something

159
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:23,637
in the water, it's like the top is usually

160
00:06:23,637 --> 00:06:25,617
more warm (mumbles) colder.

161
00:06:25,617 --> 00:06:26,893
- [Voiceover] Okay. Alright.

162
00:06:26,893 --> 00:06:29,413
Now people who think the mass
is going to stay the same.

163
00:06:29,413 --> 00:06:30,784
Who are those people?

164
00:06:30,784 --> 00:06:32,414
Who thinks the mass will stay the same?

165
00:06:32,414 --> 00:06:34,074
Gavin, why don't you
give us the reason why

166
00:06:34,074 --> 00:06:35,967
you think it's going to stay the same?

167
00:06:41,057 --> 00:06:44,340
- I think it's going to
stay the same because

168
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,493
nothing's lost when it melts.

169
00:06:47,493 --> 00:06:48,455
Nothing goes away.

170
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,020
It's still the same thing.

171
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,331
- [Voiceover] He's saying it's
going to stay the same

172
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:55,224
because nothing is lost.

173
00:06:55,224 --> 00:06:57,627
When it melts, it doesn't get lost.

174
00:06:57,627 --> 00:06:58,428
Okay.

175
00:06:58,428 --> 00:06:59,844
Anybody else who says it's
going to stay the same

176
00:06:59,844 --> 00:07:01,307
have something to add?

177
00:07:01,307 --> 00:07:02,746
Gabe?

178
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:12,270
- I said that...

179
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,465
- [Voiceover] Just talk louder.

180
00:07:15,265 --> 00:07:18,452
- I said that it'll stay the same because

181
00:07:18,452 --> 00:07:21,646
there's still the same amount
of water melted or frozen,

182
00:07:21,646 --> 00:07:26,011
and even if it's in a bag,
if it melts, and tries to...

183
00:07:27,921 --> 00:07:32,105
break down into gas, then
it's still in the bag

184
00:07:32,105 --> 00:07:33,875
so it won't go anywhere.

185
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:37,799
- [Voiceover] So Gabe's saying
that it doesn't matter

186
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:41,920
if it's frozen as an ice
cube, if it's melted as water,

187
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,439
or even, he's even going as far as saying

188
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:46,760
that even if the water, liquid starts

189
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,894
turning into a gas, it's
still going to be the same

190
00:07:50,894 --> 00:07:53,076
because nothing's leaving the bag.

191
00:07:53,076 --> 00:07:54,039
Is that what you're saying?

192
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:55,862
He's going even a step further,

193
00:07:56,662 --> 00:07:58,440
he didn't even mention anything
about turning into a gas,

194
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,134
but he's saying even if it does that,

195
00:08:00,134 --> 00:08:01,771
it's still not going to change.

196
00:08:01,771 --> 00:08:02,677
Right?

197
00:08:03,436 --> 00:08:04,197
Houston.

198
00:08:04,197 --> 00:08:06,519
- Well, I disagree with
that because if you

199
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:10,176
take a frozen lake the ice is only on top,

200
00:08:10,176 --> 00:08:12,022
it doesn't freeze all the water.

201
00:08:12,022 --> 00:08:13,136
- Okay.

202
00:08:14,256 --> 00:08:14,970
Hannah.

203
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,050
- I agree with what he said.

204
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,011
Even if there's air bubbles in the ice,

205
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:22,515
then after it melts, the air
bubbles, it's still in the bag.

206
00:08:22,515 --> 00:08:25,116
It's still concealed in the bag. (mumbles)

207
00:08:25,116 --> 00:08:28,598
- [Voiceover] So sounds like
the people who are for it,

208
00:08:28,598 --> 00:08:30,491
staying it's the same
are really sticking with

209
00:08:30,491 --> 00:08:33,370
the fact that everything's in the bag.

210
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:37,508
Nothing's out of the bag
or leaving or coming in,

211
00:08:37,508 --> 00:08:38,925
and then the people who are thinking

212
00:08:38,925 --> 00:08:40,482
it's going to increase or decrease

213
00:08:40,482 --> 00:08:43,279
have a lot of ideas about ice having

214
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,865
more mass than water as a solid,

215
00:08:46,865 --> 00:08:50,941
and then some of that's
through the temperature.

216
00:08:50,941 --> 00:08:53,165
Michael, one more before we move on.

217
00:08:53,175 --> 00:08:55,209
- About how it all stays in the bag, well,

218
00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:58,312
when you melt water it sweats.

219
00:08:58,312 --> 00:09:01,993
So wouldn't it lose
some of that. (mutters)

220
00:09:01,993 --> 00:09:03,850
- [Voiceover] So are you
saying some of the moisture's

221
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,311
going to be on the outside of the bag?

222
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:08,691
- Like, comes off the bag.

223
00:09:08,691 --> 00:09:12,556
If you have it on the table,
then it comes onto the table.

224
00:09:12,556 --> 00:09:15,708
- Like how it has a (mutters)

225
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,792
- [Voiceover] Okay, so here's
my question to you then.

226
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:19,638
That water that's on
the outside of the bag

227
00:09:19,638 --> 00:09:21,635
that you're talking about?

228
00:09:21,635 --> 00:09:24,827
You were saying that water came
from the inside of the bag?

229
00:09:24,827 --> 00:09:28,235
- Well, it sweats from the...

230
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:34,230
the compression of the temperature.

231
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,558
- [Voiceover] So you're
saying that's what's

232
00:09:35,558 --> 00:09:37,511
causing the mass to go up, then.

233
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:40,367
- Wouldn't that cause the mass to go down?

234
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:41,794
- [Voiceover] Okay, so that's
my question to you, then,

235
00:09:41,794 --> 00:09:45,509
is where was that water on
the outside coming from?

236
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:46,694
- Inside?

237
00:09:46,694 --> 00:09:49,793
- [Voiceover] How is it
getting to the outside?

238
00:09:49,793 --> 00:09:50,826
- I don't know.

239
00:09:50,826 --> 00:09:52,742
Some scientific theory. (laughs)

240
00:09:52,742 --> 00:09:54,930
- [Voiceover] (laughs) Okay.

241
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,671
Does anybody agree with her idea

242
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:57,971
that some of the water
from the inside might

243
00:09:57,971 --> 00:09:59,747
be getting to the outside?

244
00:09:59,747 --> 00:10:00,746
- [Students] Yeah.

245
00:10:00,746 --> 00:10:01,965
- [Voiceover] Do any of
you guys have an idea

246
00:10:01,965 --> 00:10:05,092
of how that might be
happening to help her out?

247
00:10:05,092 --> 00:10:06,266
James, how do you think that water

248
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:08,229
might be getting to the outside?

249
00:10:08,229 --> 00:10:12,655
- [James] The moist is like, when it...

250
00:10:13,705 --> 00:10:16,018
What's it called? Wait a minute.

251
00:10:16,018 --> 00:10:20,732
The carbonate, the condensation,

252
00:10:20,732 --> 00:10:25,236
it, like, seeps out, like
the air, it seeps out.

253
00:10:25,236 --> 00:10:26,362
- So somehow you're thinking it's

254
00:10:26,362 --> 00:10:27,418
seeping through the bag.

255
00:10:28,588 --> 00:10:29,363
Colby?

256
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:33,380
- I know how that happens, actually.

257
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,701
Because the water in the air

258
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,006
will stick to the bag because it's colder.

259
00:10:38,006 --> 00:10:41,320
So it'll stick there
and just condense there

260
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,397
so it'll look like it's (mutters).

261
00:10:44,397 --> 00:10:46,184
It's just water from the air.

262
00:10:46,184 --> 00:10:49,203
- So you're saying the water that forms

263
00:10:49,203 --> 00:10:50,550
on the outside is not
coming from the inside?

264
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,384
It's coming from the
outside, which is different

265
00:10:52,384 --> 00:10:54,160
than what they're saying.

266
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,727
Cameron, did you have any other ideas

267
00:10:55,727 --> 00:10:58,014
 how it might be getting out there?

268
00:10:58,014 --> 00:10:59,988
'Kay. Alright.

269
00:10:59,988 --> 00:11:01,914
So we got some different
ideas on that one.

270
00:11:01,914 --> 00:11:04,365
Let's move on now to our
alka-seltzer problem.

271
00:11:04,365 --> 00:11:05,967
(student mutters)

272
00:11:07,217 --> 00:11:09,658
This time, last one we started with people

273
00:11:09,658 --> 00:11:11,040
who thought the mass would decrease.

274
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,479
Let's start with the people who think

275
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:15,044
the mass will increase.

276
00:11:15,044 --> 00:11:16,438
So people who think the mass is going

277
00:11:16,438 --> 00:11:18,912
to increase with the alka-seltzer.

278
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:21,070
Who are those people?

279
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,370
Alright.

280
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,331
We're going to have Kyle
start us off on this one.

281
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:26,190
What's your reason why, Kyle?

282
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:32,850
- Well, when the tablet dissolves

283
00:11:33,189 --> 00:11:35,756
I think after dissolving, (mumbles)

284
00:11:35,756 --> 00:11:38,066
water will rise and make more.

285
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:38,867
- [Voiceover] Make more water?

286
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:39,552
- Yeah.

287
00:11:39,552 --> 00:11:40,968
- Okay.

288
00:11:40,968 --> 00:11:42,500
So Kyle thinks the reaction is going

289
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,808
to create more water,
and therefore, more mass.

290
00:11:45,808 --> 00:11:47,864
- Sam, different idea than that for why

291
00:11:47,864 --> 00:11:49,455
the mass is going to increase?

292
00:11:49,455 --> 00:11:54,075
(Sam mutters)

293
00:11:54,075 --> 00:11:56,558
- Okay, so you're thinking
it's going to increase

294
00:11:56,558 --> 00:11:59,019
because you're adding
something to the water.

295
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,274
Colby?

296
00:12:00,274 --> 00:12:02,235
- I think it's going to increase because

297
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:05,440
the alka-seltzer tablet will release gases

298
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,130
which will increase the
weight of the bottle inside.

299
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,871
- [Voiceover] Okay so the
gases that is going to be

300
00:12:11,871 --> 00:12:14,733
created from the reaction
are going to add to the mass.

301
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,834
Jake, you had your hand up
for the mass increasing, correct?

302
00:12:16,834 --> 00:12:19,658
Do you have a different reason
why it's going to do that?

303
00:12:19,662 --> 00:12:24,443
(Jake mutters)

304
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,985
- So basically saying,
the same thing as Colby.

305
00:12:26,985 --> 00:12:28,564
More gases.

306
00:12:28,564 --> 00:12:29,086
Hannah.

307
00:12:29,086 --> 00:12:30,365
- Aren't the gases from the water

308
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:31,618
in the alka-seltzer,

309
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:33,846
aren't they going to just stay the same?

310
00:12:33,846 --> 00:12:35,797
- [Voiceover] Good question.

311
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:38,474
So what you're saying, then, is

312
00:12:38,474 --> 00:12:42,848
if the gases are coming from the
alka selzter tablet in water,

313
00:12:42,848 --> 00:12:45,429
so what are you saying the mass will do?

314
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:47,023
- I think it's going to stay the same.

315
00:12:47,023 --> 00:12:48,416
Actually, it'll decrease.

316
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,099
- [Voiceover] It'll decrease?

317
00:12:50,099 --> 00:12:51,724
Okay, why do you think
it's going to decrease?

318
00:12:51,724 --> 00:12:52,839
- I don't know.

319
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:54,023
- Okay. (chuckles)

320
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,324
Who could come up with the reason

321
00:12:55,324 --> 00:12:57,134
as to why it might decrease?

322
00:12:57,134 --> 00:12:58,458
Cameron?

323
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,506
Why is it going to decrease?

324
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:05,737
- Because the acid from the,

325
00:13:05,737 --> 00:13:10,737
from the, from the
tablet, the acid from the

326
00:13:10,914 --> 00:13:14,455
tablet is going to release gases,

327
00:13:14,455 --> 00:13:17,688
and the water will go out of the beaker.

328
00:13:19,388 --> 00:13:22,054
- How is the water going
to get out of the beaker?

329
00:13:24,474 --> 00:13:26,891
- Because the tablet
will react with water,

330
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:28,888
and the gases will float away.

331
00:13:29,888 --> 00:13:31,576
- But isn't there a lid on top?

332
00:13:33,836 --> 00:13:37,508
- Maybe the lid will pop off or something.

333
00:13:37,508 --> 00:13:39,447
- Let's assume the lid
is does not pop off.

334
00:13:39,447 --> 00:13:41,652
Let's assume I have it
on there tight enough

335
00:13:41,652 --> 00:13:43,755
that it's not going to pop off.

336
00:13:43,755 --> 00:13:48,722
- Then, since air is lighter than water,

337
00:13:48,722 --> 00:13:52,797
then that means that the air,

338
00:13:52,797 --> 00:13:55,873
that means the mass will decrease

339
00:13:55,873 --> 00:14:00,481
because the water will
be like not as much,

340
00:14:00,481 --> 00:14:02,676
and there will be more
gas in the container.

341
00:14:04,026 --> 00:14:06,321
- So. Correct me if I'm wrong.

342
00:14:06,321 --> 00:14:08,910
So you're saying that
assuming the top stays on,

343
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,907
it's still going to decrease.

344
00:14:10,907 --> 00:14:12,799
That's the decrease, right?

345
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:16,386
Because the solid and liquid
are going to turn into...

346
00:14:16,386 --> 00:14:17,141
- Gas.

347
00:14:17,141 --> 00:14:20,311
- Gas, and gas is lighter
than solids and liquids.

348
00:14:20,311 --> 00:14:21,981
Is that correct? What you're saying?

349
00:14:21,981 --> 00:14:22,835
- [Cameron] Yeah.
- Alright.

350
00:14:22,835 --> 00:14:24,878
Jared has something to say about that.

351
00:14:24,878 --> 00:14:27,617
- I think that the mass
will decrease because

352
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:32,617
the tablet will disintegrate and that mass

353
00:14:33,237 --> 00:14:36,140
part will be (mumbles) decrease.

354
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,277
- Okay, so he's saying that the tablet

355
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:39,494
disappears, then the mass will go down.

356
00:14:39,494 --> 00:14:41,619
That piece that the tablet's bringing

357
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:44,974
to the table for mass is not
going to be there anymore.

358
00:14:44,974 --> 00:14:46,715
Kevin, what are you thinking?

359
00:14:46,715 --> 00:14:48,619
- Pretty much the same thing

360
00:14:48,619 --> 00:14:50,279
that the tablet's going to dissolve

361
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,615
into the water.

362
00:14:51,615 --> 00:14:53,740
- [Voiceover] And so mass will go down?

363
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,689
- [Kevin] Yeah.
- Okay.

364
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:57,354
- [Voiceover] Who thinks the
mass is going to stay the same?

365
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,630
It's not going to change.

366
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,628
Who thinks it will stay the same?

367
00:15:02,488 --> 00:15:05,371
Why don't you tell us why
it's going to stay the same?

368
00:15:06,821 --> 00:15:08,520
- I think it's going to
stay the same because

369
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,920
the water, the alka-seltzer piece

370
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,192
is a water, it's just in a different form.

371
00:15:16,192 --> 00:15:18,701
But everything is still (mumbles).

372
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:19,294
- Okay.

373
00:15:20,425 --> 00:15:21,876
So you're saying because

374
00:15:21,876 --> 00:15:23,258
nothing's going away,

375
00:15:23,258 --> 00:15:24,477
it's still going to be the same.

376
00:15:24,477 --> 00:15:25,881
It's just in a different form.

377
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:26,630
So kind of like what some people

378
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,603
were saying about ice in the water.

379
00:15:28,603 --> 00:15:32,028
Gabe, do you have a
different reason than that?

380
00:15:32,028 --> 00:15:33,443
- No, it was a lot like hers.

381
00:15:33,443 --> 00:15:34,940
- [Voiceover] It was the
same as hers, pretty much?

382
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,567
- Yeah.

383
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:36,367
- Okay.

384
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:37,245
Anybody got anything else they

385
00:15:37,245 --> 00:15:39,601
want to input on the alka-seltzer one?

386
00:15:39,601 --> 00:15:42,275
Why it might go up, down or
stay the same before we move on?

387
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,245
- Gavin?

388
00:15:43,245 --> 00:15:44,422
- I said it would probably go down

389
00:15:44,422 --> 00:15:48,579
because if you have a bunch of gas

390
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:50,680
in a bottle, it'll probably weigh a lot

391
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,499
less than a cup full of
water, like the same amount.

392
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:56,681
- [Voiceover] Okay, so you're
going again with the idea

393
00:15:56,681 --> 00:16:00,442
that gas has less mass than
the water and the tablet.

394
00:16:00,442 --> 00:16:04,772
And since we're turning them into
gases, the mass will go down.

395
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:06,897
James.

396
00:16:06,897 --> 00:16:11,897
- I said since the tablet is
gonna be kind of shrinked,

397
00:16:13,258 --> 00:16:17,240
once it mixes with the water, it'll stand,

398
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,071
making it a lot more liquidy and bigger

399
00:16:21,071 --> 00:16:23,601
and then the mass will get higher.

400
00:16:23,601 --> 00:16:26,493
- The mass will increase
because it'll produce the...

401
00:16:26,493 --> 00:16:27,897
(James mutters)

402
00:16:27,897 --> 00:16:31,286
Alright. Let's go to burning paper.

403
00:16:36,376 --> 00:16:37,533
Alright.  Burning paper.

404
00:16:38,203 --> 00:16:39,982
Let's start with the people,
this time, let's start with

405
00:16:39,982 --> 00:16:42,797
the people who think the
mass will stay the same.

406
00:16:42,797 --> 00:16:45,479
People who think the
mass still stay the same.

407
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:47,279
- Colby's the only one.

408
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,241
Morgan. Gabe.

409
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,204
Not very many. Jasmine.

410
00:16:50,204 --> 00:16:51,156
Morgan, why don't you start us off

411
00:16:51,156 --> 00:16:52,236
for why you think it's going

412
00:16:52,236 --> 00:16:53,420
to stay the same.

413
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,904
- I said the mass will stay the same

414
00:16:54,904 --> 00:16:56,925
because the air and everything else

415
00:16:56,925 --> 00:16:58,923
is still in the jar and
it's not going anywhere.

416
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,024
- Okay she says it stays the same because

417
00:17:01,024 --> 00:17:03,183
everything is still in the
jar not going anywhere.

418
00:17:03,183 --> 00:17:04,609
Jasmine, you had your hand up.

419
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:06,050
Do you think the same
thing as her or do you have

420
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,861
a different reason for why
it would stay the same?

421
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,800
- I agree with her.

422
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,578
- [Voiceover] You agree
with what she said?

423
00:17:10,578 --> 00:17:11,460
- Colby?

424
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,945
- Burning stuff does not add.

425
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:18,265
It's still the object, but
it's more spread apart.

426
00:17:18,265 --> 00:17:21,014
- [Voiceover] Okay, so the
mass stays the same, you said.

427
00:17:21,014 --> 00:17:23,406
It's just we're going to
take up more space with it.

428
00:17:23,406 --> 00:17:24,672
Okay.

429
00:17:24,672 --> 00:17:26,285
Michael? No? Yes?

430
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:27,330
- I was stretching.

431
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,607
- [Voiceover] Hannah?

432
00:17:28,607 --> 00:17:30,906
- I disagree with that because

433
00:17:30,906 --> 00:17:34,272
it, when it burns, (mutters)

434
00:17:34,272 --> 00:17:37,927
I don't know if that's the
word for it, but how it's

435
00:17:37,927 --> 00:17:41,157
(mutters) causing it all, when you burn

436
00:17:41,157 --> 00:17:44,488
wood in a fire, eventually
all that will turn into ashes,

437
00:17:44,488 --> 00:17:47,414
so I don't think it has
the same mass or anything.

438
00:17:48,594 --> 00:17:50,780
- [Voiceover] Okay. James,
you got some more on that?

439
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,904
- When that paper burns, it'll turn into

440
00:17:52,904 --> 00:17:56,004
charcoal which basically
is lighter than paper,

441
00:17:56,004 --> 00:18:00,305
and then that'll make it
so mass will be decreased.

442
00:18:00,305 --> 00:18:01,484
- Okay, so given the idea that

443
00:18:01,484 --> 00:18:04,525
we're taking the solid things,

444
00:18:04,525 --> 00:18:06,684
and we're changing them into maybe

445
00:18:06,684 --> 00:18:09,064
non-solids, so either
liquids or liquid acids

446
00:18:09,064 --> 00:18:13,023
they're not gonna have
as much mass as those.

447
00:18:13,023 --> 00:18:14,183
Edward, what do you think?

448
00:18:14,183 --> 00:18:16,738
Do you think this mass will
go up, down or stay the same?

449
00:18:16,738 --> 00:18:18,764
- I think it will decrease.

450
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,762
- [Voiceover] Decrease?

451
00:18:19,762 --> 00:18:20,425
- Yeah.

452
00:18:20,425 --> 00:18:21,851
- [Voiceover] And what's
your reason for that?

453
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:24,510
- 'Cause when the paper burns,

454
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,529
it turns into a gas,
so some of it, and then

455
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:32,529
gas is, has less mass than solid objects.

456
00:18:32,787 --> 00:18:36,489
- [Voiceover] Okay, so again, back to that gas is

457
00:18:36,489 --> 00:18:37,489
less mass than solid objects.

458
00:18:37,489 --> 00:18:38,546
Kayla, what do you think?

459
00:18:38,546 --> 00:18:39,299
Increase? Decrease?

460
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:40,890
Or stay the same?

461
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:44,333
- I thought it would
decrease, like what Hannah--
