1
00:00:01,054 --> 00:00:04,079
- [Student]
... tilted towards the Sun,

2
00:00:04,079 --> 00:00:06,462
you're closer to the sun, which is heat,

3
00:00:06,462 --> 00:00:08,821
which means you're going to be warmer.

4
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:10,403
When you're tilted away from the Sun,

5
00:00:10,403 --> 00:00:13,195
then there's less heat,

6
00:00:13,195 --> 00:00:15,164
because you're farther away from it,

7
00:00:15,164 --> 00:00:16,932
it's going to be colder.

8
00:00:16,932 --> 00:00:19,629
That's what changes the seasons.

9
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:20,825
- [Student] Once again,

10
00:00:20,825 --> 00:00:22,782
it goes in orbit.

11
00:00:22,782 --> 00:00:24,975
Like you said, the
closer we are to the Sun,

12
00:00:24,975 --> 00:00:26,252
or the father away,

13
00:00:26,252 --> 00:00:30,256
once again it goes back to
being an elliptical orbit.

14
00:00:30,257 --> 00:00:32,220
- [Student] I think that tilt

15
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,115
causes the seasons,

16
00:00:34,115 --> 00:00:37,355
and the closer we are tilted to the Sun,

17
00:00:37,355 --> 00:00:39,659
that means it's like Summer or Spring,

18
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:41,207
then if we're tilted back,

19
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,513
it's Winter or Fall.

20
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,658
- [Student]
I'm kind of understanding

21
00:00:46,658 --> 00:00:48,276
what you guys are saying.

22
00:00:48,276 --> 00:00:52,723
Because I'm thinking of it as like, say,

23
00:00:52,723 --> 00:00:55,332
like the globe that's sitting right there,

24
00:00:55,332 --> 00:00:56,557
say that Ben was the sun...

25
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,749
- [Teacher] You can
use that if you'd like.

26
00:00:58,749 --> 00:01:00,375
- Say that Ben was the Sun,

27
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,232
the Sun would be shining
at the bottom of the globe,

28
00:01:02,232 --> 00:01:04,033
because the globe's tilted.

29
00:01:04,033 --> 00:01:07,248
So, there wouldn't be much
Sun at the top of the sphere

30
00:01:07,248 --> 00:01:09,748
because that's the most tilted away

31
00:01:09,748 --> 00:01:11,681
from the Sun.

32
00:01:11,681 --> 00:01:15,090
So, it would cause Summer lower

33
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,552
and on the other side
it would cause Winter.

34
00:01:17,552 --> 00:01:19,668
- [Teacher] Why are
you shaking your head?

35
00:01:19,668 --> 00:01:21,444
- [Student] I disagree.

36
00:01:21,444 --> 00:01:23,266
I think the Sun would hit more

37
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:25,842
on top than it does on the bottom,

38
00:01:25,842 --> 00:01:28,281
because like Antarctica and stuff,

39
00:01:28,281 --> 00:01:30,411
always cold, and it's at the bottom.

40
00:01:30,411 --> 00:01:32,733
So, I think it hits more in the top

41
00:01:32,733 --> 00:01:33,988
and in between,

42
00:01:33,988 --> 00:01:35,403
like by the equator.

43
00:01:35,403 --> 00:01:37,028
Because as you go down South,

44
00:01:37,028 --> 00:01:39,742
it's more warmer, but still,

45
00:01:39,742 --> 00:01:41,695
if you go down, way down to Antarctica,

46
00:01:41,695 --> 00:01:44,851
it's totally freezing,
they don't get no sun.

47
00:01:46,058 --> 00:01:47,198
- [Student] That's not right.

48
00:01:47,198 --> 00:01:48,214
Because...

49
00:01:48,214 --> 00:01:51,677
there is like sunlight
in Antarctica and stuff.

50
00:01:51,677 --> 00:01:54,618
It's just 'cause like,
the latitude and longitude,

51
00:01:54,618 --> 00:01:57,501
and like, because...

52
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,406
Because,

53
00:02:03,406 --> 00:02:07,485
Antarctica's at zero degrees.

54
00:02:08,842 --> 00:02:11,518
So, it's cold down there.

55
00:02:11,518 --> 00:02:13,071
- [Student] I want to know,

56
00:02:13,071 --> 00:02:15,786
when the Sun is going in its orbit,

57
00:02:15,786 --> 00:02:19,172
if it just goes from this to this,

58
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,628
like boom,

59
00:02:20,628 --> 00:02:23,629
or if its turning and its like

60
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:25,346
facing the Sun like that,

61
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:31,370
like, I don't understand that.

62
00:02:33,983 --> 00:02:35,264
- [Teacher] Okay.

63
00:02:35,264 --> 00:02:38,151
So, our question is what?

64
00:02:38,151 --> 00:02:39,102
- Like,

65
00:02:39,102 --> 00:02:40,749
when you're going around the Sun,

66
00:02:40,749 --> 00:02:43,496
and its on its axis like this, tilted,

67
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,909
and it goes around,

68
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:46,958
eventu...

69
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,821
Does it just, like, go like that?

70
00:02:48,821 --> 00:02:50,060
Like real quick?

71
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,375
And then it's like

72
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:54,626
shifted so the bottom
is getting more light,

73
00:02:54,626 --> 00:02:58,205
and that would put us in Winter?

74
00:02:58,205 --> 00:03:00,023
- [Teacher] What do you think, Kaylie?

75
00:03:00,023 --> 00:03:01,717
You haven't said anything.

76
00:03:01,717 --> 00:03:03,144
Do you think that our,

77
00:03:03,144 --> 00:03:05,711
our tilt's going to just change?

78
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:07,458
- [Kaylie] No.

79
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:08,632
I think it's like,

80
00:03:08,632 --> 00:03:10,519
whenever we're rotating, like

81
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:14,875
it goes around the Sun in the orbit?

82
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,643
- [Student] Can I show...

83
00:03:19,643 --> 00:03:21,919
She's saying that as it's rotating,

84
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:24,683
it's staying the same, it's
just that it's changing because

85
00:03:24,683 --> 00:03:26,747
you're changing position

86
00:03:26,747 --> 00:03:29,745
from which way the Sun is.

87
00:03:32,436 --> 00:03:34,187
- [Student] Can I show
an example with the globe?

88
00:03:34,187 --> 00:03:36,017
- [Teacher] Yeah, please.

89
00:03:37,222 --> 00:03:38,823
- [Student] Say
the Sun was in the middle.

90
00:03:38,823 --> 00:03:40,966
Say, like the globe, is right here.

91
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:42,458
Say we're right here,

92
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:45,099
it's Summertime, really close,
and the Sun's right here.

93
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,508
And as we go around, like

94
00:03:46,508 --> 00:03:49,582
maybe, like we're right
here and this is Fall,

95
00:03:49,582 --> 00:03:51,394
and then we go to Winter.

96
00:03:51,394 --> 00:03:53,783
And as we turn this way for the Spring,

97
00:03:53,783 --> 00:03:56,622
and then we're back to
Summer again because

98
00:03:56,622 --> 00:03:59,672
we're going around the sun, so...

99
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:00,858
- [Student] But (inaudible),

100
00:04:00,858 --> 00:04:02,730
the only problem with that is

101
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,502
we're still going to be tilted away

102
00:04:04,502 --> 00:04:06,537
when it,

103
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,067
when we go over

104
00:04:08,067 --> 00:04:09,346
towards the Sun.

105
00:04:09,346 --> 00:04:12,129
We're still going to be
tilted away, won't we?

106
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:15,135
- [Student] Well the
Earth's always tilted.

107
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:17,736
- [Student] Yeah, but
we'll be tilted away.

108
00:04:17,736 --> 00:04:20,401
In the Summer you're
tilted towards the Sun.

109
00:04:20,401 --> 00:04:22,437
- [Teacher] Let's go back to,

110
00:04:22,437 --> 00:04:23,852
does the tilt change?

111
00:04:23,852 --> 00:04:26,734
Okay, so we're definitely
talking about this tilt,

112
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:29,966
and I'm guessing there's
a lot of kids that are

113
00:04:29,966 --> 00:04:33,649
a little unsure about the tilt?

114
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:34,686
Yes?

115
00:04:34,686 --> 00:04:37,174
So, if you think you understand the tilt,

116
00:04:37,174 --> 00:04:39,969
help everybody else understand.

117
00:04:39,969 --> 00:04:43,899
We're not getting this tilt
in what you're talking about.

118
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:47,011
So, explain it the best way you can,

119
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:50,429
and help each other, okay so...

120
00:04:50,429 --> 00:04:53,212
"I don't get this tilt."

121
00:04:55,746 --> 00:04:58,401
Does it just flip flop?

122
00:04:58,401 --> 00:05:00,052
What do you think, Anna?

123
00:05:00,052 --> 00:05:12,471
- [Anna] I think it stays the same?

124
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:15,730
- [Teacher] What about you, Shana?

125
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,899
You haven't said anything yet.

126
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:20,014
- [Shana] Well, as
the Earth goes around

127
00:05:20,014 --> 00:05:22,276
in its orbit, it shifts,

128
00:05:22,276 --> 00:05:24,787
just like a little bit that way,

129
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:30,905
you're like closer to the Sun.

130
00:05:30,905 --> 00:05:32,965
And then during the Winter,

131
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,511
we're father away.

132
00:05:36,631 --> 00:05:37,935
- [Teacher] Is that how it is?

133
00:05:37,935 --> 00:05:40,162
We're closer towards the Sun in the Summer

134
00:05:40,162 --> 00:05:42,027
and we're father away in the Winter?

135
00:05:42,027 --> 00:05:44,480
- [Students] Yes.

136
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,957
- [Teacher] Who doesn't think that?

137
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,046
- [Student] Could I try something

138
00:05:50,046 --> 00:05:50,865
with the globe real quick?

139
00:05:50,865 --> 00:05:51,512
- [Teacher] Yes!

140
00:05:51,512 --> 00:05:52,733
- [Student] Could I

141
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:56,289
borrow Nick, to be my Sun? (laughs)

142
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:57,659
- [Teacher] Yeah.

143
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:59,027
Be his Sun, Nick.

144
00:05:59,027 --> 00:06:00,763
- Come on, Sun.

145
00:06:00,763 --> 00:06:02,929
Go out there and stand in the middle.

146
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:03,666
- [Nick] Pretty dark Sun.
- [Teacher] Yeah, you are.

147
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,658
- Okay,

148
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:09,636
we're gonna say that this little pin here

149
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:12,267
is where the Sun is hitting today.
All right?

150
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,900
And we're spinning,

151
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,836
woah, spinning that way.

152
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:18,703
(laughs)

153
00:06:18,703 --> 00:06:20,408
It's spinning, it's spinning,

154
00:06:20,408 --> 00:06:22,971
it's spinning, it's spinning,

155
00:06:22,971 --> 00:06:24,200
but it never,

156
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,768
it never tilts back towards the Sun.

157
00:06:27,768 --> 00:06:28,868
That's what I don't understand,

158
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:30,008
does it just go like this?

159
00:06:30,008 --> 00:06:32,306
(laughs)

160
00:06:32,306 --> 00:06:34,153
- [Teacher] This is
a really good question.

161
00:06:34,153 --> 00:06:36,011
This is a really good question.

162
00:06:36,011 --> 00:06:37,272
Now I want, wait,

163
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:38,539
don't move yet.

164
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:39,311
I want,

165
00:06:39,311 --> 00:06:40,873
go ahead, be the Sun still.

166
00:06:40,873 --> 00:06:42,529
And I want you to walk around

167
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:45,193
and explain to people
what you're talking about.

168
00:06:45,193 --> 00:06:47,271
Number one, show us the tilt.

169
00:06:47,271 --> 00:06:48,018
- Okay,

170
00:06:48,018 --> 00:06:48,998
that's the tilt.

171
00:06:48,998 --> 00:06:49,873
- [Teacher] Show everybody the tilt.

172
00:06:49,873 --> 00:06:51,011
- Okay, everyone,

173
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,591
this, Nick move,

174
00:06:52,591 --> 00:06:54,027
you're in the way of people.

175
00:06:54,027 --> 00:06:55,173
- [Teacher] Just duck down, just crouch.

176
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:56,177
- And this is the way

177
00:06:56,177 --> 00:06:57,862
of the tilt, the way it's tilted

178
00:06:57,862 --> 00:06:59,524
that way.

179
00:06:59,524 --> 00:07:01,818
But as we go around it's still tilted

180
00:07:01,818 --> 00:07:04,754
that way. And this side here

181
00:07:04,754 --> 00:07:06,730
is still far away, so what?

182
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,667
It's going to stay Winter all the time?

183
00:07:08,667 --> 00:07:10,656
Or is it just going to like flip?

184
00:07:10,656 --> 00:07:12,213
And be like,

185
00:07:12,213 --> 00:07:14,704
"Hey guys, look! Now we're Summer,

186
00:07:14,704 --> 00:07:16,395
but we're upside-down."

187
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:17,693
That's what I don't understand.

188
00:07:17,693 --> 00:07:20,128
- [Teacher] He has a
very good question, okay?

189
00:07:20,128 --> 00:07:22,596
His question is,

190
00:07:22,596 --> 00:07:24,193
why is,

191
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,145
what hemisphere are you talking about?

192
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,191
- The Northern Hemisphere.

193
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:29,353
- [Teacher] Okay. 

194
00:07:29,353 --> 00:07:31,532
So, why is the Northern Hemisphere

195
00:07:31,532 --> 00:07:33,670
always tilted towards the Sun,

196
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,317
how he's walking away?

197
00:07:35,317 --> 00:07:39,624
Because his argument is, that...

198
00:07:39,624 --> 00:07:41,192
- [Student] Oh, I have it right here.

199
00:07:41,192 --> 00:07:42,059
- [Teacher] Go ahead.

200
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:43,348
- [Student] It says, "Because the Earth's

201
00:07:43,348 --> 00:07:46,544
axis is slightly tilted,
when the North Pole

202
00:07:46,544 --> 00:07:47,878
is laying towards the Sun

203
00:07:47,878 --> 00:07:50,347
and South Pole is
laying away from the Sun.

204
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:53,155
And when the South Pole
is leading towards the Sun,

205
00:07:53,155 --> 00:07:54,271
the North Pole is leading

206
00:07:54,271 --> 00:07:56,638
away from the Sun."

207
00:07:56,638 --> 00:07:58,975
It says, "As a result,

208
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,683
the number of daylight hours in

209
00:08:01,683 --> 00:08:02,749
the Northern and Southern hemisphere

210
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:04,530
are not constantly recalled

211
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,914
because the Earth is
divided in two halves

212
00:08:06,914 --> 00:08:09,461
of the hemisphere by the equator,

213
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:13,003
the hemisphere that leads towards the Sun

214
00:08:13,003 --> 00:08:15,505
has a long day and short nights."

215
00:08:15,505 --> 00:08:16,975
Does that have to do with anything?

216
00:08:16,975 --> 00:08:18,229
- [Student] See, I...
- [Teacher] Wait!

217
00:08:20,928 --> 00:08:23,311
Does that have to do with anything?

218
00:08:23,311 --> 00:08:24,851
That's Sabrina's question.

219
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:27,249
Does that have to do with anything?

220
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:28,497
So summarize,

221
00:08:28,497 --> 00:08:30,335
what you just read to us.

222
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:32,027
- [Sabrina] Does the tilt have,

223
00:08:32,027 --> 00:08:33,830
like also have to do with like,

224
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,648
the days, and like the
short days and short nights?

225
00:08:36,648 --> 00:08:38,896
- [Teacher] Does the
tilt have to do with

226
00:08:38,896 --> 00:08:41,830
the short days and long nights,

227
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,907
and long days and short nights?

228
00:08:43,907 --> 00:08:46,233
Shawn, you're shaking your head yes.

229
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:48,436
You think it does have to do with it?

230
00:08:52,503 --> 00:08:54,278
- [Student] Say yes?

231
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:55,269
- [Shawn] Yes?

232
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:57,565
- [Teacher] You think it
does have to do with it?

233
00:08:57,565 --> 00:08:58,317
Why?

234
00:08:58,317 --> 00:08:59,453
Who could help him explain,

235
00:08:59,453 --> 00:09:01,856
why would a tilt change

236
00:09:01,856 --> 00:09:04,149
the length of day?

237
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:06,400
Move over, Lucas.

238
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,815
- [Student] Because,

239
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:09,101
like it's if,

240
00:09:09,101 --> 00:09:11,272
like it'll be indirect Sun if it's tilted

241
00:09:11,272 --> 00:09:12,618
away from it?

242
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,640
And instead of like... I don't know.

243
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,839
- (laughs)

244
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:19,117
- I think it is

245
00:09:19,117 --> 00:09:20,785
because I think

246
00:09:20,785 --> 00:09:23,253
another thing in the direct rays because,

247
00:09:23,253 --> 00:09:24,713
the way we're tilted,

248
00:09:24,713 --> 00:09:26,338
it's the number of daylight hours

249
00:09:26,338 --> 00:09:27,824
because of the less Sun,

250
00:09:27,824 --> 00:09:29,365
as much of the Sun because of the tilt,

251
00:09:29,365 --> 00:09:31,531
and how the Sun hits it
when its on its tilt?

252
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:32,703
I think,

253
00:09:32,703 --> 00:09:35,207
like, see how it tilted that way?

254
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,430
- [Teacher] No, why don't you use it?

255
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,221
Why don't you boys sit down and let...

256
00:09:39,221 --> 00:09:40,750
Pass that globe over to Byers,

257
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,749
and let him explain.

258
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,280
- What I think is...

259
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,443
You know how it's tilted this way?

260
00:09:45,443 --> 00:09:48,870
Maybe it'll tilt the opposite
direction for the Summer.

261
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,094
Like instead of it being
tilted towards this,

262
00:09:51,094 --> 00:09:53,112
it'll tilt the other way for the South.

263
00:09:53,112 --> 00:09:55,103
Instead of the North be showing,

264
00:09:55,103 --> 00:09:57,124
the South would be showing.

265
00:09:57,124 --> 00:09:58,543
That's what I think.

266
00:09:58,543 --> 00:09:59,364
- [Teacher] Where is the Sun?

267
00:09:59,364 --> 00:10:00,595
That's what I'm not understanding.

268
00:10:00,595 --> 00:10:00,845
- The Sun

269
00:10:00,845 --> 00:10:02,476
would usually be in the middle.
- [Student] You need a hand?

270
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,262
- [Byers] Yeah.
- [Teacher] Okay, go ahead,

271
00:10:04,262 --> 00:10:05,862
be the Sun again.

272
00:10:05,862 --> 00:10:07,746
- The Sun's in the middle.

273
00:10:07,746 --> 00:10:11,833
And that's why if it's tilted this way,

274
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,353
we're getting our Sun,

275
00:10:13,353 --> 00:10:16,219
but I thought if it would
tilt the opposite way,

276
00:10:16,219 --> 00:10:18,960
like instead of being tilted
this way, it'd tilt that way,

277
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,250
then the South would get more Sun?

278
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,238
- [Teacher] Okay? So, how...

279
00:10:24,238 --> 00:10:26,838
But what you're asking

280
00:10:26,838 --> 00:10:28,791
is the same question as Lucas.
- Yeah.

281
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,552
- [Teacher] How does that other hemisphere

282
00:10:31,552 --> 00:10:34,119
become tilted towards the Sun?

283
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:36,665
That's what you're trying to figure out.

284
00:10:36,665 --> 00:10:39,846
Whenever Lucas walked it around,

285
00:10:39,846 --> 00:10:41,041
the whole time,

286
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,604
what hemisphere was
pointing towards the Sun?

287
00:10:43,604 --> 00:10:44,899
- [Student] The Southern Hemisphere

288
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:46,589
was pointing towards the Sun.

289
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:51,416
And the Northern Hemisphere
was pointing away from the Sun.

290
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,510
- [Teacher] Ben?

291
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,362
- [Ben] No, I thought it was

292
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:54,622
the Northern was pointing to the Sun,

293
00:10:54,622 --> 00:10:56,706
and the Southern was pointing 
the other way.

294
00:10:56,706 --> 00:10:58,492
- [Teacher] But, it remained constant

295
00:10:58,492 --> 00:10:59,918
the whole orbit.
- [Student] Yes.

296
00:10:59,918 --> 00:11:01,564
That's what I couldn't figure out, like

297
00:11:01,564 --> 00:11:03,727
how did it just like, did it like

298
00:11:03,727 --> 00:11:05,388
flip around and all of the sudden...

299
00:11:05,388 --> 00:11:07,597
- [Byers] Maybe the Sun?
- [Student] ... it changed?

300
00:11:07,597 --> 00:11:09,608
- [Teacher] What do you guys think?

301
00:11:09,608 --> 00:11:10,576
Does the Sun move?

302
00:11:10,576 --> 00:11:12,360
JJ, you haven't been in here yet.

303
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,211
- [JJ] I think like every day,

304
00:11:14,211 --> 00:11:16,796
it moves a little to the other side.

305
00:11:16,796 --> 00:11:18,267
- [Teacher] Wait, what does?

306
00:11:18,267 --> 00:11:19,797
- [JJ] The Earth.

307
00:11:19,797 --> 00:11:21,489
- [Teacher] The Earth moves everyday?

308
00:11:21,489 --> 00:11:22,570
- [JJ] Yeah, it might. 

309
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:25,323
Like it tilts every day.

310
00:11:25,323 --> 00:11:26,637
- [Teacher] It tilts,

311
00:11:26,637 --> 00:11:28,168
the tilt is changing?

312
00:11:28,168 --> 00:11:29,135
Is that what you're saying?

313
00:11:29,135 --> 00:11:30,328
So, the tilt changes?

314
00:11:30,328 --> 00:11:31,335
What were you gonna say?

315
00:11:31,335 --> 00:11:32,487
- I think the...

316
00:11:32,487 --> 00:11:33,397
It...

317
00:11:33,397 --> 00:11:34,459
The...

318
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:35,858
Earth, like doesn't move,

319
00:11:35,858 --> 00:11:38,059
like when it stays in one spot,

320
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:40,649
I think it might like flip.

321
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:41,911
Like kind of like,

322
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:43,212
just go around, like...

323
00:11:43,212 --> 00:11:44,491
- [Teacher] Can you show us?

324
00:11:44,491 --> 00:11:45,105
Do you wanna show us?

325
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:47,105
- Sure, I'll try.

326
00:11:47,105 --> 00:11:48,047
- [Student] (inaudible)

327
00:11:48,047 --> 00:11:49,135
...I was gonna say maybe like,

328
00:11:49,135 --> 00:11:49,778
as it's,

329
00:11:49,778 --> 00:11:51,656
as like the Earth turns around,

330
00:11:51,656 --> 00:11:54,433
maybe it like, tilts
forward every so often

331
00:11:54,433 --> 00:11:55,734
and backward.

332
00:11:55,734 --> 00:11:56,718
- [Teacher] So you're telling me

333
00:11:56,718 --> 00:11:58,219
the tilt is changing though

334
00:11:58,219 --> 00:11:59,609
and it flips?
- [Student] Yes.

335
00:11:59,609 --> 00:12:01,586
- [Teacher] Okay, so what are you saying?

336
00:12:01,586 --> 00:12:02,454
- It just goes

337
00:12:02,454 --> 00:12:03,970
around like this,

338
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,939
and eventually it just like, spins around.

339
00:12:05,939 --> 00:12:08,768
- [Teacher] So, it spins
on top of its rotation?

340
00:12:08,768 --> 00:12:10,580
- [Student] Yeah.

341
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,130
- [Teacher] What do you think, Brad?

342
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,491
- [Brad] I think, yeah,
I kind of agree with him.

343
00:12:14,491 --> 00:12:15,345
- [Teacher] Wait, with who?

344
00:12:15,345 --> 00:12:16,485
- [Brad] with David.

345
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:21,190
While it's like going around its orbit,

346
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,298
it just like tilts.

347
00:12:23,298 --> 00:12:25,766
- [Teacher] So the tilt is changing?

348
00:12:25,766 --> 00:12:26,478
- [Brad] Yeah.

349
00:12:26,478 --> 00:12:27,324
- [Teacher] What do you think, Alec?

350
00:12:27,324 --> 00:12:29,024
You haven't said anything yet.

351
00:12:29,024 --> 00:12:30,528
- [Alec] I don't agree with him.

352
00:12:30,528 --> 00:12:35,066
I think that it spins
while its moving around?

353
00:12:38,944 --> 00:12:39,953
- [Teacher] Don't raise your hand,

354
00:12:39,953 --> 00:12:41,054
you don't have to raise your hand.

355
00:12:41,054 --> 00:12:41,813
- [Byers] Only this,

356
00:12:41,813 --> 00:12:43,217
like what Nick just did,

357
00:12:43,217 --> 00:12:45,137
or maybe every day it goes a little bit,

358
00:12:45,137 --> 00:12:46,625
and tilts like this.

359
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,509
And the Sun hits more of the Southern.

360
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:51,034
- (inaudible)

361
00:12:51,034 --> 00:12:52,369
- [Byers] It's like, everyday,

362
00:12:52,369 --> 00:12:54,258
goes a little bit, little bit, little bit,

363
00:12:54,258 --> 00:12:56,457
so where the South starts to get more Sun.

364
00:12:56,457 --> 00:12:58,583
Because like when we're in Summer

365
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:01,293
and Australia has Winter.

366
00:13:01,293 --> 00:13:03,925
So, when we're in Winter,
Australia has Summer.

367
00:13:03,925 --> 00:13:04,971
So...

368
00:13:04,971 --> 00:13:06,657
And it's in the Southern half

369
00:13:06,657 --> 00:13:09,504
and we're in the Northern half.

370
00:13:09,504 --> 00:13:10,760
- [Student] Wait! 
- [Teacher] Tiffany,

371
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,058
you were shaking your head.

372
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:13,552
Do you agree with what he's saying?

373
00:13:13,552 --> 00:13:16,424
- [Tiffany] Sort of, yeah.

374
00:13:16,424 --> 00:13:18,035
Because,

375
00:13:18,035 --> 00:13:20,287
if...

376
00:13:20,287 --> 00:13:23,483
one spot on the hemisphere
gets more sunlight,

377
00:13:23,483 --> 00:13:26,471
the most likely it's gonna
be warmer than the other.

378
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:27,908
Like he was saying,

379
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:31,116
when we get more sunlight,

380
00:13:31,116 --> 00:13:33,083
and the temperature's warm up here,

381
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:35,926
the temperatures in
the Southern Hemisphere

382
00:13:35,926 --> 00:13:38,190
get a little colder

383
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,607
if they don't have as much sunlight,

384
00:13:40,607 --> 00:13:42,775
and not as much warmth.

385
00:13:42,775 --> 00:13:44,169
- You see what I mean?

386
00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:45,134
Like say I'm right here,

387
00:13:45,134 --> 00:13:46,366
the Sun is tilted,

388
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:47,801
so you see how the Sun's right here?

389
00:13:47,801 --> 00:13:50,238
And then it tilts 
a little bit like this.

390
00:13:50,238 --> 00:13:51,890
We're still getting Summer sunlight,

391
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,959
but Australia's getting more sunlight.

392
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:55,647
- [Student] I have to

393
00:13:55,647 --> 00:13:58,024
agree with what JJ said earlier.

394
00:13:58,024 --> 00:13:59,906
It tilts everyday.

395
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:02,148
- [Teacher] So the tilt is changing?

396
00:14:02,148 --> 00:14:05,424
You think that the tilt is changing?

397
00:14:05,424 --> 00:14:07,280
Morgan, you think the tilt is changing?

398
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:07,677
- [Morgan] No,

399
00:14:07,677 --> 00:14:08,817
I don't think it's changing.

400
00:14:08,817 --> 00:14:10,496
I think it's staying
the same, because even,

401
00:14:10,496 --> 00:14:11,868
I think the rotation helps,

402
00:14:11,868 --> 00:14:13,632
because if it goes around the orbit,

403
00:14:13,632 --> 00:14:15,704
even though its rotating it helps.

404
00:14:15,704 --> 00:14:16,791
Like...

405
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,181
Nick, you're the Sun like,

406
00:14:18,181 --> 00:14:20,039
and the axis stays,

407
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:22,553
and when it rotates, the Earth rotates,

408
00:14:22,553 --> 00:14:23,963
and it's like kind of,

409
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,877
it like helps us.

410
00:14:25,877 --> 00:14:27,822
I don't know,

411
00:14:27,822 --> 00:14:29,691
like indirect sunlight?
I don't know.

412
00:14:29,691 --> 00:14:30,929
Something like that.

413
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:32,913
- [Student] I can show
what she means, I think.

414
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,612
- [Teacher] Go ahead.

415
00:14:36,765 --> 00:14:37,570
- [Student] I think it's also

416
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:38,977
about the gravitational pull.

417
00:14:38,977 --> 00:14:41,285
Like, when it goes around farther

418
00:14:41,285 --> 00:14:43,725
there's less gravitational pull.

419
00:14:43,725 --> 00:14:45,859
- [Student] As it goes around farther,

420
00:14:45,859 --> 00:14:47,367
there's less gravitational pull.

421
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:48,892
Okay, when you do this, Grace,

422
00:14:48,892 --> 00:14:50,403
please explain to me

423
00:14:50,403 --> 00:14:51,408
what it is.

424
00:14:51,408 --> 00:14:53,230
So, that everybody here that's watching

425
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,507
can try and make sense

426
00:14:54,507 --> 00:14:55,959
of what we're talking about.

427
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:57,095
- [Grace] I think
what she's saying is like,

428
00:14:57,095 --> 00:14:58,954
say Nick's the Sun again.

429
00:14:58,954 --> 00:15:03,155
Since the Northern is that way,

430
00:15:03,155 --> 00:15:05,161
I think she's saying is,

431
00:15:05,161 --> 00:15:07,165
it doesn't rotate but this is,

432
00:15:07,165 --> 00:15:10,185
but we're kind of going around
kind of like this?

433
00:15:10,185 --> 00:15:12,197
So, then it changes.

434
00:15:12,197 --> 00:15:15,145
So now the Southern is towards the Sun

435
00:15:15,145 --> 00:15:17,102
and the Northern is that way.

436
00:15:17,102 --> 00:15:18,505
So, now it's changed.

437
00:15:18,505 --> 00:15:20,083
- [Teacher] She did something very different

438
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,836
in her orbit.

439
00:15:21,836 --> 00:15:23,542
Did anybody catch that?

440
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:24,598
- [Students] Yeah, yeah.

441
00:15:24,598 --> 00:15:27,274
- [Student] Like she, it didn't move,

442
00:15:27,274 --> 00:15:29,002
it just went around like,

443
00:15:29,002 --> 00:15:30,426
around the Sun?

444
00:15:30,426 --> 00:15:31,999
- [Teacher] What do
you mean it didn't move?

445
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:32,935
- [Student] The Earth stayed still

446
00:15:32,935 --> 00:15:33,923
and just

447
00:15:33,923 --> 00:15:35,770
moved at one point.

448
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,797
- [Grace] It didn't do that.

449
00:15:38,797 --> 00:15:40,506
- (laughs)

450
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:43,009
- [Teacher] Okay,
let's do it again, okay?

451
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:45,080
And I want you to make sure that,

452
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,535
number one, everybody
sees where you start,

453
00:15:47,535 --> 00:15:50,922
and everybody sees what
happens to the Earth

454
00:15:50,922 --> 00:15:53,731
as she's showing you
how it's going around.

455
00:15:53,731 --> 00:15:55,195
So, explain to us.

456
00:15:55,195 --> 00:15:56,399
What is this?

457
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,725
Where are we starting?

458
00:15:57,725 --> 00:15:59,125
- Okay, we're starting out this way

459
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,650
with the Northern towards the Sun,

460
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,219
and the Southern away from the Sun.

461
00:16:02,219 --> 00:16:05,580
And as we are rotating? I don't know 
if all of you guys can see this.

462
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,845
But as we're going around?

463
00:16:07,845 --> 00:16:09,871
- [Teacher] Stop there.

464
00:16:09,871 --> 00:16:12,422
- [Grace] It's not moving? 

465
00:16:12,422 --> 00:16:13,690
So, since it's not moving,

466
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,139
now the Northern is 
kind of like facing away,

467
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,482
and the Southern is facing
towards the Sun now?

468
00:16:18,482 --> 00:16:19,316
- [Teacher] Keep going.

469
00:16:19,316 --> 00:16:20,403
And then just make sure that the camera

470
00:16:20,403 --> 00:16:21,513
can see what you're talking about

471
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:22,685
as you go around.

472
00:16:22,685 --> 00:16:24,656
Okay.

473
00:16:24,656 --> 00:16:27,237
So, did everybody see that?

474
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:28,937
Who doesn't understand that?

475
00:16:28,937 --> 00:16:30,703
Who didn't understand
what she did right there?

476
00:16:30,703 --> 00:16:31,622
Okay.

477
00:16:31,622 --> 00:16:32,379
So...

478
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:33,749
- [Student] Now, I don't understand,

479
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:35,880
actually, wouldn't it actually

480
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,657
have to stop rotating

481
00:16:37,657 --> 00:16:40,071
and then it would have
to rotate on its axis,

482
00:16:40,071 --> 00:16:43,327
and then start rotating again?

483
00:16:45,448 --> 00:16:47,527
- [Grace] I'm not sure
what you mean by that.

484
00:16:47,527 --> 00:16:49,600
- Like...

485
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,030
you spun it like this,

486
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,404
- [Grace] All right?

487
00:16:53,404 --> 00:16:56,315
- [Student] But the Earth is going
like this the whole time.

488
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:59,175
Would that end up stopping,

489
00:16:59,175 --> 00:17:01,172
and then it go like this?

490
00:17:01,172 --> 00:17:02,913
Or is that still happening?

491
00:17:02,913 --> 00:17:05,780
- [Grace]
It's not turning like that.

492
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,579
It's just rotating around the Sun.

493
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:09,738
- [Teacher] Wait, Sabrina,
you had something to say.

494
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:10,747
Okay. So,

495
00:17:10,747 --> 00:17:11,989
here's what's happening.

496
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:16,782
Lucas is a little confused
about your explanation, okay?

497
00:17:16,782 --> 00:17:18,956
So, we just have to go through it again.

498
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:20,670
What did you have to say, Sabrina?

499
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,462
- [Sabrina] The earth doesn't change its tilt.

500
00:17:22,462 --> 00:17:24,550
It stays like an exact same position,

501
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,980
but when it goes around the Sun,

502
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,413
it gets like different ways,

503
00:17:29,413 --> 00:17:32,327
like the Sun hits it in
different directions

504
00:17:32,327 --> 00:17:35,266
which causes different weathers.

505
00:17:35,266 --> 00:17:36,310
- [Teacher] Okay, wait,

506
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,912
why don't you try to show him?

507
00:17:37,912 --> 00:17:40,326
Maybe it's just a different person.

508
00:17:41,843 --> 00:17:42,999
Maybe it will

509
00:17:42,999 --> 00:17:44,385
help explain it, okay?

510
00:17:44,385 --> 00:17:46,802
So, the more people we can
get information out of,

511
00:17:46,802 --> 00:17:49,140
remember, the more we're gonna understand.

512
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,997
So, start and tell us what's happening.

513
00:17:50,997 --> 00:17:51,974
And just make sure the camera

514
00:17:51,974 --> 00:17:53,186
can see what you're doing.

515
00:17:53,186 --> 00:17:54,504
- [Sabrina] The Northern Hemisphere

516
00:17:54,504 --> 00:17:55,823
is towards the Sun,

517
00:17:55,823 --> 00:17:58,185
and the Southern is facing away.

518
00:17:58,185 --> 00:18:00,462
So, this causes colder weather,

519
00:18:00,462 --> 00:18:02,615
and up here where it's facing the Sun

520
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,294
causes warmer weather.

521
00:18:04,294 --> 00:18:05,840
So, when it goes around

522
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,349
the weathers start to change

523
00:18:08,349 --> 00:18:11,249
and then when you get it around here,

524
00:18:11,249 --> 00:18:15,381
the Southern is facing towards.

525
00:18:15,381 --> 00:18:17,622
- [Teacher] Wait, is the
Southern facing towards?

526
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,245
- [Sabrina] The Southern's facing

527
00:18:22,245 --> 00:18:23,815
towards the Sun.

528
00:18:23,815 --> 00:18:25,821
And the winter is facing away.

529
00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:28,859
Which causes it to be warmer down here

530
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:30,520
and Winter up here.

531
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,850
- [Teacher] Who can
help her out, because...

532
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,266
- [Lucas] What I don't understand, is...

533
00:18:33,266 --> 00:18:34,099
- [Teacher] Go ahead, go ahead.

534
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:36,075
- [Lucas] I don't understand it because

535
00:18:36,075 --> 00:18:37,947
it's still changing from day to night,

536
00:18:37,947 --> 00:18:41,202
but then it's shifting so
wouldn't it have to stop spinning

537
00:18:41,202 --> 00:18:42,729
and then shift?

538
00:18:42,729 --> 00:18:44,643
- If it stops spinning we're gonna die.

539
00:18:44,643 --> 00:18:45,596
- (laughs)

540
00:18:45,596 --> 00:18:46,787
- [Student] Not necessarily.

541
00:18:46,787 --> 00:18:47,931
- [Teacher] Okay, wait, Ben,

542
00:18:47,931 --> 00:18:49,697
start from the beginning

543
00:18:49,697 --> 00:18:51,374
and explain what's going on.

544
00:18:51,374 --> 00:18:52,902
Nick is our Sun still.

545
00:18:52,902 --> 00:18:54,843
Put your legs in so he doesn't trip.

546
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:56,532
Northern Hemisphere is towards the Sun,

547
00:18:56,532 --> 00:18:57,687
Southern's away.

548
00:18:57,687 --> 00:18:59,217
And it's still spinning, 
it doesn't change...

549
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:04,232
- [Teacher] Okay. And so stop there

550
00:19:04,232 --> 00:19:05,139
and what's happening?

551
00:19:05,139 --> 00:19:06,700
- [Ben] The Southern
Hemisphere's towards the Sun

552
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,996
and the Northern's away from it.

553
00:19:07,996 --> 00:19:09,952
- [Teacher] And what happened
to the tilt the whole time?

554
00:19:09,952 --> 00:19:11,163
- [Ben] It didn't change.

555
00:19:11,163 --> 00:19:11,837
- [Teacher] It what?

556
00:19:11,837 --> 00:19:12,648
- [Ben] It didn't change.

557
00:19:12,648 --> 00:19:14,244
- [Teacher] It didn't
change, it stayed the same.

558
00:19:14,244 --> 00:19:15,330
- [Lucas] But that made more sense.

559
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,346
Like, I couldn't figure
out why it wasn't spinning,

560
00:19:17,346 --> 00:19:19,632
but now I do.
- [Ben] And then it keeps going.

561
00:19:19,632 --> 00:19:22,558
And then it just goes back.

562
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:25,688
- [Lucas] Now I understand.

563
00:19:25,688 --> 00:19:26,866
- [Teacher] Okay.

564
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:29,019
Let's use this model,

565
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:30,637
and try to figure out,

566
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:32,553
where are the seasons happening?

567
00:19:32,553 --> 00:19:36,066
So, where do we live, Anna?

568
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:38,693
- [Anna] We live...

569
00:19:38,693 --> 00:19:40,527
Yeah, where he's pointing.

570
00:19:40,527 --> 00:19:42,504
- [Teacher] What's
that called, somebody?

571
00:19:42,504 --> 00:19:44,153
- [Students] America.

572
00:19:44,153 --> 00:19:45,266
- (laughs)

573
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:46,385
- [Student] North America.

574
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,049
- [Teacher] North
America, let's get bigger.

575
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:49,867
- [Byers] Northern Hemisphere?

576
00:19:49,867 --> 00:19:51,049
- [Teacher] What Byers?

577
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:51,940
- [Byers] The Northern Hemisphere.

578
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,587
- [Teacher] Okay, so we live
in the Northern Hemisphere.

579
00:19:53,587 --> 00:19:56,192
Right now, what's happening?

580
00:19:56,192 --> 00:19:58,109
- [Students] It's Summer.

581
00:19:58,109 --> 00:20:00,614
- [Teacher] It's Summer
in the Northern Hemisphere.

582
00:20:00,614 --> 00:20:02,218
Does everyone see that?

583
00:20:02,218 --> 00:20:03,399
- [Students] Yes.

584
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:04,037
- [Teacher] Yes.

585
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,235
Anybody not see

586
00:20:05,235 --> 00:20:07,336
it's Summer in the Northern
Hemisphere, see it?

587
00:20:07,336 --> 00:20:08,225
- [Students] Yeah.

588
00:20:08,225 --> 00:20:09,086
- [Teacher] Okay, so...
