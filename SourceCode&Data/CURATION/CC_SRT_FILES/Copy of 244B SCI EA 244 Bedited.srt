1
00:00:00,431 --> 00:00:04,744
- [Teacher] That's heavier
automatically sink.

2
00:00:06,688 --> 00:00:08,151
Hang on one sec.

3
00:00:08,151 --> 00:00:11,848
And then, we'll try to
work through this one.

4
00:00:13,212 --> 00:00:14,837
If something is heavier
than something else,

5
00:00:14,837 --> 00:00:17,247
will it automatically sink?

6
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:21,089
Are ships heavy?

7
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:23,144
Do ships sink?

8
00:00:23,614 --> 00:00:25,018
Occasionally, right?

9
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:26,957
Especially if you're on that cruise ship,

10
00:00:26,957 --> 00:00:30,121
like last week, did you hear about that?

11
00:00:31,834 --> 00:00:33,679
- [Boy] It depends on the--

12
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:35,434
- [Teacher] Okay, now we're talking about

13
00:00:35,434 --> 00:00:37,211
depends what it's in.

14
00:00:37,211 --> 00:00:39,254
So, now we've got all these
different ideas working.

15
00:00:39,254 --> 00:00:40,751
Holy cow.

16
00:00:40,751 --> 00:00:42,203
Yes, ma'am, anything else to add?

17
00:00:42,203 --> 00:00:43,932
- I was gonna say, I don't know why,

18
00:00:43,932 --> 00:00:46,104
I'm just gonna hook on
this whole list of things,

19
00:00:46,104 --> 00:00:50,167
but, like, a tin can
will float if it's empty,

20
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:52,035
because of the air
that's stuck inside of it

21
00:00:52,035 --> 00:00:53,753
holds the object up.

22
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:57,666
So, if that was hollow, I'm guessing

23
00:00:57,666 --> 00:01:01,544
that it would most likely float.

24
00:01:01,544 --> 00:01:04,434
So, the ships are hollow in the bottom,

25
00:01:04,434 --> 00:01:05,851
the air that keeps it up,

26
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:08,474
but the bottom, how part of the ship

27
00:01:08,474 --> 00:01:11,377
goes in water is because
part of it isn't hollow.

28
00:01:11,377 --> 00:01:13,431
That part sinks, but the air in the boat

29
00:01:13,431 --> 00:01:15,952
will keep it up and
that's how things float.
