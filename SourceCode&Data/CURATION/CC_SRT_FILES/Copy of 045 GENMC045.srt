1
00:00:01,100-->00:00:02,900
So we remember our unit of measurement.

2
00:00:03,500-->00:00:05,500
The top is 140

3
00:00:06,100-->00:00:15,800
41, 140... okay

4
00:00:16,100-->00:00:21,900
Ruth flip over and let Maddie do the question. We're going 
to write it out and then you can do this question next, okay.

5
00:00:22,900-->00:00:31,900
Compare and record the results of all three patterns you 
have been observing -absorption- observations.

6
00:00:32,900-->00:00:36,900
So lay out your data sheet right here in the middle, where 
you can all look at all three.

7
00:00:43,500-->00:00:48,200
Okay, um I would say... I would say...

8
00:00:49,100-->00:00:53,100
It's because like the peanut butter moves 9 and its grown 

9
00:00:53,900-->00:00:54,900
What do you mean its grown?

10
00:00:55,600-->00:00:59,500
Its like expanding, it expands

11
00:00:59,950-->00:01:02,900
What was it that expanded into that paper towel?

12
00:01:03,100-->00:01:04,900
The fat. The oil.

13
00:01:05,100-->00:01:06,900
The oil from the peanut butter?
- Yeah, the oil.

14
00:01:07,100-->00:01:11,100
Okay, so we discussed that one. So Maddie is going to write 
down about the peanut butter. 

15
00:01:11,900-->00:01:17,100
What the observation was. At the first observation it was 9 
centimetres. 

16
00:01:17,900-->00:01:21,100
And it has grown. In Joshua's words, it has grown. 

17
00:01:21,900-->00:01:24,800
Good. And you're gonna do that for all three of them.

18
00:01:25,100-->00:01:28,100
- Okay, um, The peanut butter, 
- No, we just did the peanut butter 

19
00:01:28,600-->00:01:33,100
Oh no, I mean the banana, it's... it's...

20
00:01:35,500-->00:01:37,100 
It's grown like 4 inches taller

21
00:01:39,900-->00:01:45,100
Its like 1, 1 and a half inch taller.

22
00:01:45,900-->00:01:52,100
- Its like one and  half inches. 
- Okay what is that? Look. Its like 9 and a half.

23
00:01:52,900-->00:02:01,500
- 10 and a half - 9, 10 and 12. That's 1, 2, 3  
- We're looking at the bananas, yeah

24
00:02:01,900-->00:02:03,100
... wait that's half an inch

25
00:02:08,500-->00:02:12,100
Alright, so did you get that? Were the Cheetos 
recorded? Okay, good.

26
00:02:12,900-->00:02:17,100
Alright, so now we've got... let's look here. Josh go 
ahead and read number 9.

27
00:02:17,900-->00:02:25,100
Compare and record the results from all three fat 
absorb- absorption- observations.

28
00:02:25,500-->00:02:25,995
Observations

29
00:02:26,100-->00:02:32,500
Observations, okay, so we're going to look at all three 
here we've got our data laid out here. Look at your Cheetos.

30
00:02:33,100-->00:02:37,900
Um the first time Cheetos was eight and a half inches, 

31
00:02:38,100-->00:02:43,900
the second time it was 10 and a half inches, and the 
last time it was 12. 12 centimeters.

32
00:02:44,500-->00:02:50,500
So what does that mean? Joseph what do you see when 
you see those numbers going like that?

33
00:02:50,700-->00:02:53,500
Um its like growing because every time you check one its 
like 

34
00:02:53,800-->00:02:57,500
a little bit bigger and it gets a little more inches on 
and it gets a little bit more big. 

35
00:02:57,900-->00:03:03,100
So basically the longer that the Cheetos sat on the 
paper towel, 

36
00:03:05,500-->00:03:09,800
the more fat and oil is absorbed into the paper towel, 
right? Okay?

37
00:03:10,100-->00:03:14,100 
So um Josh, if you'll just go ahead and write that down 
about the Cheetos. 

38
00:03:14,900-->00:03:16,700
And Hailey, what did you notice about the next food? 

39
00:03:16,900-->00:03:18,100
The apples?

40
00:03:21,900-->00:03:29,800
Um, two times it stayed the same and one time it got
 a little bit smaller.

41
00:03:29,900-->00:03:31,500
- Just got a little bit? 
- Yeah

42
00:03:31,800-->00:03:35,200
Okay, it says two are the same and one is just a little
 bit different. 

43
00:03:35,500-->00:03:39,200
And that could have been just, um where is our centimeters? 

44
00:03:39,600-->00:03:46,500
It could have been just human error where we just sort 
of measured a little bit off. 

45
00:03:46,800-->00:03:51,900
Okay? Um, 'cause if you look at this apple sample here, 

46
00:03:52,100-->00:03:54,100
there isn't really any coming out of the green 
circle, is there? 

47
00:03:54,900-->00:03:57,800
So nothing was absorbed from the apple.

48
00:03:57,950-->00:04:02,600
Did you see that? Okay, alright?

49
00:04:02,950-->00:04:08,800
So if you'll add that to our list 
that we've noticed, we observed. 

50
00:04:13,500-->00:04:19,200
Shemaire you look at those potato chips. 
I'm going to leave that one here. 

51
00:04:19,950-->00:04:23
Tell us what the overall pattern was with the potato chips.

52
00:04:23,950-->00:04:24,900
The potato chips

53
00:04:25,100-->00:04:26,500
Talk real loud for me.

54
00:04:26,900-->00:04:35,200
Um ok, the potato chips, they, like, changed each time. 

55
00:04:35,950-->00:04:44,200
Like, the first time, it was 5, the second time it was 
eight and a half and this time it was 7.

56
00:04:44,900-->00:04:47,500
And what are those that you are talking about? 
what units of measure?

57
00:04:47,500-->00:04:48,900
Centimeters

58
00:04:49,100-->00:04:53,900
- Centimeters, okay. So we want to make sure we get 
centimeters written in on there okay? 
-[Student] uh-huh

59
00:04:54,500-->00:04:58,900
Alright, so what does that tell you about potato chips?

60
00:04:59,100-->00:05:07,800
Um, that its not like that fat, it doesn't got that much 
grease in it 'cause, pretty much it showed like,

61
00:05:08,100-->00:05:14,800
it was lower and then it got a little bigger 
then it just got a little bigger.

62
00:05:15,100-->00:05:18,900
Okay, so comparing the three here, what do you notice? 

63
00:05:19,100-->00:05:24,500
Pretty much that this one has more fat than these two.

64
00:05:24,900-->00:05:30,500
It looks like with this observation, just this one here 
in class today, 

65
00:05:30,900-->00:05:36,500
and later we're gonna do- we'll look at the food labels of 
potato chips and Cheetos.

66
00:05:36,900-->00:05:43,500
But right now, just on our observations, it does look 
like the Cheetos have more fat right now, okay?

67
00:05:43,900-->00:05:47,200
- But when we start reading, its gonna be potato chips? 
- Oh that leads us in 
- [Shemaire] It's gonna be Cheetos!

68
00:05:48,200-->00:05:51,900
So go ahead, so um let's look at number 10, 
read that for us Josh.

69
00:05:52,100-->00:05:59,100
What can you conclude from the observations and recorded 
data? 

70
00:05:59,800-->00:06:04,100
Which snack has the most, or least amount of fat?

71
00:06:05,500-->00:06:09,200
So you all will come and discuss that together and then
you can answer that question right there. 

72
00:06:09,800-->00:06:12,200
Put most and least. Fine, okay?

73
00:06:12,900-->00:06:19,200
I'd say the apples have the least amount of fat. 
And the potato chips have the least...

74
00:06:19,900-->00:06:26,200
... the apples have the least amount of fat, then the 
potato chips second and the Cheetos is last.

75
00:06:28,900-->00:06:35,500
And why do you think that might be? Why do you 
think the banana has expanded the most?

76
00:06:36,500-->00:06:43,200
Because its... - I don't think its because 
of the fat in the bananas and getting in...

77
00:06:43,500-->00:06:44,100
Talk loud

78
00:06:44,900-->00:06:48,200
I don't think its because of fat with the bananas that's 
getting oil on the paper towel,

79
00:06:48,900-->00:06:52,200
because bananas are pretty healthy and they don't really 
normally have fat in them.

80
00:06:52,900-->00:06:54,100
Yeah, yeah

81
00:06:54,900-->00:06:57,500
Okay, so that's your background knowledge. You are aware 
of that. What were you gonna say?

82
00:06:57,900-->00:07:03,100
- It's like, its not fat or oil, its like its just water 
- Maybe water 
[Student] absorbed in it...

83
00:07:03,900-->00:07:10,200
What prediction would you make, if we were to let this sit 
over night, to where like, the water would have time to dry up. 

84
00:07:10,900-->00:07:15,900
What would you predict this paper towel would look like 
tomorrow? Let me go with Tray?

85
00:07:16,100-->00:07:18,200
It would be all wet and soggy.

86
00:07:18,900-->00:07:23,200
- So you think it would actually be more wet? 
- Yeah. 
-[Teacher] Okay, Emily what do you think?

87
00:07:23,800-->00:07:31,500
Well I would think that the way it is now, that the paper 
towels are gonna end up like that 

88
00:07:31,800-->00:07:40,500
and the bananas would get all... and more disgusting and...

89
00:07:40,900-->00:07:45,500
Okay, does anybody think that the banana might- 
that the wet, watery part might dry up? Maybe

90
00:07:45,900-->00:07:53,500
I think it would expand a little bit more and then 
start drying until the water is out of the banana

91
00:07:53,700-->00:07:55,500
and then the banana starts to dry out too.

92
00:07:55,900-->00:08:01,300
Okay, well alright. We'll actually leave that one 
out and see, and we'll check on it tomorrow.

93
00:08:01,900-->00:08:04,300
And see what it's doing. And we'll kind of answer 
our own question there, okay?

94
00:08:04,900-->00:08:12,100
Okay, wait we're not finished, 
what do we say about the banana?

95
00:08:12,900-->00:08:13,100
You have to talk louder though

96
00:08:13,900-->00:08:20,100
The banana I guess - the banana, like expands 
the wetness. 

97
00:08:20,700-->00:08:25,100
It expands a couple centimeters, like a half a centimeter.

98
00:08:25,900-->00:08:29,100
Good use of centimeters. I like how you're using 
the actual mathematical term there. 

99
00:08:29,500-->00:08:30,300
The centimeter is good. 

100
00:08:30,900-->00:08:37,100
Okay while she is writing that, I'm going to let Tray 
go ahead and read that next question, 

101
00:08:37,900-->00:08:39,100
Well, if you can see it. 

102
00:08:39,900-->00:08:44,200
Maddie, will you let him read that so we can kinda 
be thinking while your finishing up there?

103
00:08:44,900-->00:08:50,100
Um, what can you conclude from the observ- 
observation and recorded data? 

104
00:08:50,600-->00:08:54,100
What snack has the most most and least amount of fat?

105
00:08:55,900-->00:09:07,100
Well, um, as my opinion, I would think that, the 
banana has more fat than the peanut butter

106
00:09:07,700-->00:09:10,100
and the least amount of fat would be the fudge.

107
00:09:10,900-->00:09:13,900
Okay, Josh?

108
00:09:14,500-->00:09:22,100
Well, I would think that the fudge has the least amount, 
'cause it has the least amount of absorbed

109
00:09:22,700-->00:09:33,100
like, grease and fat. But the banana has like 
... all this oil, water and all that, like, sinking into it.

110
00:09:33,900-->00:09:35,800
Okay, Maddie?

111
00:09:36,100-->00:09:45,100
I think that the peanut butter has the most 
amount of fat because um 

112
00:09:45,900-->00:09:49,100
like I said earlier, the bananas are more healthy 
than the peanut butter and 

113
00:09:49,500-->00:09:56,100
it's probably just water and this is like oils and 
salt and stuff, 

114
00:09:56,900-->00:10:02,100
making it more greasy and that's probably more 
fat absorbing into the paper and 

115
00:10:02,900-->00:10:07,100
then the fudge hasn't had very much at all so 
I would say it has the least amount of fat.

116
00:10:07,900-->00:10:16,900
I would agree with like most of y'all because the banana 
and the peanut butter is like, 

117
00:10:17,100-->00:10:22,900
has like, a lot of wetness in it. And the fudge 
has like, a little bit of wetness.

118
00:10:23,100-->00:10:26,500
- Like a centimeter 
- Yeah, about a centimeter.

119
00:10:26,900-->00:10:33,100
But also the bananas could have the least amount of fat 
because they are healthier and that's probably just water.

120
00:10:39,500-->00:10:43,100
Compare the results to the original group hypothesis. 

121
00:10:44,500-->00:10:50,100
Our hypothesis is that the potato chips will 
have the most fat. 
-[Teacher] Talk loud

122
00:10:50,900-->00:10:56,200
Our Hypothesis is that the potato chips will 
have the most fat. 

123
00:10:56,900-->00:11:08,200
Our group decided this after discussing Cheetos 
versus potato chips deep fried and 

124
00:11:08,900-->00:11:21,500
adding salt and Cheetos are made out of cheese so 
cheese is made out of milk from cows, which is healthy.

125
00:11:21,900-->00:11:24,200
Oh, wow, lots of thought went into that.

126
00:11:24,900-->00:11:28,300
Okay, so read that question again, how do we compare 

127
00:11:28,900-->00:11:35,500
our original hypothesis to what we've discovered 
now in our research?

128
00:11:35,900-->00:11:39,200
- We were wrong. 
- Say that again. 
-[Shemaire] We were wrong.

129
00:11:39,900-->00:11:45,100
Okay, so according to our data, what did you find? 
Why do you say we were wrong?

130
00:11:45,900-->00:11:57,500
- Because, like the Cheetos, they had like
 a bunch of fat, grease and stuff. 
- [Teacher] Talk louder

131
00:11:57,900-->00:12:03,100
And the potato chips, they like barely have any.

132
00:12:03,900-->00:12:06,100
They had some, but it wasn't quite what you were 
thinking, right?

133
00:12:06,900-->00:12:11,100
- What were you gonna say Josh, we're gonna 
come right back to you. 
- [Josh] No

134
00:12:11,900-->00:12:12,100
- Yes Joseph?

135
00:12:12,900-->00:12:15,500
- She thought it was the Cheetos, 

136
00:12:15,900-->00:12:22,500
which we thought it was that and afterwards now since 
we found out that it was probably the cheese [mumbles]... 

137
00:12:22,900-->00:12:24,500
- Talk loud

138
00:12:24,900-->00:12:29,500
- When it gets stuck on you fingers, it's all wet and 
oily and everything.
 - [Teacher] Okay

139
00:12:29,900-->00:12:32,100
- No, she's the one that said cheese was healthy.

140
00:12:34,900-->00:12:39,100
- Okay well think about it, some cheeses are healthy, 

141
00:12:39,900-->00:12:43,500
this is more of a dehydrated powdered cheese 
added to the Cheetos, right? 

142
00:12:43,900-->00:12:45,100
Go ahead, Josh, what were you gonna say?

143
00:12:45,900-->00:12:57,100
- She said that maybe the salt from the potato chips 
could've dried up the grease, maybe. 
- [Teacher] Okay, Hailey?

144
00:13:01,900-->00:13:04,100
Pretty much what Josh said. It's the same.

145
00:13:04,900-->00:13:11,100
Okay, so you just agree with that?  So Josh, maybe 
you could all just write down some of what you all discussed.

146
00:13:11,900-->00:13:18,500
About the change from what our prediction or our 
hypothesis was to what we found now? Okay? 

147
00:13:18,900-->00:13:24,500
And Hailey if you want to go ahead and start some 
of our discussion questions. Okay?

148
00:13:25,500-->00:13:31,100
Based on our discoveries from today, 
what snack has less fat? Joseph?

149
00:13:31,900-->00:13:36,100
- Um apples
- Claire? 
- [Claire] Definitely apples.

150
00:13:36,500-->00:13:37,100
- Josh?  
- Apples

151
00:13:37,900-->00:13:39,300
- Yeah, apples. 

152
00:13:39,900-->00:13:46,500
When you go home today, what snack would you choose
based on the data collected today and why? Joseph?

153
00:13:46,900-->00:13:53,600
I'd probably do the apples because it pretty much has 
no fat which we learned, and 

154
00:13:53,900-->00:14:00,100
I'd probably want to eat no more Cheetos 
since I found out how many fat was in them now. 

155
00:14:01,100-->00:14:03,900
- Never again? 
- [Joseph] Never 
- Oh, you wouldn't live would you? 

156
00:14:04,900-->00:14:09,100
- Very good Hailey, say that again?
- [Hailey] I wouldn't eat Cheetos very often

157
00:14:10,900-->00:14:15,500
You wouldn't eat Cheetos as much, but in 
limited quantities, right? 

158
00:14:15,900-->00:14:18,500
Okay, very good. Shemaire which snack would 
you choose?

159
00:14:19,100-->00:14:29,500
I'd probably have to say apples too because 
they are healthy either way and 

160
00:14:29,900-->00:14:35,500
I love Granny Smith apples, they're my favorite.

161
00:14:35,900-->00:14:36,100
Oh good, good, healthy snack eater!

162
00:14:36,900-->00:14:41,500
I'm going to have to say now since we found out Cheetos, 
how much fat it has. 

163
00:14:41,900-->00:14:44,500
Then we start thinking about how much fat is
actually in there, 

164
00:14:44,900-->00:14:46,100
we probably don't know how much fat is in there.

165
00:14:46,900-->00:14:52,100
Right. Well we're going to look at those food labels 
closer now that we've investigated these and see 

166
00:14:52,900-->00:14:57,900
which one really does have more fat, 
the potato chips or the Cheetos.
