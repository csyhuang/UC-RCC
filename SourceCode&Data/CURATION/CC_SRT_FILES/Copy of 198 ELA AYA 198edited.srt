1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:02,909
- That they need to make
some sort of a change.

2
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:04,418
- [Male Student] Like the turning point?

3
00:00:04,418 --> 00:00:06,066
- Like there's a turning point.

4
00:00:06,066 --> 00:00:08,736
There's some kind of
change that needs to occur.

5
00:00:08,736 --> 00:00:10,292
Do you guys think that most people

6
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:13,775
take that opportunity and then change?

7
00:00:13,775 --> 00:00:16,307
- [Students] No.

8
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:19,388
- I think some no.

9
00:00:19,388 --> 00:00:22,344
In Fahrenheit 451, how some people

10
00:00:22,344 --> 00:00:24,990
were assuming that Mildred already knew,

11
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,937
but she just didn't want to not like accept it 
but not be part of it.

12
00:00:28,937 --> 00:00:30,950
She didn't want to be part of the change,

13
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,342
she just wanted to be
in tune with society.

14
00:00:33,342 --> 00:00:35,153
- She never gave herself an opportunity

15
00:00:35,153 --> 00:00:37,289
to have any kind of turning point.

16
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:38,659
[students chuckling]

17
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:41,213
- Even when she had the
opportunity, she didn't.

18
00:00:41,213 --> 00:00:41,863
- Right.

19
00:00:41,863 --> 00:00:43,140
- [Male Student] I think emotion plays

20
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,973
a big role in that, too, because Faber

21
00:00:45,973 --> 00:00:48,271
let fear get in the way
of him doing something,

22
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:51,948
so he basically created
that little earpiece thing,

23
00:00:51,948 --> 00:00:53,829
so that somebody else could do it for him,

24
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:55,247
and he could watch over somebody

25
00:00:55,247 --> 00:00:56,872
that's actually doing it.

26
00:00:56,872 --> 00:00:58,310
- [Male Student] Another
person who's carrying

27
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:01,050
the shoes to go through the
turning point is Beatty,

28
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,001
because although he had
all of the knowledge,

29
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:06,089
much more knowledge than Montag had

30
00:01:06,089 --> 00:01:07,437
about society and everything,

31
00:01:07,437 --> 00:01:09,386
he chose not to go against it

32
00:01:09,386 --> 00:01:12,613
because he believed that if he does it,

33
00:01:12,613 --> 00:01:15,167
then what's the point, if he's not going

34
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:17,095
to gain anything out of it.

35
00:01:17,095 --> 00:01:18,441
- [Female Student] Do you think also

36
00:01:18,441 --> 00:01:19,881
because he has all that knowledge,

37
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:22,365
he wants to use it to have power?

38
00:01:22,365 --> 00:01:25,361
Since he knows all that,
he wants to manipulate,

39
00:01:25,361 --> 00:01:28,286
keep them in control, keep
them in check and stuff.

40
00:01:28,286 --> 00:01:29,959
- [Male Student] No, I don't think it's

41
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:32,489
that he wants power, I
mean, it's that he's seen

42
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:35,345
the bad side of things,
and, like all humans,

43
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,806
you don't like to go through something

44
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,035
when it has lots of negativity in it.

45
00:01:40,035 --> 00:01:42,962
With education, he knows it's good

46
00:01:42,962 --> 00:01:45,236
because it helps you
think outside of the box,

47
00:01:45,236 --> 00:01:46,444
and everything,

48
00:01:46,444 --> 00:01:48,487
but it's bad also because then you have

49
00:01:48,487 --> 00:01:52,782
two countering opinions on everything.

50
00:01:52,782 --> 00:01:56,265
Then you realize that there's genocides,

51
00:01:56,265 --> 00:01:58,657
there's slavery, there's wars,

52
00:01:58,657 --> 00:02:00,050
there's too much negativity.

53
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,511
- [Female Student] The
government also doesn't want

54
00:02:02,511 --> 00:02:06,087
that because it probably gives
them ideas of where to go.

55
00:02:06,087 --> 00:02:07,642
The more information they know,

56
00:02:07,642 --> 00:02:12,478
the more possible ways they
can use it against them.

57
00:02:12,478 --> 00:02:14,824
- [Male Student] I like what you said

58
00:02:14,824 --> 00:02:18,097
about the government
doing that kind of stuff,

59
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:19,955
because I guess they see it as a way

60
00:02:19,955 --> 00:02:23,809
of knowledge makes people--

61
00:02:23,809 --> 00:02:24,522
- [Female Student] Vulnerable.

62
00:02:24,522 --> 00:02:27,106
- [Male Student] Vulnerable.
It's like if the people

63
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:28,453
were the government's subordinates,

64
00:02:28,453 --> 00:02:31,130
so it's not the government's
people who they're protecting,

65
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,776
it's pretty much who
they're in control of.

66
00:02:36,496 --> 00:02:38,730
- [Female Student] I kind
of want to share my opinion

67
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,890
on the turning point
thing, like in Harrison,

68
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,026
and bridge around again.

69
00:02:44,026 --> 00:02:47,230
You get to see the emotion, or what George

70
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,412
has to go through, but
yet he doesn't do anything

71
00:02:49,412 --> 00:02:51,084
about it; Harrison does.

72
00:02:51,084 --> 00:02:54,196
It says right here, "His
thoughts fled and panicked

73
00:02:54,196 --> 00:02:58,165
like bandits from a burglar alarm."

74
00:02:58,165 --> 00:02:59,953
It's showing you what he has to go through

75
00:02:59,953 --> 00:03:04,469
for his thoughts to be

76
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:05,469
taken out of his head, or whatever

77
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:09,874
but Harrison is the one doing the actions.

78
00:03:09,874 --> 00:03:12,661
He's the one that wants to
go against the government,

79
00:03:12,661 --> 00:03:14,286
and George isn't.

80
00:03:14,286 --> 00:03:16,537
- [Male Student] So, do you
think their relationship

81
00:03:16,537 --> 00:03:18,651
and the correlation of George and Harrison

82
00:03:18,651 --> 00:03:21,554
is just like Montag and Faber's,

83
00:03:21,554 --> 00:03:23,411
where Faber doesn't want to do anything,

84
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,407
because he didn't want to
go to jail in the South?

85
00:03:25,407 --> 00:03:27,729
George doesn't want to go to jail

86
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:30,029
because he doesn't want
to lighten his own way

87
00:03:30,029 --> 00:03:33,906
because he would get,
what was it, seven years?

88
00:03:33,906 --> 00:03:34,905
- [Female Student] Yeah.

89
00:03:34,905 --> 00:03:37,016
- For each sled that he takes out.

90
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,451
And Harrison is actually doing stuff.

91
00:03:39,451 --> 00:03:42,271
And Montag isn't doing stuff.

92
00:03:42,271 --> 00:03:45,206
So, do you think that
you need that person,

93
00:03:45,206 --> 00:03:47,946
the one behind the scenes doing the stuff,

94
00:03:47,946 --> 00:03:50,848
and then a person that's
actually doing it,

95
00:03:50,848 --> 00:03:54,831
or do you just mean people that actually

96
00:03:54,831 --> 00:03:57,303
already in action to a bill?

97
00:03:57,303 --> 00:04:00,425
- I think that you need
people who are (inaudible)

98
00:04:01,425 --> 00:04:04,575
I think that you need
people who are (inaudible)

99
00:04:04,575 --> 00:04:09,226
but I think that it's
easier to (inaudible)

100
00:04:09,226 --> 00:04:11,509
so I think that way is better.

101
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:12,601
So you don't get in trouble (inaudible)

102
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:14,900
(students laughing)

103
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,522
- (male student) I think
the people that have

104
00:04:18,522 --> 00:04:22,865
(inaudibleble), the people in the
front lines are always useful.

105
00:04:22,865 --> 00:04:25,851
They are easier to camoflauge (inaudible)

106
00:04:25,851 --> 00:04:27,880
They are the ones with the real plans.

107
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,644
These people in the
front don't usually come

108
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,573
up with them.

109
00:04:30,573 --> 00:04:32,291
- Yeah, but you have the plans and then you

110
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,125
don't do it.

111
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,656
but what does it matter
that you have the plan

112
00:04:36,656 --> 00:04:37,910
and you don't know how to use it?

113
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,579
- Well, not every body's that brave.

114
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:42,877
(students talking)

115
00:04:42,877 --> 00:04:44,479
- That's why you need to...

116
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,825
- (male student) I think
people need the support system,

117
00:04:45,825 --> 00:04:50,557
like Faber was Montag's support system.

118
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:52,265
- He had a plan (inaudible)

119
00:04:52,265 --> 00:04:58,317
(inaudible)

120
00:04:58,317 --> 00:04:59,464
(students laughing)

121
00:04:59,464 --> 00:05:00,782
- (female student) Don't
let him tell you he sees,

122
00:05:00,782 --> 00:05:02,314
walk away, walk away.

123
00:05:02,314 --> 00:05:03,197
(students laughing)

124
00:05:03,197 --> 00:05:05,008
- (teacher) I guess, here's my question.

125
00:05:05,008 --> 00:05:06,633
So, in looking at our essay question

126
00:05:06,633 --> 00:05:08,699
for our final exam tomorrow,

127
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:11,091
I want you to think... our question is,

128
00:05:11,091 --> 00:05:12,949
to what extent should citizens comply

129
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:18,011
with unfair laws, right,
created by government?

130
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:21,589
I know I'm asking you to
respond with to what extent,

131
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:23,703
should citizens comply
with these unfair laws?

132
00:05:23,703 --> 00:05:27,116
But we're also talking about
so who should act, right?

133
00:05:27,116 --> 00:05:30,274
So who should be the one to act out,

134
00:05:30,274 --> 00:05:32,875
to lead, to go against the government?

135
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,103
Because we're looking at characters who

136
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:38,053
possess the capacity to act out.

137
00:05:38,053 --> 00:05:39,724
We're looking at people
who have knowledge,

138
00:05:39,724 --> 00:05:42,511
who have strength, who are talented.

139
00:05:42,511 --> 00:05:44,090
But they're not leaders.

140
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,388
And we're also looking
at people who may not

141
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:49,963
have those qualities,
they have the potential

142
00:05:49,963 --> 00:05:52,517
to have those qualities,
but need a little bit

143
00:05:52,517 --> 00:05:54,676
of encouragement and a
little bit of a push.

144
00:05:54,676 --> 00:05:58,554
So when we say to what extent
should citizens comply,

145
00:05:58,554 --> 00:06:02,339
do you guys think that
citizens applies to everybody?

146
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:05,055
Or is it limited to a
group of people who are

147
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,982
willing to make those sacrifices?

148
00:06:06,982 --> 00:06:09,699
Do you even think that's
fair that it's a small

149
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:12,881
group of people who make
the sacrifice for the whole?

150
00:06:12,881 --> 00:06:14,785
I want you to think about
any types of current

151
00:06:14,785 --> 00:06:19,521
or historical events where
we've seen a group of people,

152
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:22,796
whether it is a whole group,
or just a couple of people

153
00:06:22,796 --> 00:06:26,301
who take charge, who
lead and impact change.

154
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:28,692
Are there any examples that
you can connect to that?

155
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:32,849
Do you think that that's
even fair for everyone

156
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:36,077
to benefit from the sacrifice
of a small group of people?

157
00:06:36,077 --> 00:06:40,721
- (male student) I see it as
a way... every time there's

158
00:06:40,721 --> 00:06:44,459
a change, or a law, or
something that affects

159
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:45,758
a certain group of people,

160
00:06:45,758 --> 00:06:50,758
it's never really based on
the whole group of people.

161
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:53,467
Like all citizens. It's more of a target,

162
00:06:53,467 --> 00:06:57,731
and when a certain group

163
00:06:57,731 --> 00:07:01,581
is attacked or targeted,

164
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:05,414
it makes others not really...

165
00:07:05,414 --> 00:07:07,923
I don't want to say care,

166
00:07:07,923 --> 00:07:10,477
but it doesn't really matter
to them because they're

167
00:07:10,477 --> 00:07:14,470
not the ones that are experiencing
the negativity of that.

168
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:18,278
Or, yeah... it's just basically
it's that group of people

169
00:07:18,278 --> 00:07:22,100
who have to, I guess,

170
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,210
express their ideas and

171
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:29,653
it may be scary for some
people to go along with it

172
00:07:29,653 --> 00:07:33,995
and actually carry out
what they think is right,

173
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:38,198
but I think it's necessary for a unit.

174
00:07:38,198 --> 00:07:40,450
You probably need that one person who

175
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:44,815
spreads the message, and then
I think it is very important

176
00:07:44,815 --> 00:07:47,346
for other groups of
people to go along with it

177
00:07:47,346 --> 00:07:50,039
because you never know when
it's going to be your turn.

178
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:52,269
- (teacher) So, here's my
question because on your

179
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:56,726
AP exam, on your final
exam, for your argumentative

180
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,884
essays, you have to be able
to generate your own examples.

181
00:07:59,884 --> 00:08:03,158
So, I know Omar you've
got a very clear idea,

182
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:05,317
but does any body have
a historical reference

183
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:10,356
or a current event that
we can tie that idea

184
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:13,421
to something specific, and
that's what you can discuss.

185
00:08:13,421 --> 00:08:16,486
Let's see if we have any
ideas here about historical

186
00:08:16,486 --> 00:08:19,365
or current events that we
could really provide as really

187
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:21,478
concrete examples that we could look at

188
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:22,918
because you want to get specific.

189
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:25,887
You want to say, "hey, let's
look at this specific example,

190
00:08:25,887 --> 00:08:27,373
where this actually happened."

191
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:28,934
Any thoughts on that?

192
00:08:32,934 --> 00:08:34,679
- (male student) Anything with slavery,

193
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:39,008
with Frederick Douglass and
the abolitionists in the north.

194
00:08:39,008 --> 00:08:41,724
They really felt the need that slavery was

195
00:08:41,724 --> 00:08:45,114
needing to be abolished
and I guess that's where

196
00:08:45,114 --> 00:08:47,064
civil disobedience comes from,

197
00:08:47,064 --> 00:08:49,851
is the abolishment of slavery.

198
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:51,847
Well, the need to abolish slavery.

199
00:08:51,847 --> 00:08:55,887
That it really wasn't
really blacks or Africans,

200
00:08:55,887 --> 00:08:57,745
or whatever you called them back then.

201
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:01,623
Wanting to be set free
was people that weren't

202
00:09:01,623 --> 00:09:05,175
even affected by slavery that
wanted them to be set free.

203
00:09:05,175 --> 00:09:08,867
And I think that's more
important, and more

204
00:09:08,867 --> 00:09:12,628
appeals to your emotion
because these people

205
00:09:12,628 --> 00:09:14,904
have no tie to slavery.

206
00:09:14,904 --> 00:09:18,038
They're not benefiting,

207
00:09:18,038 --> 00:09:20,267
they're not getting negative from it,

208
00:09:20,267 --> 00:09:24,842
so it's like you really
think that it's wrong

209
00:09:24,842 --> 00:09:27,256
when someone else is not
affected by the situation.

210
00:09:27,256 --> 00:09:29,230
It's saying that it's wrong.

211
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,529
- (male student) I want to
connect to what you just said

212
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:35,754
about to the idea of the
mental slavery that's going

213
00:09:35,754 --> 00:09:37,124
on right now

214
00:09:37,124 --> 00:09:40,909
because I guess maybe not
a lot of you are aware,

215
00:09:40,909 --> 00:09:44,299
but there's... I don't know
if you guys heard something

216
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:47,736
about the green eye? That
recently... that's in the past.

217
00:09:47,736 --> 00:09:50,406
And I think that's very
important because that affects me

218
00:09:50,406 --> 00:09:54,824
in a way because many

219
00:09:54,824 --> 00:09:57,524
people wanna go to college

220
00:09:57,524 --> 00:10:02,463
but I guess the idea of going to college

221
00:10:02,463 --> 00:10:05,017
and getting your degree,
but then not excelling in

222
00:10:05,017 --> 00:10:07,710
what you are supposed to be excelling in.

223
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,171
That kind of stops them
and discourages them

224
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:12,169
from... to keep going.

225
00:10:12,169 --> 00:10:15,581
So I guess that idea is... I don't know,

226
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:17,911
it's kind of opressive
because they're trying

227
00:10:17,911 --> 00:10:19,699
to maintain you in that little...

228
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:23,554
it's just marginalizing you and yeah,

229
00:10:23,554 --> 00:10:25,598
I think it needs more support.

230
00:10:25,598 --> 00:10:28,011
- (teacher) So I want you
to think about that example

231
00:10:28,011 --> 00:10:30,798
because there were a
lot of protests, right?

232
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:33,468
People were really protesting that,

233
00:10:33,468 --> 00:10:35,698
and there were a lot of
these laws that people

234
00:10:35,698 --> 00:10:37,345
were standing against, right?

235
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,203
And when we look at the questions,

236
00:10:39,203 --> 00:10:42,431
to what extent should we
comply with unfair laws?

237
00:10:42,431 --> 00:10:45,148
If that is an unfair piece of legislation,

238
00:10:45,148 --> 00:10:47,632
to what extent do you
then choose to protest?

239
00:10:47,632 --> 00:10:49,930
How far would you be willing to take it?

240
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,207
Because we talked about this,

241
00:10:51,207 --> 00:10:55,526
this line between pushing your protest

242
00:10:55,526 --> 00:10:57,244
and your form of rebellion.

243
00:10:57,244 --> 00:10:58,475
Like look at Harrison, right?

244
00:10:58,475 --> 00:11:00,426
Dancing on stage as a ballerina.

245
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,956
Doesn't really seem all that tough, right?

246
00:11:02,956 --> 00:11:06,903
But, for him, he was
taking a big stance, right?

247
00:11:06,903 --> 00:11:10,038
Not about borderline violence, right?

248
00:11:10,038 --> 00:11:12,036
I want you to look at what Thoreau did.

249
00:11:12,036 --> 00:11:13,591
He didn't pay his taxes.

250
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:14,822
He wanted to go to jail.

251
00:11:14,822 --> 00:11:15,726
He was happy there.

252
00:11:15,726 --> 00:11:17,700
He was like, "don't bail me out."

253
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,138
Had nothing to do with violence, right?

254
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:23,249
You hear a lot of people
protesting, you know.

255
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:26,407
Issues regarding the DREAM Act,

256
00:11:26,407 --> 00:11:29,054
but to what extent should
they comply with the laws?

257
00:11:29,054 --> 00:11:31,470
Do you use violence?

258
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,676
Do you even take it there?

259
00:11:32,676 --> 00:11:34,998
Do you use more creative
forms of protesting?

260
00:11:34,998 --> 00:11:38,806
I want you to consider
how far do you take it?

261
00:11:38,806 --> 00:11:40,780
How far do you show your protest?

262
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,450
What is acceptable, and
where do you draw the line?

263
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,120
(students answer together)

264
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,537
Good reaction, lots of reaction.

265
00:11:47,537 --> 00:11:50,207
Let's hear from people
we haven't heard from.

266
00:11:50,207 --> 00:11:52,715
I want you to go back and think about your

267
00:11:52,715 --> 00:11:53,830
goals that you set.

268
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,454
I'm hoping those of you
that are a little bit

269
00:11:56,454 --> 00:12:01,329
quieter in our discussions,
chose goals that

270
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:03,651
might push you to speak up.

271
00:12:03,651 --> 00:12:05,345
So let's hear from a few
folks that we haven't

272
00:12:05,345 --> 00:12:07,761
heard from yet and share the air time.

273
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:09,989
Any volunteer? Jesus, what do you think?

274
00:12:09,989 --> 00:12:13,356
- (Jesus) Like Omar
said, like the DREAM Act,

275
00:12:13,356 --> 00:12:15,656
has an ill affect on a lot of people.

276
00:12:15,656 --> 00:12:17,953
It doesn't really affect
me, but I know a lot

277
00:12:17,953 --> 00:12:19,719
of friends that it is affecting.

278
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:22,970
It's not really fair that
it really didn't pass,

279
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:26,870
but when we want to try to push something,

280
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:31,235
like Julian said for
slavery, it didn't really

281
00:12:31,235 --> 00:12:34,347
take... it took such a long
time for them to really

282
00:12:34,347 --> 00:12:37,249
get the rights. There was the abolishment,

283
00:12:37,249 --> 00:12:39,710
there was Frederick
Douglass during that time.

284
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,542
But as time went, then
came Martin Luther King,

285
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:46,327
who was the center person who started the

286
00:12:46,327 --> 00:12:48,417
really big move for African Americans

287
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:50,274
to realize their own rights.

288
00:12:50,274 --> 00:12:54,384
He lead the protests,
marches... if you gather

289
00:12:54,384 --> 00:12:56,568
groups of people over time...

290
00:12:56,568 --> 00:13:00,026
if you speak up with your
voice people will hear.

291
00:13:00,026 --> 00:13:03,069
Even people like African
Americans, they came

292
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:06,621
and rallied to listen to the
idea that everyone being equal.

293
00:13:06,621 --> 00:13:08,501
There should be rights and everyone...

294
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:11,033
no matter what color you are.

295
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:14,608
So for Latinos like us,
for the (inaudible),

296
00:13:14,608 --> 00:13:16,072
it's such a short time because we just

297
00:13:16,072 --> 00:13:18,277
started also trying to pass our rights,

298
00:13:18,277 --> 00:13:20,483
but the dream that was once dead,

299
00:13:20,483 --> 00:13:22,015
but even though it didn't pass,

300
00:13:22,015 --> 00:13:24,198
people should not be put down,

301
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:25,359
like, "Aw, it didn't pass."

302
00:13:25,359 --> 00:13:27,983
So they'll just forget you
got to stand back right up

303
00:13:27,983 --> 00:13:31,604
and get more people and
to continue to pass on

304
00:13:31,604 --> 00:13:34,531
for your rights, cause
if we stay together,

305
00:13:34,531 --> 00:13:36,828
anything can happen...

306
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:40,659
If we stay together as
one, something will happen.

307
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:42,193
- (teacher) I am hearing
two things and we'll get

308
00:13:42,193 --> 00:13:43,794
back to Stephanie really
quickly I think she's just

309
00:13:43,794 --> 00:13:46,278
itching to get in this conversation.

310
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:47,766
I'm hearing two things.

311
00:13:47,766 --> 00:13:50,017
One, that it takes a
collective group effort.

312
00:13:50,017 --> 00:13:51,735
It's not just one person,

313
00:13:51,735 --> 00:13:55,009
but it needs to be many people involved.

314
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:56,889
As many people involved

315
00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:00,173
And I'm also hearing that
it takes a lot of time.

316
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:04,793
So those are a couple of
factors that play in to

317
00:14:04,793 --> 00:14:06,696
going against unfair laws.

318
00:14:06,696 --> 00:14:07,905
- (male student) That's
kind of like right now,

319
00:14:07,905 --> 00:14:11,688
that it's kind of more
modern because (inaudible).

320
00:14:11,688 --> 00:14:13,197
- (teacher) You think so?

321
00:14:13,197 --> 00:14:16,100
- (students) no, no, no.

322
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,538
- (teacher) I want you take
this idea that Omar brought,

323
00:14:18,538 --> 00:14:21,046
this idea of mental slavery of oppression,

324
00:14:21,046 --> 00:14:24,204
of our intellect, our intelligence.

325
00:14:24,204 --> 00:14:27,153
Is that something that
you think is just recent?

326
00:14:27,153 --> 00:14:29,266
Is that something that's
been happening over time?

327
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:31,518
I want you to think about that and see...

328
00:14:31,518 --> 00:14:35,744
we might isolate one part of the problem,

329
00:14:35,744 --> 00:14:38,321
but I want you to think
on a broader scale.

330
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:40,225
Is it really just one isolated event,

331
00:14:40,225 --> 00:14:44,787
or is this one in a stream of events?

332
00:14:44,787 --> 00:14:46,387
Stephanie, you had
something that you were...

333
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:51,285
- (Stephanie) Yeah, all of
them were in the governement,

334
00:14:51,285 --> 00:14:53,190
and I was thinking of the movie, "Milk".

335
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:57,370
How they have to fight for
the rights for equality

336
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:02,082
for homosexuals and what he does is

337
00:15:02,082 --> 00:15:05,148
he runs for office in California,

338
00:15:05,148 --> 00:15:07,887
and to be heard, which is kind of like

339
00:15:07,887 --> 00:15:10,372
civil disobedience in a way.

340
00:15:10,372 --> 00:15:16,321
But he does it in a bigger
way for them to be heard.

341
00:15:16,321 --> 00:15:21,085
One part in the movie
that I'll always remember,

342
00:15:21,085 --> 00:15:26,112
is when a guy in a wheelchair
calls him to tell him

343
00:15:26,112 --> 00:15:27,340
that he's gay and all of that.

344
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,475
But he just hangs up, but
yet he does it for him,

345
00:15:29,475 --> 00:15:32,982
most likely because he wants
people like that to be heard.

346
00:15:32,982 --> 00:15:36,349
And that's kind of what my connection is.

347
00:15:36,349 --> 00:15:38,624
- (female student) I think
another historical event

348
00:15:38,624 --> 00:15:41,945
besides the slavery and what 
you just said

349
00:15:41,945 --> 00:15:43,361
is the nine eleven.

350
00:15:43,361 --> 00:15:45,032
I think it's the short-term one.

351
00:15:45,032 --> 00:15:46,808
It took actually really quick...

352
00:15:46,808 --> 00:15:51,678
(inaudible)

353
00:15:51,678 --> 00:15:53,145
the terrorists going up there.

354
00:15:53,145 --> 00:15:55,884
It just took one simple idea to tell them,

355
00:15:55,884 --> 00:15:57,553
"Oh, let's just go..."
