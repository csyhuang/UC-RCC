1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,280
- Viewing my art room from the front
corner I have a storage area on the right

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:12,660
hand side. Entry to the art room and paint
storage is right by the door. Uh, a cart

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,000
for paint supplies that can be wheeled out
into the room. I have a large white

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,200
cabinet for all of my paper and on the
other side storage for student art work. I

5
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:29,800
have a dry erase board, a digital white
board and a bulletin board for instruction

6
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,500
for students in the front of the room. We
often sit right in the center of the room.

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,620
There's also a birthday chair there for
the birthday person to sit in. My tables

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,030
are shaped around there in a U-shaped
formation, each labeled by a colorful

9
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:51,260
paint splot hanging from the ceiling.
Indicating the table there's a red table,

10
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,890
orange, yellow, green, blue and so forth.
Each table has organized supplies in a

11
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:04,820
painted shoebox and red caddies left on
the tables. In the very back corner is the

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,270
teacher desk. Two computers to the left of
that as well as a laptop that's hooked up

13
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:16,810
to the digital whiteboard. Across the back
of the room I have work space for our

14
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:23,770
student teacher and also to mount student
art work, and store some ongoing large

15
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:29,620
artworks. On the back wall I have more
storage: metal cabinets, rolling

16
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:38,770
cabinets and a light board that we can use
to copy work from. And directly below me

17
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:43,870
is our class pet this is where Shelly the
turtle lives and she is currently

18
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,932
hibernating.

19
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:08,463
- Like rabbits and dogs, dinosaurs.
And kitty cats

20
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:15,050
And puppies
So first thing we are going to do today is

21
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:23,940
look at pictures. Listen so that we have
time for working. I need everyone to put

22
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:31,640
in bubble. We are going to look at some
pictures that artists have made long,

23
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:38,540
long, long ago. The very oldest art in the
whole world. Are horses and bulls inside

24
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:45,240
of a cave. So the very first artists way
back during cave people they were making

25
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:50,810
art about animals. About horses and
animals that ran around that they saw in

26
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:55,821
their environment all around them. Put
hands down, put hands down.

27
00:02:56,262 --> 00:02:58,701
- ...dinosaurs ...yeah

28
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,650
- Well that was after the dinosaurs. But
I'm looking for somebody that would be

29
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:09,402
able to point out an animal that they
recognize up here. Does anyone recognize

30
00:03:09,402 --> 00:03:11,630
some of those animals?
- Yeah

31
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:19,910
- Izaiah do you? Izaiah? Izaiah with a
"Z." Do you want to go up and point?

32
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:24,470
Come up and show us some animals that you
recognize.

33
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,700
- Only animals who... only, only...

34
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,160
- Listen! She's the teacher right now.
What's it?

35
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:41,177
- Kangaroo
- What else? Let her answer.

36
00:03:41,177 --> 00:03:51,230
- Fish and turtle and, um, crocodile and a
duck.

37
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:57,710
- Yeah and some kind of a bird. Good job.
Did you notice that these are all made

38
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:03,710
with dots?
That's how some artists who live in

39
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:09,450
Australia... Kimberly come right here in
front of me... Turn around so you can

40
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:14,700
see. That's how some artists in Australia
make animals.

41
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,290
And they kind of show what's inside of
them, don't they? It's really good that

42
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,610
you notice that, Izaiah. Do you have a
comment?

43
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:27,100
- I know all those animals

44
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:34,310
- Good so you were naming them right along
with her? Raiden, why is your name up,

45
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,300
your hand up?

46
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,190
- You said last time we have to finish our
[Inaudible].

47
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:46,680
- Oh we do have to finish those you're
right. We will, don't worry.

48
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:54,180
Okay. Next.
What kind of animal is that?

49
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,735
- A horse.

50
00:04:56,735 --> 00:05:03,260
- A horse. You know what it says at the
top? It's a horse of a different color.

51
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:07,161
Because what color is it?
- [Together] Blue.

52
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:14,521
- Kind of like the "Wizard of Oz?"
[ Background Chatter]

53
00:05:17,424 --> 00:05:26,650
right there. Why, boys and girls? Why is
the horse blue? What do you think? Why is

54
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,200
the horse blue?
- To make the horse beautiful!

55
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,300
- To make it beautiful? Why else would it
be blue?

56
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,380
- Maybe because it... ?
-There's another one.

57
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:46,710
- It's a unicorn horse isn't it?
What?

58
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:50,990
[Background Chatter]
-Shhhh... what? I'm curious...

59
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,890
- Izaiah, why would an artist make a horse
blue?

60
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,330
- Because it might be a unicorn.

61
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:01,740
- Well, it could be. Why?

62
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,060
- Because it might be a different kind of animal.
- Yeah, it might be a different type of animal horse.

63
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:10,770
- Have you ever drawn a picture and maybe
just used your imagination? And used your

64
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:17,890
favorite colors in it? How many people do
that sometimes? I know I do. Sometimes I

65
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:22,900
might make an animal but instead of making
him brown, maybe I'll make him pink and

66
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,890
purple and yellow.

67
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,610
- Ooooooh!

68
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,520
- And make him a little bit more
imaginative.

69
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:33,860
- Sometimes at my dad's house all by
myself.

70
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:38,569
- What else do we have?
- Another horse.

71
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:44,880
- Here's a fancy prancy horse.
Now the other horse was kind of looking

72
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,870
down, but what's this horse doing? What's
this horse doing?

73
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:53,670
- Jumping.
- Flying.

74
00:06:53,850 --> 00:07:02,540
- He's walking or galloping, isn't he? He
looks... Look how he's standing. Look at

75
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,920
the two horses. If you had to tell me how
this horse is feeling...

76
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,630
- [Together] Sad.

77
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:14,870
- Why do we think sad? Emma why do you
think sad?

78
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,940
- Because he's looking down.

79
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,610
- He is looking down, isn't he?

80
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:27,640
- Maybe he's sad because his family just
got killed by another animal.

81
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:33,790
- Oh, I hope that didn't happen. He could
be sad about something that happened. What

82
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,990
about this horse?
- [Together] Happy!

83
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:40,530
- Why Melanie why do you think he looks
happy?

84
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:44,292
- Because he still has a family of his
own.

85
00:07:44,292 --> 00:07:47,869
- Because why?
- Because he still has a family of

86
00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:52,558
his own.
- That's not why! That's not why!

87
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:57,271
- Izaiah, you might have a different idea
than Melanie. Isn't it okay to have a

88
00:07:57,271 --> 00:07:58,850
different idea?
- Yeah

89
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:04,230
- So, I need you sitting, Kimberly and
Regan, you both need to be sitting right

90
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,310
here where you can see hun.

91
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:11,733
Izaiah so it's okay to have... what was
your idea about why he might be happy?

92
00:08:11,733 --> 00:08:22,370
- Because he's walking and his family is
going to get killed by a pack of animals.

93
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:29,300
- Oh my, but that wouldn't be very happy
would it? You think he looks happy? Are

94
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:35,880
there any other words you can think of to
describe him?

95
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,720
He's prancing around. Usually if you're in
a bad mood do you walk around like this?

96
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,830
With your head up?
- No.

97
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:49,070
- I used to do this, too.

98
00:08:50,737 --> 00:08:55,580
- That's not prancing, that's stomping.
But prancing is when you have your head

99
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,750
up, isn't it? Kimberly! Kimberly! Right
here. Come over here by me.

100
00:09:04,716 --> 00:09:10,520
- Maybe... maybe he was doing this because
[inaudible] on his arm. There's
something on his arm.

101
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:16,880
- Oh, it could be like a bandage, couldn't
it? It might just be the way it's painted

102
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,560
like his knees are a little bit lighter
than the rest of him. Is that what you're

103
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:25,167
noticing? What are you noticing?

104
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:31,367
- [Inaudible] but one of my
family died

105
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:34,827
- Awww. That is sad, isn't it?

106
00:09:34,827 --> 00:09:37,357
- Really really really old.

107
00:09:40,864 --> 00:09:43,650
- [Background Chatter] 
- That happens sometimes, I'm sorry.

108
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,949
[Background Chatter]
- ...family died in a fire...
109
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,746
- Guess what? Guess what?

110
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:58,430
- Shhhh... Kimberly if you want to earn
your star card today you have to come sit

111
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,970
by me. Brandon if you want to earn yours
you have to be sitting on your bottom, not

112
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,764
crawling on the floor.

113
00:10:04,764 --> 00:10:08,131
- You have to color inside of it?

114
00:10:08,131 --> 00:10:10,732
[Background Chatter]

115
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:33,250
- You might want to draw his shell first
to make it really big.

116
00:10:35,616 --> 00:10:41,350
- Look at mine!
- Can I see?

117
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:46,060
- Good job! Make these lines really,
really dark.

118
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,429
- Hey, look at my turtle.
- Go back over it like this.

119
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,663
- Boys and girls, if your paper's kind of
[Inaudible]

120
00:11:01,663 --> 00:11:07,620
'cause you're pushing so hard then you're
drawing dark enough. Okay, they should

121
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:18,500
really be pressing hard with that.
Good, go over it really really dark.

122
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:24,349
That's dark enough. It looks great.

123
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,850
- Oh Kimberly yes.

124
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:41,010
- And put your name on the front with the
crayon.

125
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:52,120
Well look Izaiah, here's two choices for
your shell. You can start with an oval

126
00:11:52,300 --> 00:12:08,560
like that or you can start like this.
Okay. Yeah but I think two different ways

127
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:13,870
see the top one and the bottom was a half
circle.

128
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:22,550
Which one do you like? Make it really big.
Perfect! There you go!

129
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:25,522
[Background Chatter]

130
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:32,506
- Look at my turtle.

131
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:52,030
- Boys and girls I want you to darken your
lines and draw for at least five more

132
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:59,468
minutes before you paint. Okay? Keep
darkening your lines.

133
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,765
Okay, darken those lines.

134
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,725
- We have to go and get our paint.

135
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:43,570
- Boys and girls, darken every line and
I'm going to come around and as soon as I

136
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:49,025
see that yours is nice and dark I'll put
the paint on your table. Okay?

137
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:05,870
This is yours? That's good, that's good.
This is dark enough. What I want you to

138
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:12,760
trace over is the black parts. And see
these pencil lines? You have to trace over

139
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:20,260
top of them. Or the paint will cover them
up. So, what color would you like to use

140
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:30,880
there? What color would you like to trace
these in? Come pick a color. Come sit down.

141
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:37,300
Tyler start working on your design. No,

142
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,207
start working on your designs in the
middle.

143
00:14:53,170 --> 00:15:05,103
That's perfect. Nice and dark.
Boys and girls, see how dark these lines

144
00:15:05,103 --> 00:15:11,590
are? This is a really good example of how
dark you want your crayon to be. You want

145
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:18,621
to go back over it and trace it really
dark. That one looks good, too. Nice and

146
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:21,756
dark. That's awesome!

147
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,664
- Start drawing.

148
00:15:34,662 --> 00:15:37,263
[Background Chatter]

149
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,920
- I need yellow

150
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,396
- Boys and girls, would you put your name
on...

151
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:05,228
- [Intercom Announcement]Pardon the interruption,
[Inaudible] please

152
00:16:05,228 --> 00:16:09,501
come to the office. [Inaudible]
please come to the office.

153
00:16:11,498 --> 00:16:15,348
- [Teacher]Put your name right here. While you're
getting ready to paint, put your name on

154
00:16:15,348 --> 00:16:20,967
the front in crayon. Nice and dark, write
your name nice and dark with your crayon.

155
00:16:23,452 --> 00:16:27,360
Well, trace over it with the crayon.

156
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,910
- Look at mine.

157

- As soon as you're sitting down, Caitlin.
I'm coming around to look.

158
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:47,540
Boys and girls, when you're ready, you may
put your hand up and I'll come around and

159
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:57,305
check your pictures.
You are ready. Yours looks really nice.

160
00:16:57,305 --> 00:17:00,207
Good!
He made me draw it for you.

161
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,647
Very good!

- Melody, I'm waiting for that hand to go
up.

00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:29,973
Isaiah, ah! That looks great! While you're
waiting for your paint, make those darker.

- Shhhh...

167
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,600
Darken these a little bit.

168
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,993
- Izaiah what are you doing?

169
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:32,322
