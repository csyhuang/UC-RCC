1
00:00:01,712 --> 00:00:05,261
- Look at your station
one information.

2
00:00:05,261 --> 00:00:08,059
And the question we
posed in station one

3
00:00:08,059 --> 00:00:11,020
was does temperature affect the rate

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,645
of chemical weather.

5
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:15,727
And yesterday, you guys
constructed a graph

6
00:00:15,727 --> 00:00:17,562
to show that data.

7
00:00:17,562 --> 00:00:19,187
Why is it useful to construct

8
00:00:19,187 --> 00:00:21,074
a graph in science class?

9
00:00:22,983 --> 00:00:24,284
Sky?

10
00:00:24,284 --> 00:00:26,118
- Because it's a visual way

11
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:27,685
to show you information.

12
00:00:27,685 --> 00:00:29,055
- It's a visual way to show

13
00:00:29,055 --> 00:00:30,518
you information.

14
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:34,280
I have a case up here as an example.

15
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,857
Based on that graph, what does

16
00:00:36,857 --> 00:00:40,584
that pattern reveal
about our question?

17
00:00:40,584 --> 00:00:41,675
Gabrielle.

18
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:43,057
- The cooler the temperature

19
00:00:43,057 --> 00:00:45,054
the more the, I mean,

20
00:00:45,054 --> 00:00:48,282
more increases in time.

21
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:50,023
- The more what increases in time?

22
00:00:50,023 --> 00:00:52,575
- The more uh

23
00:00:56,354 --> 00:00:57,793
weather.

24
00:00:57,793 --> 00:00:59,454
- Okay, anybody want to restate

25
00:00:59,454 --> 00:01:00,824
that, Rebecca?

26
00:01:00,824 --> 00:01:02,553
- The colder it is,
the more time it

27
00:01:02,553 --> 00:01:03,879
takes to weather.

28
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:04,820
- Very good.

29
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,294
The colder it is, the more

30
00:01:06,294 --> 00:01:08,291
time it takes to weather.

31
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:12,320
If we're talking about
dissolving a tablet,

32
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,893
is that chemical weathering

33
00:01:13,893 --> 00:01:15,692
or mechanical weathering?

34
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,317
Logan?

35
00:01:17,317 --> 00:01:18,490
- Chemical weathering.

36
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:19,755
- Chemical weathering.

37
00:01:19,755 --> 00:01:22,994
So the colder it is,
the longer it takes

38
00:01:22,994 --> 00:01:25,909
for the chemical weathering to occur.

39
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:27,418
Would you agree?

40
00:01:27,418 --> 00:01:29,891
Thumbs up or thumbs down.

41
00:01:29,891 --> 00:01:31,621
Thumbs up, I would agree.

42
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:34,047
Now I want to talk about, so what?

43
00:01:34,047 --> 00:01:36,218
Why does it matter to us.

44
00:01:36,218 --> 00:01:38,993
Why does it matter
in our daily lives.

45
00:01:38,993 --> 00:01:41,048
Talk about it for one minute,

46
00:01:41,048 --> 00:01:43,451
record your thoughts
on your wipe board,

47
00:01:43,451 --> 00:01:45,103
and be ready to share back.

49
00:02:27,894 --> 00:02:29,623
- We could consider

50
00:02:29,623 --> 00:02:33,043
where to build our stuff...

- In what types of areas
would you have to

52
00:02:44,728 --> 00:02:49,076
be specifically and particularly hot?

What about up north?

- Okay, it might dissolve

58
00:03:55,284 --> 00:03:56,759
faster in a warmer place.

59
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:00,109
Or, what type of rock
would I want to avoid?

60
00:04:01,356 --> 00:04:03,260
Limestone, why?

61
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:10,842
[Background Chatter]
- Okay, very good, very good.

62

Alright, let's share some of

63
00:04:12,723 --> 00:04:15,393
our ideas with the class.

64
00:04:15,393 --> 00:04:17,959
Info managers, table three,

65
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,652
what did you find?

66
00:04:20,652 --> 00:04:22,626
- If you live in a cold environment,

67
00:04:22,626 --> 00:04:24,483
there will be less chemical weathering,

68
00:04:24,483 --> 00:04:27,360
than there is in a warm place.

69
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,753
- Good point, if you live in a

70
00:04:28,753 --> 00:04:30,552
cooler environment,
there will be less

71
00:04:30,552 --> 00:04:33,188
chemical weathering
than in a warm climate.

72
00:04:33,188 --> 00:04:36,346
Who's gonna be particularly
concerned with this?

73
00:04:36,346 --> 00:04:38,447
What, for instance,
job field is gonna be

74
00:04:38,447 --> 00:04:40,316
concerned with this idea?

75
00:04:40,316 --> 00:04:41,692
Forrest?
- Construction?

76
00:04:41,692 --> 00:04:45,221
- That would be one area, what else?

77
00:04:45,221 --> 00:04:46,789
- Statue building?

78
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:48,193
- Yeah, any kind of artist

79
00:04:48,193 --> 00:04:49,993
who's designing statues.

80
00:04:49,993 --> 00:04:52,257
What type of rock would
you want to avoid

81
00:04:52,257 --> 00:04:54,718
if you're living in a warm area?

82
00:04:54,718 --> 00:04:56,053
And you know that chemical weathering

83
00:04:56,053 --> 00:04:57,226
could be a problem.

84
00:04:57,226 --> 00:04:58,793
What rock would you avoid?

85
00:04:58,793 --> 00:04:59,594
Patrick?

86
00:04:59,594 --> 00:05:00,558
- Limestone.

87
00:05:00,558 --> 00:05:02,056
- Limestone.

88
00:05:02,056 --> 00:05:04,836
Do you guys have some proof for me?

89
00:05:04,836 --> 00:05:07,323
Somewhere in your data as to why we

90
00:05:07,323 --> 00:05:09,819
should avoid limestone?

91
00:05:11,592 --> 00:05:13,055
Which station, Alex?

92
00:05:13,055 --> 00:05:14,251
- Station three.

93
00:05:14,251 --> 00:05:17,067
- Flip to station three for me.

94
00:05:20,161 --> 00:05:22,726
At station three, who can explain to me

95
00:05:22,726 --> 00:05:25,635
what the lab was that you did?

96
00:05:27,022 --> 00:05:30,122
Someone I haven't heard from, Colin?

97
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:34,217
- We put one small piece of chalk into

98
00:05:34,217 --> 00:05:38,118
a bottle of vinegar and
a small piece of chalk

99
00:05:38,118 --> 00:05:41,654
into water, and we saw

100
00:05:41,654 --> 00:05:45,195
if the acid from the vinegar

101
00:05:45,195 --> 00:05:47,389
dissolved the chalk and if

102
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,653
the water dissolved the chalk.

103
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:52,521
And the chalk didn't
dissolve in the water,

104
00:05:52,521 --> 00:05:55,853
but the acid made it fizz, bubble,

105
00:05:55,853 --> 00:05:58,221
and it was just dissolving.

106
00:05:58,221 --> 00:05:59,684
- And why did we use chalk?

107
00:05:59,684 --> 00:06:02,018
What is chalk a type of?

108
00:06:02,018 --> 00:06:03,655
What is chalk a type of, Jeremy?

109
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:04,990
- It's a type of limestone.

110
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,487
- It's a type of limestone.

111
00:06:06,487 --> 00:06:08,624
So your evidence showed that yes,

112
00:06:08,624 --> 00:06:12,258
limestone weathers quickly with acid.

113
00:06:12,258 --> 00:06:14,626
Why is acid a part of our environment?

114
00:06:14,626 --> 00:06:16,786
How does it become part
of our environment?

115
00:06:16,786 --> 00:06:18,655
Andrea?

116
00:06:18,655 --> 00:06:19,456
- Acid rain.

117
00:06:19,456 --> 00:06:22,045
- Acid rain, acid rain.

118
00:06:22,045 --> 00:06:24,309
Now, as we grow up it's important that

119
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:26,108
you're environmental advocates.

120
00:06:26,108 --> 00:06:29,092
That you fight for
protecting our environment.

121
00:06:29,092 --> 00:06:31,159
What types of things can you do

122
00:06:31,159 --> 00:06:34,456
in your lives to cut down on acid rain?

123
00:06:34,456 --> 00:06:36,755
Give me two ideas on your wipe boards.

124
00:06:36,755 --> 00:06:38,659
Two ideas.

125
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:43,309
[Background Chatter]

126
00:06:50,153 --> 00:06:52,591
- Is that polluting our water, our air?

127
00:06:52,591 --> 00:06:54,193
- Polluting the air, and it's getting

128
00:06:54,193 --> 00:06:56,886
into our clouds...

129
00:06:56,886 --> 00:06:58,256
- Very nice, very good.

130
00:06:58,256 --> 00:06:59,893
So air pollution particularly because

131
00:06:59,893 --> 00:07:02,941
the air pollution contributes
to that formation.

132
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
- You are making worst case scenarios.

133
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You don't have to consider the unthinkable.

134
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
- It can happen, alright?
- You don't have to consider the impossible.

135
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,626
- So we can unplug outlets when we're

136
00:07:42,626 --> 00:07:43,683
not using them.

137
00:07:43,683 --> 00:07:44,890
- We can turn off the water when

138
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,957
we brush our teeth.

139
00:07:46,957 --> 00:08:03,131
[Background Chatter]

140
00:08:04,488 --> 00:08:07,216
- What about things in your house?

141
00:08:07,216 --> 00:08:08,319
Electricity.

142
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,782
Cut down on your electric bills.

143
00:08:09,782 --> 00:08:11,152
Remember you burn fossil fuels,

144
00:08:11,152 --> 00:08:12,754
to make electricity.

145
00:08:12,754 --> 00:08:14,624
So right now as middle schoolers,

146
00:08:14,624 --> 00:08:16,725
the easiest thing to do would be to cut

147
00:08:16,725 --> 00:08:19,007
down on your electric use.

148
00:08:22,274 --> 00:08:26,152
Alright, I want every
table to share one idea.

149
00:08:26,152 --> 00:08:28,428
Info manager from table one, give me

150
00:08:28,428 --> 00:08:30,285
one idea.

151
00:08:30,285 --> 00:08:33,852
- One idea is we can help the

152
00:08:33,852 --> 00:08:36,720
environment by taking a
bus to school, instead of

153
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,354
like everybody having
their own individual cars.

154
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:41,679
- Good point.

155
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,153
- Or even better you can walk.

156
00:08:43,153 --> 00:08:44,813
- Instead of having that carpool line

157
00:08:44,813 --> 00:08:47,019
going on, let's take busses.

158
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:48,819
Table two give me one idea.

159
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,293
- Save power by changing
your lightbulbs

160
00:08:50,293 --> 00:08:51,652
to CFLs.

161
00:08:51,652 --> 00:08:53,393
- Yeah, use those light bulbs that

162
00:08:53,393 --> 00:08:55,216
are like the twirly
light bulbs, they use

163
00:08:55,216 --> 00:08:58,026
a lot less electricity, good idea.

164
00:08:58,026 --> 00:08:59,860
Table three give me one.

165
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,310
- Conserve water by turning off

166
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,225
the water when we brush our teeth.

167
00:09:04,225 --> 00:09:06,048
- Now conserving water.

168
00:09:06,048 --> 00:09:08,660
Think about what the question was.

169
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,112
How can we be environmental

170
00:09:10,112 --> 00:09:13,293
advocates to cut down on acid rain?

171
00:09:13,293 --> 00:09:15,348
- We can cut down on electricity

172
00:09:15,348 --> 00:09:17,217
by unplugging outlets.

173
00:09:17,217 --> 00:09:18,320
- Very good.

174
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,688
Unplug items from the
outlets, that's good.

175
00:09:20,688 --> 00:09:22,325
Table four.

176
00:09:22,325 --> 00:09:24,485
- We could use hybrid cars.

177
00:09:24,485 --> 00:09:26,017
- Hybrid cars, that's good.

178
00:09:26,017 --> 00:09:28,061
They burn less fossil fuels, good idea.

179
00:09:28,061 --> 00:09:29,721
Table five.

180
00:09:29,721 --> 00:09:32,623
- Recycle.

181
00:09:32,623 --> 00:09:35,317
- Recycle.  How would that help acid rain?

182
00:09:40,852 --> 00:09:42,021
Okay, so it's cutting down on factory

183
00:09:42,021 --> 00:09:43,318
use, that would be a good one.

184
00:09:43,318 --> 00:09:44,671
Table six.

185
00:09:46,685 --> 00:09:49,285
- Cutting down on electricity.

186
00:09:49,285 --> 00:09:50,853
- Alright, cutting down on electricity,

187
00:09:50,853 --> 00:09:52,687
because to make electricity
you have to burn

188
00:09:52,687 --> 00:09:54,684
fossil fuels.

189
00:09:54,684 --> 00:09:56,158
Table seven, is there any that haven't

190
00:09:56,158 --> 00:09:56,994
been said?

191
00:09:56,994 --> 00:09:59,014
- Carpool to work and school.

192
00:09:59,014 --> 00:10:00,222
- Carpool to work and school,

193
00:10:00,222 --> 00:10:01,023
I love it.

194
00:10:01,023 --> 00:10:02,126
You got something to add?

195
00:10:02,126 --> 00:10:05,226
- I was going to say
instead of the bottles

196
00:10:05,226 --> 00:10:09,022
end up in landfills, so
you can keep bottles out

197
00:10:09,022 --> 00:10:11,147
of landfills if you reuse them.

198
00:10:11,147 --> 00:10:12,993
- Yeah, very good.

199
00:10:12,993 --> 00:10:15,651
A lot of times we focus
only on the idea of

200
00:10:15,651 --> 00:10:17,857
recycling, but it's good to reuse, too.

201
00:10:17,857 --> 00:10:19,308
That's a good idea as well.

202
00:10:19,308 --> 00:10:21,387
So we talked about
how the temperature

203
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,987
will affect our chemical weathering.

204
00:10:23,987 --> 00:10:26,251
We haven't yet talked
about how temperature

205
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,585
affects mechanical weathering.

206
00:10:28,585 --> 00:10:30,756
Which lab would
answer that question?

207
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:32,753
How temperature affects mechanical

208
00:10:32,753 --> 00:10:34,802
weathering.

209
00:10:35,818 --> 00:10:37,513
- Station four.

210
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:40,322
- Alright, look at station four.

211
00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:43,314
Take one minute, you don't have to

212
00:10:43,314 --> 00:10:46,019
write this one down, discuss it.

213
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:49,119
What does station four
tell you and how is

214
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:51,279
that important in daily life.

215
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,538
Take one minute.

216
00:10:52,538 --> 00:11:01,368
[Background Chatter]

217
00:11:02,885 --> 00:11:04,851
- And it like ice wedges,
and then it'll make

218
00:11:04,851 --> 00:11:09,583
bigger cracks and then
it will do bad stuff

219
00:11:10,853 --> 00:11:13,367
for sidewalks.

220
00:11:14,287 --> 00:11:30,287
[Background Chatter]

221
00:11:31,249 --> 00:11:32,294
- What were you supposed

222
00:11:32,294 --> 00:11:33,421
to be measuring?

223
00:11:33,421 --> 00:11:34,384
In centimeters.

224
00:11:34,384 --> 00:11:36,880
You measured in milimeters,
but you meant

225
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,673
to measure in centimeters.

226
00:11:39,986 --> 00:11:42,517
- So how much was it in centimeters?

227
00:11:42,517 --> 00:11:45,153
Well if you said it was at 79, which

228
00:11:45,153 --> 00:11:48,485
would be right there.

229
00:11:48,485 --> 00:11:50,783
What centimeters is that at?

230
00:11:50,783 --> 00:11:51,747
- Around 15.

231
00:11:51,747 --> 00:11:54,203
- Write down 15.

232
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,551
Oh wait wait!

233
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,418
I had it going the wrong way, and no one

234
00:12:01,418 --> 00:12:02,417
even noticed.

235
00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:06,352
So if it was at 79, where would it be.

236
00:12:07,982 --> 00:12:11,752
At 79, the tick mark right below the 80.

237
00:12:11,752 --> 00:12:13,017
- About 16.

238
00:12:13,017 --> 00:12:15,386
- About 16, and if it was at 76

239
00:12:15,386 --> 00:12:17,151
where would it be at?

240
00:12:17,151 --> 00:12:19,983
- About 14 and a half.

241
00:12:19,983 --> 00:12:21,464
- Very good

242
00:12:31,315 --> 00:12:33,660
Alright, let's pick someone at random,

243
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,987
who's the lucky person, Andrew P.

244
00:12:37,622 --> 00:12:40,223
What did you notice was the difference

245
00:12:40,223 --> 00:12:42,394
between the same amount of water

246
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,751
when it was frozen
and when it was left

247
00:12:44,751 --> 00:12:46,295
as a liquid.

248
00:12:46,295 --> 00:12:48,823
- When it was frozen it was taller.

249
00:12:48,823 --> 00:12:51,342
- When it was frozen it was taller.

250
00:12:51,342 --> 00:12:54,091
What does that mean
that it was taller?

251
00:12:54,091 --> 00:12:55,786
Lucy?

252
00:12:55,786 --> 00:13:00,087
- Well the water was

253
00:13:00,087 --> 00:13:01,619
frozen to ice.

254
00:13:01,619 --> 00:13:04,980
So it expands a little.

255
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,727
- It expands.

256
00:13:06,727 --> 00:13:08,353
I like the use of that word.

257
00:13:08,353 --> 00:13:10,756
Water expands as it freezes.

258
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:13,020
Here in Louisville
how is that a problem?

259
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,123
And it's been a particularly

260
00:13:14,123 --> 00:13:15,574
big problem this winter.

261
00:13:15,574 --> 00:13:16,480
Ethan?

262
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,417
- Because like, the water
can get in the cracks

263
00:13:19,417 --> 00:13:22,622
in the roads and then
when it freezes it will

264
00:13:22,622 --> 00:13:26,627
expand and it will crack
roads and buildings.

265
00:13:26,627 --> 00:13:29,515
Soon the people will have

266
00:13:29,515 --> 00:13:32,685
the construction people will
have to rebuild the roads.

267
00:13:32,685 --> 00:13:34,728
- Right, very good point.

268
00:13:34,728 --> 00:13:37,189
Now that affects us here
in Kentucky because we

269
00:13:37,189 --> 00:13:39,117
have those cold winters.

270
00:13:39,117 --> 00:13:41,150
What types of areas
would it not affect?

271
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:41,951
Forrest?

272
00:13:41,951 --> 00:13:42,880
- Florida.

273
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,517
- Florida, areas that
don't have freezing

274
00:13:44,517 --> 00:13:45,817
that's a good point.

275
00:13:45,817 --> 00:13:47,722
Now we've talked
about climate as far

276
00:13:47,722 --> 00:13:49,359
as temperature goes.

277
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:50,885
We've talked about
the warm temperatures

278
00:13:50,885 --> 00:13:52,893
and the cold temperatures
and how it affects the

279
00:13:52,893 --> 00:13:54,960
chemical and mechanical weathering.

280
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,421
What is the other
aspect of climate, other

281
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:59,755
than temperatures?

282
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,217
Other than temperature,
what is another

283
00:14:01,217 --> 00:14:02,854
aspect of climate?

284
00:14:02,854 --> 00:14:04,050
Patrick?

285
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,525
- How humid it is?

286
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:07,287
- How humid it is.

287
00:14:07,287 --> 00:14:09,226
Which lab do you think would tell us

288
00:14:09,226 --> 00:14:12,383
how humidity affects weather?

289
00:14:12,383 --> 00:14:15,873
Flip through,

290
00:14:17,051 --> 00:14:18,293
Sky?
- Seven

291
00:14:18,293 --> 00:14:21,271
Let's look at station seven.

292
00:14:25,584 --> 00:14:27,093
Now, during our labs, the materials

293
00:14:27,093 --> 00:14:29,125
managers were always in charge of

294
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,017
getting the materials ready.

295
00:14:31,017 --> 00:14:32,585
A material manager.

296
00:14:32,585 --> 00:14:34,419
Can someone explain to me, what's

297
00:14:34,419 --> 00:14:36,788
the difference between the steel wool

298
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:39,922
that was covered with a cup versus the

299
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:42,186
steel wool that was not covered

300
00:14:42,186 --> 00:14:43,823
with a cup.

301
00:14:43,823 --> 00:14:45,286
What would that difference be?

302
00:14:45,286 --> 00:14:47,689
Lucy?

303
00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:49,559
- Well the steel wool
that was covered,

304
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:51,788
well the steel wool
that wasn't covered

305
00:14:51,788 --> 00:14:53,819
with the cup, it was all like

306
00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:58,162
stuck together and it wasn't rusting

307
00:14:58,162 --> 00:15:03,162
and the one that was
covered with the cup it had

308
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:04,718
like stuff popping out, like

309
00:15:04,718 --> 00:15:06,726
it wasn't all stuck together and

310
00:15:06,726 --> 00:15:07,818
it was rusting.

311
00:15:07,818 --> 00:15:09,222
- Okay, so the one that was

312
00:15:09,222 --> 00:15:11,254
covered with a cup and moistened,

313
00:15:11,254 --> 00:15:12,926
had a lot of rust.

314
00:15:12,926 --> 00:15:14,993
And the one that was moistened, but

315
00:15:14,993 --> 00:15:17,222
was just left sitting out dried

316
00:15:17,222 --> 00:15:18,754
and did not have a lot of rust.

317
00:15:18,754 --> 00:15:20,960
Would you agree?

318
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,154
Okay, what is the purpose

319
00:15:23,154 --> 00:15:24,954
of covering it?

320
00:15:24,954 --> 00:15:27,218
Why do I cover that?

321
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:28,216
Otis?

322
00:15:28,216 --> 00:15:31,641
- Keeping the water from evaporating.

323
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:33,306
Yeah, it's keeping that water in.

324
00:15:33,306 --> 00:15:35,751
So is the covered cup a dry environment,

325
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:37,551
or a humid environment?

326
00:15:39,163 --> 00:15:41,684
- Humid environment.
- A very humid environment.

327
00:15:41,684 --> 00:15:46,049
I have a great map here that tells you

328
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:48,754
a little bit about different areas, and

329
00:15:48,754 --> 00:15:50,925
tells you what their humidity is like.

330
00:15:50,925 --> 00:15:53,294
I'm gonna flip off both lights

331
00:15:53,294 --> 00:15:55,703
to help you see it.

332
00:15:58,217 --> 00:16:00,318
This is a tropical wet area,

333
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:01,908
tropical dry area,

334
00:16:01,908 --> 00:16:04,753
semi-arid which means dry, arid,

335
00:16:04,753 --> 00:16:08,491
then, marine, west coast,

336
00:16:08,491 --> 00:16:11,626
Mediterranean, and humid sub-tropical.

337
00:16:11,626 --> 00:16:13,785
These areas that are marked as humid,

338
00:16:13,785 --> 00:16:16,885
sub-tropical, such as down in Florida,

339
00:16:16,885 --> 00:16:19,312
those areas that are marked as humid,

340
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,087
what do they have to be cautious about?

341
00:16:23,918 --> 00:16:25,926
If it's a humid area,
what do they have to be

342
00:16:25,926 --> 00:16:27,871
cautious about?

343
00:16:30,373 --> 00:16:31,743
Don't see a lot of hands,

344
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,624
talk about it for one minute.

345
00:16:33,624 --> 00:16:34,994
What do humid areas have to be

346
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,868
cautious about?

347
00:16:37,525 --> 00:16:52,477

348
00:16:54,118 --> 00:16:55,655
- Now think about this,

349
00:16:55,655 --> 00:16:57,368
an area like Kentucky.

350
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,779
And our summers aren't just

351
00:17:05,779 --> 00:17:08,159
hot, they're humid.

352
00:17:08,159 --> 00:17:10,759
So we have to deal with cold winters

353
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:12,640
which are gonna affect
mechanical weathering,

354
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,322
and we have to deal with,

355
00:17:15,322 --> 00:17:18,886
Yeah, so we're kind of getting the worst

356
00:17:18,886 --> 00:17:21,182
end of both scenarios.

357
00:17:21,182 --> 00:17:22,942
Yes, we definitely are.

358
00:17:23,853 --> 00:17:25,391
Good point.

359
00:17:28,322 --> 00:17:31,585
Alright, I need someone
I haven't heard from

360
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:33,442
to share, let's see who
the random card

361
00:17:33,442 --> 00:17:35,237
is, Lucy.

362
00:17:36,484 --> 00:17:40,066
What do you think?

363
00:17:41,488 --> 00:17:43,009
- They have to be careful
about rusting

364
00:17:43,009 --> 00:17:45,052
like their cars and stuff.

365
00:17:45,052 --> 00:17:47,189
- They have to be careful of rusting.

366
00:17:47,189 --> 00:17:49,952
Good point.  Because the more humid
the air is, the more

367
00:17:49,952 --> 00:17:52,460
likely you are to have what?

368
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,621
Oxidation.

369
00:17:53,621 --> 00:17:55,281
Now there was another lab where

370
00:17:55,281 --> 00:17:57,220
we used steel wool.

371
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,784
What was the purpose of
the other steel wool lab?

372
00:18:00,784 --> 00:18:02,885
What were you trying to answer,

373
00:18:02,885 --> 00:18:04,546
what were you trying to determine?

374
00:18:04,546 --> 00:18:06,020
Jamiel, what do you think?

375
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:09,103
[Background Chatter]

376
00:18:11,953 --> 00:18:13,114
- There was the key word,

377
00:18:13,114 --> 00:18:14,460
the what kind of water?

378
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,958
Salt water.

379
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,152
You look to see if salt water

380
00:18:18,152 --> 00:18:20,323
affected the oxidation rate.

381
00:18:20,323 --> 00:18:22,286
You look to see if salt water did.

382
00:18:22,286 --> 00:18:24,724
Silently, look at your data,

383
00:18:24,724 --> 00:18:29,217
and tell me did salt water affect

384
00:18:29,217 --> 00:18:31,724
the rate of oxidation.

385
00:18:31,724 --> 00:18:33,327
Jeremy, did salt water affect the

386
00:18:33,327 --> 00:18:35,000
rate of oxidation?
- Yeah
