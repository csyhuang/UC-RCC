1
00:00:00,124 --> 00:00:02,161
(Background Chatter)

2
00:00:02,161 --> 00:00:03,963
- [Boy in white] That one hurts.

3
00:00:03,963 --> 00:00:08,271
- [Voiceover] It says volume by, use the
formula to find the volume...

4
00:00:08,271 --> 00:00:10,284
- [Amy] Okay, so.

5
00:00:11,631 --> 00:00:13,546
I got 53 when I added up the numbers.

6
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:14,933
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I did, too.

7
00:00:16,192 --> 00:00:18,174
- [Amy] I took it and divided by three.

8
00:00:20,966 --> 00:00:22,792
- [Voiceover] 17.6666.

9
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:25,038
- [Amy] Just do 17.6.

10
00:00:25,038 --> 00:00:27,005
- [Hayden] No, 17 point three sixes.

11
00:00:27,476 --> 00:00:29,226
So, we'll just...

12
00:00:29,226 --> 00:00:32,118
- [Amy] Just, no,
Hayden, we have to find 17.666

13
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:34,110
'cause all six of them, put 17.6.

14
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,110
- [Hayden] I know, but, we are now, let's
just round it up one to 18.

15
00:00:40,368 --> 00:00:41,226
- [Amy] Okay.

16
00:00:41,226 --> 00:00:42,366
- [Hayden] Yeah.

17
00:00:42,722 --> 00:00:44,530
- [Amy] So, with average, it's 18.

18
00:00:47,755 --> 00:00:48,872
Okay.

19
00:00:51,177 --> 00:00:53,329
- [Amy] So, now, we have to do,

20
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,922
based on our average, how
close were you to your guess,

21
00:00:57,922 --> 00:01:01,001
so, how close were we to
our guesses, so, like...

22
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:02,451
- [Alina] I was close by seven.

23
00:01:02,744 --> 00:01:03,880
- [Hayden] I was close by nine.

24
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,375
- [Amy] We have 18 here, how
far was nine and 18?

25
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:09,205
- [Alina] I don't know.

26
00:01:09,205 --> 00:01:10,693
Nine.

27
00:01:10,693 --> 00:01:11,885
- [Amy] Nine plus nine is 18, right?

28
00:01:11,885 --> 00:01:13,246
- [Alina] Oh, yeah.

29
00:01:13,246 --> 00:01:15,448
- [Amy] So, write nine right here.

30
00:01:16,225 --> 00:01:17,601
I was by five.

31
00:01:18,419 --> 00:01:19,595
Okay.

32
00:01:21,393 --> 00:01:22,764
All right, based on our average,

33
00:01:22,764 --> 00:01:25,335
how many drops would it
take to make one liter?

34
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,606
- [Hayden] 18,000.

35
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:29,745
- [Amy] What?

36
00:01:29,745 --> 00:01:30,929
Oh, yeah.

37
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,989
- [Hayden] You got
us correct a few times.

38
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:35,325
- [Alina] Multiply it by...

39
00:01:35,325 --> 00:01:39,730
- [Hayden] If we had it to drops

40
00:01:41,273 --> 00:01:44,763
times 1000, 'cause that's
how many milliliters

41
00:01:44,763 --> 00:01:47,962
are in a liter, we get 10,000.

42
00:01:48,477 --> 00:01:51,410
- [Amy] Okay, so now, we do water disposal.

43
00:01:51,786 --> 00:01:55,545
Follow the directions to find
the volume of three marbles

44
00:01:55,545 --> 00:01:56,705
using water fluid.

45
00:01:56,705 --> 00:02:01,705
So, first, we have to add
20 milliliters of water,

46
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:06,336
milliliters of water to 100 milliliter...

47
00:02:07,863 --> 00:02:10,772
So, we have to add 20
milliliters of water into this.

48
00:02:11,445 --> 00:02:13,814
So, Giselle, you wanna do that?

49
00:02:14,358 --> 00:02:15,413
- [Giselle] No.

50
00:02:16,117 --> 00:02:16,872
- [Amy] Okay.

51
00:02:16,872 --> 00:02:18,410
- [Alina] That, yeah.

52
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:21,992
- [Amy] Pour it so this gets to 20, okay?

53
00:02:21,992 --> 00:02:23,162
- [Alina] I'll pour it then.

54
00:02:23,162 --> 00:02:25,236
(Background Chatter)

55
00:02:27,957 --> 00:02:29,973
- [Amy] Oops, whoa, okay.

56
00:02:29,973 --> 00:02:31,313
- [Hayden] Try not to put too much.

57
00:02:31,313 --> 00:02:32,486
- [Amy] I'll pour it out.

58
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,615
- [Hayden] Let's try
again, it, with a dropper.

59
00:02:35,804 --> 00:02:38,014
- [Amy] No, you're supposed
to do it with a beaker.

60
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,726
- [Hayden] I know, but if
we're really, really close,

61
00:02:43,726 --> 00:02:44,916
and we can't do it with a beaker,

62
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,512
then we're gonna have
to do it with a dropper.

63
00:02:46,512 --> 00:02:48,044
- [Alina] So, we just do this.

64
00:02:50,725 --> 00:02:52,445
- [Amy] Okay, we're at 20.

65
00:02:56,545 --> 00:02:57,810
I think that's 20.

66
00:02:58,962 --> 00:02:59,795
- [Alina] We're at 19
- [Hayden] I got it.

67
00:02:59,795 --> 00:03:01,074
- [Amy] Okay.

68
00:03:05,564 --> 00:03:06,716
- [Amy] Just...

69
00:03:07,724 --> 00:03:09,570
Don't drop it too fast 'cause...

70
00:03:10,475 --> 00:03:12,087
I, okay.

71
00:03:14,365 --> 00:03:15,524
Okay.

72
00:03:15,524 --> 00:03:18,643
So, now we have to add
the three marbles, so...

73
00:03:18,643 --> 00:03:20,466
- [Giselle] We'll
bring 'em on this side.

74
00:03:21,421 --> 00:03:23,890
- [Amy] Yeah, you have one, Hayden
has one, and I have one.

75
00:03:24,518 --> 00:03:26,329
- [Hayden] No, let Alina have one.

76
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:27,492
You do...

77
00:03:28,797 --> 00:03:30,308
- [Amy] Alina poured the water.

78
00:03:30,308 --> 00:03:32,521
So, it's you, Amy, and Hayden.

79
00:03:32,521 --> 00:03:33,694
- [Hayden] Okay.

80
00:03:34,764 --> 00:03:37,151
- [Amy] Okay, so, we have to like,

81
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:40,312
tilt it to roll down the cylinder.

82
00:03:42,532 --> 00:03:44,145
- [Giselle] I think I can do it.

83
00:03:44,145 --> 00:03:45,522
- [Amy] Yeah, I know, but it's the easiest way.

84
00:03:45,522 --> 00:03:47,036
- [Hayden] No, not
that much, you don't wanna,

85
00:03:47,036 --> 00:03:48,171
don't wanna pour some out.

86
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,369
Sayonara, sucker.

87
00:03:53,745 --> 00:03:58,745
- [Amy] Okay, the water level now is 26 exactly.

88
00:04:00,316 --> 00:04:03,013
All right, so it went from 20 to 26.

89
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,603
So, the difference in volume is six,

90
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:10,532
and the volume of the three
marbles is six, right?

91
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:13,642
What do you think, Alina?

92
00:04:14,332 --> 00:04:15,522
- [Alina] Yeah.

93
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:17,001
- [Amy] How do you think I got six?

94
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:19,285
- [Alina] I don't know.

95
00:04:19,522 --> 00:04:22,567
- [Amy] Well, subtracted 20 from 26.

96
00:04:23,908 --> 00:04:27,047
Because it's 20 before
the marbles and 26 after,

97
00:04:27,443 --> 00:04:28,808
so the marbles must be...

98
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,672
- [Teacher] Okay.

99
00:04:30,672 --> 00:04:31,733
- [Hayden] Kay?

100
00:04:32,078 --> 00:04:33,198
- [Teacher] How we doin' over here?

101
00:04:33,198 --> 00:04:33,988
- [Hayden] Pretty good.

102
00:04:33,988 --> 00:04:36,324
- [Teacher] All right, I'm gonna ask you a couple

103
00:04:36,324 --> 00:04:38,013
of questions about volume.

104
00:04:39,164 --> 00:04:40,755
What have you learned about volume so far?

105
00:04:40,755 --> 00:04:41,852
Whenever you...

106
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:46,342
Alina, look at the board
that I made for you, okay?

107
00:04:46,342 --> 00:04:49,041
Whenever you drop drops of water

108
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,729
into the graduated cylinder,
what's happening to the volume?

109
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:54,779
- [Girl in yellow] What happened?

110
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:56,632
- [Teacher] What happened to the
volume of the water?

111
00:04:56,632 --> 00:04:58,486
- [Amy] It was at 20 and then 26.

112
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,524
- [Alina] It got higher?

113
00:04:59,524 --> 00:05:00,829
- [Amy] It went higher.
- [Teacher] It went higher,

114
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:04,146
okay, so we can say, then,
that volume does what?

115
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:09,758
- [Amy] What did it do?
- [Alina] Rise.

116
00:05:09,758 --> 00:05:11,128
- [Teacher] It rose, okay.

117
00:05:12,274 --> 00:05:16,524
Volume rises, okay, so, the volume rose,

118
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:20,483
good, and what did you find for the volume

119
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:23,044
of the three marbles
using water displacement?

120
00:05:23,044 --> 00:05:23,941
Did you get that far yet?

121
00:05:23,941 --> 00:05:24,677
- [Amy] Yep.

122
00:05:24,677 --> 00:05:25,520
- [Teacher] Okay.

123
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,202
- [Amy] We got six because the
water was at 20 before,

124
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:31,308
and then after we put the
marbles in, it was at 26,

125
00:05:31,308 --> 00:05:35,299
so, it's six 'cause you have to subtract

126
00:05:35,299 --> 00:05:36,965
the 26 minus 20.

127
00:05:36,965 --> 00:05:37,797
- [Teacher] Good, okay.

128
00:05:37,797 --> 00:05:39,030
If you can switch places with me,

129
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,448
I wanna be able to hear Alina.

130
00:05:42,713 --> 00:05:43,711
Okay.

131
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:46,164
All right, so, I'm gonna
ask you another question.

132
00:05:46,164 --> 00:05:50,454
When you were doing-- if you got six,

133
00:05:50,454 --> 00:05:53,683
if the volume of those three
marbles is six milliliters

134
00:05:53,683 --> 00:05:56,066
according to what you have,
we need to change that

135
00:05:56,066 --> 00:05:58,800
to a solid measurement, okay?

136
00:05:59,314 --> 00:06:01,988
This is the solid measurement, cubes,

137
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:04,196
that we use to measure solids.

138
00:06:04,996 --> 00:06:06,442
Marbles are solids.

139
00:06:06,442 --> 00:06:09,562
So, Alina, can you, can anyone tell me

140
00:06:09,562 --> 00:06:12,364
how we transfer that six
milliliters to cubes?

141
00:06:12,364 --> 00:06:13,431
To centimeter cubes?

142
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:15,690
- [Hayden] Each one of
those is a gram, and if...

143
00:06:16,117 --> 00:06:18,031
- [Teacher] Each one of these is
a gram, that's correct.

144
00:06:18,031 --> 00:06:23,031
- [Hayden] And if one milliliter
is equal to one centimeter

145
00:06:23,045 --> 00:06:28,045
cubed, and all, and in that
case, it must also be equal

146
00:06:29,353 --> 00:06:32,684
to one gram, so that's why for this,

147
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:37,191
I wrote that the difference
in volume was six grams

148
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:40,124
and the volume of three
marbles is six grams.

149
00:06:40,554 --> 00:06:44,204
I could also figure out that
these are our three marbles,

150
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:48,842
and we have six grams,
then each one of them

151
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,306
is 15 grams.

152
00:06:50,306 --> 00:06:53,206
- [Teacher] Okay, but grams, is
that a unit of volume,

153
00:06:53,206 --> 00:06:55,071
or is that a unit of mass?

154
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:55,640
- [Alina] Mass.

155
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,670
- [Hayden] Mass.
- [Teacher] Good, Alina,

156
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,961
it's a unit of mass.

157
00:06:57,964 --> 00:07:01,952
So, what Hayden said is correct.

158
00:07:01,952 --> 00:07:05,463
One centimeter, one milliliter
is equal to one gram,

159
00:07:05,463 --> 00:07:07,850
one milliliter of water
is equal to one gram,

160
00:07:08,632 --> 00:07:10,674
but what do we know about
the cubic centimeters?

161
00:07:10,674 --> 00:07:12,920
We need to put the units in this term.

162
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,335
So, if you got six
milliliters for the volume

163
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:22,436
of the three marbles,
then how can we change it

164
00:07:22,436 --> 00:07:24,403
to centimeters cubed?

165
00:07:25,165 --> 00:07:27,729
How many milliliters is this,
is one centimeter cubed?

166
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,205
Do you remember, one.

167
00:07:29,205 --> 00:07:33,216
It's a one to one ratio, like
Eli told us in home room.

168
00:07:33,216 --> 00:07:35,524
So, six milliliters must also be equal

169
00:07:35,524 --> 00:07:37,656
to six centimeters cubed.

170
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,743
So, and this is the unit of
volume, but you're also right,

171
00:07:41,743 --> 00:07:45,990
the mass must be, it will
also be equal to one gram,

172
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,825
but we're talking about volume, not mass.

173
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:51,038
- [Girl in gray] So, it's the weight, it's the volume.

174
00:07:51,468 --> 00:07:52,479
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

175
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,555
- [Girl in gray] It has to do with three
times three times four.

176
00:07:54,555 --> 00:07:56,563
- [Voiceover] But you have to explain why.

177
00:07:57,441 --> 00:07:58,440
- [Girl in gray] Because...

178
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,451
- [Voiceover] So, how do we know this?

179
00:08:01,122 --> 00:08:03,191
- [Girl in gray] (Background Chatter)

180
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,407
- [Ryan] But why do we do that?

181
00:08:04,803 --> 00:08:07,080
- [Girl in gray] You don't know the answer right now.

182
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,272
- [Summer] Because it said that...

183
00:08:09,704 --> 00:08:11,956
(Background Chatter)

184
00:08:11,956 --> 00:08:14,330
- [Summer] Three cubic centimeters.

185
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,837
And a height of three cubic centimeters...

186
00:08:18,837 --> 00:08:20,364
- [Ryan] I don't know if that's really a three

187
00:08:20,364 --> 00:08:21,643
with a height of four.

188
00:08:21,643 --> 00:08:23,533
- [Summer] Yeah, with a height of four.

189
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,665
So, we have to do our work.

190
00:08:31,153 --> 00:08:33,169
- [Girl in gray] 'Cause we built the work right there.

191
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:34,946
And like...

192
00:08:34,946 --> 00:08:37,440
(Background Chatter)

193
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,314
(door shutting)

194
00:09:01,965 --> 00:09:03,514
- [Summer] Height from a...

195
00:09:03,514 --> 00:09:05,580
(Background Chatter)

196
00:09:07,803 --> 00:09:09,318
- [Girl in gray] And the height.

197
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,793
Hold on.

198
00:09:15,174 --> 00:09:16,165
So...

199
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:26,455
So, Summer, three times three, and then...

200
00:09:26,455 --> 00:09:28,811
- [Summer] Yeah, times four.

201
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:30,718
- [Girl in gray] I'm up to three times three.

202
00:09:31,121 --> 00:09:34,654
That's nine, and then times four

203
00:09:36,027 --> 00:09:38,031
gives you three times...

204
00:09:38,757 --> 00:09:40,709
- [Summer] When I did this, it
was four times three,

205
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:41,923
I know that.

206
00:09:41,923 --> 00:09:44,203
(Background Chatter)

207
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:51,077
- [Summer] Is...

208
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,602
- [Girl in gray] So, three times...
- [Summer] 16.

209
00:09:55,602 --> 00:09:56,633
- [Ryan] No.

210
00:09:57,793 --> 00:10:01,393
- [Girl in gray] Three times three is
nine, times four is...

211
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,680
- [Ryan] Okay, it's three times four--

212
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,364
Okay, it's nine times four.

213
00:10:07,364 --> 00:10:08,467
Why would that be 60?

214
00:10:11,155 --> 00:10:12,000
- [Summer] 36.

215
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,862
- [Girl in gray] Yeah, so, we did three times three,

216
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:18,282
we calculated nine times three.

217
00:10:19,443 --> 00:10:22,085
- [Ryan] So, that gives you nine, 
and then because there's a height

218
00:10:22,085 --> 00:10:25,923
of three, you multiply by
four, which gives you 36

219
00:10:25,923 --> 00:10:27,608
because it's a basic math problem.

220
00:10:31,357 --> 00:10:34,523
- [Girl in gray] And it gives you 36.

221
00:10:34,523 --> 00:10:38,788
(Background Chatter)

222
00:10:38,788 --> 00:10:40,038
Okay.

223
00:10:42,988 --> 00:10:44,733
So, explain why you know that.

224
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,204
And then...

225
00:10:48,204 --> 00:10:50,112
- [Ryan] And then we go on to number two.

226
00:10:50,112 --> 00:10:51,569
- [Girl in gray] But wait for her to finish.

227
00:10:52,036 --> 00:10:53,452
- [Ryan] I am.

228
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:55,013
I'm just gonna be a little...

229
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,981
Change the length, width, and height

230
00:10:57,981 --> 00:11:02,234
of the rectangular prism
without changing its volume.

231
00:11:02,644 --> 00:11:04,095
Try and it and explain.

232
00:11:06,323 --> 00:11:07,387
Of course not, because
we're gonna feel like

233
00:11:07,387 --> 00:11:08,542
I think is something's wrong.

234
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,956
- [Girl in gray] Well, we can...
- [Ryan] Well, I guess if...

235
00:11:10,956 --> 00:11:12,594
- [Girl in gray] No we can't 'cause you can take that one

236
00:11:12,594 --> 00:11:14,224
off the building height.

237
00:11:14,224 --> 00:11:17,050
- [Ryan] No, we could tip this 
over this way.

238
00:11:17,871 --> 00:11:19,684
and solve for--
- [Girl in gray] Why would you do that?

239
00:11:20,356 --> 00:11:21,304
- [Ryan] What?

240
00:11:21,304 --> 00:11:22,786
We're done with problem one. 

241
00:11:24,878 --> 00:11:26,056
- [Girl in gray] So, now...

242
00:11:26,914 --> 00:11:28,256
- [Ryan] So, I guess we could.

243
00:11:29,553 --> 00:11:30,650
Yeah.

244
00:11:31,313 --> 00:11:33,543
But, no, but in, we'd still have,

245
00:11:33,543 --> 00:11:35,125
we would still have the same volume.

246
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:37,584
- [Summer] All right, so the next
problem is can you change...

247
00:11:37,584 --> 00:11:38,466
- [Ryan] Summer, are you still--

248
00:11:38,466 --> 00:11:39,445
- [Summer] I'm fine.

249
00:11:39,445 --> 00:11:41,452
- [Ryan] I know, but we already read it though.

250
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:44,237
- [Girl in gray] She can read, she
needs to read it, Ryan.

251
00:11:47,345 --> 00:11:50,631
- [Ryan] So, what, say we couldn't
because the numbers,

252
00:11:50,631 --> 00:11:53,550
we'll have to do the, oh wait, no.

253
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,066
- [Girl in gray] No, we could...

254
00:11:55,066 --> 00:11:56,675
- [Ryan] No, because like, we won't...

255
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,357
- [Girl in gray] We're doing the height and we
turn it sideways.

256
00:11:58,357 --> 00:11:59,800
(Background Chatter)

257
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,998
- [Ryan] Yes, we would.

258
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,407
It's true.
- [Girl in gray] Okay.

259
00:12:04,681 --> 00:12:05,835
- [Ryan] So...
- [Teacher] So...

260
00:12:05,835 --> 00:12:06,574
How are you guys doing?

261
00:12:06,574 --> 00:12:08,996
- [Girl in gray] For number two, we wanted
to, we had it like this,

262
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:10,317
and we wanted to turn it sideways

263
00:12:10,317 --> 00:12:12,330
'cause that would change
the height around...

264
00:12:13,203 --> 00:12:15,188
- [Teacher] Okay, so let's talk about number two,

265
00:12:15,188 --> 00:12:15,964
that's the one you're on?

266
00:12:15,964 --> 00:12:17,452
- [Ryan] I'm completely knocked it over.

267
00:12:17,452 --> 00:12:20,154
- [Teacher] All right, so, the
question is, on number two,

268
00:12:20,154 --> 00:12:22,807
can you change the length, width?

269
00:12:24,196 --> 00:12:26,194
Can you change the
length, width, and height

270
00:12:26,194 --> 00:12:29,528
of the rectangular prism
without changing its volume?

271
00:12:30,007 --> 00:12:31,538
Try it and explain.

272
00:12:31,538 --> 00:12:34,521
Okay, so, first of all, the
first rectangular prism,

273
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:38,051
you built, so this
rectangular prism, okay,

274
00:12:38,461 --> 00:12:43,447
was one centimeter, I mean,
three centimeters long.

275
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,562
- [Girl in gray] We did three times three, it was nine

276
00:12:47,562 --> 00:12:49,678
because it had a line...

277
00:12:49,678 --> 00:12:54,079
(Background Chatter)

278
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,603
So, three times three is
nine, then times four,

279
00:12:56,603 --> 00:12:58,193
times height of four, I don't know.

280
00:12:59,022 --> 00:13:00,916
- [Teacher] Okay, so this is the
rectangular prism you built

281
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,067
for number one, correct?

282
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:05,396
Okay, and then you just
multiply its length

283
00:13:05,396 --> 00:13:07,198
times its width, times its height,

284
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:08,764
and what did you get, Summer?

285
00:13:08,764 --> 00:13:10,625
- [Summer] I got 36.

286
00:13:10,626 --> 00:13:11,853
- [Teacher] 36.

287
00:13:12,317 --> 00:13:13,632
- [Ryan] And I'm thinking that more than one

288
00:13:13,632 --> 00:13:15,961
thing can equal 36, like if we had...

289
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:19,838
- [Teacher] Okay, so, how many cubes
did you use to get this?

290
00:13:19,838 --> 00:13:21,316
- [Ryan] Two for 36.

291
00:13:21,316 --> 00:13:23,004
- [Teacher] This 36?

292
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,506
How many cubes were there in all?

293
00:13:25,506 --> 00:13:26,513
- [Ryan] In all, that was 36.

294
00:13:26,513 --> 00:13:29,024
- [Teacher] It was 36, you had to
count out the cubes, right?

295
00:13:29,024 --> 00:13:32,951
So, can you use the same
36 cubes in number two?

296
00:13:32,951 --> 00:13:34,401
- [Ryan] But have
like, a different height.

297
00:13:34,401 --> 00:13:36,196
- [Teacher] But have a different
length, width, and height?

298
00:13:36,196 --> 00:13:37,711
- [Ryan] Well yeah,
the answer would be yes

299
00:13:37,711 --> 00:13:39,764
because more, there are multiple pieces,

300
00:13:39,764 --> 00:13:43,592
you could do six like, well,
you do two, three, and six.

301
00:13:43,592 --> 00:13:44,399
- [Teacher] Okay.
- [Ryan] Two times three

302
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,710
equals six, six times six equals 36.

303
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,755
- [Teacher] Two times three times
six would equal 36.

304
00:13:48,755 --> 00:13:51,960
- [Ryan] Right, as long as the
three would be height.

305
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,396
(mumbling)

306
00:13:54,396 --> 00:13:56,409
So, six could be this.

307
00:13:56,409 --> 00:13:57,406
- [Teacher] Okay.

308
00:13:57,406 --> 00:13:58,323
Summer, what do you think?

309
00:13:58,323 --> 00:14:00,559
They think you can change these numbers

310
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:02,442
and it still be 36 cubes.

311
00:14:02,956 --> 00:14:07,245
Could you still use 36 cubes,
build a rectangular prism,

312
00:14:08,075 --> 00:14:10,126
and, but get different numbers here?

313
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,820
