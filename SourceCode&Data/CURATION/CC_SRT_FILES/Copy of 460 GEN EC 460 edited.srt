- Yeah because it melts.

171
00:10:13,765 --> 00:10:15,663
- Oh, if it melts it's gonna be a?

172
00:10:15,663 --> 00:10:16,383
- Liquid.

173
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,001
- Do you think that is a gas, Anne Carol?

174
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:22,407
- No.
- What do you think it is?

175
00:10:22,407 --> 00:10:23,475
- A solid.

176
00:10:23,475 --> 00:10:24,658
- A solid.

177
00:10:26,611 --> 00:10:28,116
It could turn into a liquid.

178
00:10:28,116 --> 00:10:30,117
Do you think that an ice cube --

179
00:10:30,117 --> 00:10:31,515
Hold on, Amy's got a good question.

180
00:10:31,515 --> 00:10:33,353
What did you say?

181
00:10:33,353 --> 00:10:35,519
- Maybe sometimes it could
turn into a gas state.

182
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,388
- How would you turn it into a gas?

183
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:38,289
- Boil it.

184
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:40,024
- You boil it. Very good.

185
00:10:40,024 --> 00:10:42,761
- It could melt too and turn into a --

186
00:10:42,761 --> 00:10:45,138
- It could turn into one as it melts.

187
00:10:45,138 --> 00:10:47,130
- My house is a solid.

188
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,500
Your house is a solid, Anne Carol.

189
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,518
Good job.

190
00:10:50,468 --> 00:10:51,936
- It's so cold.

191
00:10:51,936 --> 00:10:52,970
- Shake it, shake it.

192
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:53,854
Give it a good shake.

193
00:10:56,941 --> 00:10:58,359
[laughter]

194
00:11:03,635 --> 00:11:05,065
Alright, I'll be right back, guys.

195
00:11:15,793 --> 00:11:18,212
- Try not to squeeze
it, then it might pop.

196
00:11:29,507 --> 00:11:30,007
- Ms. Moore?

197
00:11:30,007 --> 00:11:30,474
- Yes ma'am?

198
00:11:30,474 --> 00:11:31,642
- Will you do it, please?

199
00:11:31,642 --> 00:11:32,209
- You want me to help you?

200
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:33,094
Okay.

201
00:11:36,384 --> 00:11:37,998
Let's re-check it and see?

202
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,804
- Have to open a lot of bags.

203
00:11:47,091 --> 00:11:48,459
- What is it still?

204
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:50,061
- Liquid.

205
00:11:50,061 --> 00:11:52,563
- So we're get it right in the middle.

206
00:11:52,563 --> 00:11:54,365
You wanna feel it?

207
00:11:55,495 --> 00:11:56,303
- Whoa.
- It's still a liquid.

208
00:11:56,303 --> 00:11:57,268
Is it getting colder?

209
00:11:57,268 --> 00:11:58,652
- Yes.

210
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:02,840
It did mix together, didn't it?

211
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,891
We're gettin there.

212
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:09,764
It does look like
that now, doesn't it?

213
00:12:17,224 --> 00:12:18,542
That's okay.

214
00:12:23,594 --> 00:12:24,713
Alright, ready guys?

215
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:28,782
We're gonna get it more in there.

216
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:41,145
- There's like 50 pieces of ice in there.

217
00:12:41,145 --> 00:12:42,163
- There is a lot of them.

218
00:12:43,981 --> 00:12:45,633
Alright, here goes your turn, Kevin.

219
00:12:46,551 --> 00:12:48,453
Getting colder. Getting colder.

220
00:12:48,453 --> 00:12:51,723
- Hey look --
- What you need, sweetie?

221
00:12:51,723 --> 00:12:53,307
- Aw, thank you, darling.

222
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:09,616
Keeping your hands warm there, Thomas?

223
00:13:09,616 --> 00:13:10,958
Ready to go?

224
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,413
Do you think it's easier to
go to the store or make it?

225
00:13:15,413 --> 00:13:16,381
- To the store.

226
00:13:16,381 --> 00:13:18,049
- Make it.

227
00:13:18,049 --> 00:13:19,451
- Is it more fun to make it?

228
00:13:19,451 --> 00:13:20,570
- Yeah.

229
00:13:27,893 --> 00:13:28,525
Yes ma'am?

230
00:13:28,525 --> 00:13:31,312
[Background Chatter]
- That's okay.

231
00:13:34,374 --> 00:13:36,573
You can make up your own flavor.

232
00:13:36,573 --> 00:13:38,301
Alright, if it's not your turn,

233
00:13:38,301 --> 00:13:39,604
what I want you to do,

234
00:13:39,604 --> 00:13:42,690
is you're gonna start to filling
out these questions, okay?

235
00:13:53,217 --> 00:13:55,469
Yep, you can start
filling those out.

236
00:14:00,258 --> 00:14:01,292
Alright, you start
filling those out.

237
00:14:01,292 --> 00:14:03,757
You can help each
other with these.

238
00:14:03,757 --> 00:14:05,863
So what did you make?

239
00:14:05,863 --> 00:14:07,881
- Ice cream.

240
00:14:12,302 --> 00:14:14,072
- One thing was solid,
what was that, Kayla?

241
00:14:14,072 --> 00:14:14,940
- Sugar.
- Ice!

242
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,840
Ice and sugar.

243
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,475
- Oh, we did use ice.

244
00:14:17,475 --> 00:14:18,743
We did use ice.

245
00:14:18,743 --> 00:14:20,127
- So three.

246
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,814
- What else is in here, though?

247
00:14:22,814 --> 00:14:24,819
What else is in here?

248
00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:25,960
- Rock salt.

249
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,306
- There you go.

250
00:14:28,219 --> 00:14:30,724
- Guys we're almost done!

251
00:14:30,724 --> 00:14:33,324
Look, look at it.

252
00:14:33,324 --> 00:14:34,609
- Keep going. Yes?

253
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:45,971
It shows, what were
the solids you used?

254
00:14:45,971 --> 00:14:47,405
Good, you have one of them on there.

255
00:14:47,405 --> 00:14:48,789
- Salt.

256
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:49,990
- Yep.

257
00:14:54,178 --> 00:14:55,429
- We used salt.

258
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:03,449
- It's gonna be vanilla ice cream.
