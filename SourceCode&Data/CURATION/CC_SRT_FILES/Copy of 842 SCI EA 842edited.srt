1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,315
ï»¿- Winter is colder.

2
00:00:02,315 --> 00:00:03,720
- Okay, alright.

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,950
Okay, okay.

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,110
So, that's his position.

5
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,607
He's going to stick with it for a minute,

6
00:00:08,607 --> 00:00:09,826
but then he might have to go around,

7
00:00:09,826 --> 00:00:11,389
he might change his mind, alright?

8
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:12,016
Okay.

9
00:00:12,016 --> 00:00:15,394
This group agreed with Fernando, okay?

10
00:00:15,394 --> 00:00:18,658
That it's because the Earth
orbits closer to the sun

11
00:00:18,658 --> 00:00:21,375
in the summer than in the winter.

12
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:23,424
Who would like to share
they're thinking?

13
00:00:25,113 --> 00:00:27,325
I'll call on you if you don't (laughs).

14
00:00:29,652 --> 00:00:31,451
So, what do you think?

15
00:00:31,451 --> 00:00:34,435
- Well, I think it's
because since the Earth

16
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:38,242
like orbits around the
sun, like in an oval,

17
00:00:38,242 --> 00:00:40,320
when it gets here it would be warmer

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,899
because it's closer to the sun.

19
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:42,492
- Okay.

20
00:00:42,492 --> 00:00:44,995
- And it's winter when it's
away from the sun (mumbles).

21
00:00:44,995 --> 00:00:45,738
- Okay.

22
00:00:45,738 --> 00:00:48,942
So, can you go and draw that
on the board, what you mean?

23
00:00:48,942 --> 00:00:52,982
Because I heard you say that
the Earth orbits around the sun

24
00:00:52,982 --> 00:00:54,933
in the shape of an oval.

25
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:56,592
Raise your hand if you agree with that.

26
00:00:57,781 --> 00:00:58,832
Okay.

27
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:08,874
Okay.

28
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:11,805
Okay.

29
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:14,185
So, that's the Earth and
it's orbiting around the sun

30
00:01:14,185 --> 00:01:16,820
and he said that the shape
of the path that it travels

31
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,362
as it orbits is an oval, okay?

32
00:01:19,362 --> 00:01:21,788
Anybody else in this
group has something to add

33
00:01:21,788 --> 00:01:24,557
to help him defend Fernando?

34
00:01:26,978 --> 00:01:27,698
Okay, I see.

35
00:01:27,698 --> 00:01:28,794
Can I read what you wrote?

36
00:01:28,794 --> 00:01:29,293
- Sure.

37
00:01:29,293 --> 00:01:33,066
- He said that the orbit
is not a perfect circle.

38
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:34,703
So, that's sort of what he's saying there.

39
00:01:34,703 --> 00:01:35,364
Is that right?

40
00:01:35,364 --> 00:01:35,805
- Yeah.

41
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:40,805
- And how would it not being
a perfect circle affect

42
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:44,628
the difference in summer,
winter temperature or heat?

43
00:01:44,628 --> 00:01:46,381
- Well, we know that the Earth,

44
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:50,487
if it was a perfect circle
the seasons wouldn't change.

45
00:01:50,487 --> 00:01:51,033
- Okay.

46
00:01:51,033 --> 00:01:51,811
- It would be the same.

47
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:52,847
- Alright.

48
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:53,729
Okay.

49
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:54,751
- Depending where the Earth is--

50
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:56,713
- Alright, okay.

51
00:01:56,713 --> 00:01:59,250
Anybody else have something
they want to add in this group?

52
00:02:00,636 --> 00:02:01,356
Okay.

53
00:02:01,356 --> 00:02:04,375
Now anybody based on these two groups?

54
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:07,144
Anybody want to move from their
group to these two groups?

55
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,819
Not yet.

56
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:10,516
Okay, that's alright.

57
00:02:10,516 --> 00:02:11,340
Okay.

58
00:02:13,476 --> 00:02:15,183
Now let's go to Raul, okay.

59
00:02:15,183 --> 00:02:17,733
This group agrees with Raul and he says

60
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:20,369
it's because the Earth's
tilt changes the angle

61
00:02:20,369 --> 00:02:22,447
of the sunlight hitting the Earth.

62
00:02:22,447 --> 00:02:23,526
Defend yourselves.

63
00:02:23,526 --> 00:02:27,013
- So, I remember learning
that the tilt of the axis

64
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,314
is the reason for the seasons.

65
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,320
But I read the question again,
it says the Earth still changes

66
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,213
and if it doesn't change
it stays the same.

67
00:02:34,672 --> 00:02:35,252
- Okay.

68
00:02:35,252 --> 00:02:36,781
Let's read it again.

69
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:37,756
Read it really simple.

70
00:02:37,756 --> 00:02:41,424
- It says it's because the
Earth's tilt changes the angle

71
00:02:41,424 --> 00:02:42,794
of sunlight hitting Earth.

72
00:02:42,794 --> 00:02:43,421
- Okay.

73
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:47,101
So, it says the Earth's tilt
changes the angle of sunlight.

74
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:47,635
- Yeah.

75
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:49,901
- Does it say it changes
the tilt of the Earth?

76
00:02:51,113 --> 00:02:51,811
- No.

77
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:52,205
- Okay.

78
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:55,140
So you going to stick with what you
said or you want to change?

79
00:02:58,174 --> 00:03:01,670
Can you show me?
If I give you something can
you show me what you mean?

80
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,134
- Alright.

81
00:03:02,134 --> 00:03:03,075
- Okay.

82
00:03:03,075 --> 00:03:07,753
So, I'm going to give you
an apple and I want you

83
00:03:07,753 --> 00:03:10,029
to pretend it's the Earth, okay?

84
00:03:10,029 --> 00:03:14,092
And I'm going to stick this
bamboo skewer through it,

85
00:03:14,092 --> 00:03:16,553
well it didn't go exactly
right, but just pretend.

86
00:03:16,553 --> 00:03:19,235
So, what does this represent
based on what you just said?

87
00:03:19,235 --> 00:03:20,853
- This is the axis of the Earth.

88
00:03:20,853 --> 00:03:24,251
- So, this is the axis and
what does the axis do?

89
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:27,432
- (mumbles).

90
00:03:27,432 --> 00:03:27,989
- Okay.

91
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:29,649
So, the Earth rotates around the axis

92
00:03:29,649 --> 00:03:31,854
which is what Ryan said, right?

93
00:03:31,854 --> 00:03:32,749
Okay.

94
00:03:32,749 --> 00:03:35,375
And be careful because
I just poked myself.

95
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,624
I want you to be careful (laughs).

96
00:03:37,624 --> 00:03:38,402
Okay.

97
00:03:38,402 --> 00:03:42,743
So, can you stand up and
show me what you mean

98
00:03:42,743 --> 00:03:44,694
and let's have someone else in your group

99
00:03:44,694 --> 00:03:47,039
that agrees with you be the sun

100
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,338
and stand kind of in the middle

101
00:03:49,338 --> 00:03:52,020
of the room right here, okay?

102
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,519
Alright.

103
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:55,502
So she's the sun, you're the Earth,

104
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,975
show us what you mean, okay?

105
00:03:57,975 --> 00:03:58,910
- Okay.

106
00:04:00,076 --> 00:04:05,076
Well, the Earth orbits the sun--

107
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,078
- Alright.

108
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:08,643
What's the word you were
just about to say though?

109
00:04:08,643 --> 00:04:09,795
Revolves?

110
00:04:11,322 --> 00:04:13,783
I think that might be okay, too.

111
00:04:13,783 --> 00:04:14,979
What do you guys think?

112
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:16,720
Do you think revolve and
orbit might be the same?

113
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,228
- Yeah.

114
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:18,280
- Okay, alright.

115
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,442
- It doesn't matter.

116
00:04:20,656 --> 00:04:22,161
- Okay, so you're going
to have to make the--

117
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,956
Go around the outside of the
desk for your orbit, okay?

118
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:27,010
- Well, it orbits the sun in a tilt.

119
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:27,621
- Okay.

120
00:04:27,621 --> 00:04:29,071
Which one is tilt?

121
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,317
- I forgot how many degrees.

122
00:04:31,317 --> 00:04:32,285
- Okay.

123
00:04:32,285 --> 00:04:33,835
Alright, okay.

124
00:04:36,441 --> 00:04:37,625
So keep going.

125
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:38,573
- It orbits in an angle.

126
00:04:38,573 --> 00:04:39,009
- Alright.

127
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:41,467
Hold it the way you think
it's supposed to be.

128
00:04:41,467 --> 00:04:42,918
Okay.

129
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:44,070
- I think it's this one.

130
00:04:45,422 --> 00:04:46,340
I'm pretty sure.

131
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,083
- Alright.

132
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:50,542
So she's tilting it, but
now, and it's tilted.

133
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:52,899
Right now it's away from
the sun, is that right?

134
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:53,804
- Yeah.

135
00:04:53,804 --> 00:04:54,396
- Okay.

136
00:04:54,396 --> 00:04:56,819
Now keep coming around (laughs).

137
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:59,314
Of course does it make a
little job to play that?

138
00:04:59,314 --> 00:05:00,061
- No.

139
00:05:00,061 --> 00:05:01,831
- But we're just imagining
those who were in this room

140
00:05:01,831 --> 00:05:03,565
(mumbles).

141
00:05:03,565 --> 00:05:04,644
Okay.

142
00:05:04,644 --> 00:05:06,585
Now stop there for a minute.

143
00:05:07,832 --> 00:05:11,178
Is your axis pointing
where you want it to?

144
00:05:12,507 --> 00:05:13,343
- Yes.

145
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,166
- Okay, alright.

146
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:14,777
Keep going.

147
00:05:14,777 --> 00:05:16,269
You guys need to make space
for her to come through

148
00:05:16,269 --> 00:05:17,354
on her orbit.

149
00:05:21,271 --> 00:05:23,497
Okay, alright.

150
00:05:23,497 --> 00:05:26,422
So, does that help some of you?

151
00:05:26,422 --> 00:05:28,605
How many people think that she's right?

152
00:05:28,605 --> 00:05:33,028
That the Earth tilts as
it's going around its orbit?

153
00:05:33,028 --> 00:05:36,232
It's actually kind of spinning on its axis

154
00:05:36,232 --> 00:05:38,945
while it's going around, right?

155
00:05:38,945 --> 00:05:39,792
Is that right?

156
00:05:39,792 --> 00:05:40,245
- Yeah.

157
00:05:40,245 --> 00:05:41,824
- It's spinning the whole time, right?

158
00:05:41,824 --> 00:05:43,522
What does that spinning give us?

159
00:05:44,932 --> 00:05:46,093
What does that spinning give us?

160
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:46,847
- Day and night.

161
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,995
- The spinning gives
us day and night, okay?

162
00:05:48,995 --> 00:05:49,656
Right?

163
00:05:49,656 --> 00:05:50,168
Okay.

164
00:05:50,168 --> 00:05:54,672
Because one side of the Earth
is facing the sun it's what?

165
00:05:54,672 --> 00:05:55,345
- Day.

166
00:05:55,345 --> 00:05:56,633
- And the other side is in?

167
00:05:56,633 --> 00:05:57,295
- Night.

168
00:05:57,295 --> 00:05:59,080
- Okay, alright.

169
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,320
Okay, alright.

170
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,980
This group over here.

171
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,501
You guys agree with--

172
00:06:04,501 --> 00:06:05,500
- Susan.

173
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,299
- Susan, okay?

174
00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:10,921
And Susan said that
she thinks it's because

175
00:06:10,921 --> 00:06:13,509
the northern hemisphere
is closer to the sun

176
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:15,901
in summer than in winter.

177
00:06:15,901 --> 00:06:17,921
So, what do you think?

178
00:06:17,921 --> 00:06:21,706
- So, like she said that
its axis is tilting,

179
00:06:21,706 --> 00:06:24,152
but as it moves around the sun the

180
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:25,983
northern and southern hemisphere

181
00:06:25,983 --> 00:06:27,817
are closer and farther away.

182
00:06:27,817 --> 00:06:28,479
- Okay.

183
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,694
- But on this side the
southern hemisphere is closer.

184
00:06:30,694 --> 00:06:32,501
(mumbles)

185
00:06:32,501 --> 00:06:33,279
- Alright.

186
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,978
- And when it comes over
here, the northern hemisphere

187
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,580
is closer in the sun and--

188
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,683
- Alright.

189
00:06:37,683 --> 00:06:40,011
Anybody else in this big
room have something to add?

190
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:45,717
- Well, I agree with her, Natalie.

191
00:06:47,082 --> 00:06:52,082
Because as it is tilted, I believe, that,

192
00:06:52,627 --> 00:06:57,627
23.7 degrees

193
00:06:57,675 --> 00:07:01,273
and so when it goes around

194
00:07:01,273 --> 00:07:06,273
the sun shines bright and as it's turning

195
00:07:10,223 --> 00:07:13,776
and so as it goes around it will change

196
00:07:15,212 --> 00:07:17,797
where the light is hitting it.

197
00:07:17,797 --> 00:07:19,046
- Okay.

198
00:07:20,014 --> 00:07:22,563
Can someone add to that
or give us more detail?

199
00:07:24,438 --> 00:07:29,255
- I'm also pretty sure that
like the state of Texas

200
00:07:29,255 --> 00:07:33,341
it's more closer towards the equator

201
00:07:33,341 --> 00:07:35,396
and so it doesn't have all of the seasons.

202
00:07:36,402 --> 00:07:37,106
- Okay.

203
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:40,589
So, you think that places
on the equator, right here,

204
00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:42,156
they don't have four seasons?

205
00:07:42,156 --> 00:07:44,022
Summer, fall, winter, right?

206
00:07:44,022 --> 00:07:45,055
- I think they do have seasons,

207
00:07:45,055 --> 00:07:47,710
they're just not as different as like --

208
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,546
- Okay.

209
00:07:48,546 --> 00:07:50,851
So, there's not much, that
difference in the heat

210
00:07:50,851 --> 00:07:53,127
from the sun and the
winter versus the summer?

211
00:07:53,127 --> 00:07:53,576
- Yeah.

212
00:07:53,576 --> 00:07:56,200
- I think they're always
getting the same amount

213
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,152
depending on--

214
00:07:57,152 --> 00:07:58,533
- The same amount of what?

215
00:07:58,533 --> 00:08:01,296
- The same amount of sunlight and heat.

216
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:05,187
Because they're getting it directly almost.

217
00:08:05,187 --> 00:08:06,441
- Okay.

218
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:07,538
Alright.

219
00:08:10,248 --> 00:08:14,852
- (mumbles)

220
00:08:18,618 --> 00:08:20,308
- Why do you think that?

221
00:08:21,938 --> 00:08:23,978
What makes you say that?

222
00:08:23,978 --> 00:08:27,565
So, you think the orbit is
elliptical like this group,

223
00:08:27,565 --> 00:08:29,423
Fernando's group agreed.

224
00:08:29,423 --> 00:08:34,031
But it's not enough to change
the difference in temperature.

225
00:08:34,031 --> 00:08:39,031
- I don't think heat
really varies depending on,

226
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:44,258
I mean it varies, but not
in that small of a scale,

227
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:46,778
depending on where it is.

228
00:08:46,778 --> 00:08:51,138
And so just that little, teeny movement,

229
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:57,152
ellipse or something, will not change--

230
00:08:58,945 --> 00:09:00,047
- Okay, alright.

231
00:09:00,047 --> 00:09:00,628
Okay.

232
00:09:00,628 --> 00:09:03,553
I think we have another group over here.

233
00:09:03,553 --> 00:09:06,096
How about the Shakira agree-ers.

234
00:09:06,096 --> 00:09:07,590
Do you want to move now?

235
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,240
Okay.

236
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,751
Okay.

237
00:09:08,751 --> 00:09:11,711
Everybody if you want to
move to a different table

238
00:09:11,711 --> 00:09:13,807
go for it now, okay?

239
00:09:16,494 --> 00:09:18,404
Nobody agreed with Warner, huh?

240
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:22,049
Okay.

241
00:09:26,571 --> 00:09:28,672
So Eva's out, alright?

242
00:09:28,672 --> 00:09:33,021
People don't think that it
gives off more heat, right,

243
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:38,021
in the summer than the winter
in Warner's group, right?

244
00:09:39,248 --> 00:09:40,584
So we're down to--

245
00:09:40,584 --> 00:09:42,169
And Shakira's out, right?

246
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:47,599
Alright.

247
00:09:48,951 --> 00:09:51,638
Who said to me that they didn't
agree with any of them?

248
00:09:52,653 --> 00:09:53,490
- I changed my mind.

249
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,371
- You changed your mind?

250
00:09:54,371 --> 00:09:54,929
Okay.

251
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:55,428
Alright.

252
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:59,584
So, here's what I want you to do now, okay?

253
00:09:59,584 --> 00:10:03,073
I want to do another
little demonstration, okay?

254
00:10:04,983 --> 00:10:06,393
Would you be the sun?

255
00:10:07,653 --> 00:10:08,256
Okay.

256
00:10:08,256 --> 00:10:09,812
And would you be the Earth?

257
00:10:09,812 --> 00:10:12,320
Now here's what I want you to do for me.

258
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:17,190
I want you to orbit around the sun.

259
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,351
I want you to pick a spot.

260
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:21,126
Like let's say that yellow bucket, okay?

261
00:10:21,126 --> 00:10:26,126
And as you're going around
I want you to keep the axis

262
00:10:26,443 --> 00:10:30,111
pointed at that yellow bucket
no matter where you are.

263
00:10:30,111 --> 00:10:30,851
Can you do that?

264
00:10:30,851 --> 00:10:31,211
- Yes.

265
00:10:31,211 --> 00:10:31,756
- Alright.

266
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,865
Give it a try.

267
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:35,686
Alright.

268
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:40,695
Alright.

269
00:10:40,695 --> 00:10:42,390
Now stop for a second right there.

270
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,655
Okay.

271
00:10:43,655 --> 00:10:46,987
He's still pointed at
that yellow bucket, right?

272
00:10:46,987 --> 00:10:48,142
Keep going.

273
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:54,401
Alright, stop right there.

274
00:10:54,401 --> 00:10:57,582
He's still pointed pretty
much at the yellow bucket

275
00:10:57,582 --> 00:10:59,346
and you're tilted over
a little bit, right?

276
00:10:59,346 --> 00:10:59,985
Like she said.

277
00:10:59,985 --> 00:11:01,865
Because we all kind of agree pretty much.

278
00:11:01,865 --> 00:11:03,305
These two groups agreed with that.

279
00:11:03,305 --> 00:11:05,076
What season is it right now?

280
00:11:06,247 --> 00:11:08,766
In the northern hemisphere?

281
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:11,192
What season is it right now
in the northern hemisphere?

282
00:11:12,183 --> 00:11:12,938
- Winter.

283
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:13,542
- Winter.

284
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:15,666
Why is it winter in the
northern hemisphere?

285
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,303
- Because it's farther away from the sun--

286
00:11:17,303 --> 00:11:18,104
- Okay.

287
00:11:18,104 --> 00:11:22,504
So, it's pointing away from the sun, right?

288
00:11:22,504 --> 00:11:24,222
Do you think it's because
the northern hemisphere

289
00:11:24,222 --> 00:11:25,765
is farther away?

290
00:11:25,765 --> 00:11:28,226
- No, because it's tilted away.

291
00:11:28,226 --> 00:11:29,086
- Tilted away?

292
00:11:29,086 --> 00:11:29,527
- Yeah.

293
00:11:29,527 --> 00:11:30,467
- Okay.

294
00:11:30,467 --> 00:11:32,383
Alright, keep coming around here now.

295
00:11:32,383 --> 00:11:34,154
Keep pointing at the yellow bucket.

296
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,605
It's a little bit hard to do, huh?

297
00:11:38,605 --> 00:11:40,795
Okay, stop right there.

298
00:11:40,795 --> 00:11:42,741
What season is it right now?

299
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,545
- Would it be spring?

300
00:11:49,435 --> 00:11:50,270
Perhaps.

301
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,012
- It would be spring in
the northern hemisphere.

302
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,950
What is it in the southern hemisphere?

303
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,879
- Fall.

304
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:55,378
- Okay.

305
00:11:55,378 --> 00:11:57,398
So it's the opposite, right?

306
00:11:57,398 --> 00:11:58,948
Okay, keep coming around here.

307
00:12:03,736 --> 00:12:05,989
Alright, keep pointing
at the yellow bucket.

308
00:12:05,989 --> 00:12:08,562
Now what season is it in
the northern hemisphere?

309
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:11,510
What season is it in the
northern hemisphere now?

310
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,449
This group over here?

311
00:12:13,449 --> 00:12:14,772
Somebody in this group.

312
00:12:14,772 --> 00:12:17,930
(mumbles) the table.

313
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:18,545
What is it?

314
00:12:18,545 --> 00:12:19,091
- Summer.

315
00:12:19,091 --> 00:12:19,590
- Summer.

316
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,308
Why is it summer in the
northern hemisphere?

317
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:23,108
- Because it's closer to the sun.

318
00:12:23,108 --> 00:12:24,443
- Closer to the sun?

319
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,927
- And it's like, kind of like--

320
00:12:26,927 --> 00:12:30,143
- Are we like a few hundred
or thousand miles away

321
00:12:30,143 --> 00:12:31,443
from the sun?

322
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:35,134
A few hundred or a few thousand?

323
00:12:35,134 --> 00:12:36,574
Or like a few million?

324
00:12:36,574 --> 00:12:37,340
- Yeah.

325
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,002
Okay.

326
00:12:38,002 --> 00:12:40,660
So, in the scope of that,
it's hard to picture,

327
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,562
do you think that the
distance between this spot

328
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:47,614
and this spot is that much
compared to the sunlight

329
00:12:47,614 --> 00:12:48,717
coming over?

330
00:12:48,717 --> 00:12:49,204
- Yeah.

331
00:12:49,204 --> 00:12:50,261
- To make it that different?

332
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,625
Okay.

333
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,304
So, you think it's more the tilt.

334
00:12:55,304 --> 00:12:56,000
- Exactly.

335
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,993
- Okay.

336
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:03,113
I'm not sure in your past science classes,

337
00:13:03,113 --> 00:13:07,420
what is it about heat
energy and light energy

338
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,437
pointed on something that
makes something warmer

339
00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:12,847
or colder?

340
00:13:13,677 --> 00:13:15,043
Anybody have an idea?

341
00:13:15,043 --> 00:13:17,202
- Depending on how direct it is

342
00:13:17,202 --> 00:13:21,393
because what I was thinking
is like if this is the sun

343
00:13:21,393 --> 00:13:23,727
and, can I come up?

344
00:13:23,727 --> 00:13:24,887
- Come show us.

345
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:29,009
- So, if my pencil's the heat and the light

346
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:32,500
it would be coming from here
and it would be coming

347
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,364
and it would hit with him, this one more.

348
00:13:35,364 --> 00:13:36,002
- Right.

349
00:13:36,002 --> 00:13:38,580
- And this one will be direct.

350
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,300
- Okay.

351
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,119
- So, I think what he's saying
is that both the northern

352
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:46,613
and southern hemisphere are
still getting sun, aren't they?

353
00:13:46,613 --> 00:13:47,438
- Yes.

354
00:13:47,438 --> 00:13:50,479
- Because we're so far away that the only,

355
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:52,220
which side of the Earth is not getting sun

356
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,312
right this minute?

357
00:13:53,312 --> 00:13:53,961
- This side.

358
00:13:53,961 --> 00:13:56,399
- When it's rotating it's night time.

359
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,534
But during the day is it
still pretty much light

360
00:13:59,534 --> 00:14:02,193
in the northern and southern hemisphere?

361
00:14:02,193 --> 00:14:02,831
- Yeah.

362
00:14:02,831 --> 00:14:03,214
- Yeah.

363
00:14:03,214 --> 00:14:05,675
So, what he's saying is
that it's more direct

364
00:14:05,675 --> 00:14:09,855
to the hemisphere that's
tilted, right, toward the sun.

365
00:14:09,855 --> 00:14:12,803
It's still getting sun and
somebody over here said

366
00:14:12,803 --> 00:14:15,678
something about the equator,
the places on the equator.

367
00:14:15,678 --> 00:14:16,688
- Those over there.

368
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:18,046
- Who said that?

369
00:14:18,046 --> 00:14:19,706
Say that again.

370
00:14:19,706 --> 00:14:22,841
- Like states or, I'm not sure--

371
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:24,664
- Any locations, right?

372
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:26,440
- So like for Texas, as an example,

373
00:14:27,864 --> 00:14:29,768
I'm not sure if it's
exactly on the equator,

374
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,765
but I know it's really
close to the equator.

375
00:14:31,765 --> 00:14:32,948
- Okay.

376
00:14:32,948 --> 00:14:33,843
Closer than we are.

377
00:14:33,843 --> 00:14:34,505
- Yeah.

378
00:14:34,505 --> 00:14:35,642
(laughter)

379
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:36,635
- Okay.

380
00:14:38,487 --> 00:14:40,866
- I just read somewhere
that it doesn't have

381
00:14:40,866 --> 00:14:43,026
all of the seasons.

382
00:14:43,026 --> 00:14:43,652
- Okay.

383
00:14:43,652 --> 00:14:44,229
- Yeah.

384
00:14:44,229 --> 00:14:45,889
- Somebody else said I think
as much difference

385
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:46,637
or variation.

386
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:47,716
- Yeah.

387
00:14:47,716 --> 00:14:48,657
- Okay.

388
00:14:48,657 --> 00:14:51,555
So, this is summer in
the northern hemisphere.

389
00:14:51,555 --> 00:14:54,120
Now we're going to cut across our orbit

390
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,863
and save time,
go back over to that side

391
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:00,568
and what season was that again?

392
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:01,373
- Winter.

393
00:15:01,373 --> 00:15:03,149
- What season was that again?

394
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:05,722
What season is it now in
the northern hemisphere?

395
00:15:05,722 --> 00:15:06,906
Winter, okay.

396
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:11,754
So, which hemisphere is getting
more direct sunlight now?

397
00:15:12,943 --> 00:15:14,638
The southern hemisphere.

398
00:15:14,638 --> 00:15:17,247
And what season is it now
in the southern hemisphere?

399
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,256
- Summer.

400
00:15:18,256 --> 00:15:19,855
- Summer, okay.

401
00:15:19,855 --> 00:15:21,322
Alright.

402
00:15:21,322 --> 00:15:23,446
- Because the heat's having to go around--

403
00:15:23,446 --> 00:15:24,178
- Okay.

404
00:15:24,178 --> 00:15:27,300
So, let's go back for a second.

405
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,172
Raul's group said it's because

406
00:15:30,172 --> 00:15:33,132
the tilt doesn't change,

407
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,315
but the tilt, as you're going around,

408
00:15:35,315 --> 00:15:38,473
changes the angle of the sunlight

409
00:15:38,473 --> 00:15:41,874
that's hitting the Earth, okay?

410
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,337
That's Raul's group.

411
00:15:43,337 --> 00:15:44,498
You guys still agree with that?

412
00:15:44,498 --> 00:15:44,997
- Yeah.

413
00:15:44,997 --> 00:15:45,659
- Okay.

414
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:49,675
And Susan's group said it's
because the northern hemisphere

415
00:15:49,675 --> 00:15:53,971
is closer to the sun in the
summer than it is in the winter.

416
00:15:53,971 --> 00:15:55,805
Anybody want to move groups now?

417
00:15:55,805 --> 00:15:56,385
- Wait.

418
00:15:56,385 --> 00:15:58,498
Does that mean more direct or--

419
00:15:58,498 --> 00:15:59,496
- Well--

420
00:15:59,496 --> 00:16:01,110
- Or literally closer?

421
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,390
- Literally closer.

422
00:16:04,601 --> 00:16:05,576
Okay.

423
00:16:05,576 --> 00:16:07,127
Anybody want to move groups?

424
00:16:10,115 --> 00:16:12,344
(laughter)

425
00:16:12,344 --> 00:16:13,314
Okay.

426
00:16:18,741 --> 00:16:20,872
That's okay.  You don't have to change, alright?

427
00:16:20,872 --> 00:16:24,491
And this group (mumbles) with Fernando

428
00:16:24,491 --> 00:16:27,938
that is because the Earth
orbits closer to the sun

429
00:16:27,938 --> 00:16:30,376
in the summer than in the winter.

430
00:16:30,376 --> 00:16:31,015
Alright.

431
00:16:31,015 --> 00:16:33,116
I'm going to show you something

432
00:16:33,116 --> 00:16:36,677
and I'm going to see if it
changes your mind, okay?

433
00:16:36,677 --> 00:16:38,802
- Do we get to eat the apples afterwards?

434
00:16:38,802 --> 00:16:40,066
(laughter)

435
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:42,791
- Well, we'll see, okay?

436
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:43,854
Alright.

437
00:16:47,852 --> 00:16:48,747
Okay.

438
00:16:48,747 --> 00:16:50,650
So, take a look up here.

439
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,788
Alright.

440
00:16:51,788 --> 00:16:54,006
This is a simulation.

441
00:16:54,006 --> 00:16:55,364
What do I mean by a simulation?

442
00:16:55,364 --> 00:16:56,827
You can come back and
sit down with your group.

443
00:16:56,827 --> 00:16:58,199
What do I mean by a simulation?

444
00:17:01,123 --> 00:17:03,642
- It's a photo or a
video of what actually--

445
00:17:03,642 --> 00:17:04,339
- Right.

446
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:09,339
It's not out in the universe
looking back at our Earth.

447
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:10,862
It's not from the space station

448
00:17:10,862 --> 00:17:13,196
or anything like that, okay?

449
00:17:13,196 --> 00:17:14,630
So take a look.

450
00:17:15,762 --> 00:17:16,934
Alright.

451
00:17:16,934 --> 00:17:20,226
And look at what's
happening with the axis.

452
00:17:21,981 --> 00:17:23,614
It's a little bit hard
to see on the screen.

453
00:17:23,614 --> 00:17:24,855
Okay.

454
00:17:24,855 --> 00:17:27,386
Did you notice how like
what we tried to do,

455
00:17:27,386 --> 00:17:29,607
It stayed pointing the
same direction, right?

456
00:17:30,982 --> 00:17:32,259
Let's do it one more time.

457
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,552
Okay, alright.

458
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:44,460
Okay.

459
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,624
Now does this look kind of like what

460
00:17:48,624 --> 00:17:50,562
he drew on the board at the beginning?

461
00:17:50,562 --> 00:17:52,106
Does it look like an ellipse?

462
00:17:52,106 --> 00:17:52,826
- Yeah.

463
00:17:52,826 --> 00:17:53,883
- Or an oval?

464
00:17:53,883 --> 00:17:54,483
- Yeah.

465
00:17:54,483 --> 00:17:55,638
- Okay.

466
00:17:57,049 --> 00:18:00,074
So, I wish I had a glass, a clear glass.

467
00:18:00,074 --> 00:18:01,374
- We do right over there.

468
00:18:01,374 --> 00:18:03,173
- We have a clear glass?

469
00:18:03,173 --> 00:18:03,673
- That's alright.

470
00:18:03,673 --> 00:18:04,752
We can use this.

471
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:05,039
Okay.

472
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,583
- There is one over there.

473
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:07,419
- We can use this.

474
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,139
Okay.

475
00:18:08,139 --> 00:18:10,556
I want you, and you're looking at this,

476
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,642
kind of from the side.

477
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:18,160
Does it look like that?

478
00:18:19,964 --> 00:18:22,112
When you're looking at the rim of this cup

479
00:18:22,112 --> 00:18:26,326
or the rim of this glass
from the, sort of the side

480
00:18:26,326 --> 00:18:28,427
does it look like an oval?

481
00:18:28,427 --> 00:18:29,553
- Yes.

482
00:18:29,553 --> 00:18:30,169
- Yeah.

483
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:30,493
- Okay.

484
00:18:30,493 --> 00:18:31,550
Let me make sure you can see that.

485
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,152
It does, doesn't it?

486
00:18:33,152 --> 00:18:35,531
When you're looking at it from that angle.

487
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,807
But look at it straight down now.

488
00:18:37,807 --> 00:18:38,770
What does it look like?

489
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:39,432
- A circle.

490
00:18:39,432 --> 00:18:41,545
- It looks like a perfect circle.

491
00:18:41,545 --> 00:18:43,502
Let's let a couple people experience that.

492
00:18:43,502 --> 00:18:47,136
Look at it from the side,

493
00:18:47,136 --> 00:18:49,296
now look at it straight down.

494
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,164
- With this one you're almost looking,

495
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:52,604
you're looking like right here.

496
00:18:52,604 --> 00:18:52,964
- Okay.

497
00:18:52,964 --> 00:18:54,357
- So, the glass it was right there--

498
00:18:54,357 --> 00:18:56,350
- I want you guys to try it too, okay?

499
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,604
Alright.

500
00:18:57,604 --> 00:18:58,347
It might.

501
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:00,727
But what I want you to think about here

502
00:19:00,727 --> 00:19:04,001
is this is sort of what
you guys probably saw

503
00:19:04,001 --> 00:19:05,689
in your fifth grade science books,

504
00:19:05,689 --> 00:19:08,718
maybe even in your middle
school science books.

505
00:19:08,718 --> 00:19:11,140
We'll have to take a look at
the pictures in our books.

506
00:19:12,515 --> 00:19:16,496
You know, publishers, the
people who print the books,

507
00:19:17,696 --> 00:19:22,429
they don't always do things
the right way for us to work.

508
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:25,017
And do you know that there are many,

509
00:19:25,017 --> 00:19:29,278
hundreds and thousands of
adults, maybe millions of adults,

510
00:19:29,278 --> 00:19:32,854
who think that the orbit of
the Earth looks like this

511
00:19:32,854 --> 00:19:35,698
because this is what they
saw in their science books

512
00:19:35,698 --> 00:19:38,229
when they were kids growing up.

513
00:19:38,229 --> 00:19:42,646
But just like the glass, what happens?

514
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,912
I'm going to do it again, but
I'm going to flip it over.

515
00:19:46,912 --> 00:19:48,607
We're looking at it from up above.

516
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,239
So, look what's happening now.

517
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:52,714
- It's a circle.

518
00:19:52,714 --> 00:19:54,211
- Yeah.

519
00:19:54,211 --> 00:19:57,717
And did you know that the Earth's orbit,

520
00:19:57,717 --> 00:20:01,671
it is slightly an oval, but

521
00:20:01,671 --> 00:20:05,092
so slightly that it's
really close to a perfect--
