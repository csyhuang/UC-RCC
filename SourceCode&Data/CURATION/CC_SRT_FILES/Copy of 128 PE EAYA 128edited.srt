1
00:00:00,558 --> 00:00:03,431
- What are some other
indicators that tell us,

2
00:00:03,431 --> 00:00:05,670
"I'm in my target heart rate range?"

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,238
Yes.

4
00:00:06,238 --> 00:00:08,164
- [female student] By the
categories on your RPE chart.

5
00:00:08,164 --> 00:00:10,038
- Okay, your RPE Chart,
you could use that.

6
00:00:10,038 --> 00:00:11,037
That's exactly right.

7
00:00:11,037 --> 00:00:12,277
How about within your body?

8
00:00:12,277 --> 00:00:15,118
What's something that
your body can tell you

9
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:16,757
that you're in that target heart rate range?

10
00:00:16,757 --> 00:00:17,517
Yes young lady.

11
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:18,997
- [female student] Um, the way you breath

12
00:00:18,997 --> 00:00:19,957
and how you're feeling.

13
00:00:19,957 --> 00:00:22,398
- Okay good, your breathing, your feeling,

14
00:00:22,398 --> 00:00:24,397
some of you want to come
in here and work out

15
00:00:24,397 --> 00:00:27,078
and then talk about how that
your legs startin' to hurt

16
00:00:27,078 --> 00:00:29,310
and your thighs are startin' to be sore.

17
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,277
All those things are physical ways

18
00:00:31,277 --> 00:00:33,757
that your body's sayin',
"Hey, I'm doin' a good job

19
00:00:33,757 --> 00:00:36,639
"in this workout, I'm within
my target heart rate range."

20
00:00:36,639 --> 00:00:39,278
When we do this today,
I want you to kind of

21
00:00:39,278 --> 00:00:41,157
take a mental picture.

22
00:00:41,157 --> 00:00:45,079
Let, take a mental picture
of, "This is how my body feels

23
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:47,680
"when I'm in my target heart rate range."

24
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,957
Whether your lower end or higher end,

25
00:00:49,957 --> 00:00:51,957
take a mental picture
so that when you're out

26
00:00:51,957 --> 00:00:55,518
walking or, not walking,
but when you're out running

27
00:00:55,518 --> 00:00:59,118
or playing soccer or playing
basketball or things like that,

28
00:00:59,118 --> 00:01:02,798
you can kind of have an idea
how you're feelin' with those,

29
00:01:02,798 --> 00:01:03,558
with those things,

30
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:05,117
and you can know whether you're close

31
00:01:05,117 --> 00:01:07,117
to being in your target heart rate range.

32
00:01:07,117 --> 00:01:08,349
Now, one of the last things is,

33
00:01:08,349 --> 00:01:10,875
is we filled out that
family health history

34
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:12,278
that each of you has there

35
00:01:12,278 --> 00:01:14,877
and some of you had some different things

36
00:01:14,877 --> 00:01:16,518
on that health history,
from heart disease,

37
00:01:16,518 --> 00:01:19,438
to high blood pressure,
those types of things.

38
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:21,758
The cardio workout that we're doin' today,

39
00:01:21,758 --> 00:01:25,237
what areas is that gonna positively impact

40
00:01:25,237 --> 00:01:27,398
on that family health history for you?

41
00:01:27,398 --> 00:01:28,717
Who knows that?

42
00:01:28,717 --> 00:01:30,477
What are some of those areas?

43
00:01:30,477 --> 00:01:32,149
Okay, Let's get you there Amy.

44
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:33,918
- [Amy] It'll help prevent heart disease,

45
00:01:33,918 --> 00:01:35,957
high blood pressure and diabetes.

46
00:01:35,957 --> 00:01:39,080
- Okay, the heart disease,
that's exactly right.

47
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,931
Good cardio, high blood pressure,

48
00:01:40,931 --> 00:01:42,997
it's gonna bring the blood pressure down.

49
00:01:42,997 --> 00:01:45,277
Also, diabetes.

50
00:01:45,277 --> 00:01:47,877
Along with high blood pressure,
you got high cholesterol.

51
00:01:47,877 --> 00:01:50,238
All of those areas,
cardio, is going to

52
00:01:50,238 --> 00:01:53,118
positively impact those areas.

53
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:54,438
Okay?

54
00:01:54,438 --> 00:01:55,397
The, yes?

55
00:01:55,397 --> 00:01:57,277
- [female student] What
do I need to lose weight?

56
00:01:57,277 --> 00:01:58,390
- Okay, to lose weight.

57
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,198
That's a question I get a lot of time.

58
00:02:00,198 --> 00:02:02,477
If you want to lose weight,

59
00:02:02,477 --> 00:02:06,757
ideally, you want to be in the upper end

60
00:02:06,757 --> 00:02:08,438
of your target heart rate range,

61
00:02:08,438 --> 00:02:10,758
or about 80%, however,

62
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:14,557
you do actually at about
60%, at your lower end,

63
00:02:14,557 --> 00:02:18,837
you do burn more cal, fat
calories at about 60%,

64
00:02:18,837 --> 00:02:22,317
but you're gonna burn more calories at 80%

65
00:02:22,317 --> 00:02:25,653
because it's a more intense workout, okay?

66
00:02:25,653 --> 00:02:28,317
So really, ideally,
you'd want to be within

67
00:02:28,317 --> 00:02:30,789
your target heart rate range.

68
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:34,114
Typically, up towards the higher
end will be a little better

69
00:02:34,114 --> 00:02:35,638
because, if you're gonna be able

70
00:02:35,638 --> 00:02:37,949
to burn a few more calories
than at the lower end.

71
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:38,598
Okay?

72
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:40,558
Any other questions on anything?

73
00:02:40,558 --> 00:02:42,070
All right, we're gonna get started here.

74
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,399
You've already got your
target heart rates, there.

75
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:47,117
I want you to look here,

76
00:02:47,117 --> 00:02:51,798
and I want you to send that
text to this poll everywhere

77
00:02:51,798 --> 00:02:58,157
to where your target heart rate zone is.

78
00:02:58,157 --> 00:03:00,998
What is your zone?

79
00:03:00,998 --> 00:03:02,077
And we'll notice this,

80
00:03:02,077 --> 00:03:04,478
most of you, you know,
we've all figured it out.

81
00:03:04,478 --> 00:03:06,277
You'll notice percentage wise

82
00:03:06,277 --> 00:03:08,758
where most of you are gonna stand,

83
00:03:08,758 --> 00:03:11,277
or where most of you are
gonna be in the chart.

84
00:03:11,277 --> 00:03:12,878
We start all the way down at 100,

85
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:15,837
go all the way up to above 176.

86
00:03:15,837 --> 00:03:18,837
You'll start to see, that,

87
00:03:18,837 --> 00:03:22,677
that most likely that 151
to 175, that's gonna be

88
00:03:22,677 --> 00:03:26,517
our biggest area here that
we're gonna fall into.

89
00:03:26,517 --> 00:03:28,557
You can see right there, we're at 75%,

90
00:03:28,557 --> 00:03:33,438
83%, within that area,
17% at 176 or higher.

91
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:37,237
So most of you in here, where's
our target heart rate range?

92
00:03:37,237 --> 00:03:38,077
In between?

93
00:03:38,077 --> 00:03:39,029
- [female student] Between 151 and 175.

94
00:03:39,029 --> 00:03:40,918
- There you go, between 151 and 175.

95
00:03:40,918 --> 00:03:42,469
That is right on the money

96
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:46,357
for young adults your age.

97
00:03:46,357 --> 00:03:50,118
If you're at that 176 or
higher, that's not a problem,

98
00:03:50,118 --> 00:03:53,238
but that is an area where, you know,

99
00:03:53,238 --> 00:03:56,393
anything over about 185 or so,

100
00:03:56,393 --> 00:03:58,837
then it just means that
you've got to bring your

101
00:03:58,837 --> 00:04:01,998
heart rate up a little bit
higher compared to most people.

102
00:04:01,998 --> 00:04:03,597
So most people though, again,

103
00:04:03,597 --> 00:04:05,637
are gonna be in that 151 to 175.

104
00:04:05,637 --> 00:04:06,630
That's a good job.

105
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,477
Okay, go ahead and go
to your machines here.

106
00:04:09,477 --> 00:04:11,759
Lay your clip boards off to the side.

107
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:14,677
If you want to listen to
your ipod or to your music,

108
00:04:14,677 --> 00:04:16,877
you can, only one ear phone though,

109
00:04:16,877 --> 00:04:18,398
only one ear piece.

110
00:04:18,398 --> 00:04:20,798
Make sure you put your cell phones up

111
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,550
in the cubby there, we'll do something

112
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,917
with those a little bit later.

113
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:27,238
And where we're gonna start with here

114
00:04:27,238 --> 00:04:28,518
is we're gonna start together.

115
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,471
We're gonna start with
a two minute workout.

116
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:33,358
On this workout, two minute warm-up.

117
00:04:33,358 --> 00:04:35,597
All we're gonna do is get warmed up.

118
00:04:35,597 --> 00:04:40,277
You need to be out on the bike,
somewhere around 40 rpms.

119
00:04:40,277 --> 00:04:44,149
Ellipticals, about the
same thing, 35 to 40 rpms.

120
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:46,597
On the treadmills, around
three speed will be a good,

121
00:04:46,597 --> 00:04:48,277
good place to start with.

122
00:04:48,277 --> 00:04:50,317
Is everybody good, we ready to go?

123
00:04:50,317 --> 00:04:50,878
- (several students in unison) Yes.

124
00:04:50,878 --> 00:04:51,517
Are we good back there?

125
00:04:51,517 --> 00:04:52,398
You all set?

126
00:04:52,398 --> 00:04:53,837
Okay, all right, here we go.

127
00:04:53,837 --> 00:04:55,478
Startin' on two minutes.

128
00:04:55,478 --> 00:04:59,117
And start.

129
00:04:59,117 --> 00:05:01,997
All right so make sure that
we got those magnets on there.

130
00:05:01,997 --> 00:05:04,198
Bump that up to about three or so.

131
00:05:04,198 --> 00:05:06,958
Just to get warmed up.

132
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:11,487
(talking too low to be
heard over treadmills)

133
00:05:17,437 --> 00:05:20,997
This is just gonna get your
heart rate up a little bit.

134
00:05:20,997 --> 00:05:22,758
Now at the end of this warm up,

135
00:05:22,758 --> 00:05:25,549
we're gonna check where
your heart rate is,

136
00:05:25,549 --> 00:05:26,997
we're gonna check that

137
00:05:26,997 --> 00:05:29,517
and you'll notice it will
be a little bit elevated

138
00:05:29,517 --> 00:05:32,758
compared to, compared to, you know,

139
00:05:32,758 --> 00:05:35,117
what it was for a resting heart rate.

140
00:05:35,117 --> 00:05:37,318
You most likely will not be though,

141
00:05:37,318 --> 00:05:39,159
in your target heart rate zone,

142
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:42,117
right here after this warm up.

143
00:05:42,117 --> 00:06:01,558
(exercise equipment humming)

144
00:06:01,558 --> 00:06:02,838
About halfway through.

145
00:06:02,838 --> 00:06:05,078
Good job.

146
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:06,678
Anytime you work folks,

147
00:06:06,678 --> 00:06:08,437
you should always do a warm up.

148
00:06:08,437 --> 00:06:10,717
Now we've already stretched

149
00:06:10,717 --> 00:06:12,398
and done some, a little bit of jogging

150
00:06:12,398 --> 00:06:14,717
down there in the gym
before we came up here.

151
00:06:14,717 --> 00:06:15,918
So you've got some warm up

152
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:17,998
but anytime you go to a fitness room,

153
00:06:17,998 --> 00:06:20,237
you want to make sure that you
do a little bit of warm up.

154
00:06:20,237 --> 00:06:22,478
Don't jump right in to it.

155
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:25,198
You're gonna have a tendency
to pull some muscles

156
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:41,437
and have a lot more soreness
and injury risk, for you.

157
00:06:41,437 --> 00:06:43,030
Good job, everybody doin' good?

158
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:43,877
- (several students in unison) Yes.

159
00:06:43,877 --> 00:06:45,557
- As we do this, I'm gonna come along

160
00:06:45,557 --> 00:06:49,318
and ask you where you are on
your RPE chart periodically,

161
00:06:49,318 --> 00:06:51,877
'Cause I want to know
how your body's feeling.

162
00:06:51,877 --> 00:06:55,037
Just kind of look at that
and gauge where ever you are.

163
00:06:55,037 --> 00:06:55,637
Okay?

164
00:06:55,637 --> 00:06:58,557
Let's go ahead and get a
heart rate check, here.

165
00:06:58,557 --> 00:07:00,279
Real quick, put your hands on the sensors,

166
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:03,838
let's get that heart rate checked.

167
00:07:03,838 --> 00:07:06,318
As soon as you get that heart rate check,

168
00:07:06,318 --> 00:07:09,357
go ahead and stop your machine, hop off

169
00:07:09,357 --> 00:07:11,749
and we're gonna record
that under heart rate one,

170
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:17,638
real quick, under the warm up.

171
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:19,598
Okay, stop your machine there.

172
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,757
Record that heart rate.

173
00:07:23,757 --> 00:07:24,837
[teacher] As soon as we get this,

174
00:07:24,837 --> 00:07:26,550
go ahead lay those back off to the side,

175
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,718
we're gonna hop back over here

176
00:07:28,718 --> 00:07:32,357
and we're gonna start
goin' through the workout.

177
00:07:32,357 --> 00:07:35,318
Now the workout's gonna be 10 minutes.

178
00:07:35,318 --> 00:07:40,487
Again, bikes, you outta be
pumpin' out about 80 to 85,

179
00:07:40,487 --> 00:07:41,910
of your RPMs there.

180
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:46,350
Ellipticals, probably
somewhere between 70 and 75.

181
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,437
We really want to try to push this

182
00:07:47,437 --> 00:07:48,670
so at the five minute mark

183
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:51,478
you're within that target heart rate zone.

184
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:55,038
Anybody right now in their
target heart rate zone?

185
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:56,117
- (several students in unison) No.

186
00:07:56,117 --> 00:07:56,678
- No?

187
00:07:56,678 --> 00:07:59,078
A little bit elevated
from the resting though?

188
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:00,077
- (several students in unison) Yes.

189
00:08:00,077 --> 00:08:01,078
- Okay, all right.

190
00:08:01,078 --> 00:08:04,798
Let's go ahead and start.

191
00:08:04,798 --> 00:08:07,198
(exercise machines beeping and humming)

192
00:08:07,198 --> 00:08:08,278
At the five minute mark,

193
00:08:08,278 --> 00:08:09,838
we will check it again

194
00:08:09,838 --> 00:08:11,437
and we will check that heart rate,

195
00:08:11,437 --> 00:08:13,311
what your heart rate is.

196
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,597
We won't get off the machines again

197
00:08:14,597 --> 00:08:38,077
until the work out's over.

198
00:08:38,077 --> 00:09:02,149
[teacher] Caroline?

199
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:03,437
- [teacher] Now again, on your own,

200
00:09:03,437 --> 00:09:05,677
once we get into this a couple minutes,

201
00:09:05,677 --> 00:09:07,398
on your own, if you want to kind of gauge

202
00:09:07,398 --> 00:09:09,829
where you are and check those sensors,

203
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:12,197
you're more than welcome to do that.

204
00:09:12,197 --> 00:09:14,037
You just don't want to
do it the whole time

205
00:09:14,037 --> 00:09:15,318
you're working out,

206
00:09:15,318 --> 00:09:18,638
and that'll kind of give you
an idea where you're standing.

207
00:09:18,638 --> 00:09:22,349
If you need, if you're
below your lower end

208
00:09:22,349 --> 00:09:24,357
of that target heart rate,

209
00:09:24,357 --> 00:09:27,918
go ahead and bump up the
resistance a little bit,

210
00:09:27,918 --> 00:09:32,357
if that's the case, as we
continue on through this.

211
00:09:32,357 --> 00:09:34,038
- [teacher] Are you all doin' good?

212
00:09:34,038 --> 00:09:37,777
Where are we on the chart?

213
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:38,278
At 3?

214
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,198
That's good.

215
00:09:40,198 --> 00:09:58,277
(talking below sound
of exercise equipment)

216
00:09:58,277 --> 00:10:00,517
You all could do this for an hour, huh?

217
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,117
There you go.

218
00:10:02,117 --> 00:10:07,389
(machines humming)

219
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:08,399
How you doin' over there?

220
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,678
Where are you on your chart?

221
00:10:10,678 --> 00:10:11,552
- Two.

222
00:10:11,552 --> 00:10:13,079
- That's good.

223
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:13,877
- Three.

224
00:10:13,877 --> 00:10:15,118
- Three.

225
00:10:15,118 --> 00:10:16,007
- Two.

226
00:10:16,007 --> 00:10:17,398
- I'd say around two.

227
00:10:17,398 --> 00:10:17,977
- Two.

228
00:10:17,977 --> 00:10:19,237
- Two.

229
00:10:19,237 --> 00:10:20,789
Ladies, how we doin' over here?

230
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:22,078
How you feelin' on your chart?

231
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:23,037
- (several students in unison) Three.

232
00:10:23,037 --> 00:10:23,757
- Three?

233
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:24,597
- Yeah.

234
00:10:24,597 --> 00:10:25,518
- You good, Russell?

235
00:10:25,518 --> 00:10:26,158
- Yeah.

236
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:27,517
- Okay.

237
00:10:27,517 --> 00:10:28,438
Andy, how you feelin?

238
00:10:28,438 --> 00:10:31,177
Where are you, on your chart?

239
00:10:31,177 --> 00:10:31,798
About four?

240
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,758
How do you feel, good?

241
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:36,077
Where are you on your chart?

242
00:10:36,077 --> 00:10:36,997
Doin' good.

243
00:10:36,997 --> 00:10:38,798
Most of you, you're all about a

244
00:10:38,798 --> 00:10:43,037
two, three, four range right now.

245
00:10:43,037 --> 00:10:45,758
Now we're just getting to
the start of the work out,

246
00:10:45,758 --> 00:10:46,798
but here in a few minutes,

247
00:10:46,798 --> 00:10:49,837
that's probably gonna change.

248
00:10:49,837 --> 00:10:53,458
Might be changing right now.

249
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,757
Probably startin' to feel
a little bit of fatigue,

250
00:10:56,757 --> 00:11:01,557
breathing's becoming a
little bit more difficult.

251
00:11:01,557 --> 00:11:10,597
We're gonna do a heart
rate check in two minutes.

252
00:11:10,597 --> 00:11:14,077
Again, remember, I want
you, mental picture

253
00:11:14,077 --> 00:11:17,597
in your mind, "How is my
body feeling when I'm in

254
00:11:17,597 --> 00:11:23,037
"that target heart rate range?"

255
00:11:23,037 --> 00:11:31,277
Doing a good job, good job.

256
00:11:31,277 --> 00:11:56,157
(speaking below level of equipment)

257
00:11:56,157 --> 00:11:57,518
Okay we got one more minute

258
00:11:57,518 --> 00:12:09,557
and we're gonna get a
heart rate check, here.

259
00:12:09,557 --> 00:12:13,437
- [teacher] If you're feelin'
like your in that 4 to 6 range,

260
00:12:13,437 --> 00:12:16,238
you might be able to
go ahead and up your,

261
00:12:16,238 --> 00:12:25,078
up your intensity just a little bit there,

262
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:33,431
up your speed maybe, up your
resistance a little bit.

263
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:35,231
Russell, did you forget to
put your phone on vibrate?

264
00:12:35,231 --> 00:12:36,189
- Yeah.

265
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:36,917
- That's all right, buddy.

266
00:12:36,917 --> 00:12:41,077
Just don't mess with it
while you're on the bike, okay?

267
00:12:41,077 --> 00:12:43,157
I mean while you're on the treadmill.

268
00:12:43,157 --> 00:12:44,348
- Okay.

269
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:46,317
- Okay, hard to do, hard
to do anything with a phone

270
00:12:46,317 --> 00:12:48,038
while you're running.

271
00:12:48,038 --> 00:12:53,559
All right, let's go ahead and
get a heart rate check here.

272
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:55,712
Get a quick check.

273
00:12:55,712 --> 00:12:57,517
Remember what this number is.

274
00:12:57,517 --> 00:13:03,518
This is gonna be heart rate
number two on your chart.

275
00:13:03,518 --> 00:13:05,437
We want to be within that range now.

276
00:13:05,437 --> 00:13:09,118
If you're not, we need
to up your resistance.

277
00:13:09,118 --> 00:13:11,277
If you're at the lower end,

278
00:13:11,277 --> 00:13:13,597
I want to try to get on up towards the higher end,

279
00:13:13,597 --> 00:13:17,167
about that 80% mark.

280
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:20,590
So if that's the case, bump
your speed a little bit,

281
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:23,237
up your resistance if you need to.

282
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:24,357
We're gonna get one more check here

283
00:13:24,357 --> 00:13:27,389
in about four and a half minutes.

284
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:31,798
(speaking below level of machines)

285
00:13:31,798 --> 00:13:33,590
- About 65, I'm in my range.

286
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,189
- Nice, nice.

287
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:49,358
(machines drowning out voices)

288
00:13:49,358 --> 00:13:51,470
Where are you on your RPE chart?

289
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,638
- Uh, about four.

290
00:13:53,638 --> 00:13:54,438
- About four?

291
00:13:54,438 --> 00:13:55,837
Four or five?

292
00:13:55,837 --> 00:14:14,797
(machines drowning out voices)

293
00:14:14,797 --> 00:14:17,517
Hey, anytime, you know if you're saying,

294
00:14:17,517 --> 00:14:20,557
"God, I just can't get
my heart rate up there,"

295
00:14:20,557 --> 00:14:22,197
if you're on the treadmill,

296
00:14:22,197 --> 00:14:25,238
increase that elevation a little bit.

297
00:14:25,238 --> 00:14:29,434
Elliptical, if you
increase the resistance,

298
00:14:29,434 --> 00:14:31,838
then you'll start to feel it.

299
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:33,037
How's Callie back here?

300
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:35,117
She's startin' to get
it right now, aren't ya?

301
00:14:35,117 --> 00:14:42,597
(machines drowning out voices)

302
00:14:42,597 --> 00:14:45,266
How are you all on your chart?

303
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:59,237
Five or six?

304
00:14:59,237 --> 00:15:01,038
Where are you all on your chart?

305
00:15:01,038 --> 00:15:01,829
- [female student] Five.

306
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:02,757
- [teacher] Five?

307
00:15:02,757 --> 00:15:04,398
- [female student] Six.

308
00:15:04,398 --> 00:15:06,295
- [teacher] Where are
you guys on your chart?

309
00:15:06,295 --> 00:15:08,398
- [male student] probably around four.

310
00:15:08,398 --> 00:15:09,718
- Ladies how we doin'?

311
00:15:09,718 --> 00:15:10,477
Where are you on your chart?

312
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:11,677
- [female student] About six.

313
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:12,997
- [teacher] Six?

314
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:13,247
- [female student] Yes.

315
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:14,157
- [teacher] How are you, Russell?

316
00:15:14,157 --> 00:15:15,118
- [Russell] Six, seven.

317
00:15:15,118 --> 00:15:16,349
- How about you?

318
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:17,358
- [female student] Six.

319
00:15:17,358 --> 00:15:19,558
- [teacher] Six?

320
00:15:19,558 --> 00:15:20,237
- [teacher] Dale, where are you?

321
00:15:20,237 --> 00:15:21,797
- [Dale] Three, four.

322
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:23,758
- [teacher] Three, four?

323
00:15:23,758 --> 00:15:24,989
You need to increase your resistance,

324
00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:29,867
I mean your elevation a little bit.

325
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:31,318
How about you?

326
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:32,677
- [male student] Four?

327
00:15:32,677 --> 00:15:34,117
- Four.

328
00:15:34,117 --> 00:15:36,238
- Most of you are comin' up on that chart.

329
00:15:36,238 --> 00:15:53,357
Comin' up!

330
00:15:53,357 --> 00:16:11,389
Okay, we're gettin' ready
to do another check here.

331
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:12,877
Good.

332
00:16:12,877 --> 00:16:21,357
A couple more minutes here.

333
00:16:21,357 --> 00:16:22,597
Everybody doing okay?

334
00:16:22,597 --> 00:16:23,957
- (several students in unison) Yup.

335
00:16:23,957 --> 00:16:24,719
- Are you startin' to feel

336
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:25,838
some of the signs we talked about,

337
00:16:25,838 --> 00:16:27,397
fatigue in the legs?

338
00:16:27,397 --> 00:16:28,317
- (several students in unison) Yes.

339
00:16:28,317 --> 00:16:32,909
- I know it's hard to talk right now.

340
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:40,230
A little more difficult breathing.

341
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,237
- (teacher) Startin'
to feel it a little bit

342
00:16:41,237 --> 00:16:41,997
more now, aren't you?

343
00:16:41,997 --> 00:16:42,998
- (male student) yeah, a little bit.

344
00:16:42,998 --> 00:16:48,717
(machines drowning out teacher talking)

345
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:50,837
- [teacher] How's it going back here?

346
00:16:50,837 --> 00:16:55,598
My legs are like rubber (laughs).

347
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:58,077
So now you know, you just
got increase that resistance

348
00:16:58,077 --> 00:17:03,037
a little bit and keep
it at the same RPMs.

349
00:17:03,037 --> 00:17:10,597
- One mile, Kyle.

350
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:11,917
- [teacher] Okay, in thirty seconds here,

351
00:17:11,917 --> 00:17:14,837
we're gonna get a heart rate check.

352
00:17:14,837 --> 00:17:16,079
Then we're going into the cool down.

353
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:25,958
You really push it right here.

354
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:37,237
You're about to jump off
the elliptical, aren't you?

355
00:17:37,237 --> 00:17:42,752
Good.

356
00:17:42,752 --> 00:17:45,357
Okay, let's get a heart rate check here.

357
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,558
Heart rate check.

358
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:50,717
Grab those sensors.

359
00:17:50,717 --> 00:17:52,917
Remember this number.

360
00:17:52,917 --> 00:17:55,403
When you get this number,

361
00:17:55,403 --> 00:17:56,557
when you've got this,

362
00:17:56,557 --> 00:18:00,717
go ahead and bring your speed on down.

363
00:18:00,717 --> 00:18:05,398
[teacher] We're goin'
into the cool down phase.

364
00:18:05,398 --> 00:18:10,718
Make sure you remember
what that number was.

365
00:18:10,718 --> 00:18:12,478
- [male student] What was your heart rate?

366
00:18:12,478 --> 00:18:13,457
- [male student] Uh, 170.

367
00:18:13,457 --> 00:18:15,447
- [male student] I'm about 169.

368
00:18:15,447 --> 00:18:19,678
(background chatter)

369
00:18:19,678 --> 00:18:24,630
- [teacher] In your cool down phase now.

370
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,678
There you go, good good.

371
00:18:27,678 --> 00:18:32,258
Did we get in there, in
your range, in your range?

372
00:18:32,258 --> 00:18:36,718
Everybody in your range?

373
00:18:36,718 --> 00:18:39,757
65 over your target heart rate?

374
00:18:39,757 --> 00:18:41,909
Great, good job.

375
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:43,641
Did you stay in heart rate range?

376
00:18:43,641 --> 00:18:46,277
Good.

377
00:18:46,277 --> 00:18:48,549
Now did anybody on that RPE chart

378
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:51,998
ever feel like you got up
to about an eight or a nine?

379
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,638
- [several students in unison] Yes.

380
00:18:53,638 --> 00:18:54,358
- [teacher] You did?

381
00:18:54,358 --> 00:18:55,238
- [several students in unison] Yes.

382
00:18:55,238 --> 00:19:05,550
Up there? All right.

383
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,438
Did ya'll get in your range?

384
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:08,469
- [two male students] Yup.

385
00:19:08,469 --> 00:19:09,989
- [teacher] Did you get within your range?

386
00:19:09,989 --> 00:19:10,918
Was ya'll on your upper end

387
00:19:10,918 --> 00:19:12,197
or towards the lower end?

388
00:19:12,197 --> 00:19:12,958
- [male student] Upper end.

389
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,077
- Tried to go up.

390
00:19:15,077 --> 00:19:15,757
How about you guys?

391
00:19:15,757 --> 00:19:17,038
Did you get in your range there?

392
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:17,878
- [male student] Yeah.

393
00:19:17,878 --> 00:19:19,038
- [teacher] Yeah.

394
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:24,317
Now, here in

395
00:19:24,317 --> 00:19:27,077
about 45 more seconds,

396
00:19:27,077 --> 00:19:29,758
we're gonna get our last check here,

397
00:19:29,758 --> 00:19:31,158
on the cool down.

398
00:19:31,158 --> 00:19:34,237
You'll notice how quickly as you do this,

399
00:19:34,237 --> 00:19:37,759
you'll be able to tell a major difference

400
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,358
from the last check that you did

401
00:19:40,358 --> 00:19:43,277
during the workout, and even after this

402
00:19:43,277 --> 00:19:45,718
two minute cool down here,
the difference 

403
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:49,798
between where that heart rate drops to.

404
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:56,807
Are ya'll okay?

405
00:19:56,807 --> 00:20:00,267
Okay, let's go ahead and get
that last heart rate check.
