1
00:00:00,228 --> 00:00:02,507
- Right here.

2
00:00:02,507 --> 00:00:04,508
Okay, so is that gonna tell us

3
00:00:04,508 --> 00:00:07,688
what one of our asymptotes is?

4
00:00:07,688 --> 00:00:08,387
- Yeah.

5
00:00:08,387 --> 00:00:11,108
- Yes, because your asymptote is where

6
00:00:11,108 --> 00:00:13,387
this would be undefined, right?

7
00:00:13,387 --> 00:00:15,347
So, it's gonna be X equals what?

8
00:00:15,347 --> 00:00:18,347
- Positive two?

9
00:00:18,347 --> 00:00:21,007
- Positive, but, okay, if
we put positive two there,

10
00:00:21,007 --> 00:00:22,608
we have two plus two.

11
00:00:22,608 --> 00:00:23,948
- So, it'd be negative two?

12
00:00:23,948 --> 00:00:26,327
- Negative two, that's why
we have an asymptote that

13
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:29,227
X equals negative two, okay?

14
00:00:31,237 --> 00:00:35,227
Now is there another number out here?
- No.

15
00:00:36,267 --> 00:00:40,898
No, so what would that other number be?

16
00:00:42,968 --> 00:00:46,308
See there is one here,
but there's not one here.

17
00:00:46,308 --> 00:00:47,407
- So it'd just be zero.

18
00:00:47,407 --> 00:00:48,777
- So, it'd just be zero.

19
00:00:48,777 --> 00:00:51,547
So, does that tell you what
your other asymptote is?

20
00:00:51,547 --> 00:00:55,497
Y equals zero, 'cause f of x stands for...

21
00:00:55,497 --> 00:00:58,687
that's your y isn't it? Okay.

22
00:00:58,687 --> 00:01:02,687
So, you can tell by looking
at the function itself,

23
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:05,607
what your asymptotes are gonna be.

24
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:08,088
Okay, tell me what this
asymptote's gonna be,

25
00:01:08,088 --> 00:01:10,708
your x, your vertical asymptote.

26
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:13,108
- [Student] Zero?

27
00:01:13,108 --> 00:01:16,127
- [Teacher] Zero, X equals zero,

28
00:01:16,127 --> 00:01:19,407
so you're gonna be drawing
your asymptote right there.

29
00:01:19,407 --> 00:01:22,248
What about your y?

30
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:27,248
Remember how we covered this up, and you
would have y equals what?

31
00:01:27,347 --> 00:01:28,728
- Negative one?

32
00:01:28,728 --> 00:01:30,947
- Negative one, y plus negative one.

33
00:01:30,947 --> 00:01:34,748
So, the function itself tells
you your asymptotes, doesn't it?

34
00:01:37,768 --> 00:01:38,777
Okay, does that help?

35
00:01:38,777 --> 00:01:39,828
- Yeah.

36
00:01:39,828 --> 00:01:41,568
- [Teacher] Okay.

37
00:01:43,088 --> 00:02:07,117
(background chatter)

38
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:11,408
- [Student] All right, so...

39
00:02:11,408 --> 00:02:14,588
- [Student] No, but it's like
that right here though.

40
00:02:14,588 --> 00:02:17,318
- [Student] But see she has negative two.

41
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:18,898
- [Student] Right here.

42
00:02:18,898 --> 00:02:20,988
- [Student] Then how did she get the,

43
00:02:20,988 --> 00:02:24,768
did we write the first one wrong then?

44
00:02:24,768 --> 00:02:26,747
- [Student] 'Cause x equals zero.

45
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:29,468
- [Student] No, because she
got zero and negative two,

46
00:02:29,468 --> 00:02:30,468
and that's what I got.

47
00:02:30,468 --> 00:02:31,367
You wrote it down wrong.

48
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:32,187
- [Student] Where?

49
00:02:32,187 --> 00:02:34,568
- [Student] Right here, 'cause
zero is supposed to be on top.

50
00:02:34,568 --> 00:02:37,013
Oh, so, no, never mind, you got it right.

51
00:02:37,013 --> 00:02:39,953
- [Student] It's the same. I
just switched these around.

52
00:02:39,953 --> 00:02:43,593
No, but you're right because
you know how x is vertical,

53
00:02:44,073 --> 00:02:47,623
okay, so, for this one it's going to be,

54
00:02:49,683 --> 00:02:52,113
the x is going to be negative 2, right?

55
00:02:52,113 --> 00:02:53,113
- Mm-hmm.

56
00:02:53,113 --> 00:02:54,792
- Okay I got it.

57
00:02:55,612 --> 00:02:58,102
- [Student] So wait, the
asymptote isn't the same thing

58
00:02:58,102 --> 00:02:59,725
as the parent function, right?

59
00:02:59,725 --> 00:03:09,294
- No.

60
00:03:11,745 --> 00:03:14,875
- Did you have the graph? Did it turn out?

61
00:03:17,805 --> 00:03:20,746
- And how do you know, up here?

62
00:03:20,746 --> 00:03:22,344
- Check this thing out.

63
00:03:22,344 --> 00:03:23,303
- Huh?

64
00:03:26,742 --> 00:03:28,522
- [Student] So, what would
the parent function be?

65
00:03:28,522 --> 00:03:31,372
- That's what I was trying
to work out for you.

66
00:03:31,382 --> 00:03:34,209
- [Student] Did you find the parent function?

67
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:35,169
- For what?

68
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:38,550
- It's not x squared, is it?

69
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,809
- One over x.

70
00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:41,879
- [Student] All of them is
going to be one over x.

71
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,570
- 'Cause you can't just put x.

72
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,430
She said put a one divided by x.

73
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:49,930
That'd be the parent function.
- [Student] All right.

74
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,910
- How do you know which
is the parent function?

75
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,290
- It's the one that's consistent.

76
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,240
- That first one that you put.

77
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,239
- It's the one that's exactly in between

78
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,270
the first and third quadrant.

79
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:15,390
This is your parent function.
This is your parent function.

80
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:18,020
- This one and this one, right?

81
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,630
So blue right there and right there.

82
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,800
- But you totally ruined it.

83
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:21,990
- Yeah.

84
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,640
- Yeah, the colors I
used are kind of weird.

85
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:28,920
- Do you have a red?

86
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,740
Are you using it?

87
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,559
- This is the graph, right?

88
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:47,850
So, if it's the first one
and the third one, right?

89
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,330
- Hey wait, that first thingy comes out at

90
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,450
negative three, not negative two.

91
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,777
- Hm?

92
00:04:55,777 --> 00:04:58,016
- [Student] This first little line
right here comes out

93
00:04:58,016 --> 00:05:00,116
negative three, not negative two.

94
00:05:00,116 --> 00:05:01,657
Is the parent function still,

95
00:05:01,657 --> 00:05:04,306
I mean, is the asymptote
still negative two?

96
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,167
- I think

97
00:05:13,197 --> 00:05:21,187
- [Student] (gasps)

98
00:05:23,176 --> 00:05:27,307
- So, how is one negative two?

99
00:05:27,436 --> 00:05:31,697
- [Student] You gotta switch it,
because the one x plus two

100
00:05:34,797 --> 00:05:38,357
when you use the calculator
you go into a negative, so

101
00:05:38,357 --> 00:05:41,959
the y would be zero because

102
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,049
it's not going to negative.

103
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,349
- How would the y be
zero, the y is a negative?

104
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:59,125
- You got em' switched, all
you gotta do is switch em'.

105
00:06:01,526 --> 00:06:03,836
- I'm not understanding.

106
00:06:04,426 --> 00:06:05,316
She busy.

107
00:06:06,626 --> 00:06:07,416
- Okay.

108
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:08,905
Oh, I know why.

109
00:06:08,905 --> 00:06:11,295
It's because we don't
have no y in the equation.

110
00:06:11,295 --> 00:06:16,226
Like this one, it'd have a y.
The y would be negative one.

111
00:06:16,226 --> 00:06:18,266
And on this one, we don't have it,

112
00:06:18,266 --> 00:06:21,646
so, automatically the y would be zero

113
00:06:21,646 --> 00:06:24,416
and the x would be negative two.

114
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,292
- That makes more sense.

115
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:27,572
- [Student] All right you got it.

116
00:06:27,572 --> 00:06:29,622
- Yeah I had to think about that.

117
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:30,772
- (laughter)

118
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:33,802
- [Student] So, that's how you do it.

119
00:06:33,802 --> 00:06:37,250
- So, then the asymptote is the...
(inaudible) right here?

120
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:43,200
- [Student] Uh-huh.

121
00:06:45,652 --> 00:06:47,982
- Which one?

122
00:06:50,712 --> 00:06:58,272
- So, then the translation is the down one.

123
00:07:00,162 --> 00:07:01,342
- Wait, what?

124
00:07:01,342 --> 00:07:17,211
- The translation is the down one.

125
00:07:19,902 --> 00:07:23,672
- So, what is this down?

126
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:32,430
- [Student] Let me plug it in.
Divide by x parentheses...

127
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,310
One over, divided by x minus one.

128
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,010
- Okay, so we don't need no parenthesis?

129
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:39,929
- [Student] No.

130
00:07:39,929 --> 00:07:57,720
- [Student] I'm almost done.

131
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:04,280
- You're crossing it, that's
the y, yeah. But that's the x.

132
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:06,910
This is x and this is y.

133
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,109
- Yes.

134
00:08:08,109 --> 00:08:12,149
- [Student] Well, look on the
sheet. It will show you that, um...

135
00:08:13,049 --> 00:08:17,590
- I basically used this one as an example.

136
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:21,490
It's like the same type of
format that the problem is.

137
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,230
- Okay.

138
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,790
- Okay, yeah that makes sense.

139
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,530
- So, the asymptote is zero.

140
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:32,060
- It says h equals x .

141
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,510
- Yeah.

142
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,690
- Yeah, so zero,

143
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,590
yeah wait... Yeah.

144
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:51,486
- [Student] This is the graph you start with?

145
00:08:53,396 --> 00:08:55,415
- Yeah, that makes more sense

146
00:08:55,415 --> 00:09:13,226
'cause that's how the graph is.

147
00:09:15,946 --> 00:09:18,576
Okay, we got the asymptote.

148
00:09:18,595 --> 00:09:22,136
X equals, is it zero?

149
00:09:22,136 --> 00:09:25,085
Yeah, and then y equals negative one.

150
00:09:27,135 --> 00:09:43,846
And the translation is one unit down.

151
00:09:45,755 --> 00:09:47,106
Do you have a value?

152
00:09:47,115 --> 00:10:00,846
- Yeah.

153
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:25,305
- Uh-oh.

154
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,635
- So, it'd be three units down.

155
00:10:32,075 --> 00:10:36,316
We would put this on negative
three cause that's y.

156
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,035
So, since it's y, we
would have to put it on

157
00:10:42,035 --> 00:10:43,575
negative three and zero.

158
00:10:43,575 --> 00:10:44,335
- Right?

159
00:10:44,575 --> 00:10:45,726
- [Student] 'Cause it's the same as this.

160
00:10:45,726 --> 00:11:28,036
- Yeah.

161
00:11:29,076 --> 00:11:31,236
- And then y equals negative three.

162
00:11:31,236 --> 00:11:34,845
- Yeah, x equals zero and
y equals negative three.

163
00:11:34,845 --> 00:11:43,925
Translation, three units down.

164
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:49,210
- Wherever the lines,
like, go the furthest

165
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,279
but don't touch.

166
00:11:52,268 --> 00:12:14,338
- Okay.

167
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:18,288
- Oh, you're just marking
down the asymptotes?

168
00:12:18,288 --> 00:12:20,728
- Yeah. She said she forgot, yeah,

169
00:12:20,728 --> 00:12:23,489
so I guess you can just
put up there yellow.

170
00:12:25,968 --> 00:12:28,175
- Okay. Are you on number four?

171
00:12:28,175 --> 00:12:32,176
- Yes.

172
00:12:34,826 --> 00:12:39,176
- So, on number four it would
be five units to the left.

173
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:41,185
- Number four, yeah, yeah, you're good.

174
00:12:41,185 --> 00:13:00,065
- Okay.

175
00:13:02,396 --> 00:13:04,575
- She just told me, she just told,

176
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,865
- I just wrote it wrong I guess, then.

177
00:13:09,775 --> 00:13:12,274
- How do you know how to
graph it with... (inaudible)?

178
00:13:12,274 --> 00:13:14,294
- Like in the calculator?

179
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,673
- In here. And it's really
not good to graph it here.

180
00:13:16,673 --> 00:13:17,373
- Yeah.

181
00:13:17,373 --> 00:13:20,513
- Okay.

182
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,194
- This seems to be not that
hard, now that I get it.

183
00:13:25,194 --> 00:13:26,704
- Really.

184
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:31,178
- Like, remember how Grayson
thought that it was three

185
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:33,608
I knew she was wrong... (inaudible).

186
00:13:33,608 --> 00:13:35,849
- I mean, I didn't think it was wrong.

187
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:37,966
- You just instinctively
knew that it was wrong.

188
00:13:37,966 --> 00:13:39,755
- (laughter)

189
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:45,729
- [Teacher] Is it going to have
a vertical shift also?

190
00:13:45,878 --> 00:13:48,259
- Yep, up, down, down.

191
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:49,878
- Okay, up or down?"

192
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:55,258
Down how many?

193
00:13:56,088 --> 00:13:58,478
- Two.

194
00:13:58,628 --> 00:14:00,539
- On number five?

195
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:01,918
- Oh, three. It would be three.

196
00:14:01,918 --> 00:14:03,459
- Three. Okay, so you're
going to have two shifts

197
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:08,659
on number five, right? Okay?

198
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:13,405
- Uh huh. I haven't plugged it in yet.

199
00:14:16,836 --> 00:14:20,646
- We're going to have a shift here, right?

200
00:14:21,196 --> 00:14:23,716
What would make that undefined?

201
00:14:23,716 --> 00:14:25,094
If x equals...?

202
00:14:28,754 --> 00:14:30,784
How about positive two?

203
00:14:30,784 --> 00:14:32,734
Because two minus two is zero.

204
00:14:32,734 --> 00:14:36,164
I mean, the zero is
where you needed to be.

205
00:14:36,194 --> 00:14:39,493
So, x equals two, right?

206
00:14:41,343 --> 00:14:44,431
Okay, now, what are we going to do
with this thing out here?

207
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:48,970
That's a vertical shift of y equals...

208
00:14:51,087 --> 00:14:52,247
negative three.

209
00:14:52,247 --> 00:14:53,727
Y equals negative three.

210
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:54,727
- (bell rings)

211
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:58,507
- So, we have two translations, okay?

212
00:14:58,507 --> 00:15:00,160
Two units right and...
