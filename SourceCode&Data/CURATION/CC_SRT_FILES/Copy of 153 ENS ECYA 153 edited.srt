1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,758
- [Vincent] I'm not gonna have no peace with that.

2
00:00:01,758 --> 00:00:03,238
If you feel something,

3
00:00:03,288 --> 00:00:04,688
I don't know, something (mumbles)

4
00:00:04,688 --> 00:00:08,558
like done bothered me
that done made me like...

5
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:12,117
brought me down to the point
where I was crying about it

6
00:00:12,117 --> 00:00:14,159
The first thing he say, "I
ain't gonna tell nobody,

7
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:16,240
"but I feel where you coming from."

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,437
He tell me it shouldn't
get to that point

9
00:00:18,437 --> 00:00:22,120
where you mad over something
that doesn't matter.

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,958
If it's good or not, that
seriously don't matter.

11
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:28,079
That's in the past; the
past ain't gonna do nothing.

12
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:28,937
The past can't hurt you.

13
00:00:28,937 --> 00:00:31,057
- [Teacher] Okay. Alright.

14
00:00:31,057 --> 00:00:32,057
- [Vincent] That's what I'd tell him.

15
00:00:32,057 --> 00:00:34,037
- [Teacher] So, really
this kind of conversation

16
00:00:34,037 --> 00:00:36,318
should've been held with
what kind of friend?

17
00:00:36,318 --> 00:00:37,278
- [Vincent] A pretty good friend.

18
00:00:37,278 --> 00:00:38,358
- [Teacher] A pretty good friend,

19
00:00:38,358 --> 00:00:41,398
or maybe even your best friend.

20
00:00:41,398 --> 00:00:43,138
Nope? Not your best friend?

21
00:00:43,138 --> 00:00:46,159
- [Vincent] (laughter) Oh yes, my best friend.

22
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:48,351
You already know who I'm talking about.

23
00:00:48,351 --> 00:00:50,278
He's my best friend.

24
00:00:50,278 --> 00:00:52,558
Now, he one of them people that

25
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,330
he done did some stuff

26
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,330
to me that made me mad.

27
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,637
I ask him, "Man, why you doing this?

28
00:01:00,637 --> 00:01:03,717
"I thought you was different
from everybody else."

29
00:01:03,717 --> 00:01:06,437
But, not once have I
actually went out there

30
00:01:06,437 --> 00:01:09,798
and played the cards while I'm at home.

31
00:01:09,798 --> 00:01:12,030
How I'm not gonna tell nobody,
and then come two days later,

32
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,677
everybody and their
momma walking up to him,

33
00:01:13,677 --> 00:01:14,910
and asking him questions.

34
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,317
"Uh, why you did this to her?"

35
00:01:16,317 --> 00:01:18,517
- [Teacher] So, let me ask you this.

36
00:01:18,517 --> 00:01:21,190
So, your saying you've had conversations

37
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,238
with your best friend before,

38
00:01:23,238 --> 00:01:26,228
and then he's divulged

39
00:01:26,228 --> 00:01:28,858
information that you've said to him?

40
00:01:28,858 --> 00:01:30,677
- [Vincent] No, from time to time, he might get mad,

41
00:01:30,677 --> 00:01:31,597
and he'll say something,

42
00:01:31,597 --> 00:01:34,919
then we have to have that one on one talk.

43
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:37,598
"OK, this was between me and you.

44
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:41,000
I don't want to hear this
coming out nobody else's mouth."

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,478
Cause then I know point blank
that you done said something.

46
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:47,598
- [Teacher] Let me ask you this,

47
00:01:47,598 --> 00:01:51,117
if you would have that
conversation with someone,

48
00:01:51,117 --> 00:01:52,877
is he truly your best friend?

49
00:01:52,877 --> 00:01:54,357
Is that a conversation that...

50
00:01:54,357 --> 00:01:57,117
Jay, chime in any time.

51
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,897
If you got to keep reminding him

52
00:02:00,897 --> 00:02:02,937
that, hey man,

53
00:02:02,937 --> 00:02:04,672
if you tell somebody something

54
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,992
and you gotta be worried about

55
00:02:06,992 --> 00:02:08,637
whether their gonna tell it

56
00:02:08,637 --> 00:02:10,277
to someone else,
- [Jay] Honestly.

57
00:02:10,277 --> 00:02:12,517
are they really your best friend?

58
00:02:12,517 --> 00:02:14,838
- [Jay] No. Like I said before,

59
00:02:14,838 --> 00:02:16,797
that's another acquaintance,

60
00:02:16,797 --> 00:02:18,918
because you can't trust him like that man.

61
00:02:18,918 --> 00:02:21,637
He telling you he ain't gonna tell nobody,

62
00:02:21,637 --> 00:02:23,317
but he going back on his word.

63
00:02:23,317 --> 00:02:26,397
- [Vincent] He going to get a friend to
turn on you in a heartbeat,

64
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:28,239
that's why I said it's about you.

65
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,118
- [Jay] Johnny? No.

66
00:02:29,118 --> 00:02:32,397
- [Vincent] Between what you say...
- [Jay] I don't blame Johnny.

67
00:02:32,397 --> 00:02:35,398
- [Teacher] If he's
truly your best friend...

68
00:02:35,398 --> 00:02:36,357
- [Vincent] He won't tell nobody.

69
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:37,558
- [Teacher] He won't tell anybody.

70
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:40,271
- [Vincent] But then, you got like...

71
00:02:40,271 --> 00:02:43,478
it's a boundary between stuff you tell.

72
00:02:43,478 --> 00:02:46,748
You can tell your best, best friend

73
00:02:46,748 --> 00:02:48,218
something deep,

74
00:02:48,218 --> 00:02:50,629
but it's a certain boundary between

75
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,918
that which you wouldn't
tell him certain stuff.

76
00:02:52,918 --> 00:02:56,008
I tell my best friend almost everything,

77
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:57,308
but certain stuff.

78
00:02:57,308 --> 00:02:59,317
he don't need to know.

79
00:02:59,317 --> 00:03:01,081
- [Teacher] Right,
cause certain things we...

80
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:02,630
- [Vincent] My business don't need to be his.

81
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:05,231
He have one of those days
when he feeling down,

82
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:06,478
then I come over there,

83
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,318
"Blah, blah, blah, don't
say nothing to me."

84
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,397
Then, he flips out on me,
and he wanna tell something

85
00:03:11,397 --> 00:03:13,487
that's so deep to me

86
00:03:13,487 --> 00:03:16,297
that I'm sitting there looking like,

87
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:17,353
did he really just say this.

88
00:03:17,353 --> 00:03:18,638
- [Teacher] Cause your shocked.

89
00:03:18,638 --> 00:03:20,118
You're in shock, and...

90
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:22,878
- [Vincent] You don't never expect,
well anybody wouldn't expect

91
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:25,117
their best friend to spill
the beans or say something

92
00:03:25,117 --> 00:03:27,838
that's not meant to be told.

93
00:03:27,838 --> 00:03:30,617
Me, I would never

94
00:03:30,617 --> 00:03:33,878
expect Chris to say anything I tell him.

95
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:36,317
So far, he has been a best friend.

96
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:37,838
He don't tell nothing I say.

97
00:03:37,838 --> 00:03:39,557
I don't want to have to
tell what he tells me,

98
00:03:39,557 --> 00:03:42,078
because we got that best
friend relationship.

99
00:03:42,078 --> 00:03:43,877
- [Voiceover] Cause a best
friend should be loyal,

100
00:03:43,877 --> 00:03:45,357
all the way to the end.

101
00:03:45,357 --> 00:03:47,828
- [Vincent] Not when it's necessary or needed.

102
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:49,127
- [Teacher] That's right.

103
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:51,597
Not when it's necessary,
but at all times, right?

104
00:03:51,597 --> 00:03:52,432
- [Vincent] Yes ma'am.

105
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,372
- [Teacher] Okay. Alright.

106
00:03:54,372 --> 00:03:56,718
Let me go to the next scenario.

107
00:03:56,718 --> 00:03:59,158
You decide you would
like to take in a movie,

108
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:01,032
but you choose not to go alone.

109
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,271
You finally reach someone by phone,

110
00:04:03,271 --> 00:04:04,837
who is just as bored as you,

111
00:04:04,837 --> 00:04:08,197
and is dying to be in the
company of someone pleasant.

112
00:04:08,197 --> 00:04:09,870
You both enjoy yourselves so much,

113
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,327
you plan to do this again.

114
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:15,838
Where is that person at
on the grading scale?

115
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,917
- [Jay] I'd say that's a group thing,

116
00:04:17,917 --> 00:04:19,553
because they interested in the same thing

117
00:04:19,553 --> 00:04:20,878
that you're interested in.

118
00:04:20,878 --> 00:04:22,388
- [Vincent] Group friend.

119
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:23,897
- [Teacher] Okay.
Alright, group friend?

120
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:24,967
- [Vincent] Group friend.

121
00:04:24,967 --> 00:04:26,837
- [Teacher] Someone that you 
know through association.

122
00:04:26,837 --> 00:04:30,658
Now, in this scenario, it's
just you and that person.

123
00:04:30,658 --> 00:04:33,358
And, it could be someone that
you met through the group.

124
00:04:33,358 --> 00:04:35,077
Or, it could be...

125
00:04:35,077 --> 00:04:36,998
It's not necessarily your best friend.

126
00:04:36,998 --> 00:04:40,151
- [Vincent] You just started hanging
out out of the blue.

127
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:43,919
You met them, and when
your friends not around,

128
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,797
y'all started to talk a little

129
00:04:45,797 --> 00:04:48,198
and get to know more
about each other then.

130
00:04:48,198 --> 00:04:50,198
- [Jay] I'd say that's a pretty good friend.

131
00:04:50,198 --> 00:04:51,238
- [Teacher] Pretty good friend?

132
00:04:51,238 --> 00:04:53,477
- [Vincent] I could say a pretty good friend,

133
00:04:53,477 --> 00:04:54,998
cause I would hang out
with a pretty good friend.

134
00:04:54,998 --> 00:04:57,558
- [Jay] A pretty good friend you can
take on the outside of school

135
00:04:57,558 --> 00:05:00,430
and you can go do activities
that both of y'all enjoy.

136
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,911
- [Teacher] Yeah, because
a group friend is normally

137
00:05:02,911 --> 00:05:05,197
someone you hang out with in a group.

138
00:05:05,197 --> 00:05:07,917
Kind of like we're together.

139
00:05:07,917 --> 00:05:10,358
Because, once again, you know that person

140
00:05:10,358 --> 00:05:12,238
through association of someone else.

141
00:05:12,238 --> 00:05:14,831
But, a good friend is someone

142
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:17,131
that you actually can call up and say

143
00:05:17,131 --> 00:05:18,901
- [Vincent] "Okay, you want to go out?"

144
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:19,579
- [Teacher] Yeah "You wanna go out?

145
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:20,579
Let's go..."

146
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:23,390
It's nothing between you guys.

147
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,837
If its a girl, you
understand that she just want

148
00:05:25,837 --> 00:05:27,958
to see the movie, and I
want to see the movie.

149
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,957
We laugh, we joke, we go
out eat pizza together,

150
00:05:30,957 --> 00:05:34,067
but it's nothing else there.

151
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,558
We ain't trying to be
boyfriend-girlfriend.

152
00:05:35,558 --> 00:05:37,969
- [Vincent] You can't try to make
it more then what it is.

153
00:05:37,969 --> 00:05:39,518
- [Teacher] Right. Then,
if it's just a friend,

154
00:05:39,518 --> 00:05:41,351
one of your dudes that you hang out with,

155
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:43,957
y'all like the same movie.

156
00:05:43,957 --> 00:05:45,828
Like, I...

157
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:47,628
You know...

158
00:05:47,628 --> 00:05:51,517
You can't call me, cause
we're not on the same level.

159
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,198
I'm your teacher at all times.

160
00:05:54,198 --> 00:05:58,150
Even though you know I like
the same type movies you like,

161
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,437
and we always discuss
the same type of movie,

162
00:06:00,437 --> 00:06:02,830
we're not going to go
to the movies together.

163
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,279
- [Vincent] Cause you on the adult level,

164
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,879
we on the young people level.

165
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:08,758
- [Teacher] Right, and
we're different types of...

166
00:06:08,758 --> 00:06:11,197
Our friendship scale is different.

167
00:06:11,197 --> 00:06:12,998
- [Vincent] Is not even up here, it's...

168
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,739
- [Teacher] Right. Okay?

169
00:06:14,739 --> 00:06:18,317
Now...

170
00:06:19,917 --> 00:06:21,437
Someone approaches you about

171
00:06:21,437 --> 00:06:23,678
going to see an exhibit at the museum.

172
00:06:23,678 --> 00:06:25,677
You were glad to hear it,
because it just happens to be

173
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:29,115
an exhibit that you wanted to see anyway.

174
00:06:30,238 --> 00:06:32,470
So, your parents tell
you both that you can go,

175
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,277
and you can...

176
00:06:34,277 --> 00:06:36,350
The exhibit is in a different city.

177
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,478
Your parents tell you
both that you can go,

178
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:41,679
and you can spend the
night over out of town.

179
00:06:41,679 --> 00:06:43,438
What kind of friend is that?

180
00:06:43,438 --> 00:06:46,819
Is that just an acquaintance?

181
00:06:50,237 --> 00:06:52,117
- [Vincent] That would probably be with
like with my best friend.

182
00:06:52,117 --> 00:06:53,597
I wouldn't go out of town with somebody

183
00:06:53,597 --> 00:06:55,037
that's not by best friend.

184
00:06:55,037 --> 00:06:57,197
- [Jay] I ain't going to go out of town...

185
00:06:57,197 --> 00:06:59,358
I got to go with somebody that I know

186
00:06:59,358 --> 00:07:00,477
is going to speak to me.

187
00:07:00,477 --> 00:07:01,357
You know what I'm saying?

188
00:07:01,357 --> 00:07:02,318
- [Teacher] mm-hmm

189
00:07:02,318 --> 00:07:03,637
- [Jay] Got to be somebody I can trust.

190
00:07:03,637 --> 00:07:06,237
I don't have to many friends I can trust.

191
00:07:06,237 --> 00:07:09,677
I don't know why, but all my
friends is just the reason

192
00:07:09,677 --> 00:07:11,037
why I don't get too close to them.

193
00:07:11,037 --> 00:07:12,437
I can't exactly tell you why.

194
00:07:12,437 --> 00:07:13,597
I just don't.

195
00:07:13,597 --> 00:07:15,117
Because, I can't trust everybody.

196
00:07:15,117 --> 00:07:17,180
- [Teacher] Okay. Alright.

197
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,397
- [Jay] Because, you'll never know who will be

198
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,639
your best friend today.

199
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,637
and, they might turn on you
tomorrow, so you'll never know.

200
00:07:22,637 --> 00:07:23,397
- [Teacher] Okay.

201
00:07:23,397 --> 00:07:26,277
So, that's why this is a good piece to do.

202
00:07:26,277 --> 00:07:29,758
Because, we got to figure out who is

203
00:07:29,758 --> 00:07:31,851
just an acquaintance,

204
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,717
who is someone we that we
will just see on the hall,

205
00:07:33,717 --> 00:07:36,757
"hi, how you doing, bye".

206
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:38,597
Got to figure out who is the acquaintance,

207
00:07:38,597 --> 00:07:41,758
and then we got to figure
out who is the group friend,

208
00:07:41,758 --> 00:07:44,188
who is a good friend,
who is the best friend.

209
00:07:44,188 --> 00:07:45,828
Because, there's somewhere...

210
00:07:45,828 --> 00:07:48,768
There's a fine line, like you
guys said, there's a fine line

211
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:51,007
between all five of them,

212
00:07:51,007 --> 00:07:53,327
but you got to know the line.

213
00:07:53,327 --> 00:07:54,938
You got to know where the line is drawn.

214
00:07:54,938 --> 00:07:57,551
You got to know the conversations
to have with all of them,

215
00:07:57,551 --> 00:08:00,757
because there are certain
conversations that you would have

216
00:08:00,757 --> 00:08:03,308
with that best friend...

217
00:08:03,308 --> 00:08:05,910
- [Vincent] That you want to tell somebody
that you just met in the hall.

218
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,197
- [Teacher] Right! Right!

219
00:08:07,197 --> 00:08:10,718
- [Vincent] 'Cause there like, "you just
telling me your whole business,

220
00:08:10,718 --> 00:08:14,497
but you don't really know
my name or nothing about me."

221
00:08:14,507 --> 00:08:15,797
That's something...

222
00:08:15,797 --> 00:08:17,910
The stuff you telling
me, I wouldn't tell you.

223
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,279
I would tell it to my
best friend, but as far as

224
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:23,277
what's going on in my house,
I'll probably let you know

225
00:08:23,277 --> 00:08:25,518
I got sisters and
brothers, the basic stuff,

226
00:08:25,518 --> 00:08:29,467
but not oh my momma's strung out,
or doing this and that.

227
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,032
Cause everybody's business
is not your business.

228
00:08:32,032 --> 00:08:34,439
Your business is not (mumbles) are you.

229
00:08:34,439 --> 00:08:35,912
- [Teacher] That's right.

230
00:08:35,912 --> 00:08:38,437
We always got to keep that in mind,

231
00:08:38,437 --> 00:08:41,039
because so many times I'll
get calls from parents,

232
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,950
and they'll say, "So and so...

233
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,768
Just talking too much."

234
00:08:45,768 --> 00:08:49,038
Especially when people are
getting into a lot of issues,

235
00:08:49,038 --> 00:08:50,838
or getting into confusion at school,

236
00:08:50,838 --> 00:08:51,919
or what have you.

237
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:54,872
And, a lot of that comes from
the fact that they don't know

238
00:08:54,872 --> 00:08:57,518
when to be quiet, or they
don't know what to say,

239
00:08:57,518 --> 00:09:00,438
or how to say it, or who to approach.

240
00:09:00,438 --> 00:09:01,997
Because, if someone says to you...

241
00:09:01,997 --> 00:09:04,680
stand up for a minute.

242
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:08,638
In the morning, when you first come in,

243
00:09:08,638 --> 00:09:09,879
and the first thing I say to you is what?

244
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:10,677
- [Vincent] Good morning.

245
00:09:10,677 --> 00:09:11,878
- [Teacher] Good morning. Good morning, Vincent.

246
00:09:11,878 --> 00:09:13,232
How you doing?

247
00:09:13,232 --> 00:09:14,237
- [Vincent] Good morning Ms. Jenson.

248
00:09:14,237 --> 00:09:17,137
- [Teacher] How was your weekend?

249
00:09:17,137 --> 00:09:18,959
- [Vincent] I went to my cousin house,

250
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,559
I got to spend time with my Godmother,

251
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,517
and I went grocery shopping.

252
00:09:23,517 --> 00:09:25,282
- [Teacher] Okay. so that...

253
00:09:25,282 --> 00:09:26,562
Now, you told me...

254
00:09:26,562 --> 00:09:27,658
I didn't say what did you do.

255
00:09:27,658 --> 00:09:28,558
- [Vincent] Oh.

256
00:09:28,558 --> 00:09:29,999
- [Teacher] I said how was your weekend.

257
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:30,757
- [Vincent] It was good.

258
00:09:30,757 --> 00:09:31,878
- [Teacher] It was good.

259
00:09:31,878 --> 00:09:34,558
And, that's basics of that conversation.

260
00:09:34,558 --> 00:09:38,357
It should not be oh guess what?

261
00:09:38,357 --> 00:09:41,051
My momma...

262
00:09:41,051 --> 00:09:44,001
My momma and her boyfriend was fighting,

263
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:46,398
and they threw the cat out the window,

264
00:09:46,398 --> 00:09:48,557
and then the police came over.

265
00:09:48,557 --> 00:09:50,918
Because, at that moment,
you have just did what?

266
00:09:50,918 --> 00:09:51,838
- [Vincent] Stepped out of bounds.

267
00:09:51,838 --> 00:09:53,157
- [Teacher] You've
stepped out of bounds.

268
00:09:53,157 --> 00:09:55,037
You've divulged way...

269
00:09:55,037 --> 00:09:56,118
- [Vincent] Too much.

270
00:09:56,118 --> 00:09:56,992
- [Teacher] Too much.

271
00:09:56,992 --> 00:09:58,679
- [Vincent] You done opened the book
before it could be read.

272
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:00,559
- [Teacher] (laughing)
Or you done read the book

273
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,159
before it could be bought.

274
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:05,112
Because, really, I didn't
buy into all of that.

275
00:10:05,112 --> 00:10:06,439
I didn't want all of that.

276
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,998
- [Vincent] You just wanted to know your name,

277
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:09,079
and how was your weekend.

278
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:12,031
- [Teacher] I just
wanted the generalities of

279
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:15,037
it was a good weekend.

280
00:10:15,037 --> 00:10:17,118
And then there are times
that we could probably

281
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:18,799
get a little deeper.

282
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:20,239
- [Vincent] But you not asking for that.

283
00:10:20,239 --> 00:10:21,317
You just asking for the simple.

284
00:10:21,317 --> 00:10:22,598
- [Teacher] That's right. That's right.

285
00:10:22,598 --> 00:10:26,037
Jeremy, I'm going to ask you....

286
00:10:26,037 --> 00:10:28,128
Stand up for a minute.

287
00:10:30,158 --> 00:10:32,468
Jay...

288
00:10:32,468 --> 00:10:35,697
'cause you're a pretty secretive guy.
-  [Jay] Mmhm.

289
00:10:35,697 --> 00:10:38,124
- [Teacher] So normally we got to
pull stuff out of you.

290
00:10:38,124 --> 00:10:41,467
'Cause I said to you earlier, I said,

291
00:10:41,467 --> 00:10:43,189
"Your Dad called.

292
00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:45,879
And what was that about?"

293
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,069
- [Jay] (mumbling)

294
00:10:47,069 --> 00:10:49,797
(laughing) I was stuck on the river.

295
00:10:49,797 --> 00:10:52,237
- [Teacher] And he said,
"I was stuck on the river."

296
00:10:52,237 --> 00:10:55,177
My first thought was Jeremy got a boat?

297
00:10:55,177 --> 00:10:57,928
(laughing)

298
00:10:57,928 --> 00:10:59,678
So I said, "You got a boat?"

299
00:10:59,678 --> 00:11:00,838
That's what I said, right?

300
00:11:00,838 --> 00:11:04,119
- [Jay] Yeah. I was over there
at the Wafflehouse,

301
00:11:04,119 --> 00:11:06,957
over there by Brian Gates behind

302
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,438
over there at the apartments.

303
00:11:08,438 --> 00:11:10,038
I went to see someone.

304
00:11:10,038 --> 00:11:12,352
- [Teacher] And so
he went to see someone,

305
00:11:12,352 --> 00:11:15,278
but again, sometimes you got to know

306
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:17,877
when to hold your conversation--

307
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,838
- [Vincent] ...and when to divulge it.
- [Teacher] --and when to divulge it.

308
00:11:19,838 --> 00:11:21,797
Because, even though
he went to see someone,

309
00:11:21,797 --> 00:11:23,718
he didn't give me no elaborate details,

310
00:11:23,718 --> 00:11:25,677
yeah this honey, she was...

311
00:11:25,677 --> 00:11:27,118
Because a lot of times,

312
00:11:27,118 --> 00:11:27,992
- [Vincent] You don't need that.

313
00:11:27,992 --> 00:11:29,197
- [Teacher] I don't need that.

314
00:11:29,197 --> 00:11:30,437
- [Jay] You just wanted to know where I was at.

315
00:11:30,437 --> 00:11:31,797
- [Teacher] Just wanted
to know where you was at.

316
00:11:31,797 --> 00:11:32,878
I want to make sure you was okay.

317
00:11:32,878 --> 00:11:35,519
Make sure that your Dad
got in touch with someone

318
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,471
to be able to say, "Jeremy's okay".

319
00:11:38,471 --> 00:11:40,677
Okay? Alright?

320
00:11:40,677 --> 00:11:41,839
- [Vincent] Alright.

321
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,067
- [Jay] Yeah.

322
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:45,418
- [Teacher] You can have a seat.

323
00:11:45,418 --> 00:11:45,998
- [Vincent] That was a good conversation.

324
00:11:45,998 --> 00:11:46,677
- [Teacher] Huh?

325
00:11:46,677 --> 00:11:47,998
- [Vincent] This was a good conversation.

326
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,032
- [Teacher] This was a good conversation?

327
00:11:49,032 --> 00:11:51,157
You thought this was a good lesson?

328
00:11:51,157 --> 00:11:52,158
- [Jay] Today was a good day.

329
00:11:52,158 --> 00:11:53,395
It was a good day.

330
00:11:53,395 --> 00:11:55,438
- [Vincent] Because some people
don't know their boundaries

331
00:11:55,438 --> 00:11:58,838
of talking and telling it all.

332
00:11:58,838 --> 00:12:01,397
- [Jay] Some people just give
up too much information.

333
00:12:01,397 --> 00:12:03,431
- [Vincent] Some people around here got to even say

334
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,357
what (mumbles) did to you and everything.

335
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:08,158
- [Teacher] From here
we're going actually,

336
00:12:08,158 --> 00:12:11,238
the next thing we're going
to discuss is conversations.

337
00:12:11,238 --> 00:12:12,437
That's where we're going to go from here.

338
00:12:12,437 --> 00:12:14,437
I wanted us to...

339
00:12:14,437 --> 00:12:15,519
because, the other day,

340
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,157
we kind of looked at friendship,

341
00:12:17,157 --> 00:12:18,358
but I wanted to go a little deeper,

342
00:12:18,358 --> 00:12:20,728
because I know....

343
00:12:20,728 --> 00:12:23,927
I want us to realize that friendships...

344
00:12:23,927 --> 00:12:26,008
they should be reciprocal.
- [Vincent] Not always.

345
00:12:26,008 --> 00:12:27,817
- [Teacher] And when I say reciprocal,

346
00:12:27,817 --> 00:12:29,119
everybody understands what I'm saying?

347
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:30,027
- [Vincent] The same.

348
00:12:30,027 --> 00:12:30,727
- [Jay] No.

349
00:12:30,727 --> 00:12:32,357
- [Teacher] Should be the
same, like how I feel about you,

350
00:12:32,357 --> 00:12:33,998
you should feel that same way about me.

351
00:12:33,998 --> 00:12:36,757
- [Vincent] I feel like you trustworthy,
but you feel like I'm going

352
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,277
to tell on you any chance I get.

353
00:12:38,277 --> 00:12:39,637
- [Teacher] Right. Exactly.

354
00:12:39,637 --> 00:12:42,239
But, they're not always reciprocal,

355
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:44,388
but...

356
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:47,578
keep in mind that friendships
are always changing.

357
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:49,557
Because, who you put down
on your friendship scale

358
00:12:49,557 --> 00:12:51,717
on Thursday...

359
00:12:51,717 --> 00:12:52,518
- [Vincent] It change.

360
00:12:52,518 --> 00:12:53,437
- [Teacher] It changed.

361
00:12:53,437 --> 00:12:54,638
You gave me a whole different...

362
00:12:54,638 --> 00:12:56,357
not a whole different set, but you gave me

363
00:12:56,357 --> 00:12:57,878
some different people,

364
00:12:57,878 --> 00:13:00,552
and you actually moved some people.

365
00:13:00,552 --> 00:13:03,599
Where you had Yolanda as a good friend,

366
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:07,248
she became just a group friend

367
00:13:07,248 --> 00:13:09,550
four days later.

368
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,877
Okay, and you had valid reasons,

369
00:13:11,877 --> 00:13:13,998
and keep in mind that things do change.

370
00:13:13,998 --> 00:13:17,958
Just because someone was a
best friend last week....

371
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:19,478
- [Vincent] Don't mean they going
to stay your best friend.

372
00:13:19,478 --> 00:13:20,958
- [Teacher] They're not.

373
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,197
Nine times out of 10, I promise you guys.

374
00:13:23,197 --> 00:13:25,249
When I was in high school,

375
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,729
I could.....

376
00:13:27,729 --> 00:13:30,797
there were three, there was four of us,

377
00:13:30,797 --> 00:13:32,678
and I considered them
my very best friends.

378
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:35,878
Now, I don't know how deep
they would've had my back,

379
00:13:35,878 --> 00:13:37,872
but I considered them my good friends.

380
00:13:37,872 --> 00:13:41,717
We talked on the phone, we
shared secrets, we shared stuff,

381
00:13:41,717 --> 00:13:44,319
you know, when we was
sneaking and doing stuff.

382
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,758
We shared those things, but today,

383
00:13:47,758 --> 00:13:50,719
I really can't tell you where they're at.

384
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,988
Now, there was some friends
that I met in college

385
00:13:54,018 --> 00:13:57,010
that we're still friends

386
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,340
to this day.

387
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,677
They're friends that I've had
since I came into teaching,

388
00:14:02,677 --> 00:14:05,478
that I don't know where those people are.

389
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:06,871
Because I've been teaching...

390
00:14:06,871 --> 00:14:09,567
when you think of teaching for 18 years,

391
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:10,687
people have friends...

392
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:14,478
people have come and gone
in the teaching profession,

393
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:17,158
but I haven't kept in
touch with all of them,

394
00:14:17,158 --> 00:14:19,798
because there has to be a...

395
00:14:19,798 --> 00:14:22,348
there has to be something in common

396
00:14:22,348 --> 00:14:25,412
that's going to keep you friends.

397
00:14:25,412 --> 00:14:27,159
It can't just be, I see...

398
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,878
if I see them just at school,

399
00:14:28,878 --> 00:14:31,239
and that's all we ever
talk about is school,

400
00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:34,318
and schoolwork, and complain, and fussing,

401
00:14:34,318 --> 00:14:36,438
and about lesson plans and stuff,

402
00:14:36,438 --> 00:14:40,277
then nine times out of 10
those are just my associates.

403
00:14:40,277 --> 00:14:41,479
Those are just acquaintances,

404
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:42,797
people that I pass in the hall.

405
00:14:42,797 --> 00:14:45,487
We laugh, we joke, but we don't share

406
00:14:45,487 --> 00:14:47,597
any intimate conversation.

407
00:14:47,597 --> 00:14:50,539
Okay?

408
00:14:50,539 --> 00:14:52,878
I'm glad this was a good
exercise for you guys,

409
00:14:52,878 --> 00:14:55,999
and next time we're going
to look into conversations.

410
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,839
The type of conversations you have

411
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,839
with each one of those type people.
