1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,452
- (Background Chatter)

2
00:00:01,452 --> 00:00:04,552
- [Teacher] Starter-stopper,
opposite side. Okay.

3
00:00:04,552 --> 00:00:06,596
Everybody has their marbles.

4
00:00:06,596 --> 00:00:08,152
How many trials are we doing?

5
00:00:08,152 --> 00:00:10,103
- [Kids] Five.
- [Teacher] Five trials.

6
00:00:10,751 --> 00:00:13,247
If the first one doesn't work,

7
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:14,872
raise your hand.

8
00:00:14,872 --> 00:00:16,010
I will come help you

9
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,832
and we'll talk about why it doesn't work

10
00:00:17,832 --> 00:00:19,307
and what we're gonna do to change it.

11
00:00:19,307 --> 00:00:20,654
What you're gonna do to change it.

12
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:22,151
Okay?

13
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,543
Timers.

14
00:00:24,543 --> 00:00:26,156
Get your people ready.

15
00:00:26,156 --> 00:00:27,735
Remember you're gonna say, "Ready, set,"

16
00:00:27,735 --> 00:00:29,221
as soon as that: "go."

17
00:00:30,813 --> 00:00:31,779
All right. Go.

18
00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:32,976
- [Kids] Ready.

19
00:00:32,976 --> 00:00:34,092
Set.

20
00:00:34,092 --> 00:00:35,510
Go.

21
00:00:37,748 --> 00:00:39,448
- [Boy] Oh! You're supposed to get it.

22
00:00:41,515 --> 00:00:44,522
- [Teacher] Right here.
This great piling direction.

23
00:00:46,182 --> 00:00:47,098
Did y'all's work?

24
00:00:47,098 --> 00:00:48,089
- [Group 1] Yeah.

25
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:51,713
- [Teacher] Good. Good.
Did you record the time?

26
00:00:51,713 --> 00:00:53,198
- [Boy in blue] Look.

27
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:55,497
- [Teacher] Tell him. You guys
are ready to keep going.

28
00:00:55,497 --> 00:00:57,297
Five trials. Good job.

29
00:00:57,297 --> 00:00:59,618
And we'll discuss why
yours worked in a minute.

30
00:00:59,618 --> 00:01:01,117
- [Boy in sweater] We gonna take-

31
00:01:01,117 --> 00:01:02,510
- [Teacher] Okay hang on. Tell me what happened.

32
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,855
- [Girl with glasses] When it got here, it stopped.

33
00:01:04,855 --> 00:01:05,992
- [Teacher] It stopped. Why did--

34
00:01:05,992 --> 00:01:06,863
- [Girl with glasses] Friction.

35
00:01:06,863 --> 00:01:08,214
- [Teacher] Okay, the--

36
00:01:08,214 --> 00:01:09,591
- [Angel] Probably because

37
00:01:09,591 --> 00:01:10,810
the speed wasn't great enough.

38
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,691
- Okay. So you think
you needed more speed?

39
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:14,049
- [Boy with Sweater] No. I think we need to take this off.

40
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:15,651
- [Teacher] Okay. Let's try taking that off.

41
00:01:15,651 --> 00:01:17,136
Where do you think you can put

42
00:01:17,136 --> 00:01:18,368
those to get more speed?

43
00:01:18,368 --> 00:01:19,549
- [Kids] Up here.

44
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:22,007
- [Teacher] Ok.

45
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,065
Now, what is that gonna give the marbles?

46
00:01:31,075 --> 00:01:33,341
- [Girl with glasses] More momentum?

47
00:01:33,341 --> 00:01:35,127
- [Teacher] Yes.
- [Boy with sweater] Let's make it bigger.

48
00:01:35,144 --> 00:01:37,161
Three centimeters.

49
00:01:38,321 --> 00:01:40,554
- [Boy behind camera]
Is this our second one?

50
00:01:40,554 --> 00:01:42,454
Are we gonna do a second try?

51
00:01:42,454 --> 00:01:44,451
- [Teacher] You're going
back to your first one

52
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:47,773
because you want to make sure it works.

53
00:01:51,313 --> 00:01:52,783
So reset it. Okay.

54
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,158
Try again.

55
00:02:02,955 --> 00:02:05,528
[Kids exclaim in excitement]

56
00:02:07,248 --> 00:02:08,685
- [Teacher] Did it work?

57
00:02:08,685 --> 00:02:09,914
- [Kids] Yeah.

58
00:02:09,976 --> 00:02:12,190
- [Teacher] Let's discuss
why did it work this time?

59
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,288
- [Angel] Look how we gave them these.

60
00:02:14,288 --> 00:02:16,118
- [Teacher] By doing what?

61
00:02:16,118 --> 00:02:17,909
- [Boy with sweater] By um. Making it higher.

62
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:20,921
- [Teacher] Elevation? Ooh.
And what's another word that--

63
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:21,588
- [Girl with glasses] Altitude.

64
00:02:21,588 --> 00:02:23,748
- [Teacher] Yeah. That's good. Okay.

65
00:02:23,748 --> 00:02:24,967
So it worked. How long did it take?

66
00:02:24,967 --> 00:02:25,991
- [Kids] Seven seconds.

67
00:02:25,991 --> 00:02:29,204
- [Teacher] Face the recorder.
Got it? Okay. Very good.

68
00:02:29,204 --> 00:02:32,202
Keep going. You're ready
for your second trial.

69
00:02:32,738 --> 00:02:33,644
Okay.

70
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:36,887
- [Boy in dark blue] We're done.

71
00:02:38,697 --> 00:02:40,544
- [Teacher] Y'all already done five trials?

72
00:02:40,544 --> 00:02:42,828
Okay. Well, let's just stop for a minute.

73
00:02:42,828 --> 00:02:44,803
What comes down. Let's pull together here.

74
00:02:44,803 --> 00:02:46,221
Let's talk. I want you guys

75
00:02:46,221 --> 00:02:49,202
to talk about why you think it worked.

76
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:51,647
- [Girl] Because the big hill helped.

77
00:02:51,647 --> 00:02:53,238
- [Teacher] The hill? What force is that?

78
00:02:53,258 --> 00:02:56,483
- [Boy with glasses] The hill was enormous

79
00:02:56,483 --> 00:02:58,751
so it gave it more momentum.

80
00:02:58,973 --> 00:03:01,541
-[Teacher] Good job. So gravity pulled it down.

81
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,633
- [Teaher] What did you say?

82
00:03:04,633 --> 00:03:08,063
- [Boy with glasses] I said the hill's bigger 
than the hoop

83
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,757
so it gave it more
momentum so it would go.

84
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,336
- [Teacher] To make it through the loop.

85
00:03:12,336 --> 00:03:13,056
Right.

86
00:03:13,056 --> 00:03:15,493
And the force pulling it down was what?

87
00:03:15,493 --> 00:03:16,365
- [Kids] Gravity.

88
00:03:16,365 --> 00:03:17,945
- [Teacher] Gravity. Good.

89
00:03:17,945 --> 00:03:19,706
Now talk to me about the order

90
00:03:19,706 --> 00:03:20,415
that you put it in.

91
00:03:20,415 --> 00:03:22,355
Why would you-- you kind of just did.

92
00:03:22,355 --> 00:03:24,061
- [Boy with glasses] We put the hill here

93
00:03:24,061 --> 00:03:25,872
so the hill would go
faster to go in the loop.

94
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,672
- [Teacher] To get more speed behind it.

95
00:03:27,672 --> 00:03:28,216
Good.

96
00:03:28,216 --> 00:03:29,111
- [Boy with glasses] And the turn would--

97
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:30,191
- [Boy in dark blue] Make it slow down.

98
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:30,898
- [Boy with glasses] Yeah.

99
00:03:32,968 --> 00:03:34,831
- [Teacher] So what do you think would

100
00:03:34,831 --> 00:03:37,791
make the marble stop
down there at the end?

101
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:38,642
- [Kids] Friction.

102
00:03:38,642 --> 00:03:40,140
- [Teacher] Friction. Okay.

103
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,123
Very good. We got all five trials.

104
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:47,729
You guys need a knee. Start
recording your information.

105
00:03:49,754 --> 00:03:51,139
- [Boy in black] It went really fast.

106
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:52,914
- [Teacher] "Really fast."

107
00:03:52,914 --> 00:03:54,408
- Just three seconds.

108
00:03:54,408 --> 00:03:55,545
- Did it work on the first trial?

109
00:03:55,545 --> 00:03:56,822
- [Group 3] No.

110
00:03:56,822 --> 00:03:59,863
- [Teacher] Okay. Tell me what
happened on the first trial.

111
00:03:59,863 --> 00:04:02,097
-[Boy in black] It was like that.

112
00:04:02,097 --> 00:04:04,437
And it just went off right here.

113
00:04:04,437 --> 00:04:06,226
- [Teacher] Okay. Why do
you think it fell off?

114
00:04:06,226 --> 00:04:09,360
What was going on right
here to make it fall?

115
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,101
- [Boy in jacket] Twist?

116
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:12,506
- [Teacher] There was a twist in it?

117
00:04:12,506 --> 00:04:14,898
So you just had to fix it
so that it went straighter.

118
00:04:14,898 --> 00:04:16,245
And so you pushed it?

119
00:04:16,245 --> 00:04:19,006
- [Boy in jacket] Renny put it 
like this, like around here.

120
00:04:19,006 --> 00:04:21,038
- [Boy in black] Pushed it in.

121
00:04:21,038 --> 00:04:23,221
- [Teacher] So it might have been
a little to steep too.

122
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,800
That incline might have been too steep.

123
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,163
What order did you put your elements in?

124
00:04:30,163 --> 00:04:32,189
- [Kids] Hill, loop, and turn.

125
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,611
- [Teacher] Okay. And why'd
you put the hill first?

126
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:35,491
- [Boy in jacket] Because it's higher.

127
00:04:35,491 --> 00:04:37,430
And it would give more speed.

128
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,402
- [Teacher] What force is
giving it more speed right here?

129
00:04:40,402 --> 00:04:41,134
- [Boy in jacket] Gravity.

130
00:04:41,134 --> 00:04:42,550
- [Teacher] Very good. Okay.

131
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,210
And then talk to me about
why you put your loop

132
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,951
right after that hill and not your turn.

133
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,831
Why didn't you put your turn there?

134
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:52,185
- [Boy in jacket] If we turn,
there's not enough speed.

135
00:04:52,185 --> 00:04:53,509
- [Boy in black] For the loop.

136
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:56,027
- [Teacher] Okay. Y'all both
said the exact same thing.

137
00:04:56,027 --> 00:04:58,164
Repeat that to me so I understand.

138
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,882
- [Boy in black] If we put the turn first,

139
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,564
it won't have enough speed for the loop.

140
00:05:02,564 --> 00:05:03,783
- [Teacher] Good. Very good.

141
00:05:03,783 --> 00:05:05,210
All right. Good job guys.

142
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,604
Have you got five trials?

143
00:05:06,604 --> 00:05:08,089
- [Boy in jacket] It's all three seconds.

144
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:09,042
- [Teacher] All of 'em were the same?

145
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,330
That's interesting. Very good.

146
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,385
We'll talk about that after you each

147
00:05:12,385 --> 00:05:15,206
need a knee and record your information.

148
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,919
Anthony, what was your job?

149
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,171
- [Anthony] Record.

150
00:05:21,171 --> 00:05:22,638
- [Teacher] So you were the one that

151
00:05:22,638 --> 00:05:25,326
found that they were the same each time?

152
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:28,148
Make sure you get written down everything.

153
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:33,819
Okay guys. Talk to me.

154
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:35,299
- [Boy] We got three.

155
00:05:35,299 --> 00:05:37,586
- [Teacher] Did the first one work?

156
00:05:37,656 --> 00:05:39,392
- [Girl in black] No.

157
00:05:39,392 --> 00:05:41,816
- [Teacher] Tell me what
happened on the first one

158
00:05:41,816 --> 00:05:43,675
becuase I didn't see it.

159
00:05:43,675 --> 00:05:46,694
- [Girl in black] The first one, we had this open

160
00:05:46,694 --> 00:05:48,818
and we had it sitting right there

161
00:05:48,818 --> 00:05:51,210
and we had the chair right here

162
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,078
and when we set it down,

163
00:05:53,078 --> 00:05:55,052
right here, when the
chair was right there,

164
00:05:55,052 --> 00:05:57,049
it kept on falling off.

165
00:05:57,049 --> 00:05:58,116
- [Girl in blue] So it just dropped.

166
00:05:58,116 --> 00:06:01,044
- [Teacher] So you think
the incline was too what?

167
00:06:01,044 --> 00:06:02,239
- [Girl in blue] Straight.

168
00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:04,998
- [Girl in black] It was too steep.

169
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,383
- [Teacher] There you go.
That's the word I'm looking for.

170
00:06:06,383 --> 00:06:06,939
It was too steep.

171
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:08,182
- [Girl in black] Because it was right here

172
00:06:08,182 --> 00:06:09,899
and it was going all down.

173
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:11,246
- [Teacher] Very Good. So
what did you do to fix it?

174
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,905
- [Girl in black] We kept on sliding 
it down a little.

175
00:06:14,535 --> 00:06:16,505
- [Teacher] Did you have to
slide it down more than once?

176
00:06:16,505 --> 00:06:17,445
- [Girl in black] Yes.

177
00:06:19,655 --> 00:06:20,923
- [Teacher] Good job guys.

178
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:22,938
So did you get it to where
you could do five trials?

179
00:06:22,938 --> 00:06:23,907
- [Girl in blue] Yes.

180
00:06:23,907 --> 00:06:25,335
- [Girl in black] And we got three for each.

181
00:06:25,335 --> 00:06:26,599
- [Teacher] Three seconds? They did too.

182
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:28,568
They got the exact same for all of 'em.

183
00:06:28,568 --> 00:06:29,589
How about that?

184
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,216
But look at your coasters.
They look different.

185
00:06:32,216 --> 00:06:32,668
- [Kids] Yeah.

186
00:06:32,668 --> 00:06:33,444
- [Teacher] That's interesting too.

187
00:06:33,444 --> 00:06:36,288
'Cause their incline
is steeper than yours.

188
00:06:37,818 --> 00:06:41,328
Lets talk about the order that
you have your elements in.

189
00:06:41,328 --> 00:06:42,503
What's first?

190
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:45,323
- [Girl in blue] The hill
because it gives more speed

191
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:46,970
when it's going down a hill so you don't--

192
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:47,982
- [Teacher] But that's on what force?

193
00:06:49,762 --> 00:06:50,733
- [Girl in blue] Gravity.

194
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:52,068
- [Teacher] Good job.

195
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:53,831
And why'd you put your
loop right after that?

196
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:55,341
- [Girl in blue] Because it
would have the most speed

197
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:58,800
to keep going and then the turn return it.

198
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,152
Because if we did the turn,

199
00:07:01,152 --> 00:07:04,130
it wouldn't have enough
speed to make the loop.

200
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,406
- [Teacher] Good job. Good job.

201
00:07:05,406 --> 00:07:07,310
Need a knee, record your information,

202
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,523
and start figuring your speed.

203
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:16,980
Have you guys got all five trials?

204
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,968
- [Kids] Nope.

205
00:07:17,968 --> 00:07:19,186
- [Teacher] Uh oh. What happened?

206
00:07:19,186 --> 00:07:21,984
- [Girl with glasses] It stopped because of the friction.

207
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:24,585
When it get right here, it
started getting out of friction.

208
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:25,862
- [Teacher] Friction right here?

209
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,661
What's causing friction right here?

210
00:07:27,661 --> 00:07:30,064
Can I watch it?

211
00:07:30,064 --> 00:07:32,340
- [Boy in sweater] Its gonna work
this time because we taped it down.

212
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,972
- [Teacher] Why do
you think it's gonna work?

213
00:07:34,972 --> 00:07:37,952
- [Boy in sweater] Because we taped it down.

214
00:07:37,952 --> 00:07:40,167
- [Teacher] You know what?
I want you to use that one.

215
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:41,440
How long did that take?

216
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,631
- [Boy in black] Seven.

217
00:07:42,631 --> 00:07:44,499
- [Teacher] Seven seconds?
All right. Do it again.

218
00:07:44,499 --> 00:07:46,338
Let's look at it again.

219
00:07:47,576 --> 00:07:49,335
So it was stopping right here.

220
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:50,278
- [Girl with glasses] It always was stopping right there

221
00:07:50,278 --> 00:07:52,357
and then I taped it down.

222
00:07:52,357 --> 00:07:54,489
- [Teacher] Oh you taped this down.

223
00:07:56,969 --> 00:07:59,311
- [Boy in black] That
thing could be higher.

224
00:07:59,311 --> 00:08:02,053
- [Teacher] Okay. I think
you should try that.

225
00:08:03,013 --> 00:08:05,135
- [Boy in sweater] We can use this clock.

226
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:12,475
No we need some more.

227
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:15,178
- [Girl with glasses] I was
gonna get one of them books.

228
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,274
- [Teacher] Guys, you can use any state.

229
00:08:17,274 --> 00:08:20,175
So what are you doing to the hills?

230
00:08:20,175 --> 00:08:22,723
- [Kids] Making it bigger.

231
00:08:22,723 --> 00:08:25,202
- [Girl with glasses] So the
speed will go more faster.

232
00:08:25,202 --> 00:08:29,717
- [Teacher] More faster? So
that it'll increase the speed?

233
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,492
All right. Let's see what happens.

234
00:08:37,152 --> 00:08:39,476
Let's see if this one works.

235
00:08:39,476 --> 00:08:41,390
- [Videographer] Angel,
what are you doing?

236
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,857
- [Angel] Timing. Ready? One-- Oh.

237
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,436
- [Boy in sweater] We use good team work.

238
00:08:46,436 --> 00:08:48,315
- [Teacher] You are using good teamwork.

239
00:08:48,315 --> 00:08:49,976
I'm proud of it.

240
00:08:49,976 --> 00:08:52,580
- [Angel] Ready? Set. Go.

241
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,709
- [Boy in sweater] It didn't start 
from the beginning.

242
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:04,941
- [Angel] I did not start that one.

243
00:09:04,941 --> 00:09:06,101
- [Teacher] Let me ask you this.

244
00:09:06,101 --> 00:09:07,343
Just to give you a different idea

245
00:09:07,343 --> 00:09:08,702
because you've already tried to change

246
00:09:08,702 --> 00:09:11,303
in the elevation of your hill.

247
00:09:13,563 --> 00:09:16,225
- [Angel] Maybe how big the loop is.

248
00:09:16,225 --> 00:09:17,525
- [Teacher] How do you think that'll help?

249
00:09:17,525 --> 00:09:21,612
- So the-- will go faster
and will make it go through.

250
00:09:27,802 --> 00:09:30,633
- [Teacher] All right.
We're gonna try this.

251
00:09:34,196 --> 00:09:35,810
Help her out guys.

252
00:09:38,448 --> 00:09:40,245
So we're making the loop smaller

253
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:41,511
and that's gonna --

254
00:09:43,491 --> 00:09:47,595
So now you might want to move
this up a little bit there.

255
00:09:57,728 --> 00:09:59,770
You see how this is gonna have to go --

256
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,575
There you go.

257
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,600
- [Videographer] What about your taping?

258
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,690
If it's -- will the --
- [Teacher] Yeah.

259
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,492
Let's try again.

260
00:10:15,972 --> 00:10:19,647
Wait. We were gonna time that, honey.

261
00:10:20,757 --> 00:10:22,748
Now you're ready to go.

262
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:25,499
So what was the solution to your problem?

263
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,809
- [Girl with glasses] To make the loop smaller

264
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:31,455
so it would go through much faster.

265
00:10:31,455 --> 00:10:32,292
- [Teacher] All right. Good job.

266
00:10:32,292 --> 00:10:35,193
Now you're ready to time five trials.

267
00:10:35,193 --> 00:10:36,238
- [Angel] Ready? Go.

268
00:10:37,788 --> 00:10:38,918
- [Teacher] Look, how beautiful.

269
00:10:38,918 --> 00:10:40,583
Good job, guys.

270
00:10:44,989 --> 00:10:45,949
- [Girl with glasses] How many seconds?

271
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:46,891
- [Angel] Four.

272
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:49,107
- [Boy in sweater] Four seconds. That's good.

273
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,430
How many trials?

274
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,198
- [Girl] Three. We got two more.

275
00:10:56,824 --> 00:11:01,015
- [Teacher] I want to know. You got
three seconds on each one.

276
00:11:01,015 --> 00:11:03,291
So your speed was the same.

277
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:06,296
Where did your distance come from?

278
00:11:06,296 --> 00:11:09,652
- [Girl] We did how many feet

279
00:11:09,652 --> 00:11:12,776
and then we found out how many inches.

280
00:11:12,776 --> 00:11:16,514
- [Boy in glasses] And times it by 18
because it's 18 on there.

281
00:11:16,514 --> 00:11:18,870
- [Teacher] How long was each tube?

282
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,217
- [Kids] Six feet.

283
00:11:20,217 --> 00:11:21,656
- [Teacher] Six feet.

284
00:11:21,656 --> 00:11:24,249
How many inches is that?

285
00:11:26,409 --> 00:11:30,159
Let's work it out. Make sure
you've got it right on here.

286
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:32,277
- [Girl] 72.

287
00:11:32,277 --> 00:11:34,970
- [Teacher] So, you've got 72 inches.

288
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,687
- [Boy in glasses] We only did one tube.

289
00:11:36,687 --> 00:11:38,405
- [Teacher] And how many tubes are there?

290
00:11:38,405 --> 00:11:39,507
- [Boy in blue] There's three tubes.

291
00:11:39,507 --> 00:11:41,225
- [Teacher] So 72.

292
00:11:41,225 --> 00:11:42,851
What would you do next?

293
00:11:42,851 --> 00:11:44,244
- [Girl] Times three.

294
00:11:44,244 --> 00:11:46,913
- [Teacher] Yes. 72 times three.

295
00:11:46,913 --> 00:11:49,689
How did you guys get 216?

296
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:54,623
You did 18 inches instead of six?

297
00:11:54,623 --> 00:11:56,851
I mean 12. Okay.

298
00:11:56,851 --> 00:12:00,287
So now you'll have to go
back and redo your speed.

299
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:02,087
Figure in your speed.

300
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:03,527
So how do you find speed?

301
00:12:05,397 --> 00:12:06,606
- [Girl] I still got 216.

302
00:12:06,606 --> 00:12:08,534
- [Teacher] Well then you were right.

303
00:12:08,534 --> 00:12:10,648
That's right. So you guys are ready

304
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:14,955
to go on to make a graph.
Let's talk about the graph

305
00:12:14,955 --> 00:12:19,397
you're gonna make. Let's
talk about the graph

306
00:12:20,137 --> 00:12:22,315
Thinking about what you've learned in math

307
00:12:22,315 --> 00:12:24,560
and what you've been
doing with graphs in math

308
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,729
using this data table right here.

309
00:12:27,949 --> 00:12:29,053
What is this right here?

310
00:12:29,053 --> 00:12:31,014
- [Boy in blue] Time.

311
00:12:31,014 --> 00:12:31,932
- [Teacher] I want you guys to

312
00:12:31,932 --> 00:12:34,068
think about what we
talked about with graphs.

313
00:12:34,068 --> 00:12:36,088
I want you to decide what
kind of graph you should make.

314
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,630
- [Girl] Line graph because it's over time.

315
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,586
- [Boy with glasses] Yeah.
Line graph. I decided.

316
00:12:43,076 --> 00:12:44,626
Yeah we decided to put a line graph

317
00:12:44,626 --> 00:12:46,746
because it's time.

318
00:12:49,216 --> 00:12:51,132
- [Teacher] So any time you use time,

319
00:12:51,132 --> 00:12:52,468
the line graph is the one to use.

320
00:12:52,468 --> 00:12:53,964
Very, very good.

321
00:12:54,754 --> 00:12:56,455
- [Girl] Do we write the numbers on here?

322
00:12:56,455 --> 00:12:58,667
- [Teacher] Yeah. How are you gonna know

323
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:00,210
what numbers to put on there?

324
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,230
Think about it.

325
00:13:10,686 --> 00:13:15,642
You've got the trials,
the distance, the time,

326
00:13:15,642 --> 00:13:20,240
and the speed. Do you need to use these?

327
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,240
You're probably just gonna
use your trial and your speed.

328
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,296
So you'll label your line graph.

329
00:13:28,296 --> 00:13:31,760
One will be the trial and
one will be the speed.

330
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,658
And do you remember when you
did the race car activity?

331
00:13:34,658 --> 00:13:36,678
Not the race car activity. I'm sorry.

332
00:13:36,678 --> 00:13:40,718
Remember the Stanley the Sluggish Snail?

333
00:13:40,718 --> 00:13:42,877
What did that line graph look like?

334
00:13:42,877 --> 00:13:44,642
- [Girl on right] It was a straight line.

335
00:13:44,642 --> 00:13:47,300
- [Teacher] Because it
was a constant speed.

336
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,180
So what do you think
this is gonna look like?

337
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,813
- [Girl] Constant
speed. A straight line.

338
00:13:51,813 --> 00:13:52,840
- [Teacher] Good.

339
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,745
- [Boy in blue] Okay.

340
00:14:08,626 --> 00:14:12,188
- [Teacher] You've got your trial.
You got your times.

341
00:14:12,578 --> 00:14:14,488
Let's talk about your speed.

342
00:14:14,488 --> 00:14:16,044
First we need to look at your distance.

343
00:14:16,044 --> 00:14:18,342
How did you figure distance?

344
00:14:18,342 --> 00:14:22,278
- [Boy in jacket] We need
to divide by those speeds.

345
00:14:22,968 --> 00:14:24,825
- [Teacher] But your distance is

346
00:14:24,825 --> 00:14:27,449
how far the marble traveled; right?

347
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,796
- [Boy in jacket] 18.
- [Boy in white] Yeah.

348
00:14:28,796 --> 00:14:29,770
- [Teacher] 18?

349
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:34,770
- [Boy in jacket] Yeah because
you said each was six feet.

350
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,593
- [Teacher] Six feet.
You're doing it in inches.

351
00:14:38,593 --> 00:14:40,473
- [Kids] Oh.

352
00:14:40,473 --> 00:14:42,911
- [Teacher] So let's go
back and refigure that.

353
00:14:42,911 --> 00:14:46,731
I want you guys to talk
about how to do that.

354
00:14:46,731 --> 00:14:49,703
'Cause we want it in inches.

355
00:14:49,703 --> 00:14:51,247
So what is the first thing you would do?

356
00:14:51,247 --> 00:14:53,413
Y'all talk through it.

357
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,728
Y'all talk to each other.

358
00:14:56,728 --> 00:14:58,328
Let's talk about it.

359
00:15:00,371 --> 00:15:02,376
After you're done erasing.

360
00:15:03,866 --> 00:15:05,212
- [Boy in jacket] I was thinking like

361
00:15:05,212 --> 00:15:07,290
how many inches each--

362
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:10,030
- [Teacher] Okay. There
you go. Talk about it.

363
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,863
Anybody know how many
inches are in a foot?

364
00:15:11,863 --> 00:15:12,843
- [Boy in jacket] 16?

365
00:15:12,843 --> 00:15:14,675
- [Teacher] Nope. Try again.

366
00:15:14,675 --> 00:15:15,615
If you have a ruler.

367
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:16,682
- [Boy in jacket] 12.

368
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:17,937
- [Teacher] Yep. Good.

369
00:15:17,937 --> 00:15:20,130
- [Boy in jacket] So that's 12 x 3.

370
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,755
- [Teacher] Good.

371
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,172
- [Boy in jacket] 36.

372
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,232
- [Teacher] Okay. So 36 inches

373
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:29,731
and then how many of these are there?

374
00:15:29,731 --> 00:15:31,310
- [Boy in black] Three.

375
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,749
- [Teacher] Uh-huh.

376
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:36,777
- [Boy in black] 36 multiplied --
- [Teacher] six speed.

377
00:15:37,477 --> 00:15:40,734
So you need to do 6 x 12.

378
00:15:42,084 --> 00:15:44,366
- [Boy in black] 6 x 12 is --
- [Boy in jacket] 72.

379
00:15:44,366 --> 00:15:45,959
- [Teacher] Make sure you got it right.

380
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:47,645
12 x 6. Do it on your paper.

381
00:15:47,645 --> 00:15:49,560
- [Boy in jacket] I did it before. It is 72.

382
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,625
- [Teacher] So now you will do 72 times...

383
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:53,683
- [Kids] Three.

384
00:15:54,063 --> 00:15:56,830
- [Teacher] Good. Do it on your paper

385
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,780
72 x 3.

386
00:16:04,037 --> 00:16:06,081
- [Boy in white] It's 216 inches.

387
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:09,261
- [Teacher] Okay. Now
what are you gonna do?

388
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:10,444
- [Boy in white] Write it down.

389
00:16:10,444 --> 00:16:12,547
- [Teacher] And then what?

390
00:16:12,547 --> 00:16:15,420
- [Boy in white] Multiply 216 to this.

391
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,120
- [Teacher] So how will you figure speed now?

392
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:36,746
- [Boy in black] Divide.

393
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,950
- [Teacher] Divide what?

394
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,564
- [Boy in jacket] Three to 216.

395
00:16:41,564 --> 00:16:43,409
- [Teacher] Very good.

396
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:46,684
- [Videographer] Can you
tell me that again, Jeffrey?

397
00:16:46,754 --> 00:16:48,504
You're gonna do what?

398
00:16:48,504 --> 00:16:52,373
- [Boy in Jacket] Divide 216 into three.

399
00:16:53,033 --> 00:16:55,157
- [Teacher] And you'll only
have to do it how many times?

400
00:16:55,157 --> 00:16:56,051
- [Boy in jacket] One.

401
00:16:56,051 --> 00:16:59,226
- [Teacher] Because you got
the same speed each time.

402
00:17:00,717 --> 00:17:03,782
You can do three into 216.

403
00:17:06,982 --> 00:17:09,455
- [Boy in jacket] 72.

404
00:17:09,455 --> 00:17:13,307
- [Teacher] And no remainder.
That's nice. Isn't it?

405
00:17:14,806 --> 00:17:19,183
Now, knowing what we know about graphs,

406
00:17:19,183 --> 00:17:22,033
what we're doing in math.

407
00:17:22,596 --> 00:17:24,674
Jeffrey, are you listening?
Y'all stop writing

408
00:17:24,674 --> 00:17:26,990
for a minute and listen.

409
00:17:27,042 --> 00:17:30,467
Knowing what we know about graphs,

410
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,301
what we talked about in math,

411
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:36,527
and using this data and speed,

412
00:17:36,527 --> 00:17:39,208
what kind of graph do you
think you're gonna make?

413
00:17:39,728 --> 00:17:41,042
- [Boy in black] Line.

414
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:43,808
- [Teacher] Why did you say a line graph?

415
00:17:47,628 --> 00:17:50,401
- [Boy in black] Because it's the same.

416
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:58,622
- [Teacher] I want you to
think about this right here.

417
00:17:58,622 --> 00:18:03,139
Over time. We discussed we
need to use a line graph, okay?

418
00:18:03,139 --> 00:18:04,915
When you make your line graph,

419
00:18:04,915 --> 00:18:07,236
which two columns --
there's only two columns

420
00:18:07,236 --> 00:18:09,198
that you can use on there.

421
00:18:09,198 --> 00:18:11,114
Which two do you think you're gonna use?

422
00:18:11,114 --> 00:18:13,342
- [Boy in black] This one and --

423
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,259
- [Teacher] Well you've already figured that out.

424
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:18,470
This one and which other one?

425
00:18:20,842 --> 00:18:22,734
And speed, good. Right.

426
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:27,437
Because you were figuring
all this for speed.

427
00:18:27,437 --> 00:18:30,728
What do you think your
line's gonna look like?

428
00:18:30,895 --> 00:18:31,976
- [Boy in black] Straight.

429
00:18:31,976 --> 00:18:33,636
- [Teacher] Straight. Because
it was the same every time.

430
00:18:33,636 --> 00:18:35,636
Good.
