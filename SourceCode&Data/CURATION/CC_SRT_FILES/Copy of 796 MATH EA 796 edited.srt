2
00:00:36,981 --> 00:00:41,325
- Three, two, one, stop.

3
00:00:42,556 --> 00:00:46,563
Okay, were there pairs of you
who chose different things?

4
00:00:46,563 --> 00:00:48,111
- Um hmm.

5
00:00:48,111 --> 00:00:49,660
- And who wants to share?

6
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,162
- I said if I had to pick, I
would pick the green cylinder

7
00:00:53,162 --> 00:00:55,687
because the white would overflow easy,

8
00:00:55,687 --> 00:00:58,384
the pink you would have to
reach down far to get it.

9
00:00:58,384 --> 00:01:00,222
- Okay, Devon?

10
00:01:00,222 --> 00:01:04,061
- I would pick the pink one,
because it's like thin enough

11
00:01:04,061 --> 00:01:07,124
to be like a cup, and
you can do this with it.

12
00:01:07,124 --> 00:01:10,357
And it would be a lot easier
than just like doing this,

13
00:01:10,357 --> 00:01:13,589
especially because if
it gets on the bottom of

14
00:01:13,589 --> 00:01:16,854
the green one, it would
be hard to get it,

15
00:01:16,854 --> 00:01:18,538
and the white one,

16
00:01:18,538 --> 00:01:20,827
it might spill if you
walk around with it.

17
00:01:20,827 --> 00:01:22,511
Or you could trip.

18
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:24,531
- Okay, good. Layla?

19
00:01:24,531 --> 00:01:28,573
- But, well, I agreed with
Devon on the pink one,

20
00:01:28,573 --> 00:01:31,434
but I would rather have the
white one because it could

21
00:01:31,434 --> 00:01:34,146
carry more popcorn, but
it also is harder to hold,

22
00:01:34,146 --> 00:01:37,712
unless you were to like,
since it has more area,

23
00:01:37,712 --> 00:01:41,427
the white one has more area
than the pink or the green one.

24
00:01:41,427 --> 00:01:44,437
- More area you're talking this way?

25
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,811
- Yeah.
- Okay, so you're saying...

26
00:01:45,811 --> 00:01:48,003
- You take the popcorn
and you could like,

27
00:01:48,003 --> 00:01:50,938
you could make it even
on the bottom of it,

28
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:53,464
so it wouldn't necessarily be
overflowing unless you were,

29
00:01:53,464 --> 00:01:56,362
when you walk, for the popcorn thing.

30
00:01:56,362 --> 00:01:59,594
- Okay, all right. Brittany?

31
00:01:59,594 --> 00:02:02,009
- Me and Lani had the same answer,

32
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:04,944
we would think that, it sort
of relates to what Devon said,

33
00:02:04,944 --> 00:02:07,619
if we picked the green one, because,

34
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,885
and related to [inaudible].

35
00:02:09,885 --> 00:02:11,817
The pink one's gonna be
hard to reach down to

36
00:02:11,817 --> 00:02:13,674
get the rest of the popcorn.

37
00:02:13,674 --> 00:02:16,312
And the green one is wide
enough, and it can hold,

38
00:02:16,312 --> 00:02:19,656
it can still hold as much
popcorn as the pink one.

39
00:02:19,656 --> 00:02:22,145
But it's still gonna be hard
to get down the pink one,

40
00:02:22,145 --> 00:02:24,002
and the white one's just gonna spill.

41
00:02:24,002 --> 00:02:25,897
- Okay, all right.  Tiffany.

42
00:02:25,897 --> 00:02:27,755
- We thought that the green and pink one,

43
00:02:27,755 --> 00:02:30,689
it doesn't matter because
they're probably gonna hold

44
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:33,736
the same capacity since
they're the same shape,

45
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,745
it's just one's taller
and one's shorter,

46
00:02:36,745 --> 00:02:39,903
but the short one's wider
and the tall one's skinnier,

47
00:02:39,903 --> 00:02:42,392
it's tall but we thought that

48
00:02:42,392 --> 00:02:44,101
both of them can hold the same.

49
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:46,033
- So you said either one of these two?

50
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:48,005
It didn't matter, okay.

51
00:02:48,005 --> 00:02:49,751
Kylie?

52
00:02:49,751 --> 00:02:52,203
- I would want the green
cup because it's easier

53
00:02:52,203 --> 00:02:54,284
like to get your hand down it.

54
00:02:54,284 --> 00:02:55,696
The pink one looks like really skinny,

55
00:02:55,696 --> 00:02:58,333
so if you have big hands,
it would be hard to

56
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,117
get your hand down it.

57
00:03:00,117 --> 00:03:02,308
- Okay, all right, Amani?

58
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:04,686
- I think the green one becuase

59
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:07,472
when you look at it, the
old popcorn container,

60
00:03:07,472 --> 00:03:10,222
and the green one,
they're kinda the same,

61
00:03:10,222 --> 00:03:12,079
although the green one
is a little bit bigger,

62
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:13,974
so then you could get more.

63
00:03:13,974 --> 00:03:15,497
- Okay.

64
00:03:15,497 --> 00:03:17,912
- I said the green one also because

65
00:03:17,912 --> 00:03:21,404
the pink one is skinny, and
it if went to the same size

66
00:03:21,404 --> 00:03:23,967
as that, with the same amount of popcorn,

67
00:03:23,967 --> 00:03:27,237
it would be less popcorn in the
pink one than the green one.

68
00:03:27,237 --> 00:03:29,354
Do you know what I'm saying?

69
00:03:29,354 --> 00:03:30,543
- Say that again.

70
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,326
- Okay, I picked the green one because,

71
00:03:32,326 --> 00:03:34,444
say you fill them with popcorn,

72
00:03:34,444 --> 00:03:37,230
and then you take all the
popcorn that was in the pink one,

73
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,980
and you put it in the green one,

74
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,394
it's gonna be less
popcorn in the green one

75
00:03:42,394 --> 00:03:43,769
than the pink one.

76
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:45,961
And the white one, it's
just gonna fall over

77
00:03:45,961 --> 00:03:48,413
'cause it's too small, it's too flat.

78
00:03:48,413 --> 00:03:50,159
- Okay, hold on Josh.

79
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,614
Now, Tiffany said that she
felt they held the same amount.

80
00:03:53,614 --> 00:03:55,335
Did you say that?

81
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,152
- Mm-hmm.

82
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,712
- And why did you say that?

83
00:03:57,712 --> 00:04:01,019
- Because they're the same size paper,

84
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:03,731
except one, they're just folded different.

85
00:04:03,731 --> 00:04:06,480
- Okay, she said that because
they're the same size paper,

86
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,341
they're folded differently,
but she thinks that

87
00:04:09,341 --> 00:04:10,864
they're gonna hold the same amount.

88
00:04:10,864 --> 00:04:12,684
And you are disagreeing.
- Mm-hmm.

89
00:04:12,684 --> 00:04:14,876
- Okay, she's disagreeing,
saying that the green one's

90
00:04:14,876 --> 00:04:17,365
going to hold more, is that correct?

91
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:18,443
What you said?

92
00:04:18,443 --> 00:04:20,337
- I said, yeah, the green one
would hold more.

93
00:04:20,337 --> 00:04:22,344
- Okay, Josh what do you think?

94
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:25,241
- I said I would rather
have the green because

95
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:28,362
it would be a lot easier
to get the popcorn out,

96
00:04:28,362 --> 00:04:32,226
and because it might have
more volume than those two.

97
00:04:32,226 --> 00:04:33,898
Yeah.

98
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:37,018
- Okay, so let's change
our thinking here.

99
00:04:37,018 --> 00:04:41,328
Some of you did think about
which one is going to hold more.

100
00:04:41,328 --> 00:04:44,523
It didn't matter whether
your hand could get easier

101
00:04:44,523 --> 00:04:47,383
into this one, or Devon liked
this one 'cause he could

102
00:04:47,383 --> 00:04:49,761
tilt it up, he didn't
even have to have his hand

103
00:04:49,761 --> 00:04:53,328
in it at all, which is an
interesting way to look at it.

104
00:04:53,328 --> 00:04:56,745
A lot of you said you didn't
like this one because it

105
00:04:56,745 --> 00:05:00,312
would spill easily or whatnot.
Yes ma'am?

106
00:05:00,312 --> 00:05:02,950
- But unless you did what I suggested,

107
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,956
and you like evened it out on the bottom.

108
00:05:04,956 --> 00:05:06,962
- Yes, because you said
you liked this one,

109
00:05:06,962 --> 00:05:09,823
'cause you thought it held
more than the other two.

110
00:05:09,823 --> 00:05:13,166
- But you'd have to like
flat, not necessarily like,

111
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,284
squish the popcorn so it's flat,

112
00:05:15,284 --> 00:05:17,550
you'd have to like shake
things sideways,

113
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,705
so that it would even it out.

114
00:05:19,705 --> 00:05:22,417
Like food in a pan, you would shake it to

115
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:23,791
even it out on the bottom.

116
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,723
- Okay, all right.

117
00:05:25,723 --> 00:05:28,621
- Well it's kinda like
with the little kid packs,

118
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:32,893
there are things shaped
like that, and it has like,

119
00:05:32,893 --> 00:05:36,683
gummies and popcorn in it, and
I don't like it 'cause like,

120
00:05:36,683 --> 00:05:38,689
everyone would get the other ones,

121
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:41,587
it would have like more popcorn in it.

122
00:05:41,587 --> 00:05:43,073
- Okay, Tiffany?

123
00:05:43,073 --> 00:05:45,413
- What I would suggest
the white one is like,

124
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:47,642
even it's the same shape as
the other two pieces of paper,

125
00:05:47,642 --> 00:05:52,138
but it's folded so it's
taking less up space,

126
00:05:52,138 --> 00:05:53,512
but it's folded.

127
00:05:53,512 --> 00:05:56,484
- Because it overlaps here,
it does overlap here,

128
00:05:56,484 --> 00:05:59,642
with the white, you're right there.

129
00:05:59,642 --> 00:06:03,692
- But I disagree with Molly
because the popcorn amount

130
00:06:03,692 --> 00:06:06,032
that's inside of the,

131
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,561
inside the square ones at Newtown,

132
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:13,945
is the same amount as
one of the plastic ones.

133
00:06:13,945 --> 00:06:17,140
The exact same amount of popcorn,

134
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,927
'cause they actually use
those as measuring cups.

135
00:06:19,927 --> 00:06:21,561
I've watched them do it.

136
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:24,273
And I've watched them
actually use those cups,

137
00:06:24,273 --> 00:06:28,063
those hard ones, to fill the other cup,

138
00:06:28,063 --> 00:06:29,511
to fill the other ones.

139
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:32,112
- So you think that this
is going to hold the

140
00:06:32,112 --> 00:06:33,784
same amount as this?

141
00:06:33,784 --> 00:06:35,641
- All of them are gonna
hold the same amount because

142
00:06:35,641 --> 00:06:40,322
they used the hard plastic
ones, as measuring cups.

143
00:06:40,322 --> 00:06:42,031
- All right, Devon.

144
00:06:42,031 --> 00:06:45,932
- I agree with Layla,
like they're all the same.

145
00:06:45,932 --> 00:06:49,610
I think it just depends on
like who you are, kind of,

146
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,393
like which one you want.

147
00:06:51,393 --> 00:06:53,177
- Okay, but do you think
it would be unfair to say

148
00:06:53,177 --> 00:06:55,740
a certain gender would
have to have each one?

149
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,929
- Yeah.

150
00:06:56,929 --> 00:06:59,121
- So if you could choose,
that would be a good thing.

151
00:06:59,121 --> 00:07:02,650
Right, hold on a second,
let's move on a second,

152
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:06,105
and I'm gonna have MK
come up here and help me.

153
00:07:06,105 --> 00:07:09,412
We're gonna see if they
hold the same, okay?

154
00:07:09,412 --> 00:07:12,830
I want you, however, on
your paper, to write down,

155
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:17,511
you know, which one you
think holds the most,

156
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:21,709
do they hold the same, or
if you think they hold a

157
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:25,498
different amount, put 'em in
order, like which one is least,

158
00:07:25,498 --> 00:07:30,169
middle greatest, why don't
you do that real quick.

159
00:07:31,331 --> 00:07:33,783
Why don't you put 'em in
order, which one do you think?

160
00:07:40,656 --> 00:07:44,036
Okay, this is what she thinks,

161
00:07:44,036 --> 00:07:47,380
she thinks least, middle greatest.

162
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,535
Here's what we're going to do.

163
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:54,243
I do not have popcorn,
but I do have cereal.

164
00:07:56,668 --> 00:07:59,997
And hopefully, hopefully,

165
00:07:59,997 --> 00:08:03,118
MK can pour this.

166
00:08:03,118 --> 00:08:06,685
Hopefully, okay, so you're,
I'm gonna hold it.

167
00:08:06,685 --> 00:08:08,431
Or would you rather
hold it and me pour?

168
00:08:08,431 --> 00:08:11,403
- Wait, yeah, you might wanna pour it.

169
00:08:11,403 --> 00:08:14,449
- Okay, and just make sure
that the bottom stays.

170
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:16,074
Okay.

171
00:08:34,477 --> 00:08:36,595
We are smellin' the sugar up here!

172
00:08:36,595 --> 00:08:37,996
- Yeah.

173
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,000
- Okay, can you all see
that it's at the top?

174
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,375
- Yeah.

175
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,712
All right.

176
00:08:52,951 --> 00:08:55,403
Now, what we are going to do, so this is,

177
00:08:55,403 --> 00:08:58,784
this would be a full thing
of popcorn for the girls.

178
00:08:58,784 --> 00:09:01,422
We're gonna put this over top,

179
00:09:01,422 --> 00:09:06,106
and you're gonna lift it
up and see what happens.

180
00:09:06,106 --> 00:09:09,190
And some of you have
predicted that it's going to

181
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,753
be the same, right?

182
00:09:11,753 --> 00:09:15,431
How many have predicted
that they're all the same?

183
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:17,883
All the same?

184
00:09:17,883 --> 00:09:20,298
Okay.

185
00:09:20,298 --> 00:09:23,418
How many are predicting
that the green is bigger?

186
00:09:23,418 --> 00:09:26,873
Predicting that the green is bigger?

187
00:09:26,873 --> 00:09:30,774
Okay.  What about the white is biggest?

188
00:09:30,774 --> 00:09:33,041
Anybody predict the white is biggest?

189
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:37,313
Okay, why don't you lift this
up, I'll hold this this time.

190
00:09:37,313 --> 00:09:40,099
You gotta make sure that.

191
00:09:40,099 --> 00:09:43,331
- Pink's bigger.

192
00:09:43,331 --> 00:09:45,672
- Ooh!

193
00:09:49,317 --> 00:09:51,573
- Can you see?

194
00:09:54,578 --> 00:09:55,980
Can you see?

195
00:09:57,141 --> 00:10:00,745
So there's more room, right?

196
00:10:00,745 --> 00:10:03,309
There's more room in the green one.

197
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:06,136
Why?

198
00:10:06,136 --> 00:10:09,553
- Because the more space it has,

199
00:10:09,553 --> 00:10:12,005
the bigger around it is,

200
00:10:12,005 --> 00:10:14,940
the more cereal that could fit in it.

201
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,767
- So what is that called, around here?

202
00:10:18,767 --> 00:10:20,587
- Circumference?

203
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:23,522
- Well this is circumference,
but at the bottom.

204
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:24,711
- Volume?

205
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:27,089
- It is volume, 'cause
we're measuring volume.

206
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:30,655
But what is at the bottom of this.

207
00:10:30,655 --> 00:10:32,401
- Base?

208
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:35,225
- A base, is that what you're saying?

209
00:10:35,225 --> 00:10:38,123
That the base, it depends
on how big the base is?

210
00:10:38,123 --> 00:10:41,071
Well let's look to see

211
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:44,368
whether it'll fit in here.

212
00:10:46,384 --> 00:10:47,823
Okay.

213
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:52,392
- There it is.

214
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:56,070
Exact same room as the pink.

215
00:10:58,198 --> 00:11:00,055
- Well, do you think there's the exact

216
00:11:00,055 --> 00:11:01,727
same room as the pink?

217
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,548
- No.

218
00:11:03,548 --> 00:11:06,111
- I think the white has more.

219
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,340
- You think the white could fit more?

220
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,532
- Yeah.

221
00:11:10,532 --> 00:11:13,021
Okay, thank you MK, have a seat.

222
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:16,959
But what do we know
about this one now?

223
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,594
- It's the smallest.

224
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,080
- It's the smallest.

225
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,981
- Do you think we could
come up with a formula

226
00:11:23,981 --> 00:11:27,997
to figure out what
the numbers are here,

227
00:11:27,997 --> 00:11:30,523
and figure out what the formula,

228
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,161
or the volume is?

229
00:11:33,161 --> 00:11:37,443
- Like the length of it,
the length of the pink one?

230
00:11:37,443 --> 00:11:40,007
- Does anybody know what a standard size

231
00:11:40,007 --> 00:11:41,901
sheet of paper measures?

232
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:45,059
- Eight by

233
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:48,180
- Is it eight by 12?

234
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,372
- Eight by 12, eight by six?

235
00:11:50,372 --> 00:11:51,800
- Eight by 10?

236
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,692
- Eight by 10?

237
00:11:52,692 --> 00:11:53,413
Eight by 10?

238
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:54,267
- A foot?

239
00:11:54,267 --> 00:11:55,605
- A foot?

240
00:11:55,605 --> 00:11:57,462
- Eight by 11.

241
00:11:57,462 --> 00:12:01,883
- Okay, it is actually eight
and a half by 11, okay?

242
00:12:01,883 --> 00:12:05,227
Eight and a half, by 11.

243
00:12:05,227 --> 00:12:09,374
So our standard size paper

244
00:12:09,374 --> 00:12:12,718
is eight and a half by 11.

245
00:12:12,718 --> 00:12:14,538
Okay?

246
00:12:14,538 --> 00:12:17,064
So for our pink one.

247
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:25,312
What is, when we do this.

248
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:28,210
What is this?

249
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,810
- The circumference?

250
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,408
- Its' the circumference.

251
00:12:32,408 --> 00:12:34,488
What do we know about
the circumference then,

252
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:35,937
for the pink one?

253
00:12:35,937 --> 00:12:37,237
- That it's 8.5.

254
00:12:37,237 --> 00:12:39,466
- It is 8.5.

255
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:43,479
So circumference equals what?

256
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:45,559
- 8.5.

257
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:49,757
- The circumference equals 8.5.

258
00:12:49,757 --> 00:12:53,435
Are we then able to find out the diameter

259
00:12:53,435 --> 00:12:56,184
and the radius if we
have the circumference?

260
00:12:56,184 --> 00:13:00,419
- Yes.
- No.

261
00:13:01,544 --> 00:13:03,327
- You say yes?

262
00:13:03,327 --> 00:13:04,813
- Yeah, I know what you could do,

263
00:13:04,813 --> 00:13:08,082
you could divide it by 3.14
'cause that's how you get,

264
00:13:08,082 --> 00:13:12,578
'cause you know how it's
the opposite of times,

265
00:13:12,578 --> 00:13:15,624
so that you would do it,
and you would divide that

266
00:13:15,624 --> 00:13:19,674
by 8.4, no, 3.14,

267
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,903
and then you'll have the diameter,

268
00:13:21,903 --> 00:13:24,280
and then you can just take half of that,

269
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,692
and that'd be the radius.

270
00:13:25,692 --> 00:13:29,593
- Okay, all right, tell me Brittany,

271
00:13:29,593 --> 00:13:33,642
what is the formula for circumference?

272
00:13:33,642 --> 00:13:36,206
- Pi times d?

273
00:13:36,206 --> 00:13:40,593
- Circumference equals pi times d.

274
00:13:42,646 --> 00:13:47,364
I'm gonna ask someone to
restate what Kiki said.

275
00:13:47,364 --> 00:13:50,188
Does anyone agree with Kiki?

276
00:13:50,188 --> 00:13:52,082
- Yes, I do.

277
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:53,717
- And what did she say?

278
00:13:53,717 --> 00:13:57,952
- She said that you can divide
the circumference by 3.14.

279
00:13:57,952 --> 00:14:01,775
- Okay.  So we know the
circumference is 8.5,

280
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:03,707
correct?

281
00:14:03,707 --> 00:14:07,645
And we know that pi is what, Molly?

282
00:14:07,645 --> 00:14:09,131
- 3.14.

283
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:12,921
- 3.14, and we're trying to find the,

284
00:14:12,921 --> 00:14:15,013
the what, Devon?

285
00:14:15,013 --> 00:14:15,979
- Diameter?

286
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:18,060
- The diameter, okay?

287
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,961
So both Kiki and Maya
say you divide by 3.14.

288
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:24,970
Is that what we do?

289
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,530
Treyshawn?

290
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,351
- Yes.

291
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:32,771
- So if I divide this side by 3.14,

292
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:37,007
and I divide this side by 3.14,

293
00:14:37,007 --> 00:14:40,313
what happens to this right here, India?

294
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:44,028
- It would get smaller.

295
00:14:44,028 --> 00:14:45,811
- It gets smaller.

296
00:14:45,811 --> 00:14:47,558
- Yes, if you divide it.

297
00:14:47,558 --> 00:14:52,489
- Okay, what is 3.14 divided by 3.14?

298
00:14:55,211 --> 00:14:56,474
- One.
- Sure.

299
00:14:56,474 --> 00:14:57,950
[laughter]
