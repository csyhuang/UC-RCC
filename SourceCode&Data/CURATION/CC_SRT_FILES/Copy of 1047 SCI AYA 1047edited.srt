1
00:00:00,017 --> 00:00:01,085
- Hello, guys.

2
00:00:01,085 --> 00:00:02,757
After all the hard work you've put in

3
00:00:02,757 --> 00:00:06,368
on doing your presentations,
and your tri-board,

4
00:00:06,368 --> 00:00:08,794
and all the really cool stuff you've done,

5
00:00:08,794 --> 00:00:10,629
now we need to put it all together

6
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:14,599
and see what you think
about these energy sources

7
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:18,407
that you've done all
this research for. Okay?

8
00:00:18,407 --> 00:00:20,311
So, first off, doing a little poll.

9
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:25,277
Which energy source do you like the best

10
00:00:25,277 --> 00:00:28,017
and think it would be the best one to use?

11
00:00:28,017 --> 00:00:29,306
- Solar energy.

12
00:00:29,306 --> 00:00:30,177
- Why?

13
00:00:30,177 --> 00:00:33,625
- It looks pretty cool, and, I don't know,

14
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,262
it seems like the most efficient way

15
00:00:35,262 --> 00:00:36,493
because the sun's always there

16
00:00:36,493 --> 00:00:39,325
and the sun won't run out--

17
00:00:39,325 --> 00:00:42,367
- That's the word, whenever
you're done using it--

18
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:43,435
- You can sell it.

19
00:00:43,435 --> 00:00:44,503
- You can keep the energy from the sun

20
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:46,907
from the morning and
afternoon during the night.

21
00:00:46,907 --> 00:00:48,532
- You can sell it.

22
00:00:48,532 --> 00:00:50,401
- Okay, so he thinks solar. Who else?

23
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:52,312
- Okay.

24
00:00:52,312 --> 00:00:53,842
- Go ahead.

25
00:00:53,842 --> 00:00:55,846
- I like the wind.

26
00:00:55,846 --> 00:00:58,716
- (chair squeeks) Oh,
so you can talk to him.

27
00:00:58,716 --> 00:01:00,711
Because you want to be able
to talk to each other, right?

28
00:01:00,711 --> 00:01:02,323
I liked the wind one

29
00:01:02,323 --> 00:01:05,226
because it stored up the battery.

30
00:01:05,226 --> 00:01:07,443
And the battery, whenever it wasn't windy,

31
00:01:07,443 --> 00:01:09,661
and so it kind of was always there.

32
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:11,066
It didn't matter about the wind.

33
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:13,899
- Yeah, you can answer the question.

34
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:17,196
- [Female student] I also
think that wind's the best one

35
00:01:17,196 --> 00:01:18,334
because not only can you store it

36
00:01:18,334 --> 00:01:21,306
and have energy for
whenever there is no wind,

37
00:01:21,306 --> 00:01:23,568
you can also make money off of that.

38
00:01:23,568 --> 00:01:26,344
So, maybe if you get it in enough homes,

39
00:01:26,344 --> 00:01:28,074
you won't even have to have a job.

40
00:01:28,074 --> 00:01:29,804
You can make money off that.

41
00:01:29,804 --> 00:01:31,650
- [Teacher] That's a very good point.

42
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,078
That's a very good point,

43
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:34,889
making money off of that energy source.

44
00:01:34,889 --> 00:01:37,049
Which other ones did we
say could make money?

45
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:42,049
- Um, the solar. Solar can
make money (students interject).

46
00:01:42,889 --> 00:01:44,526
- Well, I like the wind.

47
00:01:44,526 --> 00:01:49,263
Because, it's like, the sun
is going to burn up one day,

48
00:01:49,263 --> 00:01:51,805
but the wind is always going to be there.

49
00:01:51,805 --> 00:01:54,104
And the only bad thing about it is

50
00:01:54,104 --> 00:01:55,869
that the birds are going to die,

51
00:01:55,869 --> 00:01:58,643
but that's okay. (laughter around the room)

52
00:01:58,643 --> 00:02:01,140
- [Teacher] Okay, well, what
are some pros and cons then?

53
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,215
So, you just said birds would
die if we use wind power, okay?

54
00:02:05,215 --> 00:02:09,789
Does that outweigh the benefit
that you get from using wind power?

55
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:13,318
(students answer over one
another, mostly disagreeing)

56
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:16,987
- I think birds dying isn't that bad,

57
00:02:16,987 --> 00:02:18,926
because, you know, we eat birds,

58
00:02:18,926 --> 00:02:21,295
so I don't think it would
be that bad if birds do die.

59
00:02:21,295 --> 00:02:23,524
I mean, I don't think a
lot of birds die because of

60
00:02:23,524 --> 00:02:24,731
the wind solar energy.

61
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:28,632
Not as much as oil, or
any of that other stuff.

62
00:02:28,632 --> 00:02:31,372
- Yeah, or like we eat birds.

63
00:02:33,832 --> 00:02:36,771
- The other one I like is the hydro one

64
00:02:36,771 --> 00:02:38,744
that James did, because--

65
00:02:38,744 --> 00:02:41,309
(students agreeing and disagreeing)

66
00:02:41,309 --> 00:02:44,612
- [Male student in grey] His
was ridiculous. That was nice.

67
00:02:44,612 --> 00:02:46,374
- [Teacher] So, what part of it

68
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,030
were you most impressed with?

69
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,997
Like, not like the demonstration,

70
00:02:48,997 --> 00:02:50,390
but it was a great demonstration,

71
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,631
but hydroelectric power in general,

72
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:54,233
what part of that--

73
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:56,067
- [Female Student] Like how if
you have a pond or something,

74
00:02:56,067 --> 00:02:57,565
you can put it in there,

75
00:02:57,565 --> 00:03:00,967
and then it will power up your whole house.

76
00:03:00,967 --> 00:03:02,836
- [Teacher] Do we need moving water?

77
00:03:02,836 --> 00:03:05,738
- Oh yeah, you need
moving water to have that.

78
00:03:05,738 --> 00:03:10,738
You'd have to have a stream, but you could

79
00:03:11,207 --> 00:03:13,784
basically do it anywhere
you have moving water.

80
00:03:13,784 --> 00:03:16,814
And if you really wanted
to spend some money,

81
00:03:16,814 --> 00:03:18,707
there's also the pump storage plant

82
00:03:18,707 --> 00:03:22,637
from a high reservoir to a low reservoir.

83
00:03:24,523 --> 00:03:27,391
- [Teacher] So, that one
actually sounds pretty good.

84
00:03:27,391 --> 00:03:29,562
So, somebody want to defend theirs, Rakif?

85
00:03:29,562 --> 00:03:32,732
- I don't really like mine, because--

86
00:03:32,732 --> 00:03:34,903
- [Teacher] Which one did you do?

87
00:03:34,903 --> 00:03:37,167
- [Rakif] I did oil.
- [Other Student] Natural Gas.

88
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:39,210
- [Teacher] Oil and
natural gas, okay. Why not?

89
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,079
- Because mine isn't as abundant

90
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:43,610
as the wind or as the solar energy,

91
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:46,977
so it's probably going
to run out pretty soon.

92
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:50,414
Like oil, natural gas,
and coal do run out.

93
00:03:50,414 --> 00:03:54,082
They're not going to be as,
here as much as the wind,

94
00:03:54,082 --> 00:03:58,425
or hydro or something like that.

95
00:03:58,425 --> 00:04:01,130
- Well, there's a lot of
dangers involved with using oil, right?

96
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,706
Oil rigs, pipelines, lots
of dangers involved, right?

97
00:04:04,706 --> 00:04:08,943
- Oil prices can cause high gas prices.

98
00:04:08,943 --> 00:04:11,068
- [Teacher] That's true too.

99
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:12,542
Remember in your presentation,

100
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:13,982
you talk about some of the dangers.

101
00:04:13,982 --> 00:04:14,876
What were those dangers,

102
00:04:14,876 --> 00:04:18,045
and are those dangers any better or worse

103
00:04:18,045 --> 00:04:19,810
than some of the other dangers

104
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,575
for the other energy sources?

105
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:23,189
- For oil?

106
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:24,617
- Yeah.

107
00:04:24,617 --> 00:04:28,622
- The pipelines can burst,
and they can kill marine life

108
00:04:28,622 --> 00:04:30,178
in the water if the oil gets out.

109
00:04:30,178 --> 00:04:32,094
- They could cause another oil spill.

110
00:04:32,094 --> 00:04:33,696
- Explosions.

111
00:04:33,696 --> 00:04:37,063
- But coal, I know you're supposed to like

112
00:04:37,063 --> 00:04:39,338
stick up for your natural resource,

113
00:04:39,338 --> 00:04:43,042
but I kind of think coal can be good,

114
00:04:43,042 --> 00:04:44,412
but it's mostly bad,

115
00:04:44,412 --> 00:04:47,512
because a lot of people's
lives are getting killed

116
00:04:47,512 --> 00:04:49,683
because of all the gasses, smells,

117
00:04:49,683 --> 00:04:52,481
and being down there for so long.

118
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:54,849
And I think that's also very bad.

119
00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:59,122
- And the land, it hurts the land

120
00:04:59,122 --> 00:05:02,361
and the environment.

121
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:07,028
- Coal is a very dirty resource

122
00:05:07,028 --> 00:05:08,026
if you think about it.

123
00:05:08,026 --> 00:05:10,267
All the coal dust, it can
cause a lot of lung problems.

124
00:05:10,267 --> 00:05:12,798
So, the miners that go down there,

125
00:05:12,798 --> 00:05:14,609
they're risking their lives right?

126
00:05:14,609 --> 00:05:15,596
- Yeah.

127
00:05:15,596 --> 00:05:18,603
- Any of the other resources as
dangerous as mining coal?

128
00:05:18,603 --> 00:05:20,472
- No.

129
00:05:20,472 --> 00:05:23,340
- [Student] Nuclear energy.
- [Teacher] What?

130
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,605
- Nuclear energy is the worst.

131
00:05:24,605 --> 00:05:26,486
- [Teacher] Okay, what
about nuclear energy?

132
00:05:26,486 --> 00:05:29,354
How dangerous was that
when you looked it up?

133
00:05:29,354 --> 00:05:33,522
- It's a six out of ten chance.

134
00:05:33,522 --> 00:05:35,856
- [Teacher] Of what happening?

135
00:05:35,856 --> 00:05:40,856
- It depends. It costs way
too much, first of all,

136
00:05:40,859 --> 00:05:41,869
to build it.

137
00:05:41,869 --> 00:05:43,495
- [Teacher] It is very
expensive. That's true.

138
00:05:43,495 --> 00:05:45,434
- It's got a lot of risks, like
if it gets into your water,

139
00:05:45,434 --> 00:05:49,404
or if you breathe in
the radiation. (mumbles)

140
00:05:56,444 --> 00:05:59,517
- [Rakif] I imagine it could--
- [Student] It smells bad.

141
00:05:59,517 --> 00:06:02,083
(chair crashing against the floor).
(mumbles)

142
00:06:02,223 --> 00:06:06,285
- [Male Student] Okay, does
collecting oil use more energy

143
00:06:06,285 --> 00:06:07,620
than it provides?

144
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,732
- [Teacher] Good question!

145
00:06:10,732 --> 00:06:13,031
- What do you mean by collecting oil?

146
00:06:13,031 --> 00:06:15,933
- [Male Student] Like, if you have to have

147
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:17,164
the process of going underground

148
00:06:17,164 --> 00:06:18,859
and drilling the oil,

149
00:06:18,859 --> 00:06:21,401
does it use more energy than it provides?

150
00:06:21,401 --> 00:06:24,536
- No, I don't think so.

151
00:06:24,536 --> 00:06:28,472
Because in my presentation,
it said it produces

152
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:31,909
like a widespread, like a
very large amount of energy.

153
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:34,486
And also that, your wave and tidal power

154
00:06:34,486 --> 00:06:36,181
powers our system,

155
00:06:36,181 --> 00:06:38,143
as you said in your presentation.

156
00:06:38,143 --> 00:06:39,989
[Teacher] Oh, good point.

157
00:06:39,989 --> 00:06:41,719
Those two actually work together.

158
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:43,786
When you talk about the
wave and tidal power,

159
00:06:43,786 --> 00:06:46,258
that energy could be harnessed

160
00:06:46,258 --> 00:06:48,964
to run your offshore drilling.

161
00:06:48,964 --> 00:06:51,866
So, that's a very good thing as well.

162
00:06:51,866 --> 00:06:53,967
- It's a benefit of drilling.

163
00:06:53,967 --> 00:06:57,044
- Absolutely. Are there different energies

164
00:06:57,044 --> 00:06:58,920
that do benefit each other?

165
00:07:02,315 --> 00:07:04,347
- Yes, the solar energy and wind.

166
00:07:04,347 --> 00:07:09,347
Because the wind energy is based off the sun,

167
00:07:09,548 --> 00:07:14,548
because of how the sun
waves come onto the Earth

168
00:07:14,656 --> 00:07:17,396
and then it turns this sun mill,

169
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:22,396
so it produces the turning of the mill,

170
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:26,766
so the sun and solar
energy and wind energy--

171
00:07:26,766 --> 00:07:28,972
(loud bell tone sounds)

172
00:07:28,972 --> 00:07:31,804
- The solar energy and the wind,

173
00:07:31,804 --> 00:07:34,010
they actually work together,

174
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,682
because I've seen some wind turbines

175
00:07:35,682 --> 00:07:38,399
that have solar energy panels on the top.

176
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,888
One, then the other can go. That's okay.

177
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,395
- I think solar energy
is a really good thing,

178
00:07:48,395 --> 00:07:50,496
because for a lot of power plants,

179
00:07:50,496 --> 00:07:55,496
like for times, the condition
of natural resources like wind,

180
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:03,519
even hydroelectric if there's
a drought or something,

181
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,938
or not enough water flow,

182
00:08:05,938 --> 00:08:10,709
you could always have the solar panels

183
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:13,902
stuck on top of the plant, or anywhere.

184
00:08:13,902 --> 00:08:16,189
- Right, because we've found that solar

185
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:17,153
is pretty cost-feasible right?

186
00:08:17,153 --> 00:08:19,579
- Yeah, it's not that expensive.

187
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:22,854
And actually, you won't have
to pay an electrical bill

188
00:08:22,854 --> 00:08:24,560
if you get that.

189
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,463
- If you were going to use solar panels

190
00:08:27,463 --> 00:08:30,435
to power a wind turbine or something,

191
00:08:33,135 --> 00:08:36,467
you're better off just using the solar panel.
 It would just cost more money

192
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:39,311
to have to get the solar
panels and the wind turbine,

193
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:43,049
or to have the solar
panels power the turbine.

194
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:44,176
- It doesn't power it.

195
00:08:44,176 --> 00:08:46,881
It's just, like, another way to get energy

196
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:48,982
at the same time that
you're getting the wind.

197
00:08:48,982 --> 00:08:52,918
When there's no wind,
there's not much of a wind--

198
00:08:52,918 --> 00:08:55,874
- [Student on far left]
That's what the battery's for.

199
00:08:56,989 --> 00:08:58,000
Hmm, interesting.

200
00:08:58,144 --> 00:09:01,602
- I have a question for solar power, too.

201
00:09:01,602 --> 00:09:05,573
For solar power, how can I make aluminum

202
00:09:05,573 --> 00:09:07,604
more efficient in the future?

203
00:09:07,604 --> 00:09:12,604
- Well, it doesn't use a lot of the gas,

204
00:09:12,841 --> 00:09:17,841
so it doesn't affect the environment.

205
00:09:18,982 --> 00:09:23,185
So, it doesn't affect your breathing.

206
00:09:23,185 --> 00:09:26,157
And you don't need solar panels,

207
00:09:26,157 --> 00:09:28,456
like you don't need to turn
stuff on during the day,

208
00:09:28,456 --> 00:09:30,163
because the sun, through the windows,

209
00:09:30,163 --> 00:09:33,762
can give you light, and then
can store up for the night.

210
00:09:33,762 --> 00:09:35,828
- Okay.

211
00:09:35,828 --> 00:09:38,127
- I have a question.

212
00:09:38,127 --> 00:09:41,064
What natural resource do you think

213
00:09:41,064 --> 00:09:43,235
will be the most used in the future?

214
00:09:43,235 --> 00:09:45,279
Like, 50 or so years from now?

215
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,775
(students talking over each other)

216
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:52,709
- Wind. It was used like 3,000 years ago,

217
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:54,753
so if it was used 3,000 years ago,

218
00:09:54,753 --> 00:09:57,191
I think it would be used
3,000 years in the future.

219
00:10:00,501 --> 00:10:03,588
- That's not necessarily
true, because it could get

220
00:10:03,588 --> 00:10:06,200
more worn out by the time 3000 years

221
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,232
in the future comes.

222
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:12,237
- The problem with the
wind thing is (coughing)

223
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:15,569
it can be used in
country, like rural areas,

224
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:19,203
because in other areas,

225
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:22,279
you can't put a wind turbine
in a normal neighborhood.

226
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:24,539
Because you can't, can you put one?

227
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:26,978
(students overlap, disagreeing)

228
00:10:26,978 --> 00:10:29,080
- You mean I could put one
outside the school here?

229
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,584
(students argue)

230
00:10:36,314 --> 00:10:38,487
- [Student 1] Well, it would
give energy to the school

231
00:10:38,487 --> 00:10:41,633
and the rest of the houses
that are near the school.

232
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:44,002
- [Student 2] Well, I'd put
it on top of the school,

233
00:10:44,002 --> 00:10:46,498
because then there would
be more wind higher up.

234
00:10:46,498 --> 00:10:48,773
- Right, and we have
to worry about spacing, right?

235
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,838
Because we were saying wind
power is built usually where?

236
00:10:53,838 --> 00:10:56,838
On wind farms, where you
have a lot of flat land.

237
00:10:57,016 --> 00:10:59,048
Because if you build in
a mountainous region,

238
00:10:59,048 --> 00:11:00,813
are you going to get a lot of the wind?

239
00:11:00,813 --> 00:11:03,483
(students answering all at once)

240
00:11:03,483 --> 00:11:06,560
[Student on left side of
room] If it's high enough it'll 
probably be enough.

241
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,322
- Then if you build your wind
turbine high up on a mountain,

242
00:11:10,322 --> 00:11:12,179
what is the chance of that wind turbine

243
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:13,781
maybe getting struck by lightning,

244
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:16,068
or being damaged that way?

245
00:11:16,068 --> 00:11:18,332
- [Student on Left] Yeah,
that could be a real problem

246
00:11:18,332 --> 00:11:22,472
because of the wind and the
way it could be struck down.

247
00:11:22,472 --> 00:11:26,506
- Right, that's very possible.
So, when you think about one

248
00:11:26,506 --> 00:11:29,281
(bell tones)
energy source,

249
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:31,637
is there really one
energy source to go with?

250
00:11:31,637 --> 00:11:33,437
Or do you have to take into consideration

251
00:11:33,437 --> 00:11:36,885
a lot of factors of where
you live, what's available?

252
00:11:36,885 --> 00:11:39,927
Because, again, talking about
building a hydroelectric plant

253
00:11:39,927 --> 00:11:41,727
we established you need running water.

254
00:11:41,727 --> 00:11:44,896
Is there running water everywhere
around the United States?

255
00:11:44,896 --> 00:11:46,359
[Several students] No.

256
00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:49,795
- No. And what's the problem
if you flood an area,

257
00:11:49,795 --> 00:11:51,200
even if there is a running water,

258
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,464
what happens if you flood the area?

259
00:11:54,444 --> 00:11:57,365
- Well, they have to decide.

260
00:11:57,365 --> 00:12:02,365
Usually if it's going to be a major problem,

261
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,154
they will actually dig
a separate reservoir

262
00:12:07,154 --> 00:12:09,185
for the river to flood

263
00:12:09,185 --> 00:12:13,179
instead of it coming up on the banks

264
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:17,997
of the river and destroying
homes and things.

265
00:12:17,997 --> 00:12:22,997
That's mostly our United States rule.

266
00:12:23,094 --> 00:12:26,031
But, in China, they really don't care.

267
00:12:26,031 --> 00:12:30,768
So they flood three or four
cities, multiple towns,

268
00:12:30,768 --> 00:12:35,378
fill up three gorges of water.

269
00:12:35,378 --> 00:12:37,572
- Wow. That's just insane.

270
00:12:37,572 --> 00:12:39,476
Because once you disrupt water flow,

271
00:12:39,476 --> 00:12:41,345
you have a problem.

272
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:43,052
So again, there are some
pros and cons to these.

273
00:12:43,052 --> 00:12:44,758
Okay, we're going to take a second,

274
00:12:44,758 --> 00:12:47,789
and we're going to try
to rank the resources

275
00:12:47,789 --> 00:12:49,588
in terms of which one you guys think

276
00:12:49,588 --> 00:12:51,690
is the best one to possibly use.

277
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,766
So, if you had to pick one
that you wanted to go with,

278
00:12:54,766 --> 00:12:56,264
whether there was running water,

279
00:12:56,264 --> 00:12:58,203
think you have those things beside you,

280
00:12:58,203 --> 00:12:59,596
don't limit yourself there,

281
00:12:59,596 --> 00:13:01,337
but turn to your neighbor for a minute,

282
00:13:01,337 --> 00:13:04,043
and discuss which one you
think would be like 1 and 2.

283
00:13:04,043 --> 00:13:07,409
Because each one of you might
have a different opinion.

284
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:10,382
Give each other a
little bit of a reason why,

285
00:13:10,382 --> 00:13:12,518
and we'll get back
together in just a second.

286
00:13:12,518 --> 00:14:01,371
(students discussing in pairs)

287
00:14:05,141 --> 00:14:08,582
- [Teacher] Alright
guys, another 30 seconds.
Then we'll get back together.

288
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:25,510
(students continue discussing)

289
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,660
[Teacher] Alright, three, two, one.

290
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,390
Let's wrap up our
conversations. Alright.

291
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,898
How many people, by show of hands,

292
00:14:35,898 --> 00:14:39,265
went with one of the
non-renewable resources,

293
00:14:39,265 --> 00:14:41,807
like coal, oil, or natural gas?

294
00:14:41,807 --> 00:14:42,805
Cool!

295
00:14:42,805 --> 00:14:44,942
So, everybody picked a renewable resource

296
00:14:44,942 --> 00:14:46,672
as the way to go.

297
00:14:46,672 --> 00:14:48,309
Alright, Ryan?

298
00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:52,140
- I think it's either wind or solar power.

299
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,681
- [Teacher] How many people agree?

300
00:14:55,681 --> 00:14:58,920
- Oh, so wind or solar
is the clear choice.

301
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,383
Jonah, why?

302
00:15:00,383 --> 00:15:02,287
- The thing is, I think
solar would be first.

303
00:15:02,287 --> 00:15:04,801
Because solar energy, you can use

304
00:15:04,801 --> 00:15:06,490
almost anywhere, pretty much.

305
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:11,490
But the wind, if you live here, 
you can't get it as easily,

306
00:15:11,935 --> 00:15:14,141
because there's not as much wind.

307
00:15:14,141 --> 00:15:16,939
So, it would be a lot
easier to have solar,

308
00:15:16,939 --> 00:15:18,866
because you can use solar anywhere,

309
00:15:18,866 --> 00:15:21,014
because the sun is shining
pretty much everywhere.

310
00:15:21,014 --> 00:15:22,512
- We think solar too,

311
00:15:22,512 --> 00:15:27,512
because the sun is always there,

312
00:15:28,851 --> 00:15:31,985
even if it is winter,
or it's a little cloudy,

313
00:15:31,985 --> 00:15:33,889
the sun is still there.

314
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:36,153
- [Student] Yeah, but
what about at night time?

315
00:15:37,483 --> 00:15:40,635
- [Teacher] So, Maddy, what
did we find out about solar?

316
00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:43,061
- At night time, like a
lot of people go to work

317
00:15:43,061 --> 00:15:45,128
during the day, so no one's at their house

318
00:15:45,128 --> 00:15:47,601
using their lights and stuff.

319
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:50,376
So, there's a battery that
stores all the energy and

320
00:15:50,376 --> 00:15:52,105
then you can come home at night

321
00:15:52,105 --> 00:15:54,439
and you can still power your house.

322
00:15:54,439 --> 00:15:57,783
(students talking over each other)

323
00:15:57,783 --> 00:15:59,582
- You still get some light at night,

324
00:16:01,972 --> 00:16:03,856
bouncing off the moon.

325
00:16:03,856 --> 00:16:05,749
[Teacher] Dustin, what do you think?

326
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:08,152
- I was thinking that
solar energy would be great

327
00:16:08,152 --> 00:16:10,126
because I was comparing it to

328
00:16:10,126 --> 00:16:11,856
if you want to charge your phone,

329
00:16:11,856 --> 00:16:13,330
and you have it plugged in,

330
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,932
and while it's plugged
in it's fully charged

331
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,302
and you can still use it,

332
00:16:16,302 --> 00:16:17,556
and it won't un-charge

333
00:16:17,556 --> 00:16:19,530
because it's still plugged into the wall.

334
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,004
But, if the power goes out at your house,

335
00:16:21,004 --> 00:16:22,839
then it will stop charging,

336
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:24,336
and you'll have that much battery left.

337
00:16:24,336 --> 00:16:25,834
So, it's kind of like if
you're out in the day,

338
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:27,680
and your house is charging

339
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,410
while there's still sun.

340
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,977
So, you're still getting energy,

341
00:16:30,977 --> 00:16:32,777
and at night time when the sun is gone,

342
00:16:32,777 --> 00:16:34,519
you'll have that energy saved

343
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:36,690
in the battery of the solar thing.

344
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,990
- [Female student] Well,
it's the same thing

345
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,849
with wind power.

346
00:16:38,849 --> 00:16:40,149
You'd still have that battery there.

347
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:43,000
- Yeah. Wind power would be--

348
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,161
- Would solar power still
work during a storm?

349
00:16:46,161 --> 00:16:51,095
- It depends how severe the storm is.

350
00:16:53,605 --> 00:16:56,707
- So, you mean this is,
like, built to last.

351
00:16:57,707 --> 00:16:59,969
- Yeah, if it gets struck by lightning,

352
00:16:59,969 --> 00:17:01,548
I don't think it would still work.

353
00:17:01,548 --> 00:17:04,448
- [Teacher] But, you know,
when there are clouds

354
00:17:04,448 --> 00:17:05,853
outside during the day on a cloudy day,

355
00:17:05,853 --> 00:17:07,118
you know the solar radiation is still

356
00:17:07,118 --> 00:17:08,279
getting through the clouds,
right? (students agree)

357
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:11,913
So, that solar panel would
still be getting energy

358
00:17:11,913 --> 00:17:14,518
from the sun on a cloudy
day, just at night

359
00:17:14,518 --> 00:17:16,422
you would still have to use
the battery that's been stored.

360
00:17:16,422 --> 00:17:18,326
Just like with wind power.

361
00:17:18,326 --> 00:17:20,357
There is wind power all
day long, all night long,

362
00:17:20,357 --> 00:17:22,366
but sometimes it does die
down at certain times,

363
00:17:22,366 --> 00:17:26,569
so there's a battery too,
there as well. Exactly.

364
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:29,262
- I agree with solar power, but

365
00:17:29,262 --> 00:17:33,442
I agree that it would be great
for being on your houses and things,

366
00:17:33,442 --> 00:17:38,442
but I don't see the
purpose of a solar farm.

367
00:17:38,817 --> 00:17:41,116
It takes up a lot of land.

368
00:17:41,116 --> 00:17:45,121
Just the point to collect the sun,

369
00:17:45,121 --> 00:17:48,651
I think it would be better
putting it on a house

370
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:51,588
or combining it with another power plant,

371
00:17:51,588 --> 00:17:55,199
like wind power or something
like that, because--

372
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:59,425
- [Female student] And
cost-wise it would be probably

373
00:17:59,425 --> 00:18:02,928
expensive, because it was 900
for just one of those panels.

374
00:18:03,928 --> 00:18:06,275
And Miss Shonda said it would take

375
00:18:06,275 --> 00:18:08,446
about 12 just for one house.

376
00:18:08,446 --> 00:18:13,438
- That's basically about 10,800.

377
00:18:13,438 --> 00:18:15,482
- For one house.

378
00:18:15,482 --> 00:18:20,482
- But we also think that
solar panels blend in more

379
00:18:21,124 --> 00:18:22,622
than winter lines.

380
00:18:22,622 --> 00:18:26,929
Just imagine random winter
lines in your front yard.

381
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:31,929
- Yeah, but we saw pictures, or a video,

382
00:18:32,037 --> 00:18:35,741
of a solar-powered house, and most people

383
00:18:35,741 --> 00:18:37,842
don't like solar panels because it

384
00:18:37,842 --> 00:18:39,909
looks unattractive on
the top of your house.

385
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:42,045
Same with the wind power, wind turbines

386
00:18:42,045 --> 00:18:43,183
would look unattractive.

387
00:18:43,183 --> 00:18:45,482
But you can still
decorate them if you want.

388
00:18:45,482 --> 00:18:49,314
You can't really do that
with the wind power,

389
00:18:49,314 --> 00:18:52,891
I mean solar power thing, because it's mostly black.

390
00:18:52,891 --> 00:18:54,388
- [Teacher] That's a good thought.

391
00:18:54,388 --> 00:18:58,126
So, going forward, thinking
of an energy solution,

392
00:18:58,126 --> 00:18:59,461
because as you guys get older,

393
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:02,364
energy is going to be something
you have to worry about.

394
00:19:02,364 --> 00:19:03,864
We've seen the gas prices.

395
00:19:03,864 --> 00:19:05,629
The gasoline prices
for regular cars go up.

396
00:19:05,629 --> 00:19:08,276
You've seen the ethanol being developed.

397
00:19:08,276 --> 00:19:12,009
Is it good to keep
developing new technologies?

398
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,671
How many of you guys,
once you start driving,

399
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:18,016
think if you could do it
or your parents could do it

400
00:19:18,016 --> 00:19:20,176
for you, would drive a hybrid car?

401
00:19:20,176 --> 00:19:21,116
- I would.

402
00:19:21,116 --> 00:19:23,020
[Teacher] Okay, would
you drive a hybrid car?

403
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,827
- Yeah, I would drive
one, because it's more in

404
00:19:27,827 --> 00:19:32,827
miles per gallon, and
with rechargeable cars,

405
00:19:32,831 --> 00:19:35,129
you can charge your car
instead of using gas

406
00:19:35,129 --> 00:19:36,592
and spending more money.

407
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,626
- [Teacher] That's good.

408
00:19:37,626 --> 00:19:39,245
Also the emissions from your gas.
