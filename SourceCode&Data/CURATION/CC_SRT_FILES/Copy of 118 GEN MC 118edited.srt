1
00:00:00,051 --> 00:00:01,955
- Spanish, and you would know if,

2
00:00:01,955 --> 00:00:04,231
I mean, you would know what they're saying

3
00:00:04,231 --> 00:00:07,063
because you learn English, and you talk,

4
00:00:07,063 --> 00:00:11,289
you learn English and you
know how to talk Spanish.

5
00:00:11,289 --> 00:00:16,653
- [Girl with headband] I
agree with you, because like,

6
00:00:16,653 --> 00:00:21,227
because like if they

7
00:00:21,227 --> 00:00:22,922
when you said that they had

8
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:26,614
to read, write, and speak English,

9
00:00:26,614 --> 00:00:28,216
like they put something that,

10
00:00:28,216 --> 00:00:31,977
they put something that's
English on your paper,

11
00:00:31,977 --> 00:00:33,719
you'd probably understand it more,

12
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,316
so that's why I agree with you.

13
00:00:38,316 --> 00:00:40,391
- [Boy] But when they
fill out the application,

14
00:00:40,391 --> 00:00:42,357
what if the application didn't (mumbles)

15
00:00:42,357 --> 00:00:42,954
- Well,

16
00:00:42,954 --> 00:00:43,576
- [Girl with headband] The application is

17
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:46,469
about like where you're from,

18
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,095
why are you coming here for,

19
00:00:48,095 --> 00:00:51,694
like they want to know a lot
of information about you.

20
00:00:51,694 --> 00:00:54,712
- [Boy] I think we should,

21
00:00:54,712 --> 00:00:56,941
I think we should keep it at one,

22
00:00:56,941 --> 00:00:59,518
because if you fill out the application,

23
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:01,978
you'll know more about people,

24
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:04,407
and their birthday and stuff,

25
00:01:04,407 --> 00:01:10,763
like and then they usually
bring them a present, (mumbles)

26
00:01:10,763 --> 00:01:12,952
- Okay, so it's important
to know about somebody.

27
00:01:12,952 --> 00:01:14,513
Now, the citizenship board might not go

28
00:01:14,513 --> 00:01:15,395
to their birthday party,

29
00:01:15,395 --> 00:01:18,739
but it is important to know
when their birthday is, right?

30
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:20,596
Okay, what were you saying, Ariel?

31
00:01:20,596 --> 00:01:23,591
- I think he must fill
out an application,

32
00:01:23,591 --> 00:01:34,969
because...

33
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:35,944
- [Girl with glasses] I think you should

34
00:01:35,944 --> 00:01:37,917
fill out an application

35
00:01:37,917 --> 00:01:43,304
so you can, so if you come to America,

36
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:46,918
you can...

37
00:01:46,918 --> 00:01:48,704
If you come to America,

38
00:01:48,704 --> 00:01:50,631
they'll know when your birthday,

39
00:01:50,631 --> 00:01:53,835
where did you come from and stuff.

40
00:01:53,835 --> 00:01:54,950
- [Teacher] Yeah, it's important to have

41
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,995
that information.

42
00:01:55,995 --> 00:02:00,383
Why do you think we need to
know where they came from?

43
00:02:00,383 --> 00:02:02,705
- [Girl with headband]
Because I think they wanted

44
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:05,584
to know where they came from,

45
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:10,088
because like if they came from a bad city,

46
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:16,450
and they want to come to
like a good city, and--

47
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,983
- A city or a country?

48
00:02:17,983 --> 00:02:18,703
- A country.

49
00:02:18,703 --> 00:02:20,003
- A country, okay.

50
00:02:20,003 --> 00:02:21,466
- If they came from a bad country,

51
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:24,624
and they wanted to join a good country,

52
00:02:24,624 --> 00:02:26,481
then you want to see like,

53
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:34,259
they want to see like if
they got like (mumbles)

54
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:35,978
- [Teacher] If they were bad,

55
00:02:35,978 --> 00:02:37,510
like where they came from, that would be,

56
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,577
yeah, they'd have to know that.

57
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:41,899
- I think I would be (mumbles) because

58
00:02:41,899 --> 00:02:44,027
like when they,

59
00:02:44,027 --> 00:02:47,657
like different countries
have different holidays,

60
00:02:47,657 --> 00:02:49,421
so when they be out,

61
00:02:49,421 --> 00:02:50,931
like they be out celebrating,

62
00:02:50,931 --> 00:02:53,229
then nobody won't think nothing's

63
00:02:53,229 --> 00:02:56,439
wrong with it, because
they're celebrating,

64
00:02:56,433 --> 00:02:59,011
and they don't know that on this day,

65
00:02:59,011 --> 00:03:01,704
that's when they're
celebrating their country.

66
00:03:01,704 --> 00:03:02,935
- I didn't even think about that.

67
00:03:02,935 --> 00:03:04,305
We need to know about their culture,

68
00:03:04,305 --> 00:03:06,719
so that we can let them celebrate.

69
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,205
That's important, too.

70
00:03:08,205 --> 00:03:09,088
Great conversation.

71
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:10,318
So we're gonna keep that one

72
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:11,131
or get rid of it?

73
00:03:11,131 --> 00:03:12,989
- We're gonna keep it.

74
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:14,242
- Okay.

75
00:03:14,242 --> 00:03:16,007
So let's move onto the next step

76
00:03:16,007 --> 00:03:17,516
and see what you think about the next one.

77
00:03:17,516 --> 00:03:21,417
- That you have to live
in the US, United States,

78
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:23,321
for five years.

79
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:24,482
- [Girl with headband]
I don't believe that you

80
00:03:24,482 --> 00:03:27,059
have to live in the United
States for five years,

81
00:03:27,059 --> 00:03:31,564
because like if you're like,

82
00:03:31,564 --> 00:03:33,793
I'm (mumbles) five years,

83
00:03:33,793 --> 00:03:35,325
if you're married, you're going to have

84
00:03:35,325 --> 00:03:36,231
to live for three years,

85
00:03:36,231 --> 00:03:38,413
but then like the reason why

86
00:03:38,413 --> 00:03:40,015
you should live in it five years,

87
00:03:40,015 --> 00:03:43,614
because like you could get used

88
00:03:43,614 --> 00:03:45,240
to the country and everything,

89
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,190
that's what I think.

90
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,373
- [Girl with glasses] I
think that you should live

91
00:03:49,373 --> 00:03:51,579
in America for five years

92
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:52,670
if you come from somewhere else,

93
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,808
because like some people,

94
00:03:53,808 --> 00:03:55,247
they come here,

95
00:03:55,247 --> 00:03:57,639
and they see that they don't like it,

96
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,475
and they try to move back

97
00:03:58,475 --> 00:03:59,937
to where they came from,

98
00:03:59,937 --> 00:04:01,261
and when they try to move back,

99
00:04:01,261 --> 00:04:03,931
somebody already took
their house or something,

100
00:04:03,931 --> 00:04:05,092
and if they go, they ain't gonna have

101
00:04:05,092 --> 00:04:05,858
no money to come back

102
00:04:05,858 --> 00:04:08,412
because they're just
gonna be outside homeless.

103
00:04:08,412 --> 00:04:10,572
- I think there will be some changes

104
00:04:10,572 --> 00:04:13,706
to live in the US.

105
00:04:13,706 --> 00:04:16,562
Two years, because if you're real old,

106
00:04:16,562 --> 00:04:18,327
if you're old,

107
00:04:18,327 --> 00:04:23,180
then they say that you
might die in a couple years,

108
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,502
then if you're staying here,

109
00:04:25,502 --> 00:04:29,751
if you have to stay
here to become a citizen

110
00:04:29,751 --> 00:04:31,492
for five years,

111
00:04:31,492 --> 00:04:32,537
then it takes longer,

112
00:04:32,537 --> 00:04:35,950
then you wouldn't get the chances

113
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:40,358
to make choices before you die.

114
00:04:40,358 --> 00:04:42,224
- [Girl with braids] I
think you should change,

115
00:04:42,224 --> 00:04:46,682
you have to live in the US, United States,

116
00:04:46,682 --> 00:04:49,584
for five years, because what if

117
00:04:49,584 --> 00:04:55,830
if the house is dirty, and it's not clean?

118
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:00,195
Like if it's like the tub
still got stains in it

119
00:05:00,195 --> 00:05:02,494
(mumbles)

120
00:05:02,494 --> 00:05:03,957
- [Teacher] Explain that
a little bit more to me.

121
00:05:03,957 --> 00:05:06,209
So you said that you would change it

122
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:07,997
to how many years?

123
00:05:07,997 --> 00:05:08,949
- [Girl with braids] To one year.

124
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:09,761
- To one year,

125
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:11,642
becase if you got in a house

126
00:05:11,642 --> 00:05:14,196
that was dirty, you might want to do what?

127
00:05:14,196 --> 00:05:16,031
- [Girl with braids]
If the walls was still

128
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:17,470
had stains on it--

129
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,165
- Well what would you want to do then?

130
00:05:19,165 --> 00:05:20,442
- Move.

131
00:05:20,442 --> 00:05:22,787
- Okay, where would you move?

132
00:05:22,787 --> 00:05:25,643
Still in the United States,
or back to your country?

133
00:05:25,643 --> 00:05:27,222
- [Girl with braids] Still
in the United States.

134
00:05:27,222 --> 00:05:28,499
- Okay, so you would still be there,

135
00:05:28,499 --> 00:05:29,799
so would you want to just stay,

136
00:05:29,799 --> 00:05:31,077
even though you

137
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:33,677
move from place to place--
- [Girl with braids] I will--

138
00:05:33,677 --> 00:05:35,093
- Do you think you would
change the number of years

139
00:05:35,093 --> 00:05:36,603
they're gonna be in the United States,

140
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:39,087
or just not make them
stay in the same place?

141
00:05:39,087 --> 00:05:40,759
- Not make them stay in the same place.

142
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,825
- Okay, so we need to make
sure that Ariel knows,

143
00:05:42,825 --> 00:05:46,842
do we have to stay in the
same place for all five years?

144
00:05:46,842 --> 00:05:47,794
- No, not really.

145
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:48,653
- No, okay.

146
00:05:48,653 --> 00:05:51,370
- [Girl with glasses] I think that if they

147
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,110
I think that they should
give them at least one year

148
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,292
to figure out if they
want to stay in that home

149
00:05:56,292 --> 00:06:00,565
or go back to where they used to live.

150
00:06:00,565 --> 00:06:01,702
So I mean,

151
00:06:01,702 --> 00:06:04,837
if they don't like it on the first day,

152
00:06:04,837 --> 00:06:07,716
so they won't have to go back again,

153
00:06:07,716 --> 00:06:08,598
come back to see,

154
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:11,733
or come back, somebody else at your house.

155
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:12,453
At your old house.

156
00:06:12,453 --> 00:06:13,823
- [Girl with headband]
I disagree with you,

157
00:06:13,823 --> 00:06:14,914
and I agree with you.

158
00:06:14,914 --> 00:06:16,191
The reason why I disagree with you,

159
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:19,674
because they said still living three years

160
00:06:19,674 --> 00:06:21,787
just like if you're married,

161
00:06:21,787 --> 00:06:25,757
and I agree with you, because like

162
00:06:25,757 --> 00:06:29,496
when you said that they
come from the first place,

163
00:06:29,496 --> 00:06:32,328
I mean, the first day
they may not like it,

164
00:06:32,328 --> 00:06:37,042
and they could probably go
back where they came from,

165
00:06:37,042 --> 00:06:39,317
that's why I disagree and agree with you.

166
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:41,384
- [Boy] Okay, I think we should change it

167
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:43,311
so if they look at their choice

168
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:45,586
to go back to their home country

169
00:06:45,586 --> 00:06:48,582
for like two months,

170
00:06:48,582 --> 00:06:51,136
because then they'll miss
their family members,

171
00:06:51,136 --> 00:06:55,013
then like when a couple
days in their country,

172
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:58,101
and nobody was doing it in America,

173
00:06:58,101 --> 00:06:59,703
then they could just go
back to their country

174
00:06:59,703 --> 00:07:02,233
for like a month or something.

175
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:03,596
- [Teacher] So maybe
you guys need to discuss

176
00:07:03,596 --> 00:07:07,102
how many years they should
stay here in America,

177
00:07:07,102 --> 00:07:08,425
and maybe if they could,

178
00:07:08,425 --> 00:07:11,374
how long they could go
to visit their relatives

179
00:07:11,374 --> 00:07:12,442
in other countries.

180
00:07:12,442 --> 00:07:13,557
Although I think those

181
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:16,459
are all good
things to keep discussing.

182
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:18,827
So maybe make that
decision on how many years,

183
00:07:18,827 --> 00:07:19,942
and then move onto the next one

184
00:07:19,942 --> 00:07:26,652
and I'll come back and see you.

185
00:07:26,652 --> 00:07:27,674
- [Girl with white beads] Here, but you

186
00:07:27,674 --> 00:07:29,903
you trying to become a citizen here,

187
00:07:29,903 --> 00:07:31,296
but you like want to,

188
00:07:31,296 --> 00:07:33,641
like you're trying to vote,

189
00:07:33,641 --> 00:07:36,288
like say if you lived in Germany,

190
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:37,890
you're trying to go back to Germany.

191
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,327
You can't, that's not being loyal

192
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,997
to the US, because you're
trying to become a citizen

193
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:45,622
to the US, and you're trying to go back,

194
00:07:45,622 --> 00:07:48,083
if you was living in Germany,

195
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,521
you're trying to go back to Germany.

196
00:07:50,521 --> 00:07:53,099
What do you think, guys?

197
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:58,578
- Well, (mumbles) because they have

198
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:02,061
to want to say that, A, if you don't,

199
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:05,056
then they won't have to send you back,

200
00:08:05,056 --> 00:08:07,100
because you have to be community and jobs

201
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:12,374
so they can get you jobs
and what to do and--

202
00:08:12,374 --> 00:08:13,710
- [Brittany] I think that

203
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,869
we should keep the rule,

204
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:18,887
because say if your old country

205
00:08:18,887 --> 00:08:20,234
got in a war,

206
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:22,115
you would say you tried to take up them,

207
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:24,669
and you're already trying to become

208
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:26,782
a citizen of the USA,

209
00:08:26,782 --> 00:08:28,547
and you take up for your old country,

210
00:08:28,547 --> 00:08:31,077
that makes you not become a citizen.

211
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,005
- That don't mean if you're born

212
00:08:33,005 --> 00:08:34,978
in your like regular country,

213
00:08:34,978 --> 00:08:36,882
that don't mean like you can go back,

214
00:08:36,882 --> 00:08:39,367
go back and forth and take up for them,

215
00:08:39,367 --> 00:08:40,806
and then when we're having a war,

216
00:08:40,806 --> 00:08:41,967
you want to take up for us,

217
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:42,873
you can't do that.

218
00:08:42,873 --> 00:08:44,173
You can't like,

219
00:08:44,173 --> 00:08:45,868
if you grew up in Germany,

220
00:08:45,868 --> 00:08:47,354
you can't take up for Germany,

221
00:08:47,354 --> 00:08:50,512
because you'e trying to be
a citizen in the US now.

222
00:08:50,512 --> 00:08:52,346
You can't take up for Germany,

223
00:08:52,346 --> 00:08:53,879
even though you were born there.

224
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,968
You got to take up for the US.

225
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:56,758
- [Teacher] Do you think that's

226
00:08:56,758 --> 00:08:59,637
hard for someone who
came to the United States

227
00:08:59,637 --> 00:09:02,771
to forget about their old country?

228
00:09:02,771 --> 00:09:04,374
Woudl that be difficult?

229
00:09:04,374 --> 00:09:05,813
- [Girl with white beads] Yeah.

230
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:07,810
In my opinion, I think
that'd be difficullt

231
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,271
because like with me,

232
00:09:10,271 --> 00:09:13,150
I can make a connection because

233
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,031
when I went, when I had,

234
00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:17,608
when I used to live with my grandma,

235
00:09:17,608 --> 00:09:19,094
me and my momma, we used to live

236
00:09:19,094 --> 00:09:20,198
with my grandma,

237
00:09:20,198 --> 00:09:22,925
and I couldn't forget about the things

238
00:09:22,925 --> 00:09:24,690
that I did at my grandma's house,

239
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,385
so my grandma and my cousins,

240
00:09:26,385 --> 00:09:27,871
but we still were around,

241
00:09:27,871 --> 00:09:29,404
but I couldn't stop,

242
00:09:29,404 --> 00:09:33,328
I couldn't forget about
what the fun things

243
00:09:33,328 --> 00:09:35,046
that we did.

244
00:09:35,046 --> 00:09:37,019
- [Teacher] Yeah, (mumbles)

245
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:39,945
- [Adune] So what should we put here?

246
00:09:39,945 --> 00:09:40,809
- [Girl with white beads]
Well, I think we should

247
00:09:40,809 --> 00:09:43,317
keep it, because like

248
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:46,614
you can't go back to your like

249
00:09:46,614 --> 00:09:49,772
regular country to do like,

250
00:09:49,772 --> 00:09:51,745
like you can't fight for the army,

251
00:09:51,745 --> 00:09:53,510
the army, they're trying to stay here

252
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,600
to protect us, and you're already trying

253
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,270
to become a citizen for the US.

254
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:01,405
You can't like go back to Germany.

255
00:10:01,405 --> 00:10:02,194
- [Adune] Then we should

256
00:10:02,194 --> 00:10:05,874
keep that, because then

257
00:10:05,874 --> 00:10:08,631
so we should

258
00:10:08,631 --> 00:10:11,929
learn how to be nice?

259
00:10:11,929 --> 00:10:13,159
I don't know.

260
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:16,294
- [Girl with white beads]
Like, we could put,

261
00:10:16,294 --> 00:10:20,496
so that if like you grew up in Germany,

262
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:23,608
you can't fight for Germany.

263
00:10:23,608 --> 00:10:26,092
So we're gonna put that.

264
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,764
- [Adune] Okay.

265
00:10:27,764 --> 00:10:29,784
- [Teacher] You have to be true to the US.

266
00:10:29,784 --> 00:10:36,657
- Be true to the US.

267
00:10:36,657 --> 00:10:37,562
- [Teacher] How about the next one

268
00:10:37,562 --> 00:10:39,791
that says, "Have good moral character."

269
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,138
Is that one that you would keep

270
00:10:41,138 --> 00:10:42,670
or get rid of?

271
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,087
- [Girl with white beads] Get rid of.

272
00:10:44,087 --> 00:10:48,754
In my opinion, I'd get rid of that,

273
00:10:48,754 --> 00:10:50,611
because people,

274
00:10:50,611 --> 00:10:52,213
like that's like,

275
00:10:52,213 --> 00:10:56,555
that's like having like you
gotta be like nice to people.

276
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:58,227
Some people, they can't take it.

277
00:10:58,227 --> 00:10:59,644
Like, they can't take that,

278
00:10:59,644 --> 00:11:01,269
they can't like,

279
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:05,655
people, like I can make
a connection because

280
00:11:05,655 --> 00:11:08,942
my cousin, she got like ups and downs,

281
00:11:08,942 --> 00:11:11,195
because when people, they just like

282
00:11:11,195 --> 00:11:13,911
irritate her, and they be aggravating her,

283
00:11:13,911 --> 00:11:17,557
she can't take it no more, she just like,

284
00:11:17,557 --> 00:11:20,343
she just gotta get mad and stuff.

285
00:11:20,343 --> 00:11:23,152
Like people, they can't take having

286
00:11:23,152 --> 00:11:27,494
a moral character.

287
00:11:27,494 --> 00:11:29,816
Like my cousin, she can't do that

288
00:11:29,816 --> 00:11:32,719
because people, they be
like bullying her and stuff,

289
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:36,736
and she can't like keep like,

290
00:11:36,736 --> 00:11:39,057
she can't keep on standing right there

291
00:11:39,057 --> 00:11:42,727
and people keep on bullying her.

292
00:11:42,727 --> 00:11:43,706
- [Adune] Brittany, do you think

293
00:11:43,706 --> 00:11:48,164
we should keep it or leave it?

294
00:11:48,164 --> 00:11:49,441
- [Brittany] I think we should,

295
00:11:49,441 --> 00:11:53,457
I think we should get rid of it.

296
00:11:53,457 --> 00:11:57,567
When I was in the suburbs
with my godmother,

297
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:01,538
she said that my godbrother
was getting picked on

298
00:12:01,538 --> 00:12:02,768
in school by a bully,

299
00:12:02,768 --> 00:12:05,624
and he just felt like beating him up.

300
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,807
What do you think, Adune?

301
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:11,406
- Well, keep it, because like,

302
00:12:11,406 --> 00:12:13,867
why would you let some (mumbles)

303
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:16,027
people get away with most of that stuff?

304
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:20,159
You're just gonna let them
keep doing the same thing?

305
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,506
And without the rule?

306
00:12:21,506 --> 00:12:25,007
Without that rule, everybody,

307
00:12:25,007 --> 00:12:29,272
people would just keep
getting beat (mumbles)

308
00:12:29,272 --> 00:12:30,757
- [Teacher] So what I
hear all of you saying

309
00:12:30,757 --> 00:12:34,380
is that you don't want
people to get beaten,

310
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,609
but you also said that

311
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:39,673
sometimes it's hard to control your anger,

312
00:12:39,673 --> 00:12:41,276
so you can't, you're not always

313
00:12:41,276 --> 00:12:43,923
a good person all the time.

314
00:12:43,923 --> 00:12:45,943
Sometimes you make bad choices.

315
00:12:45,943 --> 00:12:47,498
Do you think we could maybe

316
00:12:47,498 --> 00:12:51,956
change that rule so that
everybody would be happy with it?

317
00:12:51,956 --> 00:12:52,862
- [Girl with white beads]
Yes, I think we should

318
00:12:52,862 --> 00:12:55,390
change it to like, like,

319
00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:01,406
when you're like around like older people,

320
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,241
like elder, like older people,

321
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,843
and like they're real old,

322
00:13:04,843 --> 00:13:06,213
you can like,

323
00:13:06,213 --> 00:13:09,998
like you can show like good
moral character around them,

324
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,343
but then when they like go and stuff,

325
00:13:12,343 --> 00:13:14,038
like when they're not gone,

326
00:13:14,038 --> 00:13:17,869
like when we was talking about immigrants

327
00:13:17,869 --> 00:13:20,655
on the, like they was on the boats,

328
00:13:20,655 --> 00:13:23,256
you don't know what type
of people is on the boats.

329
00:13:23,256 --> 00:13:27,389
It can be like elder
people, you never know.

330
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:32,125
Like you can have good
moral character around them,

331
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,865
but like when you like,

332
00:13:34,865 --> 00:13:38,859
when you're like around your mother,

333
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,459
don't she want you to respect you?

334
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:44,105
Don't she want you to respect her?

335
00:13:45,105 --> 00:13:49,284
- [Adune] But, we should change the rule

336
00:13:49,284 --> 00:13:52,837
to like sometimes people can just like

337
00:13:52,837 --> 00:13:56,691
have a chance to get some people back

338
00:13:56,691 --> 00:13:58,618
that really did something

339
00:13:58,618 --> 00:13:59,609
really bad to them,

340
00:13:59,609 --> 00:14:02,535
or caused them to get hurt or something,

341
00:14:02,535 --> 00:14:03,858
so we should change the rule

342
00:14:03,858 --> 00:14:08,106
to like, it's kind of
like hard for a name,

343
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:11,288
but we should think about it.

344
00:14:11,288 --> 00:14:12,142
- [Girl with white beads] I think,

345
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,562
I have a cause and effect

346
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:16,349
for a good moral character.

347
00:14:16,349 --> 00:14:18,671
That's why they have like,

348
00:14:18,671 --> 00:14:21,039
if you have to fill out an application,

349
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:23,105
that's why they're trying to like,

350
00:14:23,105 --> 00:14:26,937
that's why they're trying to
like fill out an application

351
00:14:26,937 --> 00:14:29,444
to see if you got good moral character,

352
00:14:29,444 --> 00:14:30,840
or if you're cra--
