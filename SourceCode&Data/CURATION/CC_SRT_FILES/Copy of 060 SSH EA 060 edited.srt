00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,301
(Background Chatter)

2
00:00:03,301 --> 00:00:04,878
- [Teacher] Does that include slaves?
- [Student] Yes

3
00:00:04,878 --> 00:00:06,877
- [Teacher] Does that include women?
- [Student] Yes.

4
00:00:06,877 --> 00:00:07,325
- [Teacher] Okay.

5
00:00:07,325 --> 00:00:09,641
- [Student] So how
are we supposed to take

6
00:00:09,641 --> 00:00:12,905
uneducated people's opinions when they

7
00:00:12,905 --> 00:00:15,431
obviously don't know what's gonna happen?

8
00:00:15,431 --> 00:00:17,106
- [Student] Because a lot of people in Russia--

9
00:00:17,106 --> 00:00:19,386
I mean, if the Russian's knew how to read,

10
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:22,240
they would write a song.

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,523
If they knew what was going on,

12
00:00:24,523 --> 00:00:26,122
and they were smart enough,

13
00:00:26,122 --> 00:00:28,313
they would obviously
write a song about it.

14
00:00:28,313 --> 00:00:29,343
- [Teacher] I think
John Locke had one more

15
00:00:29,343 --> 00:00:30,521
thing to say, is that right?

16
00:00:30,521 --> 00:00:32,845
- [Student] Yes, okay, and to answer your question

17
00:00:32,845 --> 00:00:34,160
about the government.

18
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,160
The government was created
to protect people's rights,

19
00:00:39,712 --> 00:00:43,563
it wasn't created for you to abuse power

20
00:00:43,563 --> 00:00:46,043
and just do what you think you need to do,

21
00:00:46,043 --> 00:00:49,554
they are only for them,
and it's not doing what

22
00:00:49,554 --> 00:00:53,205
it needs to do, then yeah,
the people do have the right.

23
00:00:53,205 --> 00:00:55,123
- [Student] People
aren't dead, so obviously

24
00:00:55,123 --> 00:00:58,074
I'm doing what I need to
do, and I'm protecting them.

25
00:00:58,074 --> 00:01:00,600
- [Student] If that's all you care about,
then that would just be easy

26
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,502
not to let people die.

27
00:01:02,502 --> 00:01:06,443
- [Student] Obviously
they're not having problems

28
00:01:06,443 --> 00:01:08,402
where their lives threatened.

29
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,951
We have all these, like...

30
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:14,346
If you're, wherever you live...

31
00:01:14,346 --> 00:01:17,199
Anyways, wherever you
live, if your king or queen

32
00:01:17,199 --> 00:01:20,553
wasn't doing what they
thought to protect you guys,

33
00:01:20,553 --> 00:01:22,783
and you had all these invaders coming in,

34
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:24,582
then you could argue being mad at them

35
00:01:24,582 --> 00:01:27,203
because they're not protecting
you and doing their job.

36
00:01:27,203 --> 00:01:29,072
- [Student] That's when
you know they're upset.

37
00:01:29,072 --> 00:01:31,423
- [Student] Plus, you're
saying that your people

38
00:01:31,423 --> 00:01:33,472
aren't educated, but
they're educated enough

39
00:01:33,472 --> 00:01:34,956
to know what their rights are,

40
00:01:34,956 --> 00:01:37,200
and how they should be treated, so...

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,181
- [Student] I mean, you can
think you should be treated

42
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:44,181
in a certain way, but I
could say I think I should

43
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:49,594
be able to slide on this floor right now,

44
00:01:49,594 --> 00:01:54,080
but I might not know if I
slide on this floor right now,

45
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,882
I'm gonna die.

46
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:58,965
But because I'm not educated
in that kind of way.

47
00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:01,354
But your king or queen is
educated in that kind of way,

48
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:04,632
so they're not gonna let
you do stuff like that.

49
00:02:04,632 --> 00:02:05,953
- [Student] We're not
asking for stuff like that,

50
00:02:05,953 --> 00:02:07,685
we're asking for our natural rights.

51
00:02:07,685 --> 00:02:12,685
- [Student] I know that they, 
(Background Chatter)

52
00:02:12,923 --> 00:02:16,606
What's the word? The end result?

53
00:02:16,606 --> 00:02:19,206
Conclusion. I know the
conclusion of you guys

54
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:21,844
getting your natural
rights, and the way that

55
00:02:21,844 --> 00:02:23,762
you guys are acting for them.

56
00:02:23,762 --> 00:02:25,082
In a way, I'm gonna get you guys

57
00:02:25,082 --> 00:02:27,518
what you guys need to get, your conclusion

58
00:02:27,518 --> 00:02:29,239
is gonna be a whole lot
better than what you guys

59
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:30,607
are hoping.

60
00:02:30,607 --> 00:02:32,308
- [Student] So what's the point of
having your natural rights

61
00:02:32,308 --> 00:02:34,714
if you're going to abuse the law?

62
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:38,744
- [Student] It doesn't mean you're
going to abuse the law,

63
00:02:38,744 --> 00:02:40,831
it just means that you're
gonna be more cooperative

64
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:42,357
towards the law.

65
00:02:42,357 --> 00:02:44,324
- [Student] You're attributed to
a beggar if they don't

66
00:02:44,324 --> 00:02:45,639
give you your natural rights.

67
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,319
It's like a two-way type thing.

68
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:49,313
- If they give it to
you, then you're gonna

69
00:02:49,313 --> 00:02:50,873
be happy about it, and
you're gonna want to

70
00:02:50,873 --> 00:02:52,840
follow them and listen to them.

71
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,275
Instead of trying to
revolt and kick them out

72
00:02:56,275 --> 00:02:57,882
if they're not gonna give it to you.

73
00:02:57,882 --> 00:03:00,826
- [Teacher] Alright, so we say
government is a good thing,

74
00:03:00,826 --> 00:03:04,479
bad thing, or kind of in between.

75
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,804
Let's go around the room real quick.

76
00:03:05,804 --> 00:03:07,193
What would you guys say?

77
00:03:07,193 --> 00:03:10,125
- [Student] I would say government
is a positive thing

78
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:11,476
because it stopped some starving,

79
00:03:11,476 --> 00:03:16,476
and it keeps everything in place.

80
00:03:16,508 --> 00:03:17,914
- [Teacher] Okay, good.

81
00:03:17,914 --> 00:03:19,677
- [Student] We're in between.

82
00:03:19,677 --> 00:03:23,479
Because it's there to protect your rights,

83
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:27,318
but if they're not gonna
be there to protect you,

84
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:29,884
then they shouldn't be there at all.

85
00:03:29,884 --> 00:03:32,571
- [Teacher] Okay, so it has
to be done in the correct way?

86
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:37,842
- [Student] Government is a good thing.

87
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,183
- [Teacher] Any explanation why?

88
00:03:39,183 --> 00:03:41,962
- [Student] Because if you don't have a government,

89
00:03:41,962 --> 00:03:45,845
then you aren't organized,
and if you're not organized,

90
00:03:45,845 --> 00:03:50,252
then you're, like, chickens
would be in your home.

91
00:03:50,252 --> 00:03:51,478
(Background Chatter)

92
00:03:51,478 --> 00:03:52,994
- [Student] We think that philosophers,

93
00:03:52,994 --> 00:03:55,556
they write what they feel about us,

94
00:03:55,556 --> 00:03:56,955
and they don't do anything about it,

95
00:03:56,955 --> 00:04:00,033
and they don't understand
where we're coming from.

96
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:02,637
"You philosophers are lucky men.

97
00:04:02,637 --> 00:04:04,556
You write on paper, and paper is patient.

98
00:04:04,556 --> 00:04:06,005
Unfortunate Empress that I am,

99
00:04:06,005 --> 00:04:09,186
I write on the susceptible
skins of living beings."

100
00:04:09,186 --> 00:04:12,916
Meaning that they write on paper because

101
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,434
they can put out they opinion like that,

102
00:04:14,434 --> 00:04:16,678
but we have to be responsible
for all the people

103
00:04:16,678 --> 00:04:19,960
in our country, and we're trying
to do what's best for them.

104
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,230
- [Student] In your opinion.

105
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,750
(Laughter)

106
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,043
- [Teacher] Frederick?

107
00:04:27,043 --> 00:04:28,707
- [Student] We think government is interesting

108
00:04:28,707 --> 00:04:31,274
because we need a
government to be organized.

109
00:04:31,274 --> 00:04:35,534
But government also
does a lot of bad stuff.

110
00:04:36,999 --> 00:04:39,245
- [Student] We think the government
is completely necessary

111
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:42,765
along with religion, because
it brings unity to the people.

112
00:04:42,765 --> 00:04:47,738
- [Student] And I think the laws and
religion kind of go hand in hand

113
00:04:47,738 --> 00:04:49,884
because...

114
00:04:49,884 --> 00:04:52,002
I wouldn't consider myself a Christian,

115
00:04:52,002 --> 00:04:53,563
but others probably would,

116
00:04:53,563 --> 00:04:57,122
because of certain stuff I write in books,

117
00:04:57,122 --> 00:04:59,632
that's why they consider me as a heretic,

118
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,785
but the bible says, "Thou shall not kill."

119
00:05:02,785 --> 00:05:06,389
Killing someone is also against the law.

120
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,924
Thou shall not steal is
also against the law.

121
00:05:13,286 --> 00:05:16,156
- [Student] I feel the government is good
if it uses the right power,

122
00:05:16,156 --> 00:05:20,602
basically for their rights and things.

123
00:05:20,602 --> 00:05:22,501
As long as--

124
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:24,471
It should be there, we
feel it should be there,

125
00:05:24,471 --> 00:05:27,530
but it needs to be used appropriately.

126
00:05:32,305 --> 00:05:37,305
- [Student] We believe, sort of, 
that the government is a positive.

127
00:05:38,153 --> 00:05:41,203
If you didn't have a
government as a base structure

128
00:05:41,203 --> 00:05:44,623
for your country. If you didn't...

129
00:05:44,623 --> 00:05:47,555
The government perhaps is a positive.

130
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:50,362
Due to the fact that the government,

131
00:05:50,362 --> 00:05:53,405
helps you if you need it to an extent,

132
00:05:53,405 --> 00:05:56,560
I agree with Catherine
the Great in the fact that

133
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,002
it sort of really helps
with the territory.

134
00:06:00,002 --> 00:06:02,260
I've been interviewed by many people,

135
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,039
and specifically saying, to
many people I've said it,

136
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,604
that I'm capable of
saying whatever I want.

137
00:06:07,604 --> 00:06:10,206
So my country is there, and
(Background Chatter)

138
00:06:10,206 --> 00:06:12,500
I get to do whatever I want

139
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,302
- [Teacher] If you were the king, 
you'd do whatever you want to.

140
00:06:14,302 --> 00:06:16,308
Theoretically.

141
00:06:16,308 --> 00:06:17,840
Alright, Voltaire.

142
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,473
- [Student] Pretty much, the
government is an abomination.

143
00:06:21,473 --> 00:06:26,401
I mean, there's way more bad 
and nasty leaders

144
00:06:26,401 --> 00:06:29,401
than there are good, lawful public leaders

145
00:06:31,403 --> 00:06:34,203
that do good stuff.

146
00:06:34,203 --> 00:06:37,270
Too many leaders take
advantage of their people

147
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,605
in their kingdoms, so I
think they should just

148
00:06:40,605 --> 00:06:45,605
all go away, start over
with enlightened, total...

149
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:55,170
(Background Chatter)

150
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,511
- [Student] What about slavery?

151
00:06:57,511 --> 00:06:59,119
- [Teacher] What do you think about slavery?

152
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:01,599
- [Student] What do you people think about slavery?

153
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,281
- [Teacher] What about slavery.
Anybody have an opinion?

154
00:07:03,281 --> 00:07:06,674
Is slavery good bad or otherwise?

155
00:07:06,674 --> 00:07:09,734
- [Student] I wouldn't say slavery is a negative.

156
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:14,034
then again, I wouldn't say 
that it's a bad thing either.

157
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:22,484
(Background Chatter)

158
00:07:22,824 --> 00:07:27,044
I guess you could say, mostly
slavery came from Austria

159
00:07:27,044 --> 00:07:30,844
due to the fact that
if you get in trouble,

160
00:07:30,844 --> 00:07:32,870
with another country, and
they sand to the Austria

161
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,918
you're pretty much going to be a slave

162
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:35,835
for the rest of your life.

163
00:07:35,835 --> 00:07:37,833
You pretty much work for them.

164
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,562
You work for the Pope himself,

165
00:07:40,562 --> 00:07:44,521
and you work for the Roman Emperor.

166
00:07:44,521 --> 00:07:46,000
- [Teacher] Voltaire?

167
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,041
- [Student] I think slavery is a necessary evil.

168
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,069
- [Teacher] A necessary evil?

169
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:53,00
(Background Chatter)

170
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,989
- [Student] Well, we disagree 
with (Background chatter),

171
00:07:54,989 --> 00:07:56,914
because we see everyone 
as equals,

172
00:07:56,914 --> 00:07:58,912
and think everyone should
be treated equally,

173
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:02,077
and it's part of their natural
rights such as freedom.

174
00:08:02,077 --> 00:08:03,762
- [Teacher] Exactly, that would 
be considered one of

175
00:08:03,762 --> 00:08:05,839
their natural rights.

176
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:09,000
(Background Chatter)

177
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,112
-[Teacher] Rousseau?

178
00:08:10,112 --> 00:08:19,310
(Background Chatter)

179
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:22,761
- [Teacher] Serfs, which were similar
to slaves, very good.

180
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:24,798
Last comment there, 
Thomas Hobbes?

181
00:08:24,798 --> 00:08:26,641
- [Student] I don't think
we really have an opinion

182
00:08:26,641 --> 00:08:30,037
on slavery, but if the
king decided to have

183
00:08:30,037 --> 00:08:33,280
slavery in the country, I
think we should respect that

184
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,023
and do it for the
betterment of the country.

185
00:08:36,023 --> 00:08:39,136
- [Teacher] Respect the authority 
of the king?

186
00:08:39,136 --> 00:08:40,594
- [Student] No piling up...

187
00:08:40,594 --> 00:08:42,077
(Background Chatter)

188
00:08:42,077 --> 00:08:44,401
...because that's what 
slavery is there for.

189
00:08:44,401 --> 00:08:46,117
- [Teacher] Okay. Very good.

190
00:08:46,117 --> 00:08:47,660
Any last minute comments?

191
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,123
I think we're almost out of
time for our salon discussion.

192
00:08:51,123 --> 00:08:52,390
I heard a lot of good ideas.

193
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,688
Does anybody have any last minute comments

194
00:08:53,688 --> 00:08:55,759
that they want to add?

195
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,720
Yes, Frederick?

196
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,432
- [Student] A lot of
things that we have to say

197
00:09:02,432 --> 00:09:05,355
I didn't get...

198
00:09:05,355 --> 00:09:09,274
Three things of everybody's opinion.

199
00:09:09,274 --> 00:09:13,596
All you guys are really self...

200
00:09:15,436 --> 00:09:17,278
You're not sinners or anything.

201
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:19,759
For lack of better words.

202
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:24,342
And I wouldn't read them,
meaning I would probably

203
00:09:24,342 --> 00:09:29,121
do anything to get support from my people,

204
00:09:29,121 --> 00:09:31,882
and I'd do anything for my people.

205
00:09:31,882 --> 00:09:34,520
Like my dad would do anything for me,

206
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,799
he raised me well.

207
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:40,666
And slavery and natural
rights and all that

208
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:44,285
mumbo-jumbo shouldn't be from you,

209
00:09:44,285 --> 00:09:45,923
because you're not them.

210
00:09:45,923 --> 00:09:48,916
You're not, just as you're not Voltaire,

211
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,150
and I'm not Thomas.

212
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:56,010
So you can't overrule
anybody else, it's not right.

213
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,755
- [Teacher] Very good.

214
00:09:58,755 --> 00:10:01,267
Excellent job, ladies and gentlemen.

215
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:05,005
Thank you for attending
our little salon here.

216
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:06,305
Hopefully we learned some new ideas,

217
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,267
and got to hear some
other opinions of people

218
00:10:08,267 --> 00:10:10,560
throughout Europe, so
let's give yourselves

219
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,922
a little round of applause.

220
00:10:11,922 --> 00:10:16,041
(Applause)

221
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,985
Alright, you are now done with the salon.

222
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,602
You can take your little parts if you want

223
00:10:20,602 --> 00:10:23,473
and put them up because you are no longer

224
00:10:23,473 --> 00:10:27,611
those people, you are now
you in modern day times.

225
00:10:29,561 --> 00:10:31,526
Back to modern day times.

226
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,642
But I do have some
questions, we are not done

227
00:10:36,642 --> 00:10:41,043
with our discussion, but you
are not longer your person,

228
00:10:41,043 --> 00:10:44,951
you are back to being you.

229
00:10:44,951 --> 00:10:48,481
(Background Chatter)

230
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,821
-[Teacher] We are not done, 
and I'm going to ask you

231
00:10:49,821 --> 00:10:52,244
your questions now. Please listen.

232
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,611
What was the purpose of a salon?

233
00:10:58,611 --> 00:11:01,661
We've talked about this
from what you've right here.

234
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,793
What was the purpose of a salon?

235
00:11:04,793 --> 00:11:05,803
- [Student] Exchange ideas.

236
00:11:05,803 --> 00:11:07,832
- [Teacher] Exchange ideas, 
any other purposes?

237
00:11:07,832 --> 00:11:11,229
- [Student] Sometimes
like, Joseph did over there,

238
00:11:11,229 --> 00:11:15,402
but to find out what
people thought of you.

239
00:11:16,922 --> 00:11:19,439
- [Teacher] Okay, to find out 
different opinions.

240
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:21,198
Okay, maybe see something from a different

241
00:11:21,198 --> 00:11:23,939
side or viewpoint.

242
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:28,125
- [Student] It was a devised to discuss music,

243
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,920
who gets painting time...

244
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,396
- [Teacher] Okay, so it has an
artistic point to it as well.

245
00:11:35,396 --> 00:11:39,237
- [Student] It was just
another way for us to learn

246
00:11:39,237 --> 00:11:41,484
about taking notes and stuff.

247
00:11:41,484 --> 00:11:44,679
Like research on our
person and then hearing

248
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,566
what the other people thought.

249
00:11:46,566 --> 00:11:48,429
- [Teacher] But as far as back then,

250
00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:49,435
is what we're thinking about.

251
00:11:49,435 --> 00:11:52,196
- [Student] Oh, back then. Oh.

252
00:11:52,196 --> 00:11:53,915
- [Teacher] Yes, you were right 
about what you said.

253
00:11:53,915 --> 00:11:57,822
- [Student] Just to
exchange ideas and go back

254
00:11:57,822 --> 00:12:00,353
until people like it.

255
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:03,521
- [Teacher] Would you say there
were effective back then?

256
00:12:03,521 --> 00:12:04,559
- [All] Yes.

257
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:06,310
- [Teacher] We haven't talked about results,

258
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,763
we kind of left off
talking about these people

259
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:13,455
and how they talked about
things and came to the salon.

260
00:12:13,455 --> 00:12:15,917
Do you think this is
going to be an effective

261
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:18,940
method of discussing?

262
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,591
- [Student] The
conversations we were having

263
00:12:22,591 --> 00:12:26,084
with them over there,
like how they didn't think

264
00:12:26,084 --> 00:12:28,506
that we were listening to what the people

265
00:12:28,506 --> 00:12:30,312
were saying and how we
were just gonna stay

266
00:12:30,312 --> 00:12:32,765
the way we were and stuff,
but actually they got

267
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:36,373
to hear our thinking about moving to where

268
00:12:36,373 --> 00:12:38,684
we need to go, it's gonna
take them a little longer

269
00:12:38,684 --> 00:12:39,945
to get there.

270
00:12:39,945 --> 00:12:41,522
- [Teacher] Okay.

271
00:12:41,522 --> 00:12:43,426
Do we have anything like salons today?

272
00:12:43,426 --> 00:12:44,393
Do we have salons today?

273
00:12:44,393 --> 00:12:45,315
- [All] Yes.

274
00:12:45,315 --> 00:12:46,682
- [Teacher] What happens at salons now?

275
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,405
(Background Chatter)

276
00:12:48,405 --> 00:12:53,382
-[Teacher] Right, so it's not so
much political all the time

277
00:12:53,382 --> 00:12:55,196
in exchanging ideas
about government stuff,

278
00:12:55,196 --> 00:12:57,473
but they're still kind of
socialization and gossip

279
00:12:57,473 --> 00:12:58,277
going on.

280
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,963
Is there anything that we have in place,

281
00:13:00,963 --> 00:13:04,274
or anything in our society
today which you can

282
00:13:04,274 --> 00:13:06,519
discuss opinions,
especially about government

283
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:09,364
or problems that you might have in life?

284
00:13:09,364 --> 00:13:10,890
- [Students] Um...

285
00:13:12,642 --> 00:13:16,565
- [Teacher] Since salons don't
really go with that, but...

286
00:13:17,314 --> 00:13:22,314
(Background Chatter)

287
00:13:24,124 --> 00:13:26,272
- [Teacher] So if you have a
problem with your country

288
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,799
or with the government or with
something that's going on,

289
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:30,274
we don't have a salon
to go and meet like this

290
00:13:30,274 --> 00:13:32,123
and talk with people, but
is there anything that

291
00:13:32,123 --> 00:13:33,302
we do that?

292
00:13:33,302 --> 00:13:35,680
Or any other thing?

293
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,680
Another way to voice your
problem, if your dissenting

294
00:13:41,035 --> 00:13:43,622
and you have a different
agreement, or a disagreement

295
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:46,669
with the government, or
with anybody, anything.

296
00:13:46,669 --> 00:13:48,763
What can you do?

297
00:13:48,763 --> 00:13:50,641
- [Student] Don't we have press conferences?

298
00:13:52,075 --> 00:13:54,768
- [Teacher] What do you mean representatives?

299
00:13:57,204 --> 00:14:00,684
Write letters.

300
00:14:00,684 --> 00:14:02,960
Write letters to who?

301
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,217
- [Student] The government.

302
00:14:04,217 --> 00:14:05,988
- [Teacher] Congress, the government, okay.

303
00:14:05,988 --> 00:14:07,800
- [Student] They also
have environment issues

304
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,076
and worldwide problems.

305
00:14:09,076 --> 00:14:12,157
- [Teacher] Worldwide problems. Okay,
that's kind of similar.

306
00:14:12,157 --> 00:14:13,925
Where different people come and talk about

307
00:14:13,925 --> 00:14:16,637
their issues, their problems,
and maybe how to solve them.

308
00:14:16,637 --> 00:14:18,323
- [Student] You kind
of have different levels

309
00:14:18,323 --> 00:14:21,761
like, if you have a problem with, like,

310
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:24,081
if it's about the school,
you go to the school board.

311
00:14:24,081 --> 00:14:25,081
- [Teacher] Okay.

312
00:14:28,391 --> 00:14:30,002
- [Student] President,
or people who are trying

313
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:33,879
to be president, they
have the debates on TV.

314
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:35,031
- [Teacher] Okay, good.

315
00:14:35,031 --> 00:14:38,482
As far as being an average
citizen, what can you do?

316
00:14:38,482 --> 00:14:40,083
Say there's an issue with the world,

317
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,679
or an issue in our country,
or an issue in our city

318
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:46,206
that we want to see fixed,
what can we do, you think,

319
00:14:46,206 --> 00:14:49,123
to maybe, go about fixing that,

320
00:14:49,123 --> 00:14:50,948
or trying to get that done?

321
00:14:50,948 --> 00:14:51,884
- [Student] Protest.

322
00:14:51,884 --> 00:14:54,321
- [Teacher] Protest. Is that allowed?
Are we allowed to protest?

323
00:14:54,321 --> 00:14:56,307
- [All] Yes.

324
00:14:56,307 --> 00:14:58,002
- [Teacher] Were you allowed to protest back then?

325
00:14:58,002 --> 00:14:59,195
- [Student] It depends
on where you live at.

326
00:14:59,195 --> 00:15:00,216
- [Teacher] Depends on where you live.

327
00:15:00,216 --> 00:15:01,430
We have a different government now, right?

328
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,601
Back then it was monarchy,

329
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:03,725
now it's more of a democracy.

330
00:15:03,725 --> 00:15:05,363
So what we're seeing here a little bit,

331
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:08,312
a little bit different method
and a lot more opportunity.

332
00:15:10,072 --> 00:15:12,963
