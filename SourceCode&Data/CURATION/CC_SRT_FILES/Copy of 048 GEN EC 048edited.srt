1
00:00:00,841 --> 00:00:13,537
(background chatter)

2
00:00:13,537 --> 00:00:14,674
- These colors.

3
00:00:14,674 --> 00:00:15,637
- What color is this?

4
00:00:15,637 --> 00:00:18,435
Yellow, oh my gosh, did you find

5
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:22,743
a lot of leaves that match this color?

6
00:00:22,743 --> 00:00:24,481
No?

7
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:26,675
You forgot to do it?

8
00:00:26,675 --> 00:00:29,311
Well let's do it right now.

9
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:31,551
Alright, go ahead and put it there.

10
00:00:31,551 --> 00:00:38,468
What other ones are yellow?

11
00:00:38,468 --> 00:00:41,112
Mmm. That's a yellow one.

12
00:00:41,112 --> 00:00:43,155
Is that yellow?

13
00:00:43,155 --> 00:00:45,843
Okay, put it right there.

14
00:00:49,461 --> 00:00:50,907
Let's see.

15
00:00:50,907 --> 00:00:53,670
If we put these two together, do they

16
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,072
match in color?

17
00:00:55,072 --> 00:00:56,233
- no.

18
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:57,556
- No, so you might not
want to put that one in.

19
00:00:57,556 --> 00:01:12,432
(background chatter)

20
00:01:12,432 --> 00:01:13,986
- Okay, wow.

21
00:01:13,986 --> 00:01:14,913
So put it here, you've already

22
00:01:14,913 --> 00:01:16,713
given it a check.

23
00:01:16,713 --> 00:01:18,826
So now, what I want you to do,

24
00:01:18,826 --> 00:01:20,382
by looking at the sheet,

25
00:01:20,382 --> 00:01:24,561
I want you to sort by size.

26
00:01:24,561 --> 00:01:26,891
What does size mean?

27
00:01:26,891 --> 00:01:31,084
- If something is bigger.

28
00:01:31,084 --> 00:01:32,906
- If something is bigger or smaller.

29
00:01:32,906 --> 00:01:35,158
Now which measurement,

30
00:01:35,158 --> 00:01:38,107
which size are you going to sort by?

31
00:01:38,107 --> 00:01:39,790
Big or little?

32
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,079
- Big.

33
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:42,356
- Okay, so all your big leaves,

34
00:01:42,356 --> 00:01:44,632
put them in the middle.

35
00:01:44,632 --> 00:01:46,873
Okay.

36
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:50,430
(background chatter)

37
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,607
- You decide how you want to sort them.

38
00:01:55,607 --> 00:01:58,470
So if you want to use
both baggies, that's okay.

39
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:04,797
If you want to just use
one, that's okay, too.

40
00:02:04,797 --> 00:02:09,520
Okay, that's okay, that's okay, too.

41
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,121
- I noticed that you
haven't started sorting yet.

42
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:14,867
So which one do you want to sort by?

43
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:19,274
Or do you want to make up your own?

44
00:02:19,274 --> 00:02:20,444
- I like to do this.

45
00:02:20,444 --> 00:02:21,631
- Yeah, color.

46
00:02:21,631 --> 00:02:22,516
- Color?

47
00:02:22,516 --> 00:02:25,201
Okay, so ok, what color
are you going to choose?

48
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:26,393
- I'm gonna choose brown.

49
00:02:26,393 --> 00:02:28,878
Jennifer is that ok?

50
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:33,261
You have to ask your partner.

51
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:35,156
Sort by brown.

52
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:37,118
So put all the leaves that match,

53
00:02:37,118 --> 00:02:42,755
the brown, in your work space.

54
00:02:42,755 --> 00:02:59,519
Ok, let's see what's going on over here.

55
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,482
Ok, well let me see this.

56
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:03,478
Let me see that, please.

57
00:03:03,478 --> 00:03:05,441
Ok we are going to work with partners.

58
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:06,840
I know sometimes it can be hard

59
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,646
to work with partners, because

60
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,470
you're trying to make a choice

61
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,595
and maybe one person
wants to do one thing,

62
00:03:12,595 --> 00:03:14,313
and maybe one person wants to do another

63
00:03:14,313 --> 00:03:20,503
so we're gonna work together
to figure this out.

64
00:03:20,503 --> 00:03:22,112
Well, let's get working.
-She's laughing.

65
00:03:22,112 --> 00:03:25,000
How do you want to sort your leaves now.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,966
Let's get our workspace in the middle.

67
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:29,597
I notice you already sorted by color,

68
00:03:29,597 --> 00:03:33,394
so now how do you want to sort?

69
00:03:33,394 --> 00:03:34,717
By shape?

70
00:03:34,717 --> 00:03:38,345
Ask your partner if that's ok.

71
00:03:38,345 --> 00:03:41,944
Ask your partner if that's ok.

72
00:03:41,944 --> 00:03:45,670
Ok, is this the shape you want to sort by?

73
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,435
Oh, this is pretty tricky.

74
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,825
See if you have any more leaves

75
00:03:49,825 --> 00:03:54,192
that match this shape.

76
00:03:54,192 --> 00:04:02,073
How can you describe this shape?

77
00:04:02,073 --> 00:04:08,996
How can you describe that shape?

78
00:04:08,996 --> 00:04:09,991
So you're going to look for

79
00:04:09,991 --> 00:04:11,540
ones that have little points?

80
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,435
So you're actually sorting by points.

81
00:04:15,435 --> 00:04:18,801
Yes, am I hearing that right?

82
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:21,031
So look at your leaves, and

83
00:04:21,031 --> 00:04:24,105
look for ones that have teeny tiny points.

84
00:04:24,105 --> 00:04:25,500
Look at your leaves,

85
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,836
so look at your leaves here.

86
00:04:26,836 --> 00:04:35,511
Ones that have teeny, tiny points.

87
00:04:35,511 --> 00:04:37,675
It has points, its very tiny.

88
00:04:37,675 --> 00:04:39,275
Does it have points?

89
00:04:39,275 --> 00:04:43,521
No, no side points?

90
00:04:43,521 --> 00:04:48,589
Yes, does it have some side points?

91
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:58,884
Do you think that belongs here?

92
00:04:58,884 --> 00:04:59,713
Oh, really!

93
00:04:59,713 --> 00:05:01,269
I loved how you used your magnifying

94
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:05,516
glass to find those little details.

95
00:05:05,516 --> 00:05:07,349
Keep on looking through yours, Jennifer

96
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,150
because I have a feeling that

97
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,640
you are going to find some more.

98
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,872
Take a look at these points and

99
00:05:12,872 --> 00:05:15,995
take a look at these points.

100
00:05:15,995 --> 00:05:18,941
You're sorting by points, right?

101
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:23,040
Are those little points or big points?

102
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,080
Little or big?

103
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,712
Little?

104
00:05:26,712 --> 00:05:28,354
Are they little like this?

105
00:05:28,354 --> 00:05:31,280
Are you sure?

106
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,273
So you think this belongs here?

107
00:05:33,273 --> 00:05:36,307
Okay.

108
00:05:36,307 --> 00:05:46,922
(background chatter)

109
00:05:46,922 --> 00:05:48,113
Don't worry about your name for right now.

110
00:05:48,113 --> 00:05:51,073
I've noticed that you've
sorted by every way.

111
00:05:51,073 --> 00:05:53,483
Now, are you ready for the challenge?

112
00:05:53,483 --> 00:05:56,759
Can you make up your own way to sort?

113
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,822
Something that we didn't
talk about on Friday?

114
00:06:00,822 --> 00:06:03,678
Oh, I bet you could.

115
00:06:03,678 --> 00:06:14,998
Yeah, well let's think a little bit more.

116
00:06:14,998 --> 00:06:18,481
Now I want you to look very very closely

117
00:06:18,481 --> 00:06:20,791
at these leaves.

118
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,440
What's something that's the same about

119
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,974
some of them?

120
00:06:24,974 --> 00:06:26,631
That's the question that you should

121
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:28,681
be asking yourself.

122
00:06:28,681 --> 00:06:30,599
What's the same about
some of these leaves?

123
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,305
- They have dots.

124
00:06:32,305 --> 00:06:34,996
- Really, they have dots?

125
00:06:34,996 --> 00:06:41,591
(background chatter)

126
00:06:41,591 --> 00:06:44,319
- Remember we had colors up here.

127
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,072
Andrew just said something.

128
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,790
Some of these had dots.

129
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:53,029
Do you see dots on some of your leaves?

130
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:56,001
Yes, do you think that's
a good way to sort?

131
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:57,116
So wow, see I thought you said you

132
00:06:57,116 --> 00:07:01,638
couldn't figure out another way.

133
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:04,310
So, I want you to put all of the leaves

134
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:07,102
with dots on your workspace.

135
00:07:07,102 --> 00:07:15,091
(background chatter)

136
00:07:15,091 --> 00:07:17,120
Okay, how are we sorting here?

137
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,904
(background chatter)

138
00:07:19,904 --> 00:07:21,192
That's okay.

139
00:07:21,192 --> 00:07:22,597
The way you're doing it is perfect.

140
00:07:22,597 --> 00:07:23,793
All you need to shoot for is

141
00:07:23,793 --> 00:07:26,275
to keep count of what you've done so far.

142
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:30,315
So let me come to you.

143
00:07:30,315 --> 00:07:37,036
I've noticed that you had
sorted by color so far.

144
00:07:37,036 --> 00:07:38,912
Which one is next, which one would you

145
00:07:38,912 --> 00:07:42,151
like to do next?

146
00:07:42,151 --> 00:07:43,916
Okay, which one do you want to do?

147
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:44,760
It's up to you.

148
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,074
Do you want to sort by big leaves?

149
00:07:47,074 --> 00:07:48,838
Is that okay, Monica?

150
00:07:48,838 --> 00:07:56,590
Okay, so look at your
leaves, and sort by size.

151
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:01,037
Now find all of your leaves that are big.

152
00:08:01,037 --> 00:08:06,323
Uh oh, does this one belong there?

153
00:08:06,323 --> 00:08:08,636
Does this one belong there?

154
00:08:08,636 --> 00:08:11,146
Okay, wow.

155
00:08:11,146 --> 00:08:12,113
Amazing.

156
00:08:12,113 --> 00:08:20,274
I like how you're really
looking at your leaves.

157
00:08:20,274 --> 00:08:24,361
Absolutely, that one's very big, nice job.

158
00:08:24,361 --> 00:08:40,638
(children talking)

159
00:08:40,638 --> 00:08:52,956
(chimes ring)

160
00:08:52,956 --> 00:08:56,590
I really love how
children stopped working.

161
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,679
They put their hands up.

162
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:02,430
Friends, can I share
something that I noticed?

163
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:05,031
Is that okay?

164
00:09:05,031 --> 00:09:08,433
When I was walking around, I noticed

165
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:13,077
children using their eyes and

166
00:09:13,077 --> 00:09:16,513
sometimes their hands
to explore their leaves.

167
00:09:16,513 --> 00:09:19,787
Some of you figured out new ways

168
00:09:19,787 --> 00:09:22,028
to sort your leaves.

169
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:26,643
And I can't wait for those
kids to share their ways.

170
00:09:26,643 --> 00:09:28,309
Some of you went ahead and you looked at

171
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:30,826
what we talked about on Friday.

172
00:09:30,826 --> 00:09:33,557
Which was also a really great way

173
00:09:33,557 --> 00:09:38,488
to use a resource in our
room to help us sort.

174
00:09:38,488 --> 00:09:39,591
I just want to remind everybody

175
00:09:39,591 --> 00:09:41,831
that your job right now is not

176
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,840
to touch your leaves.

177
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,481
Your job right now is not
to touch your leaves.

178
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:50,989
Your leaves are down.

179
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:52,707
Because it's important for scientists

180
00:09:52,707 --> 00:09:54,553
to stop what they're doing and

181
00:09:54,553 --> 00:10:01,113
share what they have noticed.

182
00:10:01,113 --> 00:10:06,837
Let's take a peek.

183
00:10:06,837 --> 00:10:08,636
This is a graph, does anybody

184
00:10:08,636 --> 00:10:10,761
recognize this graph?

185
00:10:10,761 --> 00:10:14,592
Does it look like something we already do?

186
00:10:14,592 --> 00:10:18,911
What is it, raise your
hand if you want to share.

187
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:21,384
It kind of looks like you use something,

188
00:10:21,384 --> 00:10:27,154
it's something we do
every, almost every day.

189
00:10:27,154 --> 00:10:28,487
Brian?

190
00:10:28,487 --> 00:10:30,037
- [child] Um, the calendar.

191
00:10:30,037 --> 00:10:31,476
- [Teacher] Yes!

192
00:10:31,476 --> 00:10:32,753
And what in our calendar,

193
00:10:32,753 --> 00:10:34,866
sweetheart, looks like that?

194
00:10:34,866 --> 00:10:36,074
- The weather.

195
00:10:36,074 --> 00:10:38,152
- [Teacher] Oh, I love
how you're thinking.

196
00:10:38,152 --> 00:10:41,310
Absolutely right, our weather calendar

197
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:46,232
looks like this.

198
00:10:46,232 --> 00:10:50,876
Today, friends, we're going
to share how you sorted.

199
00:10:50,876 --> 00:10:52,072
And then, I'm going to go ahead,

200
00:10:52,072 --> 00:10:55,590
I'm going to color in boxes.

201
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,111
and then at the end we're gonna see.

202
00:10:57,111 --> 00:11:00,942
What was the most popular way to sort?

203
00:11:00,942 --> 00:11:03,160
What was maybe not the most popular way,

204
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,271
and if anyone had a different way to sort.

205
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:09,175
Okay?

206
00:11:09,175 --> 00:11:12,959
So, just give me a thumbs up

207
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,314
if you sorted by size.

208
00:11:16,314 --> 00:11:24,026
Look at your sheet, look at your sheet.

209
00:11:24,026 --> 00:11:31,355
And give me a thumbs up if
you sorted by size today.

210
00:11:31,355 --> 00:11:33,038
Let's see.

211
00:11:33,038 --> 00:11:34,907
And actually, I'm only
going to ask one partner

212
00:11:34,907 --> 00:11:36,074
to put their thumb up.

213
00:11:36,074 --> 00:11:38,477
Because I'm only counting partners.

214
00:11:38,477 --> 00:11:44,721
So, one group, two groups, three groups,

215
00:11:44,721 --> 00:11:48,424
four groups, five groups, six,

216
00:11:48,424 --> 00:11:51,791
seven, eight groups, nine groups,

217
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:56,040
ten groups, eleven groups, twelve groups.

218
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,384
Uh oh.

219
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,998
Do I have enough spaces?

220
00:11:58,998 --> 00:12:00,321
- [children] No.

221
00:12:00,321 --> 00:12:02,841
- Oh my gosh, I'll have to add them.

222
00:12:02,841 --> 00:12:07,142
Eleven, twelve, so
there were twelve groups

223
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:11,093
- [Child] There's thirteen.

224
00:12:11,093 --> 00:12:13,652
- that wanted, that sorted by this kind.

225
00:12:13,652 --> 00:12:19,522
- [Child] Mrs (unclear), you forgot mine.

226
00:12:19,522 --> 00:12:22,798
Okay, anybody sort by shape today?

227
00:12:22,798 --> 00:12:27,885
Anybody sort by shape today?

228
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:29,577
Okay, keep your thumbs up.

229
00:12:29,577 --> 00:12:32,351
One, two, okay.

230
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:35,756
One, two, three,

231
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:39,184
four, five,

232
00:12:39,184 --> 00:12:42,436
six, seven,

233
00:12:42,436 --> 00:12:46,233
eight, nine, ten.

234
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:49,793
Wow, ten groups sorted by shape.

235
00:12:49,793 --> 00:12:52,585
- [Child] Mrs (unclear)
you keep forgetting mine.

236
00:12:52,585 --> 00:12:58,258
Mrs (unclear) you keep forgetting mine.

237
00:12:58,258 --> 00:12:59,992
Okay friends, before we continue

238
00:12:59,992 --> 00:13:02,302
going on with that, did you sort

239
00:13:02,302 --> 00:13:05,600
by another way today?

240
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,433
Did you sort by another way, that wasn't

241
00:13:08,433 --> 00:13:13,994
something we talked about on Friday?

242
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:16,960
Emma, did you sort by
a different way today?

243
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:18,542
Oh sorry, you're two.

244
00:13:18,542 --> 00:13:21,598
Joel, and Emma, I'll come to you.

245
00:13:21,598 --> 00:13:26,753
(child talking)

246
00:13:26,753 --> 00:13:29,063
- What's another way you sorted?

247
00:13:29,063 --> 00:13:43,831
(child talking)

248
00:13:43,831 --> 00:13:46,595
Okay, did someone sort by a completely

249
00:13:46,595 --> 00:13:49,230
different way that's not on your chart?

250
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,239
Andrew?

251
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:52,713
- Dots.

252
00:13:52,713 --> 00:13:57,113
- Dots, did anybody sort by dots today?

253
00:13:57,113 --> 00:13:59,842
Yeah, okay.

254
00:13:59,842 --> 00:14:04,520
What's another way you sorted your leaves?

255
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:12,833
Catherine?

256
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,354
Counting the points.

257
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,827
Okay, now that was a way
that we sorted on our

258
00:14:16,827 --> 00:14:18,917
sheet, but that's okay.

259
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:20,078
How's it different?

260
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:27,195
(child talking)

261
00:14:27,195 --> 00:14:31,397
So you were looking for nine points, okay?

262
00:14:31,397 --> 00:14:32,825
So friends there's so many different

263
00:14:32,825 --> 00:14:35,063
ways you can sort, and I just want you

264
00:14:35,063 --> 00:14:36,828
to put your hands down..

265
00:14:36,828 --> 00:14:37,713
Because there's so many different

266
00:14:37,713 --> 00:14:39,315
ways you can sort, and there's many

267
00:14:39,315 --> 00:14:43,615
more ways than just
what we practiced today.

268
00:14:43,615 --> 00:14:45,759
As scientists and
mathematicians, we're gonna

269
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,194
continue sorting and
looking for similarities,

270
00:14:50,194 --> 00:14:51,785
things that are the same things,

271
00:14:51,785 --> 00:14:53,201
and things that are different.

272
00:14:53,201 --> 00:14:55,035
Give yourself a pat on the back.

273
00:14:55,035 --> 00:14:56,754
Thank you so much, friends, for

274
00:14:56,754 --> 00:14:59,407
doing your best job today.
