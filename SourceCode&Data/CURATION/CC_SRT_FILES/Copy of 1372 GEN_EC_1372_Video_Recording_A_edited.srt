1
00:00:00,454 --> 00:00:02,787
- This one is probably medium.

2
00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:09,756
So this one is mine.

3
00:00:10,922 --> 00:00:13,339
- So this has to be a medium.

4
00:00:15,587 --> 00:00:18,638
- And this one has to be a large because...

5
00:00:18,638 --> 00:00:21,388
My medium is half way up to here.

6
00:00:25,611 --> 00:00:27,611
So it has to be a large.

7
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:35,920
- So you make a prediction
about how many small rocks

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,837
it takes to make a big.

9
00:00:39,448 --> 00:00:42,488
- I think it's gonna be 12 small rocks.

10
00:00:42,488 --> 00:00:44,624
- That's a good idea.

11
00:00:44,624 --> 00:00:47,336
Put our small rocks we have here

12
00:00:47,336 --> 00:00:49,958
so we make it, draw two little blocks

13
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,458
and if we have 12.

14
00:00:53,907 --> 00:00:56,490
- Draw a rectangle and just put,

15
00:00:58,872 --> 00:01:01,622
put your line through right here.

16
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,617
- What do you think how many small rocks?

17
00:01:10,774 --> 00:01:24,941
(children talking over each other)

18
00:01:25,215 --> 00:01:28,715
- I think that there is going to be eight.

19
00:01:31,338 --> 00:01:33,005
We have eight rocks.

20
00:01:34,414 --> 00:01:37,459
So I think that there's going to be

21
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:38,709
15 small rocks.

22
00:01:41,556 --> 00:01:42,806
What about you?

23
00:01:44,966 --> 00:01:46,466
- I have 10, 11, 12.

24
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,472
- Boys and girls I had a good question.

25
00:01:49,472 --> 00:01:52,144
If you've got more
rocks than you do boxes,

26
00:01:52,144 --> 00:01:55,672
you know that we've got how many boxes?

27
00:01:55,672 --> 00:01:56,505
How many boxes?
- Ten.

28
00:01:56,505 --> 00:01:57,522
- There's ten.

29
00:01:57,522 --> 00:01:59,290
So at the top you can write,

30
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,958
since we've been working with
place value with tens and ones

31
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:05,773
you can put ten. We know
that's how many boxes we have.

32
00:02:05,773 --> 00:02:09,856
You could put plus six
if you have which number?

33
00:02:10,911 --> 00:02:11,815
- 16.

34
00:02:11,815 --> 00:02:12,648
- 16.

35
00:02:12,648 --> 00:02:14,072
If you all had 11 what could you do?

36
00:02:14,072 --> 00:02:18,468
You got ten so you
would write plus one.

37
00:02:18,468 --> 00:02:20,149
If you had 12 you would write,

38
00:02:20,149 --> 00:02:22,163
you've got 10 so what
would you write above it?

39
00:02:22,163 --> 00:02:22,996
Plus two.

40
00:02:24,255 --> 00:02:25,731
So you can do it that way.

41
00:02:25,731 --> 00:02:27,664
Good question.

42
00:02:27,664 --> 00:02:31,497
- Now what about you
make a prediction of five

43
00:02:32,428 --> 00:02:36,561
then you ask us how
many baby rocks we think

44
00:02:36,561 --> 00:02:37,811
that ten makes.

45
00:02:41,644 --> 00:02:45,811
(children talking over each other)

46
00:02:54,772 --> 00:02:58,939
(children talking over each other)

47
00:03:04,325 --> 00:03:07,492
- I think that there is going to be...

48
00:03:13,537 --> 00:03:14,974
- These can be large.

49
00:03:14,974 --> 00:03:16,947
And there's one, two

50
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,030
three, four, four larges.

51
00:03:22,195 --> 00:03:26,362
(children talking over each other)

52
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,537
(children talking over each other)

53
00:03:43,572 --> 00:03:45,215
- He's already told you

54
00:03:45,215 --> 00:03:47,465
how many mediums there are.

55
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:54,186
(children talking over each other)

56
00:03:57,807 --> 00:04:01,974
(children talking over each other)

57
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:07,033
- However you think.

58
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:07,866
Very good.

59
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:18,016
So you've got yours sorted by size

60
00:04:18,016 --> 00:04:20,397
or you could see if there's another way

61
00:04:20,397 --> 00:04:21,874
you can sort your rocks?

62
00:04:21,874 --> 00:04:25,284
- We just did size first
so we could do our work.

63
00:04:25,284 --> 00:04:26,804
- Very smart.

64
00:04:26,804 --> 00:04:28,412
Very smart.

65
00:04:28,412 --> 00:04:30,505
Tell me about looking at the graph

66
00:04:30,505 --> 00:04:33,005
how many small you had Diana.

67
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,897
How many small rocks were there?

68
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,211
- Five.

69
00:04:41,211 --> 00:04:45,402
- Alright how many
medium rocks did you have?

70
00:04:45,402 --> 00:04:46,235
- 11.

71
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,018
- And how many large?

72
00:04:49,018 --> 00:04:50,128
- Four.

73
00:04:50,128 --> 00:04:52,591
- Good, good and you sorted them.

74
00:04:52,591 --> 00:04:54,841
Oh, you got some nice rocks.

75
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:00,398
Oooh.

76
00:05:01,738 --> 00:05:04,071
Nice rock there, it's pretty.

77
00:05:05,309 --> 00:05:06,142
- Neat.

78
00:05:09,451 --> 00:05:13,618
(children talking over each other)

79
00:05:20,447 --> 00:05:23,273
- Now this looks
much better, much better.

80
00:05:23,273 --> 00:05:25,606
- Medium, there's one, two, three, four,

81
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,303
five, six, seven, eight, nine,

82
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:32,171
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

83
00:05:34,122 --> 00:05:38,289
(children talking over each other)

84
00:05:39,828 --> 00:05:43,328
- Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

85
00:05:48,234 --> 00:05:49,734
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

86
00:06:00,545 --> 00:06:04,712
(children talking over each other)

87
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:13,416
(children talking over each other)

88
00:06:20,433 --> 00:06:21,433
- Wait, wait. One, two, three, four, five...

89
00:06:29,804 --> 00:06:32,721
- Now we need five more to make 15.

90
00:06:37,809 --> 00:06:41,976
(children talking over each other)

91
00:06:55,555 --> 00:06:59,722
(children talking over each other)

92
00:07:01,914 --> 00:07:03,164
- One, two, three,

93
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:06,883
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

94
00:07:06,883 --> 00:07:08,133
10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

95
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:14,986
(children talking over each other)

96
00:07:17,675 --> 00:07:19,609
- Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

97
00:07:19,609 --> 00:07:21,109
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

98
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,470
- I counted 14.

99
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:30,880
(children talking over each other)

100
00:07:37,946 --> 00:07:42,113
(children talking over each other)

101
00:07:45,124 --> 00:07:47,291
- Put them together.

102
00:07:48,226 --> 00:07:49,893
- One, two, three, four.

103
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:56,556
(children talking over each other)

104
00:07:59,486 --> 00:08:03,261
- I'd say like maybe
it goes with the white.

105
00:08:03,261 --> 00:08:04,775
- Okay, what about this one?

106
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,110
- That goes with the white right?

107
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:11,277
(children talking over each other)

108
00:08:12,761 --> 00:08:14,594
- What about this one?

109
00:08:15,725 --> 00:08:19,590
- Hmm, I'd say like, what
does it have the most of?

110
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,853
I'd say probably white.

111
00:08:21,853 --> 00:08:24,189
- What about this one?

112
00:08:24,189 --> 00:08:26,233
- This one goes for tan.

113
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:27,400
- This one is,

114
00:08:29,472 --> 00:08:30,639
this one goes.

115
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:35,052
This one goes too.

116
00:08:35,052 --> 00:08:38,372
- This goes with the gray too.

117
00:08:38,372 --> 00:08:40,665
- This one goes to the--

118
00:08:42,665 --> 00:08:44,165
- I think it goes.

119
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:47,502
- It goes with the white.

120
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,607
(children talking over each other)

121
00:08:54,819 --> 00:08:56,831
- Now let's see.

122
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,677
I think it's a pretty rock.

123
00:08:58,677 --> 00:08:59,540
Wait, oh.

124
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,851
- That one goes there.

125
00:09:00,851 --> 00:09:01,684
- I know it.

126
00:09:01,684 --> 00:09:02,684
They all do.

127
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:06,226
Wait, these go with the green.

128
00:09:08,396 --> 00:09:10,858
No this one, this one is gray.

129
00:09:10,858 --> 00:09:12,788
- It's still got sand in it.

130
00:09:12,788 --> 00:09:15,535
- This one is green and

131
00:09:15,535 --> 00:09:18,868
at least it looks a little bit greenish.

132
00:09:22,867 --> 00:09:25,284
I'd say like maybe green too.

133
00:09:27,147 --> 00:09:28,730
We'll have all yes.

134
00:09:30,568 --> 00:09:32,151
Okay, now this rock.

135
00:09:34,601 --> 00:09:37,018
Okay Diana, Cam and Gaelin.

136
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,371
What I want you to do is

137
00:09:43,243 --> 00:09:44,966
you'll probably,

138
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:46,936
how about you just take the rocks.

139
00:09:46,936 --> 00:09:49,430
Because I can't remember.

140
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,822
- What's going on?

141
00:09:50,822 --> 00:09:53,239
- We're sorting them a different way.

142
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:55,865
- You're sorting
them a different way.

143
00:09:55,865 --> 00:09:57,588
And what way would that be?

144
00:09:57,588 --> 00:10:00,139
How did you all decide to sort rocks?

145
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:01,942
- I thought we'd sort them by color

146
00:10:01,942 --> 00:10:04,284
and now we're gonna do it by cut.

147
00:10:04,284 --> 00:10:07,117
- Tell me that again because I don't,

148
00:10:08,052 --> 00:10:10,104
I don't know that part.

149
00:10:10,104 --> 00:10:13,671
(children talking over each other)

150
00:10:13,671 --> 00:10:16,219
- Now since we did the color,

151
00:10:16,219 --> 00:10:18,227
we're going to do is,

152
00:10:18,227 --> 00:10:20,033
we're going to do by texture.

153
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:21,505
- What's texture?

154
00:10:21,505 --> 00:10:23,673
- It's by how it feels.

155
00:10:23,673 --> 00:10:26,006
- Oh, well can you teach me?

156
00:10:31,226 --> 00:10:35,020
- Find out the texture
from these two rocks,

157
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,603
I see how it feels.

158
00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:41,669
And since this one feels very
smooth I'll put it by itself.

159
00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:43,419
- Well, can I feel it?

160
00:10:46,523 --> 00:10:47,613
- Pretty smooth.

161
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,132
- Pretty smooth. Have you felt it?

162
00:10:49,132 --> 00:10:50,118
Feel it.

163
00:10:50,118 --> 00:10:52,006
How you think it feels?

164
00:10:52,006 --> 00:10:52,839
- Smooth.

165
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:54,064
- It does feel pretty smooth.

166
00:10:54,064 --> 00:10:55,918
- And it looks like a piece of meat.

167
00:10:55,918 --> 00:10:57,481
- It looks like a piece a meat?

168
00:10:57,481 --> 00:10:58,314
- Yes.

169
00:10:58,314 --> 00:11:00,235
- Better not eat a rock should I?

170
00:11:00,235 --> 00:11:02,077
Okay, where does this one need to go?

171
00:11:02,077 --> 00:11:03,222
- It needs to go.

172
00:11:03,222 --> 00:11:04,696
- Over here?

173
00:11:04,696 --> 00:11:07,358
- We haven't finished quite yet so...

174
00:11:07,358 --> 00:11:08,566
- Okay.

175
00:11:08,566 --> 00:11:12,316
- And this one is like
I'll say pretty rough.

176
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,715
- Pretty rough, can I feel this one?

177
00:11:15,715 --> 00:11:16,548
Oh gosh.

178
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:18,968
Whoo.

179
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,100
Yeah.

180
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,087
It does feel a little rough.

181
00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:24,386
It does feel like it's
got some sand on it.

182
00:11:24,386 --> 00:11:26,022
You know a word that I can think of

183
00:11:26,022 --> 00:11:27,954
that makes me think of that?

184
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:28,787
- Rough.

185
00:11:28,787 --> 00:11:30,504
- Rough or gritty.

186
00:11:30,504 --> 00:11:33,538
You know sand is gritty feeling.

187
00:11:33,538 --> 00:11:35,918
Well, that's kind of gritty.

188
00:11:35,918 --> 00:11:38,838
It does feel a little rough.

189
00:11:38,838 --> 00:11:40,235
- It can stand up.

190
00:11:40,235 --> 00:11:41,838
- It stands up?

191
00:11:41,838 --> 00:11:43,763
- I'm gonna do it, put it by itself.

192
00:11:43,763 --> 00:11:44,596
- Okay.

193
00:11:44,596 --> 00:11:47,164
- And we're going to keep on doing it.

194
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:50,319
Until all of them are sorted.

195
00:11:50,319 --> 00:11:52,093
- Okay, this is a pretty cool rock,

196
00:11:52,093 --> 00:11:54,104
how does it feel?

197
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:55,867
- I'll say pretty bumpy kind of rock.

198
00:11:55,867 --> 00:11:57,340
- Pretty bumpy, pretty rough.

199
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,560
Oh, this one's very rough.

200
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,816
- So rough I can hardly stand myself.

201
00:12:01,816 --> 00:12:03,374
- Look at the shell on it.

202
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:04,207
(gasp)

203
00:12:04,207 --> 00:12:05,754
- It does have a shell in it.

204
00:12:05,754 --> 00:12:07,684
- On the other side, look.

205
00:12:07,684 --> 00:12:10,721
On the other side turn it like right here,

206
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:11,951
it has another shell.

207
00:12:11,951 --> 00:12:14,579
- It does, so what kind
of rock would this be?

208
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:15,849
- A two fossil rock.

209
00:12:15,849 --> 00:12:17,730
- A fossil rock.

210
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,289
And what kind are they,

211
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:21,092
what's it called?

212
00:12:21,092 --> 00:12:23,842
If it has a fossil imprint in it?
- Fossil.

213
00:12:25,295 --> 00:12:26,462
- If it settled

214
00:12:27,685 --> 00:12:28,753
and got a fossil?

215
00:12:28,753 --> 00:12:29,615
- Sedimentary.

216
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,499
- It would be a sedimentary rock.

217
00:12:31,499 --> 00:12:32,332
Very cool.

218
00:12:32,332 --> 00:12:33,428
I'm so proud of you.

219
00:12:33,428 --> 00:12:35,319
That was definitely very rough.

220
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:36,509
Have you felt it?
- This is.

221
00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:38,767
- What do you think?

222
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:40,651
- On, the back is kind of squishy.

223
00:12:40,651 --> 00:12:41,553
- It is rough.

224
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,238
Okay, you all keep working,
you're doing a good job.

225
00:12:43,238 --> 00:12:44,071
I'm proud of you.

226
00:12:44,071 --> 00:12:44,904
- Okay.

227
00:12:44,904 --> 00:12:47,737
Now you can put it with the rough, the super rough.

228
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,270
I think this one is, I can tell.

229
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,795
I say medium, a little
rough, a little smooth.

230
00:12:58,795 --> 00:13:01,128
This one goes in the middle.

231
00:13:03,358 --> 00:13:04,224
- This one is smooth.

232
00:13:04,224 --> 00:13:06,057
- This is super rough.

233
00:13:07,304 --> 00:13:08,221
Let me feel.

234
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:12,149
- Smooth.

235
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:14,488
- I'm gonna put it in the middle

236
00:13:14,488 --> 00:13:16,296
because I think--

237
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:20,463
(children talking over each other)

238
00:13:22,821 --> 00:13:26,988
(children talking over each other)

239
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:34,256
(children talking over each other)

240
00:13:36,407 --> 00:13:40,234
(children talking over each other)

241
00:13:40,234 --> 00:13:44,401
- Very good
Arianna, I like the way you--

242
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:49,959
(children talking over each other)

243
00:13:51,086 --> 00:13:55,253
(children talking over each other)

244
00:13:56,624 --> 00:13:59,614
(children talking over each other)

245
00:13:59,614 --> 00:14:02,856
- One more medium rock than large.

246
00:14:02,856 --> 00:14:05,232
Because we have eight medium

247
00:14:05,232 --> 00:14:06,565
and seven large.

248
00:14:08,428 --> 00:14:12,595
- Because you can see...

249
00:14:18,687 --> 00:14:22,854
- A smooth side and a rough side.

250
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:32,308
(children talking over each other)

251
00:14:32,308 --> 00:14:35,637
(children talking over each other)

252
00:14:35,637 --> 00:14:37,607
(children talking over each other)

253
00:14:37,607 --> 00:14:39,417
- Because if you add two more together

254
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:40,417
it make 12.

255
00:14:41,594 --> 00:14:42,427
Medium is

256
00:14:46,395 --> 00:14:47,895
seven and large is

257
00:14:51,361 --> 00:14:52,958
eight.

258
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,914
- And I have an idea, when you do your rock

259
00:14:55,914 --> 00:14:57,593
what about you trace it?
