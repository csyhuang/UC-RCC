1
00:00:00,516 --> 00:00:02,916
- [Voiceover] I can go into
group two because that--

2
00:00:02,916 --> 00:00:04,950
- Except this one is
like, these two are like,

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,954
both like pop.

4
00:00:07,954 --> 00:00:11,159
These two are kinda like both pop.

5
00:00:11,159 --> 00:00:13,144
Because water's not bubbly.

6
00:00:13,144 --> 00:00:15,153
This one's bubbly and this one's--

7
00:00:15,153 --> 00:00:17,313
- [Voiceover] Coca Cola.

8
00:00:17,313 --> 00:00:18,158
Or Dr. Pepper.

9
00:00:18,158 --> 00:00:21,072
- [Voiceover] Do you have
a secret rule to use?

10
00:00:21,072 --> 00:00:23,638
- We're gonna get, like,
one of those blue ones

11
00:00:23,638 --> 00:00:26,157
and that could be like the bubbles.

12
00:00:26,157 --> 00:00:28,154
- Because they're kinda the same.

13
00:00:28,154 --> 00:00:28,920
- [Voiceover] Okay.

14
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,601
- [Voiceover] And this one, like--

15
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:31,344
- [Voiceover] So, I'm gonna make sure

16
00:00:31,344 --> 00:00:32,841
I'm understanding what
your rule is gonna be.

17
00:00:32,841 --> 00:00:34,312
Does it have something to do
with bubbles or does it have

18
00:00:34,312 --> 00:00:36,073
something to do with it sticks
to the side of the container?

19
00:00:36,073 --> 00:00:37,199
- It's the bubble.

20
00:00:37,199 --> 00:00:39,150
- Bubbles and stick to the side.

21
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:39,951
- Yeah.

22
00:00:39,951 --> 00:00:42,795
- [Voiceover] Okay, so
one group is gonna be

23
00:00:42,795 --> 00:00:43,597
sticking to the side

24
00:00:43,597 --> 00:00:45,071
and one group is not sticking to the side.

25
00:00:45,071 --> 00:00:45,760
Is that right?
- Yeah.

26
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,756
- [Voiceover] Okay, great, alright.

27
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,806
Alright, friends.

28
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:53,434
In order to be closer together,

29
00:00:53,434 --> 00:00:55,001
to really see how this is going to work,

30
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:57,119
I'm going to ask Anagelia's group

31
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,080
to very quietly come and sit
in these three chairs here.

32
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,437
Go ahead and bring your liquids with you.

33
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,232
(mumbling)

34
00:01:04,232 --> 00:01:06,681
Thank you very much.

35
00:01:06,681 --> 00:01:08,011
And...

36
00:01:15,191 --> 00:01:15,958
What we're going to do

37
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:18,117
is we're going to set up our rule

38
00:01:18,117 --> 00:01:20,904
so that

39
00:01:20,904 --> 00:01:22,076
it's up here at the front.

40
00:01:22,076 --> 00:01:26,070
So actually, Anagelia, if you don't mind,

41
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,080
Callie and Natalie,

42
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,031
if you guys could scoot
down just a little bit

43
00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:30,703
and then Anagelia's going to
join you on that side

44
00:01:30,703 --> 00:01:32,874
so we can see this front area right here.

45
00:01:32,874 --> 00:01:34,035
Okay?

46
00:01:34,035 --> 00:01:35,364
Thank you.

47
00:01:36,716 --> 00:01:39,956
So, we can set up one of
our groups on this table

48
00:01:39,956 --> 00:01:42,196
and one on this table.

49
00:01:42,196 --> 00:01:44,832
For your, what's my rule, okay.

50
00:01:44,832 --> 00:01:46,353
So, you're thinking of your property

51
00:01:46,353 --> 00:01:49,197
and you're going to put the ones
that fit the property here

52
00:01:49,197 --> 00:01:51,914
and the ones that don't
fit the property here.

53
00:01:51,914 --> 00:01:53,319
Who would like to go first?

54
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:55,432
Who would like to start?

55
00:01:55,432 --> 00:01:57,754
Okay, so Ryan's group.

56
00:01:57,754 --> 00:01:59,437
Ryan's group.

57
00:01:59,437 --> 00:02:01,991
Come up and set up one
that fits your rule.

58
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:03,186
Just a minute, Ryan.

59
00:02:03,186 --> 00:02:04,755
Isabella needs to come with you.

60
00:02:04,755 --> 00:02:06,392
One that fits your rule here,

61
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:08,435
and one that doesn't fit your rule here.

62
00:02:08,435 --> 00:02:09,782
Just one, just one.

63
00:02:09,782 --> 00:02:11,245
One in each.

64
00:02:19,142 --> 00:02:20,185
Okay, thank you.

65
00:02:20,185 --> 00:02:22,718
You can be seated, okay.

66
00:02:22,718 --> 00:02:25,156
So, we have this one fits their rule,

67
00:02:25,156 --> 00:02:27,601
this one doesn't fit their rule.

68
00:02:29,278 --> 00:02:30,520
I can tell Bryson's already thinking about

69
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,640
what it could possibly be.

70
00:02:34,595 --> 00:02:36,360
- This one can fit their rule.

71
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,788
- Hold on one second.

72
00:02:37,788 --> 00:02:41,155
That's where we're going,
but wait one second, okay.

73
00:02:41,155 --> 00:02:43,512
Let's talk about what we see.

74
00:02:43,512 --> 00:02:48,512
Any ideas so far of what
might be going on here?

75
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,274
Bryson, do you have one
that you could bring up

76
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,631
that you think

77
00:02:56,631 --> 00:02:59,319
goes in either space?

78
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,874
- [Bryson] The bubbles on the top.

79
00:03:00,874 --> 00:03:02,802
- Okay, so you think it has
something to do with bubbles.

80
00:03:02,802 --> 00:03:05,568
Do you have one that fits bubbles?

81
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,931
- [Voiceover] That one.

82
00:03:10,714 --> 00:03:13,152
- He's got a hypothesis.

83
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:14,708
Now Lena, he's got a hypothesis

84
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,157
about what he thinks it might be.

85
00:03:17,157 --> 00:03:18,791
Do you think this fits the rule?

86
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:19,707
- Yeah.
- Okay.

87
00:03:19,707 --> 00:03:22,146
So, now we need to check
in with Isabella and Ryan.

88
00:03:22,146 --> 00:03:23,076
Does that fit the rule?

89
00:03:23,076 --> 00:03:24,036
- [Voiceover] Yes.

90
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:25,395
- It does, okay.

91
00:03:25,395 --> 00:03:27,275
- [Voiceover] It doesn't fit my rule.

92
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:31,197
- So, your rule should be
the same as your partner's.

93
00:03:31,197 --> 00:03:32,880
Do you remember what that rule was, Ryan?

94
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,511
- [Ryan] Yeah.

95
00:03:33,511 --> 00:03:34,869
- Okay, great.

96
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:36,913
Alright, so Anagelia, thanks
for raising your hand.

97
00:03:36,913 --> 00:03:39,432
Do you have one that
you think fits the rule

98
00:03:39,432 --> 00:03:41,218
or doesn't fit the rule?

99
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,397
Thank you, Callie.

100
00:03:47,397 --> 00:03:48,917
Callie, will you check
in with Isabella and Ryan

101
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:49,753
and see if that fits.

102
00:03:49,753 --> 00:03:51,872
- Isabella, does that fit the rule?

103
00:03:51,872 --> 00:03:52,719
- [Isabella] Yes.

104
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,635
- Okay.

105
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:57,944
Anybody else who's ready to bring one up?

106
00:03:57,944 --> 00:03:59,070
- [Voiceover] Oh, another rule?

107
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,947
- Another one that might
fit or doesn't fit.

108
00:04:02,947 --> 00:04:03,992
Rigo, would you like to try?

109
00:04:03,992 --> 00:04:06,396
Which one do you think
would go with this group?

110
00:04:06,396 --> 00:04:07,348
Which ones from the ones you have

111
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:09,879
would go with this group?

112
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,742
Bryson giving you a hint?

113
00:04:11,742 --> 00:04:14,334
- [Voiceover] No, that one doesn't.

114
00:04:14,334 --> 00:04:17,712
That one here.

115
00:04:17,712 --> 00:04:19,036
- So, you think both of these fit?

116
00:04:19,036 --> 00:04:20,673
- The blue one, just the blue one.

117
00:04:20,673 --> 00:04:21,996
Because look at this one.

118
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:25,561
It doesn't leave white bubbles.

119
00:04:25,561 --> 00:04:27,952
- Okay, so if that one
doesn't fit the rule,

120
00:04:27,952 --> 00:04:29,996
where would it go, Rigo?

121
00:04:29,996 --> 00:04:31,950
Where would this one go?

122
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,112
- This one--

123
00:04:33,112 --> 00:04:34,401
- Over here, right?

124
00:04:34,401 --> 00:04:36,433
Just hold that thought
for a just a second.

125
00:04:36,433 --> 00:04:38,720
No, this one we said does fit it.

126
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,357
Right?

127
00:04:40,357 --> 00:04:42,306
Isabella and Ryan, are we on track so far?

128
00:04:42,306 --> 00:04:44,316
- [Isabella] Yes.
- Okay.

129
00:04:44,316 --> 00:04:46,440
Anagelia, did your group
have another one to bring up?

130
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,805
Okay.

131
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,398
That one you think fits in
this side, fits the rule?

132
00:04:51,398 --> 00:04:53,232
And Callie, you think this
one doesn't fit the rule?

133
00:04:53,232 --> 00:04:55,601
- [Callie] Look, when it shakes.

134
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:56,834
Doesn't do anything.

135
00:04:56,834 --> 00:05:00,122
- Okay, okay.

136
00:05:01,231 --> 00:05:04,319
Natalina, do you want to take a stab at

137
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:05,271
stating the rule for us?

138
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:08,824
What's going on here?

139
00:05:08,824 --> 00:05:12,746
- [Natalina] I think it's the
bubbles and not the bubbles

140
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,199
because that whole group,

141
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:16,196
when you shake it, it has lots of bubbles.

142
00:05:16,196 --> 00:05:17,918
That one doesn't.

143
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:19,195
- Okay, so let's go back a minute though

144
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:20,994
because you said two different things.

145
00:05:20,994 --> 00:05:22,038
Sit on your botton, Rigo.

146
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:25,626
First, you said bubbles and not bubbles.

147
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:29,143
And then you said
bubbles when you shake it

148
00:05:29,143 --> 00:05:31,999
and no bubbles when you shake it.

149
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,681
Is that the same rule
or is that different?

150
00:05:34,681 --> 00:05:37,201
Is the shaking part important,
do you think, to that rule?

151
00:05:37,201 --> 00:05:40,068
Okay, so can you state
it one more time for us?

152
00:05:40,068 --> 00:05:42,553
- [Natalina] When you shake it,

153
00:05:42,553 --> 00:05:44,712
if there's bubbles, it will go that one.

154
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:48,474
If it doesn't go bubbles,
it goes in that one.

155
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:48,950
- Okay.

156
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,877
And Isabella and Ryan, is that correct?

157
00:05:50,877 --> 00:05:51,357
- [Isabella] Yup.

158
00:05:51,357 --> 00:05:52,913
- Excellent, so the shaking
was the really important

159
00:05:52,913 --> 00:05:53,873
part of that, great.

160
00:05:53,873 --> 00:05:55,391
- [Bryson] At least for
this one it's weird.

161
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:57,306
- Right, because right now
this one has no bubbles.

162
00:05:57,306 --> 00:05:59,037
But if I shake it, it gets bubbles later.

163
00:05:59,037 --> 00:05:59,838
Okay.

164
00:05:59,838 --> 00:06:00,558
Excellent.

165
00:06:00,558 --> 00:06:01,951
Can you remember which
ones you had in your group?

166
00:06:01,951 --> 00:06:02,238
- [Voiceover] Yes.

167
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:03,504
- Can you come and get them?

168
00:06:03,504 --> 00:06:04,711
I'm not sure if I can.

169
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:06,023
I'm glad you can remember.

170
00:06:06,023 --> 00:06:08,074
Can you remember, Rigo,
which one you put out there?

171
00:06:08,074 --> 00:06:09,079
- This.

172
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,228
- - [Voiceover] No, that one's ours.

173
00:06:10,228 --> 00:06:11,716
- No, this is ours.

174
00:06:11,716 --> 00:06:13,631
Um, yeah.

175
00:06:13,631 --> 00:06:15,352
One, two, three, four, five.

176
00:06:15,352 --> 00:06:17,395
- I think you've got five.

177
00:06:17,395 --> 00:06:20,437
These ones are originally from
Isabella and Ryan I think.

178
00:06:20,437 --> 00:06:21,354
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

179
00:06:21,354 --> 00:06:23,432
- Isabella and Ryan, can
you come back and get yours?

180
00:06:23,432 --> 00:06:25,359
Great.

181
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:28,239
Alright, which partnership
is ready to tell,

182
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:32,116
to not tell, but to do
another secret rule?

183
00:06:32,116 --> 00:06:34,588
- I thought I brought a blue.

184
00:06:34,588 --> 00:06:35,865
- Did you think you brought a blue one?

185
00:06:35,865 --> 00:06:37,515
You figured it out.

186
00:06:37,515 --> 00:06:40,000
Okay, Natalina's group.

187
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,914
Can you put one on this side
that is fitting the rule

188
00:06:42,914 --> 00:06:46,443
and one on this side that
is not fitting the rule?

189
00:06:50,556 --> 00:06:51,880
Natalina, you want to
check that one more time,

190
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,514
make sure that's correct?

191
00:06:55,514 --> 00:07:00,514
Okay, this one fits the rule
you guys told me about earlier.

192
00:07:01,353 --> 00:07:04,360
And let's leave this on the table.

193
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,200
Anagelia, can you remind

194
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,953
what the rule is?

195
00:07:09,953 --> 00:07:12,718
(whispering)

196
00:07:12,718 --> 00:07:14,571
- Stick to the sides.

197
00:07:18,512 --> 00:07:21,036
Anagelia, can you remind
Callie what the rule is too?

198
00:07:21,036 --> 00:07:23,446
Go remind Callie.

199
00:07:28,437 --> 00:07:31,038
So, these two do fit, right?

200
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:35,011
Alright, show us one that doesn't, please.

201
00:07:36,712 --> 00:07:37,862
Okay.

202
00:07:37,862 --> 00:07:41,113
Careful with the liquids, please.

203
00:07:41,113 --> 00:07:42,587
You okay?

204
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,863
Alright.

205
00:07:44,863 --> 00:07:48,079
We actually got a little extra
help here now, didn't we?

206
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:50,355
We got two in this group that fit the rule

207
00:07:50,355 --> 00:07:53,559
and one that does not.

208
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:55,231
Isabella, do you have one
in your group over there

209
00:07:55,231 --> 00:07:58,110
that you think does or doesn't fit the rule?

210
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,396
Ryan, can you sit on your
bottom again, please?

211
00:08:01,396 --> 00:08:04,275
Watch what Isabella is doing.

212
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,065
- [Voiceover] Oh, cool.

213
00:08:05,065 --> 00:08:06,121
- See if you agree.

214
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:07,398
Ryan, watch what Isabella's doing

215
00:08:07,398 --> 00:08:10,211
and see if you agree.

216
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,321
Okay.

217
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,358
- [Voiceover] I agree.

218
00:08:15,358 --> 00:08:18,193
- Natalina, Callie, and Anagelia,

219
00:08:18,193 --> 00:08:19,156
thumbs up?

220
00:08:19,156 --> 00:08:20,317
Is that correct?

221
00:08:20,317 --> 00:08:21,232
Did she put it in the right place?

222
00:08:21,232 --> 00:08:22,555
- [Voiceover] Yeah.
- Okay, good.

223
00:08:22,555 --> 00:08:24,041
Bryson and Rigo, do you guys have one

224
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,307
that you want to put in?

225
00:08:25,307 --> 00:08:26,549
- [Voiceover] Yeah, more than one.

226
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:27,675
- More than one, okay.

227
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:29,034
- [Voiceover] Oh, three.

228
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:29,835
- Oh.

229
00:08:29,835 --> 00:08:31,681
Go ahead if you think that's right.

230
00:08:31,681 --> 00:08:35,315
I think that's right, Rigo.

231
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:38,113
Rigo, can you tell us why
you put these two here?

232
00:08:38,113 --> 00:08:40,435
- Because it can bubble.

233
00:08:40,435 --> 00:08:41,630
Bubbles in it.

234
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,279
- Because they have bubbles in them?

235
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,352
Does this--
- [Voiceover] Does not--

236
00:08:44,352 --> 00:08:45,873
- Just a second, just a second, Callie.

237
00:08:45,873 --> 00:08:47,998
Does this one have bubbles in it?

238
00:08:47,998 --> 00:08:49,240
Yes, it does.

239
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,824
So, it's not bubbles and no bubbles.

240
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,440
You're on the right track though.

241
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,983
Take a look again.

242
00:08:57,983 --> 00:08:59,712
Ryan, do you have one
that you can bring up

243
00:08:59,712 --> 00:09:02,159
and add to our groups here?

244
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,471
- [Voiceover] Stuff on the side.

245
00:09:03,471 --> 00:09:06,448
And this one, it goes away after awhile.

246
00:09:06,448 --> 00:09:09,872
Maybe this is the rule.

247
00:09:09,872 --> 00:09:11,965
- Thank you, Ryan.

248
00:09:11,965 --> 00:09:13,517
So far so good?

249
00:09:13,517 --> 00:09:15,038
- [Voiceover] Yeah.
- Okay.

250
00:09:15,038 --> 00:09:15,595
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

251
00:09:15,595 --> 00:09:18,881
Let's bring up all the rest.

252
00:09:18,881 --> 00:09:20,472
Oh Bryson, you can go ahead
and leave those there.

253
00:09:20,472 --> 00:09:21,238
You can go ahead and leave those there.

254
00:09:21,238 --> 00:09:22,561
I think we're okay, actually.

255
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:24,198
If you have any other
liquids to bring up--

256
00:09:24,198 --> 00:09:25,869
- [Voiceover] This one.

257
00:09:25,869 --> 00:09:27,867
- Bring them on up.

258
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:28,796
And put them where they belong

259
00:09:28,796 --> 00:09:33,161
and we'll see if we can
figure out what the rule is.

260
00:09:33,161 --> 00:09:35,344
Bring it on up, bring it on up.

261
00:09:35,344 --> 00:09:36,714
Ryan, bring that one on up

262
00:09:36,714 --> 00:09:40,513
and see if we can figure
out where it goes.

263
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:44,604
(mumbling)

264
00:09:46,676 --> 00:09:49,230
- This one's confusing.

265
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,353
- Ooh, a confusing one.

266
00:09:52,353 --> 00:09:55,360
I love a confusing one, do you know why?

267
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,556
- Because it helps you think.

268
00:09:56,556 --> 00:09:57,961
- It helps you think, exactly.

269
00:09:57,961 --> 00:10:00,794
It makes it more difficult to figure out.

270
00:10:00,794 --> 00:10:02,837
Would you like to consult with someone?

271
00:10:02,837 --> 00:10:03,986
Do you want to consult with Ryan?

272
00:10:03,986 --> 00:10:04,753
Ryan, come here a minute.

273
00:10:04,753 --> 00:10:07,431
Your partner needs your help.

274
00:10:07,431 --> 00:10:08,473
She's trying to figure
out where this one goes.

275
00:10:08,473 --> 00:10:10,000
What do you think?

276
00:10:11,155 --> 00:10:14,475
- I think it goes in no bubbles

277
00:10:14,475 --> 00:10:17,958
because no bubbles is the correct one.

278
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,862
- Now remember, we just found out though

279
00:10:19,862 --> 00:10:23,879
that bubbles and no
bubbles is not the rule.

280
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:27,119
Because look, this one has bubbles.

281
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:30,671
This one, if I shake it, has bubbles.

282
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:33,225
So, bubbles and no bubbles
was our last rule.

283
00:10:33,225 --> 00:10:33,876
Okay.

284
00:10:33,876 --> 00:10:35,838
Thanks for your help, Ryan.

285
00:10:35,838 --> 00:10:39,239
Anybody else give Isabella
some assistance here?

286
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:42,989
Well, you know the rules already right, Anagelia?

287
00:10:42,989 --> 00:10:43,707
What do you think, Anagelia?

288
00:10:43,707 --> 00:10:46,040
Which one do you think it goes in?

289
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,314
Listen to Anagelia, Rigo.

290
00:10:49,314 --> 00:10:52,001
(mumbling)

291
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:53,916
What's your opinion, what do you think?

292
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:57,759
Does it go in this group?

293
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,234
Or this one?

294
00:10:59,234 --> 00:11:00,836
What do you think?

295
00:11:04,077 --> 00:11:05,397
Even though you know what the rule is,

296
00:11:05,397 --> 00:11:07,510
can you help her figure
out how to classify it?

297
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,472
Rigo, are you watching?

298
00:11:09,472 --> 00:11:10,558
What do you think?

299
00:11:10,558 --> 00:11:12,439
- [Anagelie] It goes in--
- [Voiceover] In that one.

300
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:13,321
- [Anagelie] That one.

301
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:15,028
- In this group right here?

302
00:11:15,028 --> 00:11:16,398
Okay.

303
00:11:16,398 --> 00:11:18,151
What do you think, Isabella?

304
00:11:18,151 --> 00:11:19,446
You want Bryson's idea?

305
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:20,092
What does Bryson think?

306
00:11:20,092 --> 00:11:21,675
- I think it goes in that one.

307
00:11:21,675 --> 00:11:22,442
- Because?

308
00:11:22,442 --> 00:11:27,442
- Because most of them kind of move

309
00:11:27,794 --> 00:11:28,870
when you shake them.

310
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,914
But when you shake those, they don't.

311
00:11:30,914 --> 00:11:31,599
- Oh, interesting.

312
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:33,271
Let's try that out, okay.

313
00:11:33,271 --> 00:11:35,822
Okay, Ryan, come a little
closer to me right now, please.

314
00:11:35,822 --> 00:11:37,717
We're trying out something different.

315
00:11:37,717 --> 00:11:39,436
Bryson just said the ones...

316
00:11:39,436 --> 00:11:41,675
Rigo, you can stay where you
are, you're right close by.

317
00:11:41,675 --> 00:11:42,276
(mumbling)

318
00:11:42,276 --> 00:11:44,598
No.

319
00:11:44,598 --> 00:11:46,037
Bryson just said something
really interesting.

320
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:47,024
He just said,

321
00:11:47,024 --> 00:11:48,348
stand on your own two feet, please.

322
00:11:48,348 --> 00:11:48,951
Thank you.

323
00:11:48,951 --> 00:11:52,957
He just said that these ones
don't move when you shake them,

324
00:11:52,957 --> 00:11:54,872
and these ones do move
when you shake them,

325
00:11:54,872 --> 00:11:56,834
and that's how they're classified.

326
00:11:56,834 --> 00:11:59,273
So, I want to just double check

327
00:11:59,273 --> 00:12:01,235
that I make sure that I agree
with what you're saying.

328
00:12:01,235 --> 00:12:02,361
Okay, Bryson?

329
00:12:02,361 --> 00:12:06,270
Does this one move when I shake it?

330
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,915
- Not really, I can't really.

331
00:12:08,915 --> 00:12:09,913
- Try it out.
- Okay.

332
00:12:09,913 --> 00:12:11,039
- See what you think.

333
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:11,872
- It kinda does.
- Does this one move

334
00:12:11,872 --> 00:12:13,602
when you shake it?

335
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,113
- Yes.

336
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:18,550
- [Voiceover] Yes, okay.

337
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,186
- Oh, it sticks on the walls.

338
00:12:20,186 --> 00:12:21,278
- Ah-ha.

339
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:23,194
So, are you amending your rule?

340
00:12:23,194 --> 00:12:26,027
Are you saying that the rule
is it sticks on the sides?

341
00:12:26,027 --> 00:12:26,712
- Yes.

342
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:28,117
- So, this group right here is--

343
00:12:28,117 --> 00:12:30,555
- [Voiceover] Ding ding
ding ding ding ding.

344
00:12:30,555 --> 00:12:31,441
- [Voiceover] This group
right here is the one's

345
00:12:31,441 --> 00:12:32,474
that stick on the sides?

346
00:12:32,474 --> 00:12:34,633
- [Bryson] Yes.
- Ding ding ding ding ding.

347
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:36,917
Ring the bell, ring the bell.

348
00:12:36,917 --> 00:12:38,194
- [Voiceover] But we
still haven't figured out,

349
00:12:38,194 --> 00:12:40,435
even if we know that that's
what the secret rule is,

350
00:12:40,435 --> 00:12:42,234
where does this one go?

351
00:12:42,234 --> 00:12:43,314
- That one.

352
00:12:43,314 --> 00:12:45,275
- [Voiceover] That one, that one.

353
00:12:45,275 --> 00:12:46,790
- Okay, Natalina.

354
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,439
Let's take your opinion first.

355
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:50,076
Rigo, we're listening to Natalina.

356
00:12:50,076 --> 00:12:51,434
And then we'll hear from you, okay.

357
00:12:51,434 --> 00:12:52,432
Go ahead, Natalina.

358
00:12:52,432 --> 00:12:56,194
- I don't think it follows our rule.

359
00:12:56,194 --> 00:12:56,679
- [Voiceover] It does.
- [Voiceover] You think

360
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:58,072
it's totally out here, it's separate?

361
00:12:58,072 --> 00:12:59,790
It's not in either category?

362
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,795
- [Natalina] No, I don't
think it goes in this one.

363
00:13:01,795 --> 00:13:03,676
- [Voiceover] You don't
think it goes in this one?

364
00:13:03,676 --> 00:13:05,023
- No, I do think it goes--

365
00:13:05,023 --> 00:13:06,230
- [Voiceover] Because?

366
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:09,191
- Because it doesn't
really stick to the walls.

367
00:13:09,191 --> 00:13:12,360
- [Voiceover] It doesn't
really stick to the walls.

368
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,172
Okay, you wanna hold it, make sure?

369
00:13:14,172 --> 00:13:15,598
- [Voiceover] Stick to the--

370
00:13:15,598 --> 00:13:16,840
- [Voiceover] Other opinions?

371
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,886
Other opinions?

372
00:13:20,795 --> 00:13:21,640
Anagelia, I couldn't hear you.

373
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,195
Could you say it louder
so the group can hear you?

374
00:13:23,195 --> 00:13:24,240
Go ahead.

375
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,397
- It should go there
because when you move it,

376
00:13:28,397 --> 00:13:31,752
some parts stick to the
wall and some parts...

377
00:13:31,752 --> 00:13:33,041
- [Voiceover] When you move it?

378
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,480
- It sticks to the part.

379
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,595
- [Voiceover] It does stick to the walls?

380
00:13:35,595 --> 00:13:36,199
- Yeah.

381
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:37,870
- [Voiceover] Okay.

382
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:41,426
- [Voiceover] It's dirty.

383
00:13:41,426 --> 00:13:42,902
- [Voiceover] Isabella, what do you think?

384
00:13:42,902 --> 00:13:46,036
- I think it should go in this one because

385
00:13:46,036 --> 00:13:49,200
it kind of...

386
00:13:57,112 --> 00:14:00,559
It sticks to the wall at
first, and then it goes down.

387
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:03,520
So, and then doesn't stick
to the wall (mumbles).

388
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,074
- Okay, it sticks to the wall
first, and then it doesn't,

389
00:14:06,074 --> 00:14:08,036
so you think it goes in this one?

390
00:14:08,036 --> 00:14:09,824
May I have it just for a minute?

391
00:14:09,824 --> 00:14:13,075
One thing I'm noticing that's
a little confusing for me,

392
00:14:13,075 --> 00:14:15,757
if I look at this one
compared to all the others,

393
00:14:15,757 --> 00:14:18,998
this is the only one that's
not colored in this group.

394
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,041
Does that make it feel like
these ones are stickier

395
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,757
because they're colored somehow?

396
00:14:26,757 --> 00:14:29,834
So, this one's not as sticky
because it's less colored maybe?

397
00:14:29,834 --> 00:14:31,076
I don't know.

398
00:14:31,076 --> 00:14:32,353
So, you're saying it sticks at first,

399
00:14:32,353 --> 00:14:34,478
but then not so much after that.

400
00:14:34,478 --> 00:14:36,800
Can we tell how much this one sticks?

401
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,787
- [Voiceover] No.
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

402
00:14:37,787 --> 00:14:39,841
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

403
00:14:39,841 --> 00:14:41,356
- It really sticks.

404
00:14:41,356 --> 00:14:42,674
- It really sticks.

405
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:44,392
How about this one, can you
tell how much this one sticks?

406
00:14:44,392 --> 00:14:45,321
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

407
00:14:45,321 --> 00:14:46,992
- [Voiceover] It kinda sticks.

408
00:14:46,992 --> 00:14:48,750
- [Voiceover] That does stick (mumbles).

409
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,223
- [Voiceover] Most of it.
- Some of it.

410
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,001
- [Voiceover] That does.

411
00:14:52,001 --> 00:14:55,784
- So it sticks, but it is--

412
00:14:55,784 --> 00:14:58,908
- [Voiceover] Most of it
goes away and some stays.

413
00:14:58,908 --> 00:15:00,120
- Some goes away and some stays--
