1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,768
(alarm beeps)
[Background chatter]

2
00:00:03,538 --> 00:00:05,729
- Okay, would the person
who is currently writing,

3
00:00:06,229 --> 00:00:06,988
please stand up?

4
00:00:07,488 --> 00:00:08,698
(students groan)

5
00:00:08,836 --> 00:00:10,016
(laughter)

6
00:00:11,524 --> 00:00:15,284
- Alright, nice and loud.
What did you guys put?

7
00:00:15,912 --> 00:00:16,702
And why?

8
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,028
- Nicholas Carnatkey
created the perfect tangent

9
00:00:19,028 --> 00:00:22,428
of calculating all the key
transient effects on the core

10
00:00:22,428 --> 00:00:24,739
to predict, to create the
perfect amount of work.

11
00:00:24,896 --> 00:00:26,376
- Okay, very good. John, nice and loud.

12
00:00:26,376 --> 00:00:28,116
- Marie Curie.

13
00:00:28,116 --> 00:00:28,936
- Okay.

14
00:00:28,936 --> 00:00:30,796
- Discovered that radiation...

15
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:35,653
- Okay. What about you guys?

16
00:00:35,653 --> 00:00:40,653
(student murmurs answer)

17
00:00:43,748 --> 00:00:45,140
- Alright. Two claps
for these neighbors.

18
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,118
(students clap)

19
00:00:46,118 --> 00:00:47,948
- Sit down. Pass the board one person.

20
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,768
- What would be, this
is an opinion question,

21
00:00:59,248 --> 00:01:01,248
what do you think would be the result,

22
00:01:01,248 --> 00:01:04,318
if scientists didn't
communicate their findings

23
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,188
to the community at large?

24
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:07,828
Go!

25
00:01:08,466 --> 00:01:16,156
(students mumble)

26
00:01:18,176 --> 00:01:19,756
- Do we need to write
this down on the board?

27
00:01:19,772 --> 00:01:21,130
- Just give a bullet sentence.

28
00:01:22,748 --> 00:01:27,238
(students mumble)

29
00:01:29,816 --> 00:01:31,967
- Do we have to pick a scientist
for this one? To prove it?

30
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:32,497
- Nope.

31
00:01:33,167 --> 00:01:34,277
This is just an opinion.

32
00:01:34,277 --> 00:01:36,326
Just give me, like, a one
word bullet, would be fine.

33
00:01:39,573 --> 00:01:41,704
(alarm beeps)

34
00:01:44,328 --> 00:01:45,977
Okay. Pass the board one person.

35
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,526
And would that person please stand up?

36
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:57,294
Troy, what did you guys have?

37
00:01:57,603 --> 00:02:00,824
- There would be multiple
theories on how things worked.

38
00:02:00,824 --> 00:02:05,824
Society would be stagnant
and Newton's hypothesis...

39
00:02:06,364 --> 00:02:10,224
- Newton was actually asked
by a college of scientists

40
00:02:10,224 --> 00:02:11,823
about the thoughts of gravity and stuff,

41
00:02:11,823 --> 00:02:12,964
and he didn't think it was important.

42
00:02:12,964 --> 00:02:15,803
So when he found out, a
few months before that,

43
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:18,044
he didn't publish it, until
they asked him about it,

44
00:02:18,044 --> 00:02:21,503
and then he republished to
them, so they could hang out

45
00:02:21,503 --> 00:02:22,451
with everybody else.

46
00:02:22,451 --> 00:02:25,091
- Okay. Excellent. What do you guys have?

47
00:02:25,091 --> 00:02:28,151
- There would be no uniform
units, therefore there would

48
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:30,632
be no real way to judge one's discovery,

49
00:02:30,632 --> 00:02:34,411
and you couldn't really
bounce one idea off another.

50
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:37,072
- Okay. What'd you guys have?

51
00:02:37,072 --> 00:02:39,092
- We said that we wouldn't
have the technology

52
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,391
that we have today
because scientists tend to

53
00:02:41,391 --> 00:02:43,792
go off of what other scientists have done.

54
00:02:43,792 --> 00:02:47,042
Because I know that Celsius
went off of Newton's ideas

55
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:51,561
of how the poles were flat,
and so he went on an expedition

56
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:53,079
and found out that they were.

57
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:55,760
- Okay. Very good. Alright.

58
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,939
Two claps for all our neighbors.

59
00:02:56,939 --> 00:02:57,959
(students clap)

60
00:02:57,959 --> 00:02:58,939
Pass the board one person.

61
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,740
Okay. I like this one.

62
00:03:07,446 --> 00:03:10,627
If you could interview
any of the scientists

63
00:03:10,627 --> 00:03:11,627
that we've looked at today,

64
00:03:12,347 --> 00:03:13,256
who would it be

65
00:03:13,256 --> 00:03:15,946
and what one question,
would you be sure to ask?

66
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:19,659
Okay. Go!

67
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:52,709
(students murmur)

68
00:03:53,235 --> 00:03:55,175
(alarm beeps)

69
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:57,131
Okay. Stop right there.

70
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,507
Pass the board one person.

71
00:04:02,065 --> 00:04:04,275
Please stand up. Please stand up.

72
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:10,513
Who's going from this group?

73
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,149
- Andy.

74
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:12,699
- Super.

75
00:04:14,747 --> 00:04:18,267
Okay. Nice and loud. Let's
use active listening. John,

76
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:20,867
who would you guys pick and
what question would you ask?

77
00:04:20,867 --> 00:04:23,147
- Marie Curie.

78
00:04:23,147 --> 00:04:24,627
(student laughs)

79
00:04:24,627 --> 00:04:26,147
I said it right.

80
00:04:26,147 --> 00:04:27,547
- And what question would you ask, dear?

81
00:04:27,547 --> 00:04:31,027
- If she got any oppression
from the male scientists.

82
00:04:31,027 --> 00:04:34,047
- Okay. The oppression from
the male scientists. I like it.

83
00:04:34,047 --> 00:04:35,107
What about you guys?

84
00:04:35,107 --> 00:04:36,807
- We would ask Thomas Edison,

85
00:04:36,807 --> 00:04:39,587
"What inspired you to
create the phonograph?"

86
00:04:39,587 --> 00:04:42,247
- Excellent. Okay. Back there.
Who would you pick and what?

87
00:04:42,247 --> 00:04:43,537
- We were also going to ask Thomas Edison

88
00:04:43,537 --> 00:04:45,387
to see how other people felt

89
00:04:45,405 --> 00:04:47,115
about his invention of light bulbs.

90
00:04:47,115 --> 00:04:49,635
- Of the light bulb,
specifically. Okay. Brandon?

91
00:04:49,635 --> 00:04:52,915
- We had Albert Einstein
and our question would be,

92
00:04:52,915 --> 00:04:55,595
how did he come up with all his theories,

93
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,505
if he couldn't pass high school math?

94
00:04:57,809 --> 00:04:59,409
- Okay. What'd you guys put?

95
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:03,645
- We picked Oppenheimer and we would ask

96
00:05:05,895 --> 00:05:07,205
why he went into this?

97
00:05:08,635 --> 00:05:10,165
If he realized what he actually made?

98
00:05:11,565 --> 00:05:13,015
- You probably can't see
it, but they have written

99
00:05:13,015 --> 00:05:14,535
on the board, "The Manhattan Project."

100
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,865
Okay. Very good. And you guys?

101
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:19,733
- Oppenheimer. What his
thoughts were of the morality

102
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:20,793
of the atomic bomb.

103
00:05:20,793 --> 00:05:23,253
- Okay. This is a really great segway

104
00:05:23,253 --> 00:05:24,813
to what we're going to do next.

105
00:05:24,813 --> 00:05:26,113
Big claps for all these guys.

106
00:05:26,113 --> 00:05:27,393
(students clap)

107
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:29,973
Please move into your catwalk formation.

108
00:05:29,973 --> 00:05:30,653
Find a partner. Go!

109
00:05:30,653 --> 00:05:33,993
In ten. Without the
boards! Just yourself.

110
00:05:33,993 --> 00:05:35,473
Just your bodies!

111
00:05:35,473 --> 00:05:37,853
Nine.

112
00:05:37,853 --> 00:05:39,433
Eight.

113
00:05:39,433 --> 00:05:41,513
Seven.

114
00:05:41,513 --> 00:05:43,033
Six.

115
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:44,251
Five.

116
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:45,849
Oh, we have a partner whose hand is up.

117
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:49,579
Four. Looks like, there we go.

118
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:50,919
Three.

119
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:51,819
Two.

120
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:54,677
One. Be sure to,

121
00:05:54,677 --> 00:05:55,997
oh, we need a real quick
hands up, don't we?

122
00:05:55,997 --> 00:05:58,397
Hand ripple! Establish
who your partner is.

123
00:05:59,657 --> 00:06:00,707
(students laugh)

124
00:06:00,707 --> 00:06:02,947
Wow! That was emphatic! Okay!

125
00:06:05,673 --> 00:06:08,093
Be sure you're using active listening,

126
00:06:08,093 --> 00:06:09,313
because I will quiz you.

127
00:06:10,843 --> 00:06:12,253
Here's your question:

128
00:06:12,603 --> 00:06:17,033
"How are scientists
affected by social issues?"

129
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:21,043
Social issues going on in our culture.

130
00:06:21,223 --> 00:06:23,713
How does that affect what
scientists can and can't do,

131
00:06:23,713 --> 00:06:27,113
or what they think? The person who

132
00:06:27,113 --> 00:06:29,733
woke up the earliest
will answer this question

133
00:06:30,803 --> 00:06:32,363
and then stand back to back. Go!

134
00:06:33,539 --> 00:07:10,929
(animated conversation)

135
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:17,139
When you're done, stand back to back!

136
00:07:19,957 --> 00:07:20,887
Okay. Face me.

137
00:07:22,065 --> 00:07:24,265
Since this one is kind
of a shifting gears one,

138
00:07:24,265 --> 00:07:26,765
I want to let you
volunteer. Did anybody have

139
00:07:26,765 --> 00:07:30,995
a really good answer that
their partner gave? Yeah?

140
00:07:31,005 --> 00:07:32,741
- Interference from the church.

141
00:07:32,741 --> 00:07:34,841
- Okay. Definitely a social issue.

142
00:07:34,841 --> 00:07:37,481
- If they don't have
their research believed,

143
00:07:37,481 --> 00:07:38,801
they could not receive funding,

144
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:40,641
or just get shunned, basically.

145
00:07:40,641 --> 00:07:43,941
If it disagrees with what the
society basically believes in.

146
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:46,581
- Okay. So, you could be shunned,

147
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:48,701
you could risk your political or your

148
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:51,601
religious beliefs. Em?

149
00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:55,041
- Problems with morality,
like testing on animals.

150
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:58,101
- Okay. Did you guys want
to add something down there?

151
00:07:58,101 --> 00:07:58,801
- No.

152
00:07:58,801 --> 00:07:59,681
- No? You're good?

153
00:07:59,681 --> 00:08:01,681
- They said what we said, basically.

154
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:05,281
- Okay. This question is
for the other partner.

155
00:08:05,281 --> 00:08:06,861
"Why do you think scientists

156
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:10,161
try to understand the natural world?"

157
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,421
Think for a few seconds.

158
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:14,643
"Why do scientists try to understand

159
00:08:14,643 --> 00:08:15,573
the natural world?"

160
00:08:16,721 --> 00:08:18,191
(students murmur)

161
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:21,109
Okay. Give your answer,
then stand back to back. Go!

162
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:44,919
(animated conversation)

163
00:08:45,835 --> 00:08:46,545
Okay. Face me.

164
00:08:47,591 --> 00:08:49,781
I'm going to let you guys
volunteer on this one, too.

165
00:08:49,871 --> 00:08:51,731
Who had a partner with
a really good answer?

166
00:08:56,151 --> 00:08:56,701
Yeah?

167
00:08:57,145 --> 00:08:59,405
- It's just human nature
to question things.

168
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:01,325
- Okay. Very good. Since
we got the bigger brain

169
00:09:01,325 --> 00:09:04,325
with all the cool parts to
it. We just question. Okay.

170
00:09:04,325 --> 00:09:04,965
What'd you guys have?

171
00:09:04,965 --> 00:09:07,685
- Because they're extremely
curious on how things work

172
00:09:07,685 --> 00:09:10,805
and why certain things do what they do.

173
00:09:10,805 --> 00:09:12,845
- Okay. So we're very curious creatures.

174
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:15,425
- How to make things in
everyday life easier?

175
00:09:15,425 --> 00:09:18,935
- Ooooh! That segways to my
next question. Split apart!

176
00:09:20,945 --> 00:09:23,221
Brody, take the catwalk.
Logan, take the catwalk.

177
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:24,991
Hey, you guys were my
first ones last time, too.

178
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:27,787
Aw, such love!

179
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:29,835
- I was the first one last time.

180
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:30,355
- Were you?

181
00:09:30,365 --> 00:09:30,615
- Yeah!

182
00:09:30,615 --> 00:09:32,715
- Oh, I just remember those
two catwalking together.

183
00:09:32,975 --> 00:09:34,205
Okay. Shift us down two!

184
00:09:36,155 --> 00:09:38,895
Super. Shift down two. And
a real quick hand ripple

185
00:09:38,895 --> 00:09:40,055
to establish your partner.

186
00:09:40,055 --> 00:09:42,535
Hand. Hand. Hand. Hand. Hand. Hand. Hand.

187
00:09:42,535 --> 00:09:44,291
Hand. Hand. Hand. Hand. Hand.

188
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,031
Super! Okay.

189
00:09:47,771 --> 00:09:52,072
The person who has ordered
the most ID badges this year

190
00:09:52,072 --> 00:09:55,731
is going to answer the following question.

191
00:09:55,731 --> 00:09:57,631
Shh!!

192
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:58,851
Here's your question.

193
00:09:58,851 --> 00:10:03,071
Five. Four. Three. Two. Thank you.

194
00:10:03,071 --> 00:10:04,571
Here's your question.

195
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:09,171
"What motivation is there
to develop technology

196
00:10:09,171 --> 00:10:10,671
to meet human needs?"

197
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:15,781
What motivation do scientists
have to create technology

198
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:18,455
that meets human needs? Think about it.

199
00:10:22,565 --> 00:10:23,085
Go!

200
00:10:25,345 --> 00:10:41,345
(animated conversation)

201
00:10:43,923 --> 00:10:44,573
Okay. Split apart.

202
00:10:46,381 --> 00:10:48,651
I'm just going to randomly
popcorn on this one.

203
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:49,781
Brandon, what'd you guys say?

204
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:52,341
- We came up with, make life easier.

205
00:10:52,341 --> 00:10:54,341
- Okay. To make life easier. Alright.

206
00:10:54,341 --> 00:10:55,341
What's something you guys said?

207
00:10:55,341 --> 00:10:56,361
- Money and power.

208
00:10:56,361 --> 00:10:59,141
- Money and power. Interesting.

209
00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:00,181
What's something you guys said?

210
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:03,801
- To decrease death.
Like, medical science.

211
00:11:03,801 --> 00:11:07,001
- Okay. So, let people live longer?

212
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:09,641
Probably also live more quality lives?

213
00:11:09,641 --> 00:11:13,101
Excellent! Okay. Take the
catwalk. Take the catwalk.

214
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:19,169
Shift down two partners
once she gets down there.

215
00:11:21,859 --> 00:11:25,259
Shift down two. Super!
And a quick hands up!

216
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:28,159
Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Uh oh!

217
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,239
There we go.

218
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:31,499
Hands. Hands. Hands.
Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands.

219
00:11:31,499 --> 00:11:34,499
Now, everybody, take three steps that way.

220
00:11:34,499 --> 00:11:35,879
One.

221
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:37,239
Two.

222
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:38,779
Three.

223
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:43,679
Super! Okay. This time, the
person with the longest hair

224
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,099
is going to answer the question.

225
00:11:47,837 --> 00:11:52,837
"What evidence can you cite
from today's scientists

226
00:11:53,557 --> 00:11:57,777
that we've discussed, where
something microscopic,

227
00:11:57,777 --> 00:12:01,877
something you can't see, was
being sensed or manipulated?"

228
00:12:06,497 --> 00:12:09,722
What is an example of the
scientists we learned today,

229
00:12:09,722 --> 00:12:10,892
hold on, just one sec.

230
00:12:10,892 --> 00:12:13,872
What is an example of
something the scientists

231
00:12:13,872 --> 00:12:16,833
we learned about today,
hold on, hold on, hold on.

232
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,112
I had a request to restate the question.

233
00:12:20,293 --> 00:12:22,153
"What is an example from
the scientists we learned

234
00:12:22,153 --> 00:12:26,998
about today, using, sensing or manipulating

235
00:12:26,998 --> 00:12:30,067
something that is microscopic
or can't be seen?"

236
00:12:31,058 --> 00:12:32,368
Okay? Now go.

237
00:12:33,177 --> 00:12:35,288
(animated conversation)

238
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,797
We certainly cannot see that.

239
00:12:38,797 --> 00:12:40,256
Except on the macroscopic level,

240
00:12:40,256 --> 00:12:41,896
we can see the results of it.

241
00:12:53,676 --> 00:12:55,245
(teacher laughs)

242
00:13:03,675 --> 00:13:06,926
Brandon decided to use a
lifeline called phone a poster.

243
00:13:07,283 --> 00:13:09,483
So, Brandon, what was your answer?

244
00:13:09,483 --> 00:13:13,144
- I found on, Thomas
Edison found radio waves.

245
00:13:13,144 --> 00:13:15,563
- Okay. Very good. Face me, please.

246
00:13:15,563 --> 00:13:17,643
Emily, what's something
you guys talked about?

247
00:13:17,643 --> 00:13:20,944
- Marie Curie found radiation from atoms.

248
00:13:20,944 --> 00:13:22,570
- Okay. Very good. Erin,

249
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,664
what's something you guys talked about?

250
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:28,502
(student murmurs)

251
00:13:29,112 --> 00:13:33,338
- Okay. Very good. Take the
catwalk. Take the catwalk.

252
00:13:34,028 --> 00:13:37,618
On the catwalk. Alright.
PG! PG! PG! Thank you!

253
00:13:37,762 --> 00:13:40,112
(students laugh)

254
00:13:40,202 --> 00:13:43,442
Scooch down. And, hands up!

255
00:13:43,442 --> 00:13:46,202
Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands.

256
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:48,462
Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands.

257
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:51,742
Super! Okay. The person,

258
00:13:51,742 --> 00:13:56,742
whose last digit, in their
address, is the lowest,

259
00:13:57,502 --> 00:13:58,782
is going to answer this question.

260
00:13:58,782 --> 00:14:02,742
(students murmur)

261
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:07,452
Okay. Here is your question.

262
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,862
We talked a second ago about the fact

263
00:14:12,862 --> 00:14:15,542
that scientists are naturally curious

264
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:19,002
about our natural world,
but many scientists

265
00:14:19,002 --> 00:14:22,042
have learned to manipulate
our natural world.

266
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:26,022
"What is your opinion of
scientists manipulating,

267
00:14:26,022 --> 00:14:30,212
using for our benefit, our natural world?"

268
00:14:32,202 --> 00:14:34,232
Okay. Go.

269
00:14:35,762 --> 00:15:10,762
(animated conversation)

270
00:15:12,322 --> 00:15:16,570
Okay. Face me! Nice and
loud so everyone can hear.

271
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,590
Brian, what did your group discuss?

272
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:22,090
- We thought it all depended on humanism.

273
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,910
How they thought the humanism
in relation to all the other

274
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,970
creatures of the world, that
they feel like they're higher

275
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:32,650
than all the other creatures,
then they can do what they want

276
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:33,708
to the natural world.

277
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:36,418
- Okay. So, as long as
it's being used for good.

278
00:15:36,418 --> 00:15:37,238
- I guess.

279
00:15:37,238 --> 00:15:39,238
- Okay. With the benefit of humans or

280
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:42,478
the world in general?
Kind of a socialist view?

281
00:15:42,478 --> 00:15:43,438
- The world.

282
00:15:43,438 --> 00:15:46,718
- In general. Okay. John,
what did you guys say?

283
00:15:46,718 --> 00:15:48,178
- Yeah, what did we say?

284
00:15:48,178 --> 00:15:50,378
- Pretty much the same thing.

285
00:15:50,378 --> 00:15:51,558
- The same thing, pretty much.

286
00:15:51,558 --> 00:15:53,998
- Okay. So, are you, specifically,
looking at human needs

287
00:15:53,998 --> 00:15:55,598
or more, global?

288
00:15:55,598 --> 00:15:56,358
- Human.

289
00:15:56,358 --> 00:15:57,678
- Okay. What about you guys?

290
00:15:57,678 --> 00:15:59,178
What did you partnership talk about?

291
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,814
- That it was okay to a
point. There was a point when

292
00:16:05,814 --> 00:16:09,034
you should not manipulate
the natural world.

293
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,594
Like, taking a dolphin from one ocean

294
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:11,754
and moving it to another.

295
00:16:11,754 --> 00:16:16,134
- Okay. So, who should decide
what those points are?

296
00:16:17,374 --> 00:16:18,000
- I don't know.

297
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,780
- Okay. Alright. That segways
us to the next question.

298
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,048
"If you were..."

299
00:16:36,048 --> 00:16:38,848
Let's see, let's do this. The person

300
00:16:38,848 --> 00:16:42,328
with the most buttons on is
going to answer this question.

301
00:16:42,328 --> 00:16:46,878
(students murmur)

302
00:16:53,043 --> 00:16:57,863
Okay. "If you were the
scientific consultant

303
00:16:57,863 --> 00:17:00,864
to President Barack Obama,

304
00:17:00,864 --> 00:17:04,224
what percentage of our National Budget,

305
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:08,164
should be spent on science, and why?"

306
00:17:08,164 --> 00:17:12,313
Justify that amount. Go!

307
00:17:13,924 --> 00:17:16,224
It's a percentage. So, we're
not talking a dollar amount.

308
00:17:16,224 --> 00:17:17,694
What percentage?

309
00:17:18,963 --> 00:17:21,534
(animated conversation)

310
00:17:23,103 --> 00:17:24,524
Well, it doesn't really
matter. Do you think half

311
00:17:24,524 --> 00:17:26,563
of our budget? Do you think
a third of our budget?

312
00:17:26,563 --> 00:17:28,243
You think a quarter of our budget?

313
00:17:28,243 --> 00:17:35,274
(animated conversation)

314
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,802
I don't know. You could delineate that.

315
00:17:50,641 --> 00:17:52,700
Okay. I could tell by looking at you guys,

316
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,321
that we've got a couple of folks that feel

317
00:17:54,321 --> 00:17:55,681
kind of passionately about this,

318
00:17:55,681 --> 00:17:56,811
so spread back apart and face me.

319
00:17:58,601 --> 00:17:59,491
What did you guys say?

320
00:17:59,718 --> 00:18:03,438
- Well, I said that 15% is a good amount

321
00:18:03,438 --> 00:18:06,138
because then, it puts enough
money forward to get going

322
00:18:06,138 --> 00:18:09,358
and leaves money for
other things that we need.

323
00:18:09,358 --> 00:18:13,698
- Okay. Now you guys had a
very specific take on it.

324
00:18:13,698 --> 00:18:14,938
What did you guys talk about?

325
00:18:14,938 --> 00:18:19,938
- We talked about if medical,
if the percentage was

326
00:18:20,258 --> 00:18:22,658
accounting for medical
sciences, as well, as it should

327
00:18:22,658 --> 00:18:26,458
and, if it is, then the
percentage should be increased

328
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,458
to help.

329
00:18:28,988 --> 00:18:32,688
- Like 50 to 60%, if medical is included.

330
00:18:32,746 --> 00:18:35,286
- Okay. So, we have to
look at the different

331
00:18:35,286 --> 00:18:37,886
kinds of research. Are
we just studying stuff

332
00:18:37,886 --> 00:18:40,286
to study stuff? Are we
developing a technology

333
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,466
that will help human
need? Are we looking at

334
00:18:42,466 --> 00:18:46,286
medical? Alright. Very
good. Take the catwalk.

335
00:18:47,566 --> 00:18:48,767
Take the catwalk.

336
00:18:50,524 --> 00:18:51,614
On the catwalk.

337
00:18:52,112 --> 00:18:54,442
They do their little turns on the catwalk.

338
00:18:55,312 --> 00:18:57,022
On the catwalk.

339
00:18:58,952 --> 00:19:03,272
Okay. Of the science, of the person...

340
00:19:03,272 --> 00:19:05,292
- We haven't scooted.

341
00:19:05,292 --> 00:19:07,512
- Oh, scoot down. I'm
out of order. Thank you.

342
00:19:07,512 --> 00:19:09,252
Scoot down. I got so
excited about the questions.

343
00:19:09,252 --> 00:19:12,772
Scoot down. Scoot down. We will! Okay.

344
00:19:12,772 --> 00:19:16,052
Here we go. We're creatures
of habit sometimes.

345
00:19:16,052 --> 00:19:19,292
Hands up, real fast. Make sure
you've got the right partner.

346
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,072
Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh.

347
00:19:22,382 --> 00:19:22,942
There we go.

348
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:28,460
Okay. The person,

349
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,670
whose third, no.

350
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,140
The person whose last digit in

351
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,357
their cell phone number is the highest.
