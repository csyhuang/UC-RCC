1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,226
- Yeah. Why don't we list that up here?

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,010
[inaudible]

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:19,006
Okay. Here is what you're going to do. Go
ahead and put your pencils back inside

4
00:00:19,006 --> 00:00:30,040
that basket for me really quick. Put those
pencils away in ten, nine, eight, seven,

5
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:44,153
six, five, four, three, two, one and just
to make sure you haven't

6
00:00:44,153 --> 00:00:44,942
[inaudible].

7
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:55,900
Now, you have identified, you have taken
this work of art, you've seen what it is

8
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:03,620
and you've taken out all those elements of
art and you listed them and you told me

9
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,120
how they were being used. Now, we need to
figure out what is that artist trying to

10
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:18,550
tell you with those elements. What kind of
thought, feeling is this artist

11
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:25,675
communicating to you with these elements,
with this subject?

12
00:01:25,675 --> 00:01:30,810
So, who can raise their hand and tell us
first what is one element that you found?

13
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,890
What's one?

14
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,080
- Shapes.

15
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,818
- Shapes. What's another one?

16
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:42,000
- Color.

17
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,527
- Color.

18
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,448
- Shape lines.
- Value.

19
00:01:48,448 --> 00:02:02,190
- Value. Texture.
You guys, with those elements, they're

20
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:06,100
telling you something. So, here's what
we're going to. We're going to put on our

21
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,940
thinking, pairing, and sharing hats. So,
whatever I do that

22
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,170
[inaudible]

23
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:16,510
so you guys can pair and share together,
will you take your material with you so

24
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:22,250
that you can use them for reference? Thank
you.

25
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:33,110
All right. First question--ready? The
first question is how does this man feel?

26
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:42,620
Now, think for 30 seconds by yourself how
does this man feel? No talking. Think to

27
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:52,331
yourself. Think. Shh... You've got to
tell me why, too. Don't just think about

28
00:02:52,331 --> 00:03:08,270
feeling. Tell me why. Two people look like
they're pairing already. Don't pair yet.

29
00:03:11,934 --> 00:03:19,540
Now, tell your neighbors what you think
this man is thinking, is feeling is

30
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,544
feeling.
[cross talk]

31
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:20,730
All right. Now we're ready to share with
the whole group. So, I'm going to start

32
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:25,250
with, right here with Jermaine's group and
we're going to go around and each person

33
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,230
is going to get a turn, or each pair is
going to get a turn. So, first, what was

34
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,950
your group thinking? How did he feel?

35
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:31,580
- Sad.
- Why?

36
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:40,394
- Because the color blue is a sad color.
And he looked down

37
00:04:40,394 --> 00:04:40,882
[inaudible].

38
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,060
- So he had two reasons-- he had the body
position, because he's kind of looking

39
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,540
down like this and he also he had a
connection with what you learned in

40
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:56,390
kindergarten, good job, he said that sad
and the color blue go together. What do

41
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,057
you guys think? How does he feel?

42
00:04:58,057 --> 00:05:03,910
- I think he feels happy. He's smiling and
he's playing the guitar.

43
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:09,430
- Okay, because he's creating music. Maybe
that's what makes him happy. I heard Miss

44
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,370
Webster had a disagreement when they were
pairing. Miss Webster, what is your take?

45
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:18,420
What do you think he's feeling? Tell me
what you think he is? Sit up, tell me what

46
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,200
you think he is.

47
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,120
- I think he's sad because...

48
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,590
- Okay. Because why?

49
00:05:27,564 --> 00:05:28,400
[Inaudible]

50
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:32,890
- He looks what? Say it again, honey.
Don't be embarrassed. It's okay to have a

51
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,530
different opinion.

52
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:40,880
- I think he is lonely because he doesn't
have any friends.

53
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,790
- There's nobody else in that picture. He
is by himself in the picture. Maybe he's

54
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:51,047
lonely. We don't know. Okay. So, we had a
difference of opinion. That's okay.

55
00:05:51,047 --> 00:05:51,698
Next pair.

56
00:05:51,698 --> 00:05:58,222
- I think he's sad because he's looking
down. If he was happy he'd be

57
00:05:58,222 --> 00:05:59,221
[inaudible].

58
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:09,030
- Whoa. Wait a minute. She just said this
man doesn't have anything to eat. Why do

59
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,160
you think he doesn't have any?

60
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:23,300
- Because his shirt is torn, he don't have
no pants and he don't have no socks.

61
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:29,440
- So, you're telling me he looks what? Is
he rich or is he poor?

62
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,380
- No. He's poor.

63
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:39,420
- Okay. That is very good insight on not
only the details, but also just what those

64
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:49,260
details are telling us, okay? Do you have
something else to add? What would you say?

65
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:59,600
- I said I think he was happy to sit
alone. I think he's happy because he just

66
00:06:59,600 --> 00:06:59,990
[inaudible]

67
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:07,630
- Okay. So, you think the guitar
looks-- even though his clothing looks

68
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:12,190
torn, his guitar looks nice, right? Maybe
he just puts a lot of value on keeping it

69
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:18,950
nice. Maybe he puts a lot of value on
keeping his guitar nice rather than his

70
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:25,000
clothes. Maybe not. Last pair, tell me
what you think he's feeling.

71
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,320
- I think he's--

72
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,650
- One at a time.

73
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,530
- I think he's
[inaudible].

74
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:47,730
...It looks like he's playing a sad
song. He's playing a sad song and he's

75
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:48,540
playing--

76
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,900
- Why do you think it looks like he's
playing a sad song?

77
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:01,920
- Because he's bowing his head down and
his face don't look very happy.

78
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:09,671
- Okay. You guys, next question-- I can see
everyone sitting nice and tall in your

79
00:08:09,671 --> 00:08:15,336
seat. Did you have something different
than that? Okay. Go ahead.

80
00:08:15,336 --> 00:08:20,654
- I think he's sad because he looks like
he's homeless.

81
00:08:20,654 --> 00:08:26,157
- Oh, maybe he's homeless. Now, why do you
think he's homeless?

82
00:08:26,157 --> 00:08:29,593
- Because his shirt's torn on the side.

83
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:34,240
- Are there any other clues besides his
clothing? We already had Miss Marshall

84
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,880
tell us about his clothing. What other
clues do we have that makes us think he's

85
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:38,730
homeless?

86
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,240
- [Inaudible]

87
00:08:49,888 --> 00:08:54,480
- ...without talking and making noise.
Jermaine, do you have a clue why he might

88
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,550
be homeless? Why?

89
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,580
- Because he's outside by his self.

90
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,170
- He looks like me might be outside. This
might be a step that he's sitting on. Next

91
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:17,310
question... Next question--what do you
think the artist is trying to tell us?

92
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:26,020
What is the important message-- put your
hands down. Think. What is the message?

93
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:32,150
Why is the artist painting this picture of
this man? I have one person, she's got

94
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:47,970
herself in the thinking posture. She's
thinking. Think please. Think, think,

95
00:09:48,150 --> 00:10:00,690
think. I've got a good thinker at this
table.

96
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:10,400
I hope you're thinking, honey. Okay. Now,
pair up. Ready? Pair and share with your

97
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,810
table mate. Get paired up.

98
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,829
[cross-talk]

99
00:10:48,058 --> 00:10:53,887
Thirty more seconds to share. I hear some
good talking so I'm giving you 30 more

100
00:10:53,887 --> 00:11:11,280
seconds. Why don't you share this time
because you shared last time? Okay. So,

101
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:30,590
you're going to share this time. Let's see
you sitting up nice and tall. We're going

102
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:35,430
to share with the entire group. We all
learn from each other. You guys, we're

103
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:43,360
going to start with the opposite way. I'm
going to go this way. Can you tell me what

104
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:52,810
the artist is trying to tell us, by
painting this picture-- I'm sorry, just a

105
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,640
second. Could you wait until your
classmates are showing you the respect you

106
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,932
deserve? You guys, when you're listening
to what he's saying, he's trying to tell

107
00:12:00,932 --> 00:12:03,417
you what he thinks, what his table mate
thinks.

108
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:06,930
So, you need to turn your body, make eye
contact and really listen to what he's

109
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,660
saying, okay? Okay. Go again.

110
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:19,860
- I think the artist did this picture
because he wanted kids to know how alone

111
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:35,922
he is and how he's homeless. He doesn't
have any money. He doesn't have any value.

112
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:39,590
- Okay. When you mean value, do you mean
value like art value or what kind of value

113
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:40,751
do you mean?

114
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:43,680
- Like he seems very sad.

115
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:50,339
- Okay. So, you're talking about the
color, right? Okay. Next group.

116
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:56,377
- I think that the artist is trying to
persuade him--

117
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,603
- Wait a minute. Say that word again. He's
trying to what?

118
00:13:00,603 --> 00:13:01,694
- Persuade.

119
00:13:01,694 --> 00:13:06,361
- Persuade us what? Persuade us to think
what?

120
00:13:06,361 --> 00:13:10,400
- Persuade us
[inaudible]

121
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:48,430
He feels real mad or trying to do music or
something.

122
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:54,419
- Okay. Is that what your team came up
with? You came up with something different

123
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:59,000
than your team. You had a disagreement,
right?

124
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:05,311
- I think that I was not
[inaudible].

125
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:14,280
- Do you think the artist wants you to be
like him?

126
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,090
- No.

127
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,850
- What do you think the artist wants you
to learn from him?

128
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:29,502
- He won't have nothing to work...
[Inaudible].

129
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:44,236
- You can have a better life, right? Okay.
This group-- could you put your feet down?

130
00:14:44,747 --> 00:14:49,411
It's your turn. You're going to share with
us what your team came up with? You can

131
00:14:49,411 --> 00:14:57,890
share. Come on. You can talk to us.
Remember that there's no wrong answer.

132
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,000
It's just what you think.
