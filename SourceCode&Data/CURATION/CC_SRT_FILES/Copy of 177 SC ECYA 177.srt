00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,140

think about that, because that was

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:13,090
something that came up yesterday.
Sometimes we think, "Oh that's only stuff

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:19,440
men do," or, "That's only stuff women
do." But, especially mechanics working on

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,890
engines and stuff like that, we think,
"That's a man's job." But you said your

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,430
dad works with a lot of women, and Kyle,
your dad's a kind of a mechanic, too, and

8
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:33,140
he works with a lot of women, too. So
girls, think about that kind of thing.

00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:39,574
Okay, thank you, very good. All right, now

have Lexi, Lexi Wilson. All right, Lexi.

32
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,530
All right, tell us about your job.

33

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,408
Oh, I wasn't watching you.

38
00:03:47,408 --> 00:03:52,000

40
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:29,513

41
00:04:29,513 --> 00:04:38,180

hard question. Science, the person with

42
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:44,585
that job indicated they use science in a
furniture showroom management position.

43
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:46,953
How do you think they use science?

44
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,121
- Maybe they make the furniture.

45
00:04:50,121 --> 00:04:57,080
- [teacher] The materials maybe they use,
and stuff like that. Good, good job, all

46
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,100
right, thank you. Okay, so we can see that
all of the skills that we're learning in

47
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:12,640
school right now, especially technology
skills, computer skills, reading, math,

48
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:18,350
even science, our parents are using those
jobs, uh, skills in their jobs right now in real

49
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:24,890
life. So someday, you're gonna be using
exactly what you're doing right now in a

50
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:32,460
job, as well as our personal skills, our
seven habit skills, being in charge of

51
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,100
ourselves, thinking about things ahead of
time, planning ahead, putting first things

52
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,190
first, good job.

53
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:46,590
All right, now we're gonna
take our group cards, and on the cards you

54
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:50,890
have a job listed, one of the jobs that
you're looking at in your group, and a

55
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:56,340
skill that goes along with that job. What
I want you to do is, as a group discuss,

56
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:05,830
how can we show the use of that skill in
our job that we have, okay? So look at

57
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:12,470
your cards, figure out how you're gonna
use the skill listed on the skill card,

58
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:22,490
and then we're gonna role-model to the
rest of the class the use of our skill and

59
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:29,150
show how we use that skill in the job
that's on that card, okay? So start

60
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,900
discussing, and then in a few minutes, I'm
gonna call you back and we're gonna start

61
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,192
showing the rest of the class our skills.

62
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:50,030
- We're the paralegal. We could
do, well for reading skills, we could do

63
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:56,510
filing or we could prepare bills for
clients. But to prepare bills for clients,

64
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:01,150
we'd have to read you know, who they are,
and then for filing we'd have to read

65
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:01,430
whose bill it was.

66
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,570
- [intercom] Class, when your children get
ready for heading where they go down to

67
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,850
gym for the program this morning, we are
right now in the process of calling

68
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:11,420
kindergarten, we're gonna get them to head
down the hallway to the gym first, and

69
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:19,970
then we're going to have second grade come
on down, third grade, fourth grade and

70
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:20,250
fifth grade [inaudible].

71
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:25,530
- Okay, so Payton is gonna lay on
the floor, and then I'm gonna get to do a

72
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:30,710
knee surgery on him. First I'll like get a
pencil, pretend I'm cutting the knee open

73
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:37,630
and pulling it, and then cutting the
muscle, and replacing the broken parts of

74
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,090
the knee bone with--

75
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:45,000
- Like using our skills, we can
measure the wire right here.

76
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,830
- And we could measure how long
it could be for the house electricity

77
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:56,980
circuits, and we can measure how long the
wire is, and somebody could be in the

78
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,700
house and we could measure how long the
wire is.

79
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:11,460
- So, let's do the thing we did
yesterday. When you're laying on the floor

80
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:16,931
and I'm trying to put the breath back in
you, and then I ask Carly what happened,

81
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:28,674
okay. 
- So you two are doing it. Do you
think maybe a table and chairs, and maybe

82
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:38,055
a couch, 
- Yeah, a sofa.
- and then you'll get over behind
the table and everything, and then I can

83
00:08:38,055 --> 00:08:41,270
say what day and what time.

84
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:48,935
- [teacher] And that's writing down what?
Writing skills. 
- Writing skills.
- Very good, very good.

85
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,210
- We're gonna show like you, you
would be like typing on the computer and

86
00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:00,358
you would be, and I would come up and ask
what you're doing, and so the other people

87
00:09:00,358 --> 00:09:07,494
would know what you're doing on the
computer, I would come up and ask what

88
00:09:07,494 --> 00:09:10,086
you're doing and you would say, "I'm
making a blueprint."

89
00:09:13,035 --> 00:09:20,075
- Like, 'cause if we did use set
up machines for production, and we use

90
00:09:20,075 --> 00:09:25,791
synergize, we'd have to work together to
do it, and how do we do that? Miss

91
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,359
Kimberly?
- [teacher] Yes ma'am.

92
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:32,094
- How do we act out setting up
for productions, setting up machines?

93
00:09:32,094 --> 00:09:36,319
- [teacher] Well, since you're act, you
want to show synergizing, now what does

94
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:38,398
synergizing mean?
- Working together.

95
00:09:38,398 --> 00:09:41,086
- [teacher] Okay, so you need to
involve... ?

96
00:09:41,086 --> 00:09:42,910
- Working together.

97
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:49,051
- [teacher] Yeah, okay. And
certainly with being a mechanic, you're

98
00:09:49,051 --> 00:09:52,283
working on, what?
- [together] Machines.

99
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:57,083
- [teacher] Machines, and so what you
wanna try to demonstrate, is everybody

100
00:09:57,083 --> 00:10:00,187
working together.
- To build a machine?

101
00:10:00,187 --> 00:10:03,803
- [teacher] Possibly, that would be a good
one, I think.

102
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,493
All right, we're going to go
ahead and start our demonstrations. So I'm

103
00:10:25,493 --> 00:10:35,637
gonna ask Morgan, Landon and Abby's group
