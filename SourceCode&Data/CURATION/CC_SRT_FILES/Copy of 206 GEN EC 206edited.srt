1
00:00:00,198 --> 00:00:03,068
- Who's gonna do the skyscraper?

2
00:00:03,068 --> 00:00:06,798
- So we got to put size, color, and shape.

3
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:09,270
- Size, color, and shape.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,588
- Ok, I'm gonna do a skyscraper

5
00:00:13,588 --> 00:00:15,718
- Beau, is that for the
past or the present?

6
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:17,758
- That's for the present.

7
00:00:17,758 --> 00:00:18,789
- Skyscraper?

8
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:20,277
- [All boys] Present, the present.

9
00:00:20,277 --> 00:00:22,189
- [Teacher] The present, ok.

10
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,318
- [Brown sweatshirt] And
the pyramid is for the past.

11
00:00:24,318 --> 00:00:25,078
- [Beau] Yeah

12
00:00:25,078 --> 00:00:26,437
- [Teacher] And you'll do
a pyramid for the past?

13
00:00:26,437 --> 00:00:28,438
- [White Shirt] I was
gonna do a log cabin.

14
00:00:28,438 --> 00:00:29,437
- That's what I was gonna do.

15
00:00:29,437 --> 00:00:30,597
- [Glasses] But we have
to use different things

16
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:31,878
because we don't got no logs.

17
00:00:31,878 --> 00:00:33,677
- [Brown Sweatshirt] Well,
actually, they still make

18
00:00:33,677 --> 00:00:34,477
log cabins now.

19
00:00:34,477 --> 00:00:35,109
- [White Shirt] We can
use brown for the logs.

20
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:37,757
- [Teacher] Jonathon says they
still make log cabins now.

21
00:00:37,757 --> 00:00:38,717
- [Jonathon] They do.

22
00:00:38,717 --> 00:00:39,949
- [Glasses] Yeah, they do.

23
00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:41,917
- [Teacher] We don't really
make pyramids any more, do we?

24
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:42,877
- [Boys] No.

25
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:45,637
- [Jonathon] Yeah, but they
could be hidden in Egypt.

26
00:00:45,637 --> 00:00:47,477
- [Beau] Yeah, but there is four lines.

27
00:00:47,477 --> 00:00:49,309
What we gonna do with the other two?

28
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:52,078
- [Teacher] What I want you
to do is list three details.

29
00:00:52,078 --> 00:00:54,478
- [Glasses] Color, size, and shape.

30
00:00:54,478 --> 00:00:56,658
- [Teacher] So, what shape will
your skyscraper probably be?

31
00:00:56,658 --> 00:00:59,007
(chattering excitedly)

32
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:00,977
- [Glasses] A rectangle!

33
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:01,982
A rectangular prism.

34
00:01:01,982 --> 00:01:03,988
- [Teacher] A rectangular prism?

35
00:01:07,388 --> 00:01:08,917
That's what Dillon said.

36
00:01:08,917 --> 00:01:09,757
- [Beau] Rectangle

37
00:01:09,757 --> 00:01:10,538
- [Dillon] Rectangular Prism

38
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:13,158
- [Teacher] Okay.

39
00:01:13,158 --> 00:01:17,708
- Then you can talk about your pyramids.

40
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:20,688
Ask them, they're your team.

41
00:01:20,688 --> 00:01:22,552
- [Jonathan] A square pyramid.

42
00:01:22,552 --> 00:01:23,735
- [Dillon] Triangle

43
00:01:23,735 --> 00:01:25,070
- [Teacher] Oh, he said a square pyramid.

44
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,232
- [Jonathon] Yeah, let's do it.

45
00:01:26,232 --> 00:01:27,067
- [Dillon] A triangle.

46
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:28,147
- [Teacher] You think it
should be a triangular pyramid?

47
00:01:28,147 --> 00:01:29,435
- [Beau] Yeah, I'm with Dillon.

48
00:01:29,435 --> 00:01:30,631
- [Teacher] Well talk about it.

49
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:31,571
Which one do you want to do?

50
00:01:31,571 --> 00:01:33,789
- [Jonathon] I thought square pyramid

51
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:35,588
was more like a real pyramid.

52
00:01:35,588 --> 00:01:38,165
You know, because it has four sides?

53
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:39,825
- [Teacher] It does have four.

54
00:01:39,825 --> 00:01:41,626
- [Jonathon] A pyramid
only has four sides.

55
00:01:41,626 --> 00:01:44,829
- [Dillon] Well a triangle has four, too.

56
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:45,991
- [Teacher] It does?

57
00:01:45,991 --> 00:01:47,127
- [Dillon] One, two, three, four.

58
00:01:47,127 --> 00:01:48,265
- [Teacher] That's a square, honey,

59
00:01:48,265 --> 00:01:53,543
because it has four.

60
00:01:53,543 --> 00:01:56,948
Well, if it has three sides,
how many sides does it have?

61
00:01:56,948 --> 00:01:58,078
- [Dillon] Three.

62
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,609
- [Teacher] Three.

63
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:03,508
So, you have to decide.

64
00:02:03,508 --> 00:02:07,554
- [Dillon] So, we could take a
square and make it like a ...

65
00:02:07,554 --> 00:02:09,156
- [Teacher] Dillon agrees
a square pyramid,too.

66
00:02:09,156 --> 00:02:11,302
I love having y'all together.

67
00:02:11,302 --> 00:02:12,242
- [Jonathon] Let's do square pyramid

68
00:02:12,242 --> 00:02:13,997
and rectangular prism.

69
00:02:13,997 --> 00:02:18,607
- [Teacher] Good deciding.

70
00:02:18,607 --> 00:02:20,997
- Alright.

71
00:02:20,997 --> 00:02:22,823
- What are you guys discussing, right now?

72
00:02:22,823 --> 00:02:29,472
- We're discussing what all we wanna do.

73
00:02:29,472 --> 00:02:30,996
- I like that. Okay.

74
00:02:30,996 --> 00:02:33,978
- [Grey Sweatshirt] We're not
sure what play we're doing?

75
00:02:33,978 --> 00:02:36,115
- [Teacher] You're not sure
what play you wanna do?

76
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:36,998
- [Navy Sweatshirt] Because everybody

77
00:02:36,998 --> 00:02:38,693
keeps picking everything.

78
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:40,213
- [Teacher] So, how are
we gonna figure it out?

79
00:02:40,213 --> 00:02:41,617
- [Navy Sweatshirt]
But I agree with Randy.

80
00:02:41,617 --> 00:02:43,371
- [Teacher] So, what do you guys agree on?

81
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,751
- [Randy] I agree with my plans.

82
00:02:44,751 --> 00:02:46,597
- [Black Shirt] He wants
like an old time car,

83
00:02:46,597 --> 00:02:48,073
and I don't agree with that.

84
00:02:48,073 --> 00:02:50,359
- [Red Sweatshirt] But,
we don't understand

85
00:02:50,359 --> 00:02:51,833
how you do an old time car.

86
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,817
- [Teacher] How do you do a play, or skit,

87
00:02:53,817 --> 00:02:54,934
about an old car?

88
00:02:54,934 --> 00:02:56,296
That's what you need to tell them.

89
00:02:56,296 --> 00:02:57,489
- The only time --

90
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:02,396
(all speaking at once)

91
00:03:02,396 --> 00:03:03,576
- [Teacher] Okay.

92
00:03:03,576 --> 00:03:05,885
- [Navy Sweatshirt] Aaron said
something about the classroom

93
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,706
and that I was going to be the teacher.

94
00:03:07,706 --> 00:03:09,042
Or something like that.

95
00:03:09,042 --> 00:03:10,377
- [Grey Sweatshirt] I
wanna be assistant teacher.

96
00:03:10,377 --> 00:03:11,619
- [Teacher] Randy likes that.

97
00:03:11,619 --> 00:03:12,780
- [Red Sweatshirt] And this
is two people from the past

98
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,670
and two people from the present.

99
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,295
- [Teacher] Hear what Jacob said.

100
00:03:17,295 --> 00:03:19,211
- [Jacob] Jacob wants
to be assistant teacher.

101
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:23,936
- [Black Shirt] You're the
teacher, assistant teacher.

102
00:03:23,936 --> 00:03:25,991
- [Teacher] So when will that
be in the past or the present?

103
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:27,094
- [Jacob] Present!

104
00:03:27,094 --> 00:03:28,986
- [Red Sweatshirt] Haley could
be a teacher from the present

105
00:03:28,986 --> 00:03:31,435
and then me and Randy can be from the past

106
00:03:31,435 --> 00:03:33,131
and then they can be from the present too.

107
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:35,696
And then we'll come to where they are,

108
00:03:35,696 --> 00:03:38,506
then they'll have to show us what changed.

109
00:03:38,506 --> 00:03:39,887
- [Teacher] Did y'all hear Aaron's idea?

110
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,605
You can say that to them.

111
00:03:41,605 --> 00:03:42,871
- [Jacob] I like Aaron's idea.

112
00:03:42,871 --> 00:03:44,345
- [Teacher] Listen to
what Aaron just said guys.

113
00:03:44,345 --> 00:03:46,132
He has an idea that you may want to do.

114
00:03:46,132 --> 00:03:50,126
- [Aaron] Ian and Jacob and
Haley are from the present.

115
00:03:50,126 --> 00:03:52,390
And me and Randy are from
the past and we come.

116
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:56,231
And, they show us all the
stuff that has changed.

117
00:03:56,231 --> 00:03:58,076
- [Jacob] I agree with Aaron.

118
00:03:58,076 --> 00:03:59,156
I agree with Aaron.

119
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,271
- [Haley] I agree with Aaron.

120
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:03,316
- [Randy] Or we could do,
like, you two are teachers

121
00:04:03,316 --> 00:04:08,690
and like me and Aaron and
Ian are like students.

122
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,849
And then, them two teach us.

123
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:11,870
- [Teacher] Oh, that's an idea.

124
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,229
You could do...

125
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:15,214
- [Aaron] But then how do we do the past?

126
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:16,793
- [Teacher] Well, but
you could do the past

127
00:04:16,793 --> 00:04:19,114
and then, how, could you do

128
00:04:19,114 --> 00:04:22,133
a skit about the past, and
a skit about the present?

129
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:23,109
- [Kids] Yeah.

130
00:04:23,109 --> 00:04:24,292
- [Teacher] They would be the same

131
00:04:24,292 --> 00:04:26,149
except one is the past
and one is the present.

132
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:27,937
- [Randy] To where like, no one had desks

133
00:04:27,937 --> 00:04:30,375
and then in the present we have desks.

134
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,395
- [Teacher] Oh. What do you think, Ian?

135
00:04:32,395 --> 00:04:33,927
- [Ian] I wanted to do

136
00:04:33,927 --> 00:04:37,910
people from the past and future

137
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:38,827
they all meet together

138
00:04:38,827 --> 00:04:41,369
and do things from the
past and the future.

139
00:04:41,369 --> 00:04:43,574
- [Teacher] Well are we doing
the future or the present?

140
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:46,477
- [Kids] Present

141
00:04:46,477 --> 00:04:49,495
- [Ian] Well then people
from present and past

142
00:04:49,495 --> 00:04:55,613
and they do things from
the past and the present.

143
00:04:55,613 --> 00:04:57,112
- Okay. Well, decide.

144
00:04:57,112 --> 00:04:59,446
It sounds like you got
some really good ideas.

145
00:04:59,446 --> 00:05:00,769
- [Ian] Why can't we just do one

146
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:03,323
if they are doing stuff from
the past and the present?

147
00:05:03,323 --> 00:05:05,970
And you choose your own people
who live in the present.

148
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:11,832
- [Teacher] Well, Ian, if
your working in a group

149
00:05:11,832 --> 00:05:13,504
should everybody do their own thing

150
00:05:13,504 --> 00:05:16,290
or should we work and kind of
come up with the same idea?

151
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,310
- [Ian] Yeah, you choose your own people

152
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,376
but you do it in the present.

153
00:05:21,376 --> 00:05:24,696
- Sounds like y'all have to just keep on.

154
00:05:24,696 --> 00:05:28,670
You may just have to make a decision. Ok?

155
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,965
You may just have to make a decision.

156
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:36,888
Sounds like you are doing great, guys.

157
00:05:36,888 --> 00:05:40,325
- [Blue Polo] How do you
spell transfer trucks?

158
00:05:40,325 --> 00:05:41,215
- [Teacher] Huh?

159
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,975
- [Blue Polo] How do you

- [Teacher] F.

184
00:06:28,026 --> 00:06:29,850
How do you make "er' at the end of a word?

185
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,169
- [Grey Shirt] E.R.

186
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:32,477
- You got it.

187
00:06:32,477 --> 00:06:35,907
There you go, and you know trucks.

188
00:06:35,907 --> 00:06:38,626
So, what are y'all doing
with transfer trucks?

189
00:06:38,626 --> 00:06:40,638
- [Grey Shirt] I don't know.

190
00:06:40,638 --> 00:06:42,774
He's the one who wanted to write it.

00:06:49,921 --> 00:06:51,614
- [Teacher] Ok, but what...

195
00:06:51,614 --> 00:06:53,912
But why did y'all, um

196
00:06:53,912 --> 00:06:57,108
You're describing what
each persons' job will be.

197
00:06:57,108 --> 00:07:00,311
And I have that, "Noah
and Ta'jarius and Madison

198
00:07:00,311 --> 00:07:01,831
are gonna" do what?

199
00:07:01,831 --> 00:07:03,145
- [Blue Polo] The waves.

200
00:07:03,145 --> 00:07:08,638
- [Teacher] What kind of waves?

201
00:07:08,638 --> 00:07:12,347
What are y'all showing from
the past and the present?

202
00:07:12,347 --> 00:07:15,054
- [Blue Polo] I wanna
do waves in the present.

203
00:07:15,054 --> 00:07:17,791
- [Teacher] Do waves change
from the past to the present?

204
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,136
Do you mean like ocean waves?

205
00:07:20,136 --> 00:07:24,316
Have those changed over time?

206
00:07:24,316 --> 00:07:28,332
- [Blue Polo] I'm doing transfer trucks.

207
00:07:28,332 --> 00:07:30,398
- [Teacher] What's it suppose to be?

208
00:07:30,398 --> 00:07:31,478
- [Grey Shirt] A.

209
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:33,313
- [White Polo] I'm doing transfer trucks.

210
00:07:33,313 --> 00:07:35,008
- [Teacher] How have
those changed over time?

211
00:07:35,008 --> 00:07:37,527
- [White Polo] Horses
carried them, with like,

212
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:41,810
umbrella's over them.

213
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:42,588
- [Teacher] Very cool.

214
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:45,270
And we saw that kind of wagon
on the smart board earlier.

215
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,930
And you said that was like a truck.

216
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,532
- [Grey Shirt] You could
pull that up, back up there.

217
00:07:48,532 --> 00:07:49,751
- [Teacher] I could pull it back up.

218
00:07:49,751 --> 00:07:51,214
Do you wanna see that again?

219
00:07:51,214 --> 00:07:54,232
Cash, do you wanna do the illustrations

220
00:07:54,232 --> 00:07:57,529
for the trucks over time?

221
00:07:57,529 --> 00:07:59,073
Shannon, what are you doing?

222
00:07:59,073 --> 00:08:00,350
What are your illustrations gonna be,

223
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,531
showing change over time?

224
00:08:03,531 --> 00:08:06,108
- [Ta'jarius] She might
do cars or something.

225
00:08:06,108 --> 00:08:08,372
- [Blue Polo] Do you wanna do cars?

226
00:08:08,372 --> 00:08:09,730
- [Teacher] You don't have to do cars.

227
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,949
- [Blue Polo] You don't want to?

228
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,744
- [Teacher] Lots of things
have changed over time.

229
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:16,514
(all speaking at once)

230
00:08:16,514 --> 00:08:20,790
- [Cash] You can actually
buy food and not hunt it.

231
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:25,540
- [Blue Polo] How do you spell Shannon?

232
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,035
- That's one of the things you could draw

233
00:08:27,035 --> 00:08:32,294
the change from the, maybe
you'll do washing machines?

234
00:08:32,294 --> 00:08:34,684
- [Cash] Yeah. Yeah, that works.

235
00:08:34,684 --> 00:08:37,494
- [Blue Polo] Yeah. Cars change.

236
00:08:37,494 --> 00:08:39,597
- Do you wanna do transfer trucks?

237
00:08:39,597 --> 00:08:42,219
- [Shannon] No. You're already doing them.

238
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:43,899
- [Teacher] Guys!

239
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:46,567
- Do you wanna do washing
machines, Madison?

240
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,948
Draw a washing machine next to that?

241
00:08:48,948 --> 00:08:53,479
- [Blue Polo] You wanna
do washing machines?

242
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:55,520
- [Teacher] Can you hold
that up so they can see it?

243
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,959
because Shannon can't see it.

244
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,667
- Where did ya wash your clothes at?

245
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:15,384
- Turn it over like this, and
you'd rub them against here.

246
00:09:15,384 --> 00:09:16,713
- Different, isn't it?

247
00:09:16,713 --> 00:09:17,456
- Yeah.

248
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:20,717
- When I was little, my
great- great- great- great-

249
00:09:20,717 --> 00:09:25,906
great- great- great- grandma, grandfather

250
00:09:25,906 --> 00:09:29,665
he had a washing board
he took a picture of

251
00:09:29,665 --> 00:09:34,707
and then when I was big
I was allowed to see it.

252
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:37,090
- Very cool. There was a picture.

253
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,226
Alright. It sounds like
you've got some work to do guys.

254
00:09:39,226 --> 00:09:41,608
I love the idea of
showing the illustrations

255
00:09:41,608 --> 00:09:44,677
of the trucks over time
and the cars over time.

256
00:09:44,677 --> 00:09:46,981
I think we need to think
about waves, though,

257
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:49,208
because waves are a natural thing.

258
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:53,178
People don't really build
and change those, do we?

259
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:55,735
No, so we need to think about something

260
00:09:55,735 --> 00:09:57,893
that has changed over time.

261
00:09:57,893 --> 00:09:59,298
And don't forget our books--

262
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,364
- [Ta'jarius] Buildings! Buildings!

263
00:10:00,364 --> 00:10:03,800
- Buildings have definitely
changed over time.

264
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,645
Alright guys.

265
00:10:05,645 --> 00:10:08,316
Keep it up you are doing great.

266
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:12,077
Alright, let's see what
you guys are up to.

267
00:10:12,077 --> 00:10:14,097
Okay, what's going on over here?

268
00:10:14,097 --> 00:10:16,941
- [Black Sweatshirt] Well,
we're thinking about--

269
00:10:16,941 --> 00:10:20,131
- [Pink Shirt] About Cassa
coloring, Ann coloring,

270
00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:22,694
and me coloring and
drawing, and her drawing.

271
00:10:22,694 --> 00:10:23,625
- [White Shirt] I love drawing.

272
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:24,960
- [Teacher] You love drawing.

273
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,411
- [White Shirt] That's what I
love. I love typing at home.

274
00:10:27,411 --> 00:10:28,411
I love all of it.

275
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:29,927
- [Teacher] Very cool.

276
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:33,306
Alright, so what kind of
things are you gonna show

277
00:10:33,306 --> 00:10:36,487
how are you gonna show past
to present with your clothing?

278
00:10:36,487 --> 00:10:40,086
- We're gonna show the style, the color...

279
00:10:40,086 --> 00:10:43,046
- [Teacher] Okay, can you tell
me what you're gonna draw?

280
00:10:43,046 --> 00:10:45,382
- [Black Sweatshirt]
We're gonna draw dresses.

281
00:10:45,382 --> 00:10:46,682
- [Teacher] Oh, dresses.

282
00:10:46,682 --> 00:10:49,758
- [Black Sweatshirt] And shoes.
Like, dresses and the shoes

283
00:10:49,758 --> 00:10:52,765
that they would wear.

284
00:10:52,765 --> 00:10:56,274
- [White Shirt] I can get my old dress,

285
00:10:56,274 --> 00:10:58,571
My mom's old dress she's got,

286
00:10:58,571 --> 00:11:01,914
I have it, and I can design it.

287
00:11:01,914 --> 00:11:02,936
- You can?

288
00:11:02,936 --> 00:11:04,353
- [White Shirt] Uh-huh.

289
00:11:04,353 --> 00:11:07,290
(inaudible)

290
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,066
- So are you all four
going to show dresses

291
00:11:09,066 --> 00:11:10,574
from the past and present?

292
00:11:10,574 --> 00:11:11,193
- Yes.

293
00:11:11,193 --> 00:11:12,779
- Or are some of you gonna do past

294
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:14,205
and some of you do present?

295
00:11:14,205 --> 00:11:15,347
- We're gonna do it all together.

296
00:11:15,347 --> 00:11:16,495
- I love that.

297
00:11:16,495 --> 00:11:17,970
- Them two are coloring, I'm coloring,

298
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,095
and me and her are drawing.

299
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,223
- Very nice.

300
00:11:20,223 --> 00:11:21,480
- You're drawing?

301
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,041
- Yes, we're drawing, I'm coloring.

302
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:24,972
- Very, very nice.

303
00:11:24,972 --> 00:11:27,200
Well, it looks like you guys
are ready for your next page.

304
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,156
Let me ask you this, how has
clothing changed over time?

305
00:11:33,156 --> 00:11:35,676
- The color has definitely changed.

306
00:11:35,676 --> 00:11:36,966
- The colors have changed?

307
00:11:36,966 --> 00:11:38,754
- And the shoes.

308
00:11:38,754 --> 00:11:40,031
- [Glasses] Ladies used
to wear long dresses

309
00:11:40,031 --> 00:11:43,387
and now they wear not
that long of dresses.

310
00:11:43,387 --> 00:11:47,171
- Oh, so they used to wear
really long dresses and now...

311
00:11:47,171 --> 00:11:51,552
- [Pink Shirt] They have short
dresses that come up to here.

312
00:11:51,552 --> 00:11:54,300
- [Black Sweatshirt] Yeah, and
shoes they wear lace-up boots

313
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,857
- [Teacher] Laced-up boots

314
00:11:55,857 --> 00:11:59,422
- I think my mama has them,
I won't be able to wear them,

315
00:11:59,422 --> 00:12:00,862
but I might be able to bring them.

316
00:12:00,862 --> 00:12:03,369
- Oh, that'd be cool if you bring those.

317
00:12:03,369 --> 00:12:05,250
It sounds like you have great ideas.

318
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:09,386
- And they wore hats back then.

319
00:12:09,386 --> 00:12:16,195
(inaudible)

320
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:24,334
- 'cause I'm thinking about my mom's dress...

321
00:12:24,334 --> 00:12:27,024
I mean, I can design it.

322
00:12:27,024 --> 00:12:29,949
- I am very, very pleased with
how much you've accomplished

323
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:32,398
together in your group, let
me get you the next sheet.

324
00:12:32,398 --> 00:12:35,954
- [In Unison] Okay.

325
00:12:35,954 --> 00:12:37,033
- [Pink Shirt] We all have our things done

326
00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:38,436
and we're going to get it.

327
00:12:38,436 --> 00:12:40,556
- And we all have each
others' phone numbers.

328
00:12:40,556 --> 00:12:42,315
- Here's the next sheet.

329
00:12:42,315 --> 00:12:43,824
Let's look for a second.

330
00:12:43,824 --> 00:12:45,554
"Who will design the piece from the past?"

331
00:12:45,554 --> 00:12:47,934
and, "Who will design the
piece from the present?"

332
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,672
Now that doesn't mean
it has to be separate.

333
00:12:50,672 --> 00:12:52,532
Right, you can take it home.

334
00:12:52,532 --> 00:12:53,821
- [Pink Shirt] Well, me and her...

335
00:12:53,821 --> 00:12:55,901
- Well, it sounded like we're all, okay?

336
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:59,671
- [Pink Shirt] Yeah, we're
all basically doing it.

337
00:12:59,671 --> 00:13:03,542
- Okay, "Why is this change
important to people today?"

338
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:07,765
and, "How could this continue
to change in the future?"

339
00:13:07,765 --> 00:13:09,564
Hmmmm.

340
00:13:09,564 --> 00:13:14,520
There's some questions to think about.

341
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:23,160
(inaudible)

342
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,553
So have you worked on this some more?

343
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:25,726
You've decided to what you're gonna do?

344
00:13:25,726 --> 00:13:27,294
Skyscrapers and pyramids.

345
00:13:27,294 --> 00:13:28,233
- They're doing the pyramids,

346
00:13:28,233 --> 00:13:31,555
me and him is doing the skyscrapers.

347
00:13:31,555 --> 00:13:32,681
- Them two are doing the pyramids,

348
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:34,412
we're doing the skyscrapers.

349
00:13:34,412 --> 00:13:36,697
- That was nice. Good
going, coming up with that.

350
00:13:36,697 --> 00:13:37,858
Good job.

351
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,960
- We're doing a square pyramid.

352
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,214
- [Teacher] You're doing a square pyramid?

353
00:13:41,214 --> 00:13:42,189
- Yeah.

354
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:45,776
- That's easy, all you gotta
do is start out as a square

355
00:13:45,776 --> 00:13:47,529
and draw triangles at the top.

356
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:50,710
- So when I was with you
before you said this is hard,

357
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,011
we don't know what we're gonna do

358
00:13:52,011 --> 00:13:54,878
and all had different
ideas, and as it turns out

359
00:13:54,878 --> 00:13:56,375
this is kind of easy.

360
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,114
What made it easier?

361
00:13:58,114 --> 00:13:59,718
- [Beau] Working as a team!

362
00:13:59,718 --> 00:14:01,309
- Working as a team.

363
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:02,945
- Dillon, would you mind
sitting over here, sweetie,

364
00:14:02,945 --> 00:14:05,731
so that everybody can hear
and see what you're doing?

365
00:14:05,731 --> 00:14:06,823
- [Dillon] Yeah.

366
00:14:06,823 --> 00:14:10,224
- Kinda off by himself over
there, huh, sweetheart.

367
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,965
Alright, the last thing you
need to fill out on your papers

368
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:15,367
is "How has this changed over time?"

369
00:14:15,367 --> 00:14:19,798
Buildings, how have
buildings changed over time?

370
00:14:19,798 --> 00:14:26,457
- Pyramids, pyramids been tooken down.

371
00:14:26,457 --> 00:14:28,019
- Did we ever build buildings out of gold?

372
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:32,519
- No.

373
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,837
- I got something. Pyramids
have been tooken down

374
00:14:34,837 --> 00:14:38,830
to make more space in
Eygpt, like more land.

375
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,461
- [Teacher] Okay.

376
00:14:40,461 --> 00:14:42,350
(all speaking at once)

377
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,675
- What about buildings in general?

378
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:48,134
How is this building
different from McWilliams?

379
00:14:48,134 --> 00:14:48,853
- [Dillon] It's bigger!

380
00:14:48,853 --> 00:14:50,593
- It's bigger and has more space.

381
00:14:50,593 --> 00:14:51,987
- Which one is bigger?

382
00:14:51,987 --> 00:14:54,927
- [Kids] McWilliams!

383
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,295
- [Beau] And it's newer.

384
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,763
- It's newer, so how do you--

385
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:59,209
- It's newer or it's smaller?

386
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:00,029
- He says it's newer.
