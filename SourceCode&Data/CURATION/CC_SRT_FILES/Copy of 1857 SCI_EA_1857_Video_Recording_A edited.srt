1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,230
- A prediction on the
weather temperatures.

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:04,623
- Okay so maybe they can
predict something

3
00:00:04,623 --> 00:00:05,882
that's going to happen.

4
00:00:05,882 --> 00:00:06,747
- Yes.
- [Teacher] Okay.

5
00:00:06,747 --> 00:00:09,666
So, based on the information
that you collected

6
00:00:09,666 --> 00:00:11,024
is there any information,

7
00:00:11,024 --> 00:00:13,227
let's say you could go
out the next day.

8
00:00:13,227 --> 00:00:15,111
What do you think,
based on what you saw,

9
00:00:15,111 --> 00:00:18,963
what do you think might
happen the next day?

10
00:00:18,963 --> 00:00:22,727
- It might go back down
into the 30s or the 20s.

11
00:00:22,727 --> 00:00:25,039
- [Teacher] Okay, and
what makes you say that?

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,907
- Because there's more 30s and 20s

13
00:00:26,907 --> 00:00:28,995
then there are 50s and 40s.

14
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:30,420
And,

15
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,253
then

16
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,829
there was a large spike so.

17
00:00:36,154 --> 00:00:37,451
- [Teacher] Okay, so it got warmer.

18
00:00:37,451 --> 00:00:40,343
But you're saying because
most of them were cooler,

19
00:00:40,343 --> 00:00:42,348
it might get cooler again?

20
00:00:42,348 --> 00:00:43,181
- Yes.

21
00:00:43,181 --> 00:00:44,703
- Okay, so you're making
a conclusion.

22
00:00:44,703 --> 00:00:46,774
You're using your data
to support that.

23
00:00:46,774 --> 00:00:47,960
Shaun, what are you thinking?

24
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,872
- I was thinking that maybe

25
00:00:50,872 --> 00:00:52,938
they might want to track it,

26
00:00:52,938 --> 00:00:56,049
because maybe weather can,
not evolve over time,

27
00:00:56,049 --> 00:00:58,216
but how much it's changing

28
00:00:59,357 --> 00:01:02,074
and predict what's gonna happen.

29
00:01:02,074 --> 00:01:04,122
- Okay, so you're thinking
like a meteorologist

30
00:01:04,122 --> 00:01:06,962
or a scientist might
make a forecast,

31
00:01:06,962 --> 00:01:10,080
make a prediction, so you're
thinking sort of like Hava.

32
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,925
And were your temperatures
similar to her,

33
00:01:12,925 --> 00:01:14,587
or were they very different?

34
00:01:14,587 --> 00:01:16,427
because you might have been
at two different stations.

35
00:01:16,427 --> 00:01:20,344
What do you think might
happen on the next day?

36
00:01:21,256 --> 00:01:24,310
- I think it will drop
down to the 30s,

37
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,000
because I see that it's
dropping down, it's going up,

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,292
and then it's dropping down.

39
00:01:29,292 --> 00:01:32,822
I think it's gonna go up
and then drop down again.

40
00:01:32,822 --> 00:01:36,593
- Okay, and it does look like
you had kind of a trend here.

41
00:01:36,593 --> 00:01:38,926
So, what do you think if you
had a day that went down,

42
00:01:38,926 --> 00:01:40,559
do you think it might go up again?

43
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:41,856
- Mhm.
- Might peak up again?

44
00:01:41,856 --> 00:01:42,843
Okay.

45
00:01:42,843 --> 00:01:43,676
Is there anybody else

46
00:01:43,676 --> 00:01:45,427
who's looking at their
data thinking of

47
00:01:45,427 --> 00:01:47,951
what else might happen with
that temperature change?

48
00:01:47,951 --> 00:01:49,656
Madison, are you
looking at something?

49
00:01:49,656 --> 00:01:51,489
Yeah, what do you think?

50
00:01:51,489 --> 00:01:55,489
- Well, with the wind
speed and it would be like

51
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:01,576
8.5 for quite a few times a day.

52
00:02:03,287 --> 00:02:06,454
Sort of shot up into
20s or something.

53
00:02:07,522 --> 00:02:10,655
- So what do you think
that was indicating?

54
00:02:10,655 --> 00:02:13,651
- That it was a very windy day.

55
00:02:13,651 --> 00:02:15,051
- A very windy day, okay.

56
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:17,622
So you guys, some of you look
at your charts if you were,

57
00:02:17,622 --> 00:02:21,246
Madison was in Group A, and
can you make a connection,

58
00:02:21,246 --> 00:02:22,079
or H.

59
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:22,912
Madison, can you make a connection

60
00:02:22,912 --> 00:02:25,857
to your wind speed really spiked.

61
00:02:25,857 --> 00:02:28,380
On that same day did
you have any difference,

62
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,547
or did you have something
happen in your temperature?

63
00:02:33,638 --> 00:02:37,305
- Well, the temperature
was about 20 degrees

64
00:02:39,236 --> 00:02:43,421
and because of the wind
was making it cooler.

65
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:45,879
- Okay, so you're saying
that you think that the wind

66
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:48,011
also has an effect on
the temperature?

67
00:02:48,011 --> 00:02:49,243
- Mhm.
- Okay, so

68
00:02:49,243 --> 00:02:50,708
was there anybody else in Group H

69
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,230
that recorded that sort of thing?

70
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,096
You had a big windy gust,
you had a very windy day,

71
00:02:55,096 --> 00:02:57,203
your temperatures went down?

72
00:02:57,203 --> 00:02:59,143
Did you have a similar
thing happen to you Hava?

73
00:02:59,143 --> 00:03:00,304
- Yes.
- Yes, okay.

74
00:03:00,304 --> 00:03:03,718
So you guys, why would we
want to track something like

75
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:06,724
not only temperature,
but also the wind speed?

76
00:03:06,724 --> 00:03:07,557
Jada?

77
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:11,716
- So that they can know what
tomorrow's gonna be like,

78
00:03:11,716 --> 00:03:13,851
or what another day's gonna be like.

79
00:03:13,851 --> 00:03:16,690
Or for them to know if
it's gonna rain or,

80
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,834
- [Teacher] Okay.
- What the temperature

81
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:19,616
is gonna do.

82
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,505
- So they want to think maybe more,

83
00:03:21,505 --> 00:03:23,088
you guys now your thinking, Jada,

84
00:03:23,088 --> 00:03:25,200
you're even putting
together precipitation?

85
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,728
So maybe there's a
consequence of precipitation?

86
00:03:27,728 --> 00:03:30,228
- No, with low temperature and

87
00:03:31,994 --> 00:03:33,161
maybe heat can

88
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,736
evaporate some water
and then the next day

89
00:03:38,736 --> 00:03:42,558
it can get dropped
down and get colder.

90
00:03:42,558 --> 00:03:44,661
- Okay, so maybe a connection
with the precipitation,

91
00:03:44,661 --> 00:03:46,329
temperature, those sorts of things.

92
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:48,078
Okay, Katie O. What are you thinking?

93
00:03:48,078 --> 00:03:49,422
- I would think that they wouldn't

94
00:03:49,422 --> 00:03:50,815
just want to track the temperature,

95
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:52,455
but they'd also do the wind speed

96
00:03:52,455 --> 00:03:56,015
because wind speed can change how,

97
00:03:56,015 --> 00:04:00,106
what the temperature is,
and how it changes.

98
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:02,368
- So why do you think wind speed

99
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:05,502
makes a difference with temperature?

100
00:04:05,502 --> 00:04:06,808
What are you making the connection with?

101
00:04:06,808 --> 00:04:07,698
What's your evidence?

102
00:04:07,698 --> 00:04:10,904
- Well wind speed I think would change

103
00:04:10,904 --> 00:04:12,666
like it wouldn't make it warmer,

104
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,329
it would make the
temperature feel colder.

105
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:18,079
- Okay.  So why do you think that?

106
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,922
- Because the wind...

107
00:04:21,922 --> 00:04:23,788
- Well you go out to the
playground a lot, right?

108
00:04:23,788 --> 00:04:24,624
- Yeah.
- And when you guys

109
00:04:24,624 --> 00:04:26,437
are on the playground
and it's really windy,

110
00:04:26,437 --> 00:04:27,270
is it warm?

111
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,103
- No.

112
00:04:28,103 --> 00:04:29,868
- Okay, so maybe are
you thinking like

113
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:31,163
when you go out there
and it's really windy

114
00:04:31,163 --> 00:04:33,680
and you don't have a coat,
does it feel cooler to you?

115
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,513
- Yes.

116
00:04:34,513 --> 00:04:35,807
- Does it on sometimes?

117
00:04:35,807 --> 00:04:36,640
- Yeah.
- [Teacher] Alright,

118
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,040
so maybe they're maybe a prediction.

119
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,914
And so you were saying they,

120
00:04:39,914 --> 00:04:42,406
so are you thinking
scientists and meteorologists

121
00:04:42,406 --> 00:04:46,043
are trying to put those two
together, those phenomenons?

122
00:04:46,043 --> 00:04:46,876
- Yeah.

123
00:04:46,876 --> 00:04:48,569
- Okay, so Katie O, let me ask you,

124
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:50,491
if this was a hypothesis
that you were saying,

125
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:53,956
if it's windier,
then it may be cooler.

126
00:04:53,956 --> 00:04:56,857
You guys agree as a class?

127
00:04:56,857 --> 00:04:58,151
Okay thumps up, thumbs down,

128
00:04:58,151 --> 00:04:59,113
what do you guys think?

129
00:04:59,113 --> 00:05:00,942
Yes, no, maybe, a little bit there?

130
00:05:00,942 --> 00:05:03,917
Alright, Josh, what are you thinking?

131
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:05,750
- I was saying that if

132
00:05:06,929 --> 00:05:08,510
people are always looking
at the temperature

133
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:12,046
so we know what's gonna happen,
when it's gonna happen,

134
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:14,881
what we can expect,
what we need to do.

135
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:18,519
- Okay.  So we're taking that
forecast even further maybe?

136
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,230
So let me kind of pose
another question real quick

137
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,262
before I keep going you guys.

138
00:05:21,262 --> 00:05:22,103
Let me ask you, you guys remember

139
00:05:22,103 --> 00:05:24,102
when you went on the computer

140
00:05:24,102 --> 00:05:26,837
and you watched the hurricanes?

141
00:05:26,837 --> 00:05:29,091
And you tracked the hurricanes?

142
00:05:29,091 --> 00:05:32,174
So was that data indicating the speed

143
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,666
or the movement of the hurricane?

144
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:36,789
- Yes.
- Yes?

145
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:40,436
So, does a meteorologist even
track something like that

146
00:05:40,436 --> 00:05:43,666
to be able to maybe help people?
- Yes.

147
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,058
Okay.  So do you guys remember

148
00:05:45,058 --> 00:05:47,384
when the meteorologist
came to visit us?

149
00:05:47,384 --> 00:05:48,744
You guys remember that?

150
00:05:48,744 --> 00:05:53,263
And he really talked to us a
lot about tornadoes, didn't he?

151
00:05:53,263 --> 00:05:55,673
But, he was also giving us situations

152
00:05:55,673 --> 00:06:00,086
of how we know a tornado
might be forming, right?

153
00:06:00,086 --> 00:06:01,707
So, yeah, does that make sense,

154
00:06:01,707 --> 00:06:05,444
that that might be another
reason that they start tracking?

155
00:06:05,444 --> 00:06:08,259
So think and talk to
your shoulder partner.

156
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:12,740
Besides a hurricane, what
else might they track to,

157
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,923
like Josh was saying, to
prepare us for, to let us know.

158
00:06:15,923 --> 00:06:17,704
So talk to your shoulder partner.

159
00:06:17,704 --> 00:06:22,704
[Background Chatter]

160
00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:24,783
- The weather because some people

161
00:06:24,783 --> 00:06:27,733
can know what to like my hands.

162
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:29,900
- Yeah, or like tornadoes.

163
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:33,789
- Yeah, or maybe even thunderstorms.

164
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,229
- Or the normal weather.

165
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,067
Very intense temperatures,
we can already know.

166
00:06:45,508 --> 00:06:47,497
- Maybe even like snow,

167
00:06:47,497 --> 00:06:49,113
because that can be
a really heavy and

168
00:06:49,113 --> 00:06:52,780
or kind of get everywhere
like snowbound us.

169
00:06:56,108 --> 00:06:59,358
- Or it could like be rain, snow, hail.

170
00:07:03,592 --> 00:07:07,370
[Background Chatter]

171
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,203
- [Teacher] So what do you think Emily,

172
00:07:08,203 --> 00:07:10,423
what else can we determine?

173
00:07:10,423 --> 00:07:13,423
[Background Chatter]

174
00:07:14,258 --> 00:07:15,890
- Snow storm.

175
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:16,973
Or a tornado.

176
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,564
- Or a earthquake.

177
00:07:24,131 --> 00:07:25,811
- So what were you
thinking first Alexis,

178
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:27,028
and then we'll come back to Nick?

179
00:07:27,028 --> 00:07:31,195
- I was thinking either a
tornado or blizzard snowstorm.

180
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:33,800
- Okay.  So what kind of weather

181
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,926
do you think they're tracking

182
00:07:34,926 --> 00:07:37,215
in order for us to be
prepared about weather.

183
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,331
What do we?

184
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:39,164
- Wind.

185
00:07:39,164 --> 00:07:40,265
- Wind, maybe.

186
00:07:40,265 --> 00:07:42,782
- And temperature.
- Snow.

187
00:07:42,782 --> 00:07:44,866
- [Teacher] Okay, so if we're
looking for just a tornado,

188
00:07:44,866 --> 00:07:47,042
maybe temperature, maybe the wind.

189
00:07:47,042 --> 00:07:52,033
- Yeah, what kind of wind is
it, is it cold or hot, yeah.

190
00:07:52,033 --> 00:07:53,267
- Okay, hot and cold fronts.

191
00:07:53,267 --> 00:07:55,440
And then we were thinking
about, what else Nick?

192
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,357
- I would say a flood because maybe

193
00:07:59,201 --> 00:08:00,711
maybe the clouds are coming

194
00:08:00,711 --> 00:08:03,739
and there's going to
be a bunch of rain.

195
00:08:03,739 --> 00:08:06,139
Like you said, that we
could get a flash flood.

196
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:08,060
- Okay.  So and are you
making that connection

197
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,320
to maybe our area that had a fire,

198
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,047
and so we have to think
about would there be,

199
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:14,850
because it can't absorb the moisture.

200
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,410
Okay, so that's another idea.

201
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,643
So how would meteorologist
or scientists,

202
00:08:19,643 --> 00:08:20,607
how would they Austin,

203
00:08:20,607 --> 00:08:23,089
how would they predict
maybe a flood happening?

204
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:25,495
What do you think they'd use?

205
00:08:25,495 --> 00:08:27,532
What kind of information
would they be looking at?

206
00:08:27,532 --> 00:08:29,908
- Well if a rainstorm was coming,

207
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:32,991
because that rain would cause a flood.

208
00:08:34,754 --> 00:08:36,963
- [Teacher] Okay, so a
large amount of rain,

209
00:08:36,963 --> 00:08:38,204
that would make sense yes.

210
00:08:38,204 --> 00:08:39,503
- Or snow.

211
00:08:39,503 --> 00:08:41,001
- Or even if we had a lot of snow.

212
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:43,918
So if we had large amounts of snow,

213
00:08:44,848 --> 00:08:47,830
what could we possibly
be warning people of,

214
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:48,769
if that was the case?

215
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:51,344
Alexis, what do you think?

216
00:08:51,344 --> 00:08:55,096
- Stay inside or wear warm
clothes if you go somewhere

217
00:08:55,096 --> 00:08:58,248
or something so they
don't get so cold.

218
00:08:58,248 --> 00:09:00,231
- [Teacher] Okay, so would
you guys say,

219
00:09:00,231 --> 00:09:03,438
would one of you formulate
some sort of a hypothesis

220
00:09:03,438 --> 00:09:06,021
about snow coming if there was?

221
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,849
- If there was enough cold air.

222
00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:15,476
And some times when it's
raining it starts to hail,

223
00:09:15,476 --> 00:09:19,213
and then it starts to,
sometimes it starts to snow.

224
00:09:19,213 --> 00:09:22,002
- So, if there's cold
weather and clouds,

225
00:09:22,002 --> 00:09:23,952
then we might have consequences.

226
00:09:23,952 --> 00:09:25,660
- Snow, or rain, or yeah.
- [Teacher] of hail,

227
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,493
or heavy snow?

228
00:09:26,493 --> 00:09:27,540
- Yeah.

229
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,329
- [Teacher] Okay, so we'd
wanna keep that in mind.

230
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:31,920
And does that seem to
happen in our areas?

231
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,550
- Sometimes.
- [Teacher] Sometimes.

232
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,564
And sometimes when we
make that forecast,

233
00:09:35,564 --> 00:09:37,774
and then maybe it doesn't come.

234
00:09:37,774 --> 00:09:39,757
- That happened on Saturday.

235
00:09:39,757 --> 00:09:42,663
- [Teacher] Okay, so if it does come,

236
00:09:42,663 --> 00:09:46,200
what happened on Saturday, Austin?

237
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,508
- I think

238
00:09:47,508 --> 00:09:49,948
it was really humid out at first,

239
00:09:49,948 --> 00:09:51,158
- [Teacher] Mhm.
- And then,

240
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:52,614
it started to rain,

241
00:09:52,614 --> 00:09:54,531
and then a lot of times

242
00:09:56,359 --> 00:10:00,882
usually rain starts out
as ice and then it melts.

243
00:10:00,882 --> 00:10:04,113
And it started to get colder
and then it started to hail.

244
00:10:04,113 --> 00:10:06,689
- [Teacher] So then we have the
consequences of a hailstorm.

245
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,554
Didn't last Saturday, did it
start out really nice first?

246
00:10:09,554 --> 00:10:10,433
- Yeah.
- Yeah, and then

247
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:12,350
also happened yesterday too,

248
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,183
because

249
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:18,564
when I got picked up it was
nice and warm and everything.

250
00:10:18,564 --> 00:10:20,984
And then when I got to my
house it was all windy,

251
00:10:20,984 --> 00:10:23,171
and then it started raining.

252
00:10:23,171 --> 00:10:24,836
So I was like,

253
00:10:24,836 --> 00:10:26,957
I thought it was supposed
to be hot today.

254
00:10:26,957 --> 00:10:27,790
- Right.

255
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,333
So is it possible to use
forecasting information

256
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,719
and still be wrong?
- Yes.

257
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:37,719
[Background Chatter]

258
00:10:38,232 --> 00:10:40,985
- Well in the weather book,

259
00:10:40,985 --> 00:10:44,429
it explains the rating of tornadoes.

260
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:46,596
So I'm thinking tornadoes,

261
00:10:48,596 --> 00:10:51,276
or something to track
like the wind speed

262
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:53,693
if it's gets too crazy,

263
00:10:53,693 --> 00:10:54,610
it get like

264
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,740
wind miles per hour, and

265
00:11:00,814 --> 00:11:02,795
how bad it is.

266
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,505
Like if the wind
speed's really high,

267
00:11:04,505 --> 00:11:06,838
then it can cause a tornado.

268
00:11:09,906 --> 00:11:11,156
Like the scale.

269
00:11:15,837 --> 00:11:28,837
[Background Chatter]

270
00:11:29,978 --> 00:11:31,373
- So they use that information.

271
00:11:31,373 --> 00:11:33,142
We were just talking
and showing the things

272
00:11:33,142 --> 00:11:35,470
that they might be using for

273
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,231
information that they're
collecting to do what now?

274
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:38,496
To give to the what?

275
00:11:38,496 --> 00:11:41,348
- They're doing it to give us warnings.

276
00:11:41,348 --> 00:11:44,219
They can't tell us that a
tornado's happening prior to it,

277
00:11:44,219 --> 00:11:45,052
- [Teacher] Right.
- So they

278
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:47,731
have to warn us about them.

279
00:11:47,731 --> 00:11:51,397
And so I think they collect
the data from that to do that.

280
00:11:51,397 --> 00:11:53,632
- Okay, and then Reagan, what
were you connecting that with?

281
00:11:53,632 --> 00:11:57,168
- I was connecting it with
a blizzard or snow storm,

282
00:11:57,168 --> 00:12:00,974
because if there's a delay
and you need to go somewhere,

283
00:12:00,974 --> 00:12:02,966
you can know that there
might be delays.

284
00:12:02,966 --> 00:12:05,893
And if you're gonna go outside
you need to wear a coat,

285
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:07,583
a heavy coat.

286
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:08,623
- Okay, so how do we respond,

287
00:12:08,623 --> 00:12:10,956
how do we react to it, good.

288
00:12:14,572 --> 00:12:16,550
Okay, you guys I was going around,

289
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,780
and I heard some
excellent conversations.

290
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,865
And so I think you guys
made strong connections

291
00:12:21,865 --> 00:12:23,115
with your data.

292
00:12:23,998 --> 00:12:27,066
And probably with your
meteorologist visit,

293
00:12:27,066 --> 00:12:27,904
what they were telling you,

294
00:12:27,904 --> 00:12:30,605
and how you were putting
that information together.

295
00:12:30,605 --> 00:12:34,101
So I want you guys to go ahead
and pick up your pencils.

296
00:12:34,101 --> 00:12:36,744
And write underneath your graphs,

297
00:12:36,744 --> 00:12:39,427
I want you to answer this question.

298
00:12:39,427 --> 00:12:42,314
What does your data tell you?

299
00:12:42,314 --> 00:12:44,573
So write there on
underneath your graph,

300
00:12:44,573 --> 00:12:46,776
or write on your graph,

301
00:12:46,776 --> 00:12:50,207
you could even write right
in the middle of your graph,

302
00:12:50,207 --> 00:12:54,373
I want you to write what is
your graph actually telling you?

303
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:58,837
So is it telling you that you
had a series of cold days?

304
00:12:58,837 --> 00:13:00,707
Make your prediction.

305
00:13:00,707 --> 00:13:02,668
So go ahead and take a minute or two,

306
00:13:02,668 --> 00:13:05,585
write down what your data tells you

307
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,039
and then what changes
did you observe?

308
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,206
What was the most significant
change that you observed?

309
00:13:16,267 --> 00:13:18,593
If at all possible, while
you're writing that,

310
00:13:18,593 --> 00:13:20,582
you can come up with a hypothesis

311
00:13:20,582 --> 00:13:22,668
about your data.

312
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,744
It could either be your wind speed,

313
00:13:24,744 --> 00:13:27,411
or it could be your temperature.

314
00:13:29,363 --> 00:13:33,280
Write down what it is
that actually took place.

315
00:13:46,214 --> 00:13:47,625
Yeah, you want to
answer the question,

316
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:48,805
what does your data tell you?

317
00:13:48,805 --> 00:13:51,991
What changes did you observe?

318
00:13:51,991 --> 00:13:54,507
On either graph or you
can even write a sentence

319
00:13:54,507 --> 00:13:57,443
that combines the two
of them together.

320
00:13:57,443 --> 00:13:59,568
- So mine says,
I added a little more.

321
00:13:59,568 --> 00:14:04,246
It says, it is telling me
all about my wind speed,

322
00:14:04,246 --> 00:14:07,579
and how it's going high
or low, or high.

323
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:11,058
What does your say Austin?

324
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:14,058
- Mine is, it had cold and hot days.

325
00:14:16,876 --> 00:14:20,043
And it went from 44 degrees Fahrenheit

326
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,244
to 20 degrees Fahrenheit.

327
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,423
- [Teacher] So go ahead,

328
00:14:26,423 --> 00:14:28,175
just like Alexis and Austin shared,

329
00:14:28,175 --> 00:14:31,040
go ahead and share with
your face partner this time,

330
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,753
so that you change who
you're talking to.

331
00:14:33,753 --> 00:14:36,985
So Emily and Madison, you can
also share what you wrote.

332
00:14:36,985 --> 00:14:40,356
- It tells me that some
times it can be hot,

333
00:14:40,356 --> 00:14:43,608
and then go down to
a little bit colder,

334
00:14:43,608 --> 00:14:46,923
and then it goes back into hot.

335
00:14:46,923 --> 00:14:48,793
- Yeah, that's what I was kinda saying

336
00:14:48,793 --> 00:14:50,183
when I told the wind speed,

337
00:14:50,183 --> 00:14:53,318
because it's not always wind speed.

338
00:14:53,318 --> 00:14:56,736
Yeah, it's not always wind speed,

339
00:14:56,736 --> 00:14:59,565
but most of the time when we took it,

340
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:03,513
it was mostly in the winter
so it would mostly go down.

341
00:15:03,513 --> 00:15:06,903
Like, it was 40, then it
was 25, then it was 20,

342
00:15:06,903 --> 00:15:11,070
and then it was 30, and then
it was 30, and then it was 40,

343
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:14,143
and then it was 50.

344
00:15:14,143 --> 00:15:15,476
So, that's what.

345
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,228
- [Teacher] So John what did
you figure out from your data?

346
00:15:21,228 --> 00:15:22,895
- I figured out that

347
00:15:23,906 --> 00:15:26,987
it was colder the week
we were doing this.

348
00:15:26,987 --> 00:15:27,945
- [Teacher] Okay.

349
00:15:27,945 --> 00:15:31,195
- And the wind speed
was not very high.

350
00:15:33,061 --> 00:15:35,970
- [Teacher] Okay, oh yeah, yeah.

351
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,411
So you were in an area that maybe

352
00:15:37,411 --> 00:15:39,867
was more protected by
the wind, do you think?

353
00:15:39,867 --> 00:15:41,356
- Yeah, we were behind the building.

354
00:15:41,356 --> 00:15:43,579
- [Teacher] Oh okay, so that
might of had an effect too?

355
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:44,412
- Yeah.

356
00:15:44,412 --> 00:15:49,071
- [Teacher] Okay, did you draw
any conclusions from that?

357
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:49,928
- I forgot to do that.

358
00:15:49,928 --> 00:15:50,922
- Okay, great.

359
00:15:50,922 --> 00:15:52,533
Braden, tell us a little bit about

360
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:54,147
what you observed from your data?

361
00:15:54,147 --> 00:15:56,064
- Well, I observed that

362
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,305
I did not get much wind speed.

363
00:15:59,305 --> 00:16:02,012
- Okay, so where was your station?

364
00:16:02,012 --> 00:16:03,921
Were you at a protected area as well?

365
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:04,754
- Yes.

366
00:16:04,754 --> 00:16:06,128
- Okay, so that definitely
had an effect, didn't it?

367
00:16:06,128 --> 00:16:06,961
- Yes.

368
00:16:06,961 --> 00:16:07,920
- So as a meteorologist,

369
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,759
would you want to be able
to put your anemometers

370
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,129
somewhere where you know
you're gonna catch the wind?

371
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:13,962
- Yep.
- [Teacher] Okay,

372
00:16:13,962 --> 00:16:16,376
so that was a really important
lesson right there, too.

373
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:18,675
So what about your
thermometer readings,

374
00:16:18,675 --> 00:16:21,466
since those weren't
dependent necessarily on

375
00:16:21,466 --> 00:16:22,717
being protected from the wind.

376
00:16:22,717 --> 00:16:24,803
What can you observe from
your thermometer reading?

377
00:16:24,803 --> 00:16:28,170
- Well, that it was
40 degrees on Monday,

378
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:31,714
and then on Tuesday and
Wednesday it got colder.

379
00:16:31,714 --> 00:16:33,464
- Okay, so it got colder
on Tuesday and Wednesday.

380
00:16:33,464 --> 00:16:34,619
So if you were making a prediction,

381
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,064
what do you think would
happen on this day,

382
00:16:36,064 --> 00:16:38,257
based on your data?

383
00:16:38,257 --> 00:16:41,400
Do you think it's gonna
change, stay the same,

384
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,384
what do you think?

385
00:16:42,384 --> 00:16:43,217
- Stay the same.

386
00:16:43,217 --> 00:16:44,250
- Seems like it's
gonna stay the same,

387
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,124
because you have
that pretty consistently?

388
00:16:46,124 --> 00:16:47,339
- Yeah.
- [Teacher] Okay, alright.

389
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,486
Tariq, what do you find
from your data?

390
00:16:49,486 --> 00:16:51,334
What did you discover observing?

391
00:16:51,334 --> 00:16:54,751
- I noticed that for
my temperature I had

392
00:16:55,675 --> 00:16:57,902
up and down weather.

393
00:16:57,902 --> 00:16:58,918
- [Teacher] So your temperature was,

394
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:01,048
would you say it was fluctuating?

395
00:17:01,048 --> 00:17:01,881
- Yeah.

396
00:17:01,881 --> 00:17:05,581
- [Teacher] Okay, why do you
think that was happening?

397
00:17:05,581 --> 00:17:09,369
- Because, well it was cold
on the days we went out,

398
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:13,536
but where we were the sun was
kind of coming towards us,

399
00:17:15,649 --> 00:17:17,028
at the times we went out.

400
00:17:17,028 --> 00:17:18,183
- [Teacher] So do you
think that had an effect

401
00:17:18,183 --> 00:17:19,467
on your thermometer as well?

402
00:17:19,467 --> 00:17:20,300
- Yeah.

403
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,348
- [Teacher] Hm, okay so
then that's another thing

404
00:17:22,348 --> 00:17:24,209
as a meteorologist, you
might want to think about

405
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,815
where your thermometer is, right?

406
00:17:26,815 --> 00:17:28,752
Are you just getting straight sun?

407
00:17:28,752 --> 00:17:29,798
Okay, was there something else

408
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,187
you were gonna say about
your wind speed?

409
00:17:31,187 --> 00:17:33,838
- Well, my wind speed.

410
00:17:33,838 --> 00:17:35,755
On Monday we got a lot.

411
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:39,515
And on Thursday we got a lot.

412
00:17:40,964 --> 00:17:43,969
On the other two days
we didn't get any wind.

413
00:17:43,969 --> 00:17:45,763
- [Teacher] Not too much, okay.

414
00:17:45,763 --> 00:17:47,784
- Then.
- Then I also had,

415
00:17:47,784 --> 00:17:48,735
- [Teacher] Go ahead.

416
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,370
- All three of us were
in the same group.

417
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,040
- [Teacher] You were in
the same group, alright.

418
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,373
So there you go.

419
00:17:54,438 --> 00:17:55,271
- And,

420
00:17:56,298 --> 00:17:59,298
I also had to say
that my wind speed

421
00:18:00,175 --> 00:18:01,955
was never below 20 degrees.
- [Teacher] You to pull out

422
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,826
your sheet, right there that you have

423
00:18:03,826 --> 00:18:06,530
about your temperature on the moon.

424
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:09,277
I want to ask you
one more question.

425
00:18:09,277 --> 00:18:13,426
And I want you to think about
your temperature on the moon.

426
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,546
Now did you actually go to
the moon to get your data?

427
00:18:16,546 --> 00:18:17,379
- No.

428
00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:20,704
- No, but let's look
at the scientists

429
00:18:20,704 --> 00:18:22,501
who recorded that data.

430
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:26,423
Why was it important
for them to find out

431
00:18:26,423 --> 00:18:27,962
the temperature on the moon?

432
00:18:27,962 --> 00:18:31,134
And as you look at it,
did it change very much?

433
00:18:31,134 --> 00:18:33,836
So why was it important and
did it change very much?

434
00:18:33,836 --> 00:18:34,836
Okay, Jaime.

435
00:18:36,243 --> 00:18:37,576
- I thought that

436
00:18:39,425 --> 00:18:40,926
on

437
00:18:40,926 --> 00:18:42,509
one of the missions

438
00:18:44,648 --> 00:18:47,565
that it was different temperatures.

439
00:18:48,572 --> 00:18:49,905
Like it would be

440
00:18:51,743 --> 00:18:52,576
213,

441
00:18:54,491 --> 00:18:57,658
and then it dropped
down to about 200.

442
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:02,091
- Okay, and so you're specifically
talking about the day?

443
00:19:02,091 --> 00:19:03,079
- Yeah.
- [Teacher] Okay.

444
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:06,078
And so you're saying
is it pretty similar?

445
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,543
Is that you're saying?

446
00:19:08,543 --> 00:19:11,395
- Pretty similar, but not very.

447
00:19:11,395 --> 00:19:12,312
- Okay, so.

448
00:19:14,324 --> 00:19:18,382
- The main thing is that
it didn't stay the same.

449
00:19:18,382 --> 00:19:20,058
- Okay, it didn't seem
to stay the same.

450
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:21,492
- No.
- [Teacher] Okay.

451
00:19:21,492 --> 00:19:23,502
And then we had,
not only day temperature,

452
00:19:23,502 --> 00:19:25,634
but was the other temperature
that we looked at on the moon?

453
00:19:25,634 --> 00:19:26,467
- Night.

454
00:19:26,467 --> 00:19:27,300
- Nighttime, okay.

455
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,971
So what were you thinking
about that Shaun?

456
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:33,506
- I kind of had the
same data as Jamie did.

457
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,257
- [Teacher] Okay.
- Because

458
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,729
it switched every single mission.

459
00:19:37,729 --> 00:19:39,646
So on mission 11 it was

460
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:44,875
210 degrees,

461
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:49,125
well 200 and about 13 degrees.

462
00:19:50,729 --> 00:19:51,562
- [Teacher] Okay.

463
00:19:51,562 --> 00:19:54,965
- And it just kept on going
down and up each mission.

464
00:19:54,965 --> 00:19:58,169
So it changed significantly
each mission.
