1
00:00:00,522 --> 00:00:02,622
- You're totally fine.

2
00:00:02,622 --> 00:00:05,094
So you guys will be using,

3
00:00:05,094 --> 00:00:07,234
I'm assuming a meter tape?

4
00:00:07,234 --> 00:00:07,694
- Yeah.

5
00:00:07,694 --> 00:00:08,754
- For measurements?

6
00:00:08,754 --> 00:00:10,794
And then can you take a minute to explain

7
00:00:10,794 --> 00:00:13,604
the balance thing again so we're good?

8
00:00:14,234 --> 00:00:17,594
- Strength versus strength
qualifies ten times.

9
00:00:17,594 --> 00:00:19,314
- Ok so I like that you're
making everyone go clockwise,

10
00:00:19,314 --> 00:00:20,634
everyone's doing ten, alright.

11
00:00:20,634 --> 00:00:22,874
- And then see how long they can balance

12
00:00:22,874 --> 00:00:25,014
on their most dominant foot.

13
00:00:28,226 --> 00:00:29,566
- Ok.

14
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:30,666
- There's a max of 60 seconds

15
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:31,826
and no shoes on.

16
00:00:31,826 --> 00:00:32,786
- No shoes on, ok perfect.

17
00:00:32,786 --> 00:00:33,986
You guys are good.

18
00:00:44,323 --> 00:00:45,802
Ok so wingspan,

19
00:00:45,802 --> 00:00:47,822
what are your units you
guys are measuring in?

20
00:00:47,822 --> 00:00:50,843
Centimeters and you're
going tip to tip right?

21
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:53,742
And then what was the ability again?

22
00:00:53,742 --> 00:00:55,103
- They'll take their shoes off,

23
00:00:55,103 --> 00:00:56,942
try to touch their toes.

24
00:00:56,942 --> 00:00:58,102
And then we'll measure the distance

25
00:00:58,102 --> 00:01:00,182
from their finger tip to
the top of their foot.

26
00:01:00,182 --> 00:01:01,182
- Ok, good.

27
00:01:01,182 --> 00:01:02,062
In what units?

28
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:02,543
- Centimeters.

29
00:01:02,543 --> 00:01:03,302
- Centimeters.

30
00:01:03,302 --> 00:01:04,622
Did you say take shoes off or no?

31
00:01:04,622 --> 00:01:05,122
- Yeah.

32
00:01:05,122 --> 00:01:05,902
- Ok, cool.

33
00:01:05,902 --> 00:01:08,272
You guys can start collecting data.

34
00:01:11,742 --> 00:01:13,473
I'll come back to you.

35
00:01:13,723 --> 00:01:15,623
Ok what do you guys got?

36
00:01:15,623 --> 00:01:16,903
- [Voiceover] Same thing we got yesterday.

37
00:01:16,903 --> 00:01:18,622
- Recap me.

38
00:01:18,622 --> 00:01:19,722
- Hair color,

39
00:01:19,722 --> 00:01:21,102
- You were hair color.

40
00:01:21,102 --> 00:01:22,822
Why the hell don't you
have something else?

41
00:01:22,822 --> 00:01:23,422
- [Voiceover] I don't know.

42
00:01:23,422 --> 00:01:24,462
- Ok, so here's my question.

43
00:01:24,462 --> 00:01:26,362
Cause I was thinking
about this last night.

44
00:01:26,362 --> 00:01:28,623
You're gonna be asked to
make a scatter plot graph

45
00:01:28,623 --> 00:01:29,983
of this data.

46
00:01:29,983 --> 00:01:33,142
How would one go about
making a scatter plot

47
00:01:33,142 --> 00:01:34,992
with hair color?

48
00:01:35,402 --> 00:01:37,183
Ok, so you're gonna assign numbers,

49
00:01:37,183 --> 00:01:38,803
numeric data to shades?

50
00:01:38,803 --> 00:01:39,802
- [Voiceover] Zero to ten.

51
00:01:39,802 --> 00:01:40,382
Or one to ten.

52
00:01:40,382 --> 00:01:41,062
- One to ten.

53
00:01:41,062 --> 00:01:41,662
- Yeah.

54
00:01:41,662 --> 00:01:43,102
- One being the,

55
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:43,962
- lightest.

56
00:01:43,962 --> 00:01:45,022
- [Voiceover] The lightest (laughing)

57
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:45,822
- lightest.

58
00:01:45,822 --> 00:01:46,782
We should probably get
this straightened out

59
00:01:46,782 --> 00:01:48,102
before we do it, right?

60
00:01:48,102 --> 00:01:49,702
And then ten being the darkest.

61
00:01:49,702 --> 00:01:51,402
Ok, before you start collecting it

62
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,922
can you just give me a
really quick specturm.

63
00:01:52,922 --> 00:01:54,902
Draw a line out so I
could see where you're

64
00:01:54,902 --> 00:01:56,143
getting your number data.

65
00:01:56,143 --> 00:01:59,002
And then what is your characteristic?

66
00:01:59,002 --> 00:01:59,642
That was your characteristic.

67
00:01:59,642 --> 00:02:00,702
What is your ability?

68
00:02:00,702 --> 00:02:02,302
- How many steps does it take you

69
00:02:02,302 --> 00:02:03,843
to walk backwards seven feet?

70
00:02:03,843 --> 00:02:05,742
- Ok, so we'll probably
do that in the hallway?

71
00:02:05,742 --> 00:02:06,742
Does that sound fine?

72
00:02:06,742 --> 00:02:09,252
Meter tapes are up there.

73
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,822
- [Voiceover] That's a lot of guys.

74
00:02:10,822 --> 00:02:12,042
- So give me a real quick scale

75
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:12,856
then you guys can start.

76
00:02:12,856 --> 00:02:13,656
- Ok.

77
00:02:13,656 --> 00:02:17,227
(people talking over each other)

78
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,090
One and ten.

79
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,140
So that's blonde and really blonde.

80
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,130
And like really dark brown.

81
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,310
- So where would red fall in?

82
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,650
- Like me?

83
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,390
Like right there.

84
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,551
- So you're gonna make blonde one end.

85
00:02:34,551 --> 00:02:36,570
The low end, are we all
in agreeance on that?

86
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,591
- [Voiceover] Yeah and
mine is like in the middle.

87
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:41,630
- [Voiceover] Ok, and
then the other far end's

88
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,710
gonna be the darkest brown?

89
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,350
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

90
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,250
- [Voiceover] Or black.

91
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,810
- Or black.

92
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,950
Are you gonna have everyone
taking data on that?

93
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,851
Or maybe one or two people

94
00:02:49,851 --> 00:02:52,450
just consistently doing the hair color?

95
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:52,850
You know what I mean

96
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,550
so there's not a ton of variation?

97
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,871
(laughing)

98
00:03:05,911 --> 00:03:08,070
- Measure their hand from first crease

99
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,251
to their middle finger.

100
00:03:10,251 --> 00:03:12,911
And then hopping on one foot, right?

101
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:14,670
On your tiptoe?

102
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,970
Or no, balance, balance.

103
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,210
And then once your heel touch
into the ground, it's done.

104
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,918
And your hands can do whatever you want.

105
00:03:23,918 --> 00:03:26,178
- [Voiceover] Ok, are
we shoe on, shoe off?

106
00:03:26,178 --> 00:03:26,939
- Shoe off.

107
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:30,149
- [Voiceover] Shoe off and
is it right or left foot?

108
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,378
Right foot for everybody?

109
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:32,978
Ok.

110
00:03:32,978 --> 00:03:36,068
Right foot shoe off on tiptoe

111
00:03:37,138 --> 00:03:38,158
- Max two minutes.

112
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:39,858
- Max two minutes so the deciding factor

113
00:03:39,858 --> 00:03:40,799
when to stop the stopwatch

114
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,018
is when their heel hits the ground.

115
00:03:42,018 --> 00:03:43,938
- Or their other foot.

116
00:03:43,938 --> 00:03:44,678
- [Voiceover] Or their other foot.

117
00:03:44,678 --> 00:03:46,138
So it could be either or.

118
00:03:46,138 --> 00:03:46,658
Okeydoke.

119
00:03:46,658 --> 00:03:48,578
So just a kind of a
flashback to remind us.

120
00:03:48,578 --> 00:03:50,658
This has been a couple daytime span here.

121
00:03:50,658 --> 00:03:52,358
Our goal behind this is try to determine

122
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:54,138
what we can learn from a fossil.

123
00:03:54,138 --> 00:03:55,298
So as we work through this unit

124
00:03:55,298 --> 00:03:58,279
we're gonna start building
together pieces of information

125
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,998
that help us come up with
ideas about the past.

126
00:04:00,998 --> 00:04:02,978
We've been specifically,
as I've said before

127
00:04:02,978 --> 00:04:06,878
looking at one specific fossil,
foot fossil length, right?

128
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:09,498
The idea behind this is that
scientists put the pieces

129
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:12,238
of the puzzle together, we
start to get a clear image

130
00:04:12,238 --> 00:04:13,678
of what's going on.

131
00:04:13,678 --> 00:04:15,779
Again, our goal was to determine
if there's a relationship

132
00:04:15,779 --> 00:04:17,738
between the characteristic you chose,

133
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:21,038
the ability you chose, and
a person's foot fossil.

134
00:04:21,038 --> 00:04:24,398
I asked you last night
to plot up your data

135
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:26,519
for both characteristic and ability

136
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:29,958
and then if possible
draw a line of best fit.

137
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,698
That could be an indirect relationship,

138
00:04:31,698 --> 00:04:35,258
a direct one, a trend, or no relationship.

139
00:04:35,258 --> 00:04:37,158
What I'm gonna ask you to do for a minute,

140
00:04:37,158 --> 00:04:39,258
talk to your neighbors.

141
00:04:39,258 --> 00:04:40,878
Compare your data.

142
00:04:40,878 --> 00:04:42,098
Make sure we're on the same page

143
00:04:42,098 --> 00:04:43,898
in determining a relationship.

144
00:04:43,898 --> 00:04:46,418
And then I'd like you to
come up and post your data.

145
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:48,598
It's gonna be a pretty simple
process to post your data.

146
00:04:48,598 --> 00:04:50,919
So for example, if group one,

147
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:52,138
what was your characteristic?

148
00:04:52,138 --> 00:04:54,198
- [Voiceover] For fossil length.

149
00:04:54,198 --> 00:04:54,978
- Hand spans.

150
00:04:54,978 --> 00:04:56,218
We're gonna put characteristic
on the left side

151
00:04:56,218 --> 00:04:58,858
so they're gonna right hand span for us.

152
00:04:58,858 --> 00:05:00,158
And then what type of relationship

153
00:05:00,158 --> 00:05:01,579
did you guys see for that?

154
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:02,158
- [Voiceover] Direct.

155
00:05:02,158 --> 00:05:05,029
- Direct, so all you're
gonna do is do this.

156
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,618
That's all we need to report.

157
00:05:06,618 --> 00:05:08,098
Ok, in your lab packet,

158
00:05:08,098 --> 00:05:11,778
you are going to find some little graphs.

159
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,398
You're gonna be asked to
record everyone's data.

160
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:16,178
I've also given you a supplementary sheet

161
00:05:16,178 --> 00:05:17,578
cause you're gonna need more graphs.

162
00:05:17,578 --> 00:05:20,018
I messed up and didn't tell you.

163
00:05:20,018 --> 00:05:21,618
So what's gonna wind up happening

164
00:05:21,618 --> 00:05:23,539
is all the graphs would appear on here.

165
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:26,218
You will also copy down into your packet

166
00:05:26,218 --> 00:05:28,539
because as a whole you'll be
looking at everyone's data

167
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:30,818
and drawing conclusions, ok?

168
00:05:30,818 --> 00:05:32,418
So take a minute to talk to your groups.

169
00:05:32,418 --> 00:05:33,998
I'll come around and
give you some markers.

170
00:05:33,998 --> 00:05:35,858
Determine what your
characteristic and ability

171
00:05:35,858 --> 00:05:37,658
relationships are.

172
00:05:37,658 --> 00:05:39,539
Post them on the board

173
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,298
and then we'll talk.

174
00:05:41,298 --> 00:05:46,298
(students chattering)

175
00:06:10,886 --> 00:06:12,020
- No

176
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,900
- Can you determine it?

177
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,940
- No.

178
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,160
- Cause they're not.

179
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,020
They're just kind of clustered.

180
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:21,630
It was like more not clustered.

181
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,360
- Ok, so we're gonna have a trend

182
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,670
fall in between where?

183
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,060
- I guess the trend
really is between 15 and

184
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,360
- What are we lacking?

185
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,330
- You know what, it was 12:30 last night,

186
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,020
Fossil, foot length, stride length.

187
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,220
- Ok, so we're having a
trend falling between,

188
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,380
what's our lowest?

189
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,740
- Our lowest is 12 and our highest is 23

190
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,000
but like the trend is between these ones.

191
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,860
(mumbling)

192
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,680
- Ok, I think that works.

193
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,600
So you're gonna give a horizontal line

194
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,640
on your graph up there.

195
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,095
Need help?

196
00:07:04,095 --> 00:07:06,325
Ok, whatcha got?

197
00:07:10,896 --> 00:07:12,075
- [Voiceover] Would you draw a line

198
00:07:12,075 --> 00:07:13,075
for a trend?

199
00:07:13,075 --> 00:07:14,475
- Yeah it would either
be vertical or horizontal

200
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,035
just like we did in the beginning.

201
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:19,316
So this person's kinda
like an outlier right

202
00:07:19,316 --> 00:07:22,035
so let's just for argument's
sake take them out.

203
00:07:22,035 --> 00:07:24,605
Does that help clear the data up at all?

204
00:07:26,035 --> 00:07:27,375
You could say no, it's ok.

205
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,295
- They're all kind of
in the same foot length

206
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:31,315
but they all have different times.

207
00:07:31,315 --> 00:07:35,176
- Ok, so we've got a pretty
wide range here, right?

208
00:07:35,176 --> 00:07:39,475
For trend, we tend to see
more of a skinnier range.

209
00:07:39,475 --> 00:07:41,515
So if you look at our options,

210
00:07:41,515 --> 00:07:44,475
it's definitely not a direct
or indirect I would say

211
00:07:44,475 --> 00:07:46,735
based on what you showed me, right?

212
00:07:46,735 --> 00:07:49,015
Trend-wise,

213
00:07:49,015 --> 00:07:51,215
it's kind of a wide range.

214
00:07:51,215 --> 00:07:52,355
So what would we determine,

215
00:07:52,355 --> 00:07:53,655
what's our other option?

216
00:07:53,655 --> 00:07:54,515
- No relationship.

217
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:55,275
- Yeah, I would probably go.

218
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:56,415
So up there instead of drawing a line

219
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,935
just write no relation, ok?

220
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,045
Here's your marker.

221
00:08:07,535 --> 00:08:08,515
- With this one,

222
00:08:08,515 --> 00:08:10,456
cause it's kind of like a trend

223
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:13,615
or kind of just focused in this area.

224
00:08:13,615 --> 00:08:15,395
But then there's also the increase

225
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:16,415
- Ok, so here's my question.

226
00:08:16,415 --> 00:08:17,375
That's a good question.

227
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,775
When I look at this data, right?

228
00:08:19,775 --> 00:08:22,735
If I had a pick, excluding this line,

229
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:25,296
if I had to pick where
someone with a foot fossil

230
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,555
over here would fall,
where would you pick?

231
00:08:27,555 --> 00:08:30,045
Up here?

232
00:08:30,055 --> 00:08:31,625
Why?

233
00:08:33,695 --> 00:08:35,035
Yeah, it appears to be going this way.

234
00:08:35,035 --> 00:08:35,995
So that would indicate

235
00:08:35,995 --> 00:08:37,575
that you have a direct relationship.

236
00:08:37,575 --> 00:08:39,255
It's kind of the easiest
way to look at it.

237
00:08:39,255 --> 00:08:40,356
Ok group number one.

238
00:08:40,356 --> 00:08:44,415
Hand span versus foot fossil
length and then jump height.

239
00:08:44,415 --> 00:08:47,005
What kind of relationship
are we seeing here?

240
00:08:47,015 --> 00:08:48,455
Direct, so the bigger the foot fossil,

241
00:08:48,455 --> 00:08:50,015
the bigger the hand span.

242
00:08:50,015 --> 00:08:51,315
So just to clarify hand span,

243
00:08:51,315 --> 00:08:54,615
we're talking tip of
thumb to tip of finger.

244
00:08:54,615 --> 00:08:55,735
Correct?

245
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:56,575
Why do we see that?

246
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,655
So I asked you guys last night

247
00:08:57,655 --> 00:08:59,796
to jot down some ideas

248
00:08:59,796 --> 00:09:01,055
in the conclusion section.

249
00:09:01,055 --> 00:09:02,915
so you might want to turn
to that page, everyone,

250
00:09:02,915 --> 00:09:05,095
cause you wanna gather some ideas here.

251
00:09:05,095 --> 00:09:06,835
Why are we seeing this?

252
00:09:06,835 --> 00:09:10,535
Why do you think we're
seeing that relationship?

253
00:09:10,535 --> 00:09:12,686
What did you guys say?

254
00:09:13,415 --> 00:09:17,275
- Because your hands and
feet are usually proportional

255
00:09:17,275 --> 00:09:18,135
in size.

256
00:09:18,135 --> 00:09:19,816
You're not gonna have a very large foot

257
00:09:19,816 --> 00:09:21,415
and have very small hands.

258
00:09:21,415 --> 00:09:22,375
Usually.

259
00:09:25,415 --> 00:09:26,985
- [Voiceover] Ok.

260
00:09:27,435 --> 00:09:29,555
So I have a question
for everyone in class.

261
00:09:29,555 --> 00:09:31,786
I bought some new shoes and I like them.

262
00:09:34,016 --> 00:09:35,906
Do you like them?

263
00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:39,095
- [Voiceover] They're so big on you.

264
00:09:39,095 --> 00:09:42,305
(clomping)

265
00:09:44,295 --> 00:09:45,015
- They're a little loud.

266
00:09:45,015 --> 00:09:47,505
Don't worry I won't wear
them on testing days.

267
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:49,556
They look good?

268
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:54,165
(students chattering)

269
00:09:54,356 --> 00:09:56,285
What's the problem here?

270
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,295
They're like way too big,

271
00:09:58,295 --> 00:10:00,295
like twenty sizes too big.

272
00:10:00,295 --> 00:10:01,075
How do you know?

273
00:10:01,075 --> 00:10:04,205
Why do you know that
my foot's not this big?

274
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,685
Yeah, it doesn't look
proportional to my body.

275
00:10:09,055 --> 00:10:10,795
And exactly what Megan said,

276
00:10:10,795 --> 00:10:13,635
bodies in general are proportional.

277
00:10:13,635 --> 00:10:14,995
Now we go through some stages in our lives

278
00:10:14,995 --> 00:10:17,235
where we have long, really lanky arms.

279
00:10:17,235 --> 00:10:20,115
Or you might know someone
that has extremely long legs.

280
00:10:20,115 --> 00:10:22,395
They're kind of fitting
outside that pattern.

281
00:10:22,395 --> 00:10:27,365
But in general, bodies
are proportionate, right?

282
00:10:32,775 --> 00:10:35,655
And so we can probably
makes some connections

283
00:10:35,655 --> 00:10:38,015
to certain body characteristics

284
00:10:38,015 --> 00:10:41,215
based on other body
characteristics, right?

285
00:10:41,215 --> 00:10:44,895
Because of this idea
that we are proportioned.

286
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:45,995
You're not gonna see Shaquille O Neal

287
00:10:45,995 --> 00:10:47,835
wearing a size three shoe.

288
00:10:47,835 --> 00:10:49,715
He'll fall over.

289
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:52,435
He wouldn't be able to
support his own body.

290
00:10:52,435 --> 00:10:54,095
Common sense applies here.

291
00:10:54,095 --> 00:10:54,995
That's a good one.

292
00:10:54,995 --> 00:10:56,175
Jump height.

293
00:10:56,175 --> 00:11:00,455
So you said pretty much
everyone kind of fell

294
00:11:00,455 --> 00:11:03,375
into one kind of area
but there's no indirect

295
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,015
or direct relationship.

296
00:11:05,015 --> 00:11:07,265
Why do you think we saw that?

297
00:11:09,455 --> 00:11:11,896
- Jump height is an ability versus,

298
00:11:11,896 --> 00:11:12,995
- Ok, jump height is an ability,

299
00:11:12,995 --> 00:11:14,915
you are correct.

300
00:11:14,915 --> 00:11:18,676
- [Voiceover] It depends on muscles

301
00:11:18,676 --> 00:11:20,275
versus structure.

302
00:11:20,275 --> 00:11:23,195
- Ok, so it's depending more on muscle

303
00:11:23,195 --> 00:11:25,785
as opposed to structure of your foot.

304
00:11:25,995 --> 00:11:28,715
- I remember the class
like could already reach

305
00:11:28,715 --> 00:11:32,055
so that played to our height
and the proportions of our body

306
00:11:32,055 --> 00:11:35,795
and then in turn determined
how high I could jump in itself

307
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:39,055
so I guess with your foot,

308
00:11:39,055 --> 00:11:40,095
depending on what size shoe you have,

309
00:11:40,095 --> 00:11:42,755
that in turn kinda determines your height

310
00:11:42,755 --> 00:11:44,415
because of the proportions of your body.

311
00:11:44,415 --> 00:11:45,815
- By having them reach, guys.

312
00:11:45,815 --> 00:11:47,396
What was your point?

313
00:11:47,396 --> 00:11:48,715
When you set up your lab?

314
00:11:48,715 --> 00:11:50,095
Cause I remember distinctly
talking to you guys

315
00:11:50,095 --> 00:11:53,055
you said you're gonna
have them make a mark

316
00:11:53,055 --> 00:11:54,495
and then they're gonna jump.

317
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,135
- [Voiceover] Well it's
so that the taller people

318
00:11:56,135 --> 00:11:57,795
didn't just automatically jump higher

319
00:11:57,795 --> 00:11:59,955
than everybody who was shorter than them.

320
00:11:59,955 --> 00:12:01,835
Cause then it's already the distance,

321
00:12:01,835 --> 00:12:04,055
like how high they can
actuall jump as part of

322
00:12:04,055 --> 00:12:04,969
how tall they are.

323
00:12:04,969 --> 00:12:05,610
- Ok.

324
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,289
So you're saying that
by measuring the height,

325
00:12:07,289 --> 00:12:09,189
you factored that idea in.

326
00:12:09,189 --> 00:12:12,189
So Mr. Bieber isn't totally outjumping

327
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,269
say Adrian who's a little bit shorter.

328
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:16,449
So you already kind of factored that in.

329
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:18,763
Why did we not see a connection though?

330
00:12:18,763 --> 00:12:20,693
Megan said

331
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:24,233
jump height deals with

332
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,794
more muscle mass maybe?

333
00:12:31,503 --> 00:12:35,193
opposed to foot.

334
00:12:38,203 --> 00:12:40,283
- [Voiceover] Cause everybody
kind of jumped the same.

335
00:12:40,283 --> 00:12:42,103
There wasn't any variation.

336
00:12:42,103 --> 00:12:44,923
So it didn't really matter
what foot size you have.

337
00:12:44,923 --> 00:12:46,493
- Ok.

338
00:12:46,903 --> 00:12:48,543
So when you say jump the same you mean

339
00:12:48,543 --> 00:12:50,883
achieve the same scores roughly?

340
00:12:50,883 --> 00:12:52,463
They found the same general area

341
00:12:52,463 --> 00:12:54,123
in that same general pattern?

342
00:12:54,123 --> 00:12:56,183
- [Voiceover] That's why theres a trend.

343
00:12:56,183 --> 00:12:57,803
It was all in just one spot.

344
00:12:57,803 --> 00:12:59,723
- So in general when
we're looking at fossils,

345
00:12:59,723 --> 00:13:02,083
would jump height be one

346
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,003
that we could solely predict then

347
00:13:04,003 --> 00:13:05,603
based on the length of the foot fossil?

348
00:13:05,603 --> 00:13:05,996
- [Voiceover] No.

349
00:13:05,996 --> 00:13:07,236
- Probably not.

350
00:13:07,236 --> 00:13:08,916
Which kind of makes sense anyway.

351
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:09,596
Group two.

352
00:13:09,596 --> 00:13:10,556
Group two didn't get their data plotted

353
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,036
but let's take a peek.

354
00:13:12,036 --> 00:13:14,916
They did foot fossil length and height.

355
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,416
If you were to make an assumption,

356
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:18,796
if there was a relationship,

357
00:13:18,796 --> 00:13:21,466
what would you all assume
would be the relationship?

358
00:13:21,816 --> 00:13:23,606
Direct, why direct?

359
00:13:23,716 --> 00:13:25,016
- [Voiceover] Cause it's proportional.

360
00:13:25,016 --> 00:13:27,266
- Bingo, bodies are proportional.

361
00:13:29,656 --> 00:13:32,546
You're gonna see that pattern
as we work through this.

362
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,986
Proportional, ok?

363
00:13:35,396 --> 00:13:37,286
Average stride.

364
00:13:40,076 --> 00:13:41,256
- [Voiceover] We didn't really get a graph

365
00:13:41,256 --> 00:13:42,936
but it didn't look very direct.

366
00:13:42,936 --> 00:13:44,536
It was a little more indirect.

367
00:13:44,536 --> 00:13:46,656
- More indirect?

368
00:13:46,656 --> 00:13:47,396
- [Voiceover] I think so.

369
00:13:47,396 --> 00:13:48,276
- Like this?

370
00:13:48,276 --> 00:13:49,216
So you're saying longer?

371
00:13:49,216 --> 00:13:50,736
- No, no.

372
00:13:50,736 --> 00:13:52,556
Like there wasn't really a pattern.

373
00:13:52,556 --> 00:13:54,416
- Oh so your'e saying no relationship?

374
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,026
- Yeah.

375
00:14:05,116 --> 00:14:07,426
- Does that make sense?

376
00:14:09,596 --> 00:14:10,389
Alana says no.

377
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:12,339
I saw this.

378
00:14:12,669 --> 00:14:13,349
Why?

379
00:14:13,349 --> 00:14:16,869
- Well just based on
the proportional idea,

380
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:20,549
if your height and hand
span is proportional

381
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:22,289
to your foot length

382
00:14:22,289 --> 00:14:25,729
then your legs then,
the length of your legs

383
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:27,909
are also proportional to your foot lenghts

384
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,829
and the length of your stride

385
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:31,829
based on the length of your legs.

386
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,069
- So you're arguing that
you think we should see

387
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:35,602
what kind of relationship?

388
00:14:35,602 --> 00:14:36,762
- [Voiceover] I think, a direct.

389
00:14:36,762 --> 00:14:37,682
- You would say direct.

390
00:14:37,682 --> 00:14:39,302
Claire and then Barrett.

391
00:14:39,302 --> 00:14:41,662
- Well, cause we had the same thing

392
00:14:41,662 --> 00:14:44,162
but a little bit different.

393
00:14:44,162 --> 00:14:47,992
And, well, backwards.

394
00:14:48,462 --> 00:14:50,022
It couldn't really be that accurate

395
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:54,162
because it wasn't a very long distance.

396
00:14:54,162 --> 00:14:59,162
and people had different ideas of walking.

397
00:14:59,662 --> 00:15:01,382
Some people were trying
to take larger steps

398
00:15:01,382 --> 00:15:04,302
or being more careful or walking slower.

399
00:15:04,302 --> 00:15:06,162
It wasn't just like an average.

400
00:15:06,162 --> 00:15:08,182
- So you are saying based on the idea

401
00:15:08,182 --> 00:15:08,962
of body proportions

402
00:15:08,962 --> 00:15:10,542
that we should see a direct.

403
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,602
- But you're saying, you agree
that we should see direct

404
00:15:12,602 --> 00:15:14,002
- [Voiceover] No we
should see an indirect.

405
00:15:14,002 --> 00:15:15,422
- An indirect?

406
00:15:15,422 --> 00:15:17,962
Longer leg, shorter strides?

407
00:15:17,962 --> 00:15:18,702
Direct.

408
00:15:18,702 --> 00:15:20,202
Longer legs, longer strides.

409
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:21,742
But you're arguing that the way maybe

410
00:15:21,742 --> 00:15:22,908
that the experiment was set up

411
00:15:22,908 --> 00:15:25,108
didn't lend itself to collect proper data?

412
00:15:25,108 --> 00:15:25,708
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

413
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:28,048
- Ok, good point.

414
00:15:28,048 --> 00:15:29,068
- I think it was also just,

415
00:15:29,068 --> 00:15:31,588
I was asked just to
walk like I normally do

416
00:15:31,588 --> 00:15:33,961
and I don't take very long strides.

417
00:15:33,961 --> 00:15:37,401
I kind of walk really slow

418
00:15:37,401 --> 00:15:39,121
so my strides are very small

419
00:15:39,121 --> 00:15:40,561
when I just normally walk.

420
00:15:40,561 --> 00:15:42,181
- Ok so you almost felt
it was kinda awkward

421
00:15:42,181 --> 00:15:44,721
like how am I supposed to walk.

422
00:15:44,721 --> 00:15:46,361
So maybe we could have captured it

423
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:47,221
in a different manner.

424
00:15:47,221 --> 00:15:48,341
We could have designed the experiment

425
00:15:48,341 --> 00:15:49,901
if you're already walking

426
00:15:49,901 --> 00:15:51,301
and then you walk past the line

427
00:15:51,301 --> 00:15:54,481
and maybe keep carrying
through that stride.

428
00:15:54,481 --> 00:15:55,841
- I think no relationship is accurate

429
00:15:55,841 --> 00:15:58,661
because my stride length I would assume

430
00:15:58,661 --> 00:16:00,281
is based on how long my legs are.

431
00:16:00,281 --> 00:16:01,581
I have very long legs

432
00:16:01,581 --> 00:16:04,641
but everybody knows I have a small foot.

433
00:16:04,641 --> 00:16:07,941
I mean I'm still proportional
like I'm normal sized

434
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:11,161
but my legs are just a lot
longer than anything else.

435
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:12,621
- Ok so you're kinda arguing that maybe

436
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:13,881
you're not always going to fall

437
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:16,321
into every part of your body

438
00:16:16,321 --> 00:16:18,961
being specifically proportional.

439
00:16:18,961 --> 00:16:20,641
- There was a lot where some people

440
00:16:20,641 --> 00:16:23,974
with kinda smaller feet had
relatively longer strides

441
00:16:23,974 --> 00:16:26,634
and some people with big
feet had smaller strides.

442
00:16:26,634 --> 00:16:28,714
It was kind of just all over the place.

443
00:16:28,714 --> 00:16:29,854
- Ok.

444
00:16:29,854 --> 00:16:32,324
So what are we labeling this?

445
00:16:41,214 --> 00:16:42,314
Direct, question mark,

446
00:16:42,314 --> 00:16:43,767
no relationship, question mark.

447
00:16:43,767 --> 00:16:45,087
- [Voiceover] If we're basing
it on the data that they had,

448
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,407
I'd say no relationship.

449
00:16:46,407 --> 00:16:47,347
- Ok, if we're basing it on the data,

450
00:16:47,347 --> 00:16:48,327
even though we didn't plot it.

451
00:16:48,327 --> 00:16:50,547
Looking at their actual data,

452
00:16:50,547 --> 00:16:52,667
we would say no relationship.

453
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:55,447
Could there be a point
where we could argue

454
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:59,167
that we might potentially
see a direct relationship?

455
00:16:59,167 --> 00:16:59,947
Yes.

456
00:16:59,947 --> 00:17:04,127
So for our data collection,
we'll leave no relationship.

457
00:17:04,127 --> 00:17:06,607
But keeping in mind that very valid point

458
00:17:06,607 --> 00:17:08,607
that if' you're gonna have longer feet,

459
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,187
more than likely you have longer legs.

460
00:17:10,187 --> 00:17:12,107
More than likely you're
gonna take longer strides.

461
00:17:12,107 --> 00:17:13,627
But inherent as Claire said

462
00:17:13,627 --> 00:17:15,947
in the kind of setup of the experiment,

463
00:17:15,947 --> 00:17:18,637
that maybe that didn't shine through.

464
00:17:19,947 --> 00:17:22,167
Group three.

465
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:25,717
Hair color versus foot fossil length.

466
00:17:25,867 --> 00:17:27,527
No relationship.

467
00:17:27,527 --> 00:17:29,297
Is this shocking to anyone?

468
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:30,467
- Yes.

469
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,857
Even though they had
a great numeric scale?

470
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,667
Why?

471
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:36,927
Why no relationship Bubs?

472
00:17:36,927 --> 00:17:39,497
- [Voiceover] I didn't have
anything to do with it.

473
00:17:39,907 --> 00:17:41,067
- [Voiceover] It's like a gene base.

474
00:17:41,067 --> 00:17:42,547
- Hair color is determined by

475
00:17:42,547 --> 00:17:43,347
- Your DNA.

476
00:17:43,347 --> 00:17:44,687
- Does your DNA determine
your foot length?

477
00:17:44,687 --> 00:17:45,867
- [Voiceover] Yes it does.

478
00:17:45,867 --> 00:17:46,807
- [Voiceover] But not the same gene.

479
00:17:46,807 --> 00:17:48,182
- Ok but not the same gene.

480
00:17:48,182 --> 00:17:49,482
Ok, now you're getting very technical,

481
00:17:49,482 --> 00:17:50,222
I appreciate that.

482
00:17:50,222 --> 00:17:51,652
Yes sir.

483
00:17:51,762 --> 00:17:54,852
- I think its partially
because (murmuring)

484
00:17:56,502 --> 00:17:58,842
- Would you think that
there would be a connection?

485
00:17:58,842 --> 00:18:01,412
Like smaller foot, lighter hair?

486
00:18:01,682 --> 00:18:04,202
- [Voiceover] Well go on
for like racial background

487
00:18:04,202 --> 00:18:06,982
like your ethnicity,

488
00:18:06,982 --> 00:18:10,822
Some ethnic groups are generally taller

489
00:18:10,822 --> 00:18:13,742
and have bigger feet than the others.

490
00:18:13,742 --> 00:18:16,222
- Ok so maybe you're
arguing the sample size?

491
00:18:16,222 --> 00:18:19,022
The idea that we were to survey globally,

492
00:18:19,022 --> 00:18:21,302
maybe we could see
certain ethnic backgrounds

493
00:18:21,302 --> 00:18:24,562
that tend to be taller,
would have different,

494
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:25,502
I could see that.

495
00:18:25,502 --> 00:18:26,322
Yeah.

496
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:29,402
- Well, I think it has
nothing to do with it

497
00:18:29,402 --> 00:18:31,722
because I'm six feet tall

498
00:18:31,722 --> 00:18:33,282
and Franco's under five feet

499
00:18:33,282 --> 00:18:34,422
and we both have dark hair.

500
00:18:34,422 --> 00:18:35,702
So obviously.

501
00:18:35,702 --> 00:18:37,622
- [Voiceover] Yeah it's
got nothing to do with it.

502
00:18:37,622 --> 00:18:40,802
- Ok so on face value,
looking at hair color.

503
00:18:40,802 --> 00:18:44,202
Would we say that foot fossil length

504
00:18:44,202 --> 00:18:46,942
would be a good indicator of hair color?

505
00:18:46,942 --> 00:18:47,782
- [students] No.

506
00:18:47,782 --> 00:18:48,662
- Ok, I would agree.

507
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:50,102
There's no connection there.

508
00:18:50,102 --> 00:18:52,012
No connection.

509
00:18:58,682 --> 00:19:00,302
My question though, is.

510
00:19:00,302 --> 00:19:03,322
There are organisms
that lived in the past.

511
00:19:03,322 --> 00:19:08,012
And we have very, I would say.

512
00:19:08,302 --> 00:19:12,582
We have certain ideas about
what their coloring was like.

513
00:19:12,582 --> 00:19:14,382
How would we come up with that, then?

514
00:19:14,382 --> 00:19:16,682
How would scientists
come up with that idea?

515
00:19:16,682 --> 00:19:18,482
Of the coloring of certain organisms?

516
00:19:18,482 --> 00:19:19,142
Caroline.

517
00:19:19,142 --> 00:19:22,882
- Well if you say that lizards would be,

518
00:19:22,882 --> 00:19:24,242
or dinosaurs would be green,

519
00:19:24,242 --> 00:19:25,902
it would help them blend
into their environment

520
00:19:25,902 --> 00:19:27,842
so you would assume it would be good then

521
00:19:27,842 --> 00:19:29,983
to be green but you don't know for sure.

522
00:19:29,983 --> 00:19:31,782
- So you're thinking
evolutionary connection.

523
00:19:31,782 --> 00:19:33,462
It'll be beneficial for
them to be able to blend

524
00:19:33,462 --> 00:19:34,222
in their environment,

525
00:19:34,222 --> 00:19:34,682
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

526
00:19:34,682 --> 00:19:35,902
- Yes Claire.

527
00:19:35,902 --> 00:19:38,302
- I think you also said a few days ago.

528
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,902
About how you're supposed to assume

529
00:19:39,902 --> 00:19:41,742
everything in the past
works how it does now.

530
00:19:41,742 --> 00:19:44,062
So if you see some type
of reptile in the past

531
00:19:44,062 --> 00:19:46,502
it probably looks something
like a reptile now.

532
00:19:46,502 --> 00:19:48,362
- Ok, so again you're doing
that evolutionary connection

533
00:19:48,362 --> 00:19:50,682
to modern day relatives saying

534
00:19:50,682 --> 00:19:53,202
well if they appear to be this color,

535
00:19:53,202 --> 00:19:55,462
possibly due to some benefit,

536
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:56,862
we can assume in the past.

537
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,792
Good, nice job.
