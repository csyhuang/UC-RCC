1
00:00:00,962 --> 00:00:04,333
- [Voiceover] Okay, so tell us
a little background about Ed.

2
00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:08,535
- Alright, well it showed
that he had chest pains

3
00:00:08,535 --> 00:00:10,828
and also his vital signs showed that

4
00:00:10,828 --> 00:00:12,642
his heart was very weak so we thought

5
00:00:12,642 --> 00:00:17,079
he was having a heart attack
and also he was unconscious.

6
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:19,212
- [Voiceover] Okay, so
because of his complaining

7
00:00:19,212 --> 00:00:23,137
of chest pains, be subtle
from conscious or no?

8
00:00:23,137 --> 00:00:26,369
- He called and he
talked to the paramedics,

9
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:29,701
but it also said he was obese and so that

10
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:30,710
could contribute to it as well.

11
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:31,990
- [Voiceover] How do you
suppose that contributes

12
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,499
to having a cardiac condition?

13
00:00:35,499 --> 00:00:37,845
- Generally, it can clog your arteries.

14
00:00:37,845 --> 00:00:39,509
- [Voiceover] What can clog your arteries?

15
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:41,066
- The fat that builds up.

16
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:42,112
- [Voiceover] Okay, from being obese?

17
00:00:42,112 --> 00:00:42,837
- Yeah.

18
00:00:42,837 --> 00:00:45,109
- [Voiceover] Okay, is
that one of the, I guess,

19
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:47,594
physical signs that someone may

20
00:00:47,594 --> 00:00:49,013
have a heart condition?

21
00:00:49,013 --> 00:00:49,983
- Yes.

22
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:52,095
- [Voiceover] Okay, okay, alright.

23
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:54,719
Go ahead.

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,225
- It is also his blood pressure.

25
00:00:57,225 --> 00:00:59,039
It said it's at variable levels,

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,385
so that means his heart
isn't working properly

27
00:01:01,385 --> 00:01:04,340
or consistently. So, that means
it could also contribute

28
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:09,340
to a circulatory system,
it could damage it.

29
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,830
It's also another sign of a heart attack.

30
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,262
- [Voiceover] Okay, so the variable heart,

31
00:01:15,262 --> 00:01:17,725
or actually the variable blood pressure.

32
00:01:17,725 --> 00:01:20,029
And some of you had questions about that

33
00:01:20,029 --> 00:01:21,373
when you were doing your research.

34
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:23,389
You were wondering what
did this variable mean

35
00:01:23,389 --> 00:01:26,290
and I think what you
said is exactly right,

36
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,805
it's not normal, okay.

37
00:01:27,805 --> 00:01:29,031
They state the variable meaning,

38
00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:31,474
it wasn't working how it should.

39
00:01:31,474 --> 00:01:36,474
Okay, so sounds like this
guy had some definite issues

40
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,159
both with his vital signs
and with his history.

41
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,828
So, tell us a little bit why
you ranked him number one

42
00:01:44,828 --> 00:01:49,828
compared to let's say, you ranked, who was

43
00:01:50,545 --> 00:01:55,545
your number, hmm?

44
00:01:55,835 --> 00:01:58,022
Who was your second, who proceeded him?

45
00:01:58,022 --> 00:01:59,654
Nelson.

46
00:01:59,654 --> 00:02:03,045
Nelson, so you got Ed ranked over Nelson

47
00:02:03,045 --> 00:02:04,133
where some other people had Nelson

48
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:06,554
ranked number one, so, what do you think?

49
00:02:06,554 --> 00:02:09,594
- Well, he's unconscious now so that means

50
00:02:09,594 --> 00:02:11,941
his heart attack started some time ago

51
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:13,498
and once you have a heart
attack you need treatment

52
00:02:13,498 --> 00:02:15,812
immediately, and since
his heart attacks aren't

53
00:02:15,812 --> 00:02:17,786
his title, he needs it.

54
00:02:17,786 --> 00:02:22,786
I think it's important
to see, to get treatment.

55
00:02:25,476 --> 00:02:26,329
- [Voiceover] To get medical care?

56
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:26,980
- Yeah.

57
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,721
- [Voiceover] Okay, if
he doesn't get treatment

58
00:02:29,721 --> 00:02:32,814
what do you think could happen?

59
00:02:32,814 --> 00:02:34,787
- Probably, he'll die from the heart attack

60
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:38,574
if he doesn't get treatment or paralyzed.

61
00:02:38,574 --> 00:02:39,619
- [Voiceover] What do
you mean by paralysis?

62
00:02:39,619 --> 00:02:42,915
Why do you think he
could become paralyzed?

63
00:02:42,915 --> 00:02:44,376
- I'm not sure if it's a
stroke or a heart attack

64
00:02:44,376 --> 00:02:47,672
if you go through it if
you get paralyzed or not.

65
00:02:47,672 --> 00:02:48,621
- [Voiceover] Okay, you're
not sure if it's a stroke

66
00:02:48,621 --> 00:02:50,808
or a heart attack that
leads to possible paralysis?

67
00:02:50,808 --> 00:02:51,554
- Yeah.

68
00:02:51,554 --> 00:02:54,573
- [Voiceover] Anybody
like to comment on that?

69
00:02:54,573 --> 00:02:56,013
Question, go ahead Jordan.

70
00:02:56,013 --> 00:02:56,845
- It's a stroke.

71
00:02:56,845 --> 00:02:59,426
It has a brain clot
and then that will cause

72
00:02:59,426 --> 00:03:03,014
partial, I can't say it.

73
00:03:03,014 --> 00:03:03,468
- Paralysis.

74
00:03:03,468 --> 00:03:05,367
- Yeah that word, but heart attack.

75
00:03:05,367 --> 00:03:08,876
You could have a heart attack after
that using different parts,

76
00:03:08,876 --> 00:03:11,318
not paralysis.

77
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:12,129
- [Voiceover] Good point.

78
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:17,129
So, Jordan says having a stroke
can cause paralysis.

79
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,464
What system is being affected
when you have a stroke

80
00:03:22,464 --> 00:03:23,766
that could lead to paralysis?

81
00:03:23,766 --> 00:03:25,291
What system in our body is that?

82
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:26,965
- [Voiceover] Nervous system.

83
00:03:26,965 --> 00:03:28,427
- [Voiceover] Yeah, nervous system.

84
00:03:28,427 --> 00:03:30,176
Okay, understand?

85
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,893
Doban, Jake, got that?

86
00:03:31,893 --> 00:03:33,120
Alright, so you guys have Ed,

87
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,319
you ranked him number
one and then you ranked

88
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,874
Nelson number two along with quite a few

89
00:03:40,874 --> 00:03:41,684
other people.

90
00:03:41,684 --> 00:03:44,287
It looks like we have
some consistencies there.

91
00:03:44,287 --> 00:03:47,519
Let's look at group B.

92
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,441
You had Nelson ranked number one,

93
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:54,580
but then you did have
Ed ranked number three.

94
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,171
So, you didn't think Ed
was as serious having

95
00:03:57,171 --> 00:04:00,126
this heart condition compared to Nelson

96
00:04:00,126 --> 00:04:02,419
and/or Monique?

97
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:06,600
- Well, Nelson and Monique had the most

98
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,603
critical vital signs.

99
00:04:07,603 --> 00:04:09,715
They seemed the most, the worst,

100
00:04:09,715 --> 00:04:12,339
because their temperatures
were in the critical zone

101
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:17,138
and above where they started,
so they were overheated

102
00:04:17,138 --> 00:04:22,138
and they probably had
heatstroke or hyperthermic.

103
00:04:23,207 --> 00:04:27,474
So, they were not, and
they were dehydrated too.

104
00:04:27,474 --> 00:04:28,796
When your body starts to dehydrate

105
00:04:28,796 --> 00:04:33,212
that's not, it really
messes up all your systems.

106
00:04:33,212 --> 00:04:34,374
So they were...

107
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:38,300
- [Voiceover] What systems?

108
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,827
- Cardiovascular system,
the respiratory system,

109
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:42,918
the immune system, everything's
just being attacked here

110
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:47,600
because with Eve, let me see this,

111
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,947
his heart rate was way below normal

112
00:04:49,947 --> 00:04:51,973
and that's the cardiovascular system.

113
00:04:51,973 --> 00:04:55,291
His temperature was completely 109

114
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,594
from all the heat from the canyon.

115
00:04:57,594 --> 00:04:58,917
- [Voiceover] What's the
normal body temperature

116
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:00,634
for that of a human?

117
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:04,463
- The normal temperature
is 98.6 and he's at 109.

118
00:05:04,463 --> 00:05:05,925
- [Voiceover] He's at 109 folks.

119
00:05:05,925 --> 00:05:07,930
Okay, I think this was one of our hypers

120
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,455
if you remember, Nelson and Monique

121
00:05:09,455 --> 00:05:12,313
were our two hypers that were airlifted

122
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:13,593
into the hospital, okay?

123
00:05:13,593 --> 00:05:14,820
So, he's at 109.

124
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,633
- Isn't this like the immune system?

125
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:17,540
- [Voiceover] Mmhmm.

126
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,396
- Yeah, so that's the immune system

127
00:05:19,396 --> 00:05:21,529
and then his breathing rate is way down.

128
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:26,158
It's at 10 respirations per minute.

129
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:27,193
- [Voiceover] 10 respirations per minute?

130
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:30,606
- And the normal's like 20,
so he's down to half.

131
00:05:30,606 --> 00:05:35,203
So, I think that his vital signs
were way more out of whack.

132
00:05:35,203 --> 00:05:38,136
- [Voiceover] Did you count
in on the blood pressure?

133
00:05:38,136 --> 00:05:40,504
- The blood pressure?

134
00:05:40,504 --> 00:05:43,309
- It's really low and that means

135
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:46,605
his circulatory system's not working right

136
00:05:46,605 --> 00:05:47,565
which means blood's not getting

137
00:05:47,565 --> 00:05:48,951
everywhere it needs to be.

138
00:05:48,951 --> 00:05:52,695
Which means he could end up having,

139
00:05:52,695 --> 00:05:54,967
I don't actually know if
it would lead to a stroke,

140
00:05:54,967 --> 00:05:57,937
but like if everything's not
getting blood everywhere,

141
00:05:57,937 --> 00:05:59,244
his brain might not get enough blood.

142
00:05:59,244 --> 00:06:01,942
He could have brain damage
or something like that.

143
00:06:01,942 --> 00:06:04,076
- [Voiceover] It's
interesting she said stroke,

144
00:06:04,076 --> 00:06:06,006
talking about Nelson.

145
00:06:06,006 --> 00:06:11,006
Was Nelson having any type
of nervous system symptoms?

146
00:06:11,136 --> 00:06:12,203
- [Voiceover] Seizures.

147
00:06:12,203 --> 00:06:13,248
- [Voiceover] It was seizures.

148
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,336
- [Voiceover] He was having seizures.

149
00:06:14,336 --> 00:06:16,267
Is that, is a seizure an event that occurs

150
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:19,360
as a result of something going wrong with

151
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,192
the nervous system?

152
00:06:20,192 --> 00:06:22,560
Absolutely.

153
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,162
Think about all the
systems you just named.

154
00:06:25,162 --> 00:06:28,810
What's going on with Nelson?

155
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:33,810
Cardiac, nervous, circulatory, immune.

156
00:06:34,378 --> 00:06:35,839
- Dehydration.

157
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,700
- Entire (mumbles)
bringing in dehydration.

158
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,689
Digestive, not enough water.

159
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:47,337
This guy is having a rough time, isn't he?

160
00:06:47,337 --> 00:06:50,121
So, if you're pretty confident
in why you ranked him

161
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:50,793
number one.

162
00:06:50,793 --> 00:06:51,774
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

163
00:06:51,774 --> 00:06:54,771
- Okay, comments?

164
00:06:54,771 --> 00:06:56,435
Anybody?

165
00:06:56,435 --> 00:06:58,600
- Well, the reason we ranked him three

166
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,917
was because we thought
that he was most likely

167
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:05,170
going to die and so we
thought that his daughter

168
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,858
was a higher priority because...

169
00:07:07,858 --> 00:07:08,445
- [Voiceover] Monique?

170
00:07:08,445 --> 00:07:12,338
- Yeah, because she has a
better chance of survival.

171
00:07:12,338 --> 00:07:13,853
- [Voiceover] So, you ranked him three,

172
00:07:13,853 --> 00:07:18,853
and it's interesting you
said, "We thought he was

173
00:07:19,516 --> 00:07:20,263
going to die."

174
00:07:20,263 --> 00:07:22,609
He was maybe beyond that point of help.

175
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,420
- Yeah.

176
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,716
- [Voiceover] Okay, so
why'd you rank him three?

177
00:07:26,716 --> 00:07:29,852
Why not rank him seven?

178
00:07:29,852 --> 00:07:32,768
- [Voiceover] Well, what if he has a shot?

179
00:07:32,768 --> 00:07:33,542
- [Voiceover] He's got a chance.

180
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:34,470
- Yeah.

181
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:39,470
- [Voiceover] Okay, he
has a chance over Mark.

182
00:07:39,515 --> 00:07:42,064
- That wound to the chest.

183
00:07:42,064 --> 00:07:43,205
- [Voiceover] Yeah, because Mark got shot

184
00:07:43,205 --> 00:07:44,475
in the chest, didn't he?

185
00:07:44,475 --> 00:07:45,616
- You'd save him though.

186
00:07:45,616 --> 00:07:46,544
- [Voiceover] It's interesting you said

187
00:07:46,544 --> 00:07:48,058
if he has a shot.

188
00:07:48,058 --> 00:07:49,701
Mark's the one that got shot.

189
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:50,725
(laughing)

190
00:07:50,725 --> 00:07:54,181
- He was more stable
than Nelson was though.

191
00:07:54,181 --> 00:07:54,714
Mark was.

192
00:07:54,714 --> 00:07:55,674
- [Voiceover] Mark was more stable?

193
00:07:55,674 --> 00:07:56,207
- Yeah.

194
00:07:56,207 --> 00:07:57,114
- [Voiceover] Interesting,
you're bringing in

195
00:07:57,114 --> 00:07:58,916
the whole fact of, now you're triaging it.

196
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,380
You're saying okay, Mark's
a little bit more stable

197
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,937
even though he's got this gun shot

198
00:08:02,937 --> 00:08:04,516
and they were kind of vague in what

199
00:08:04,516 --> 00:08:05,519
they said about the gun shot.

200
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,398
We don't know what kind of gun it was.

201
00:08:08,398 --> 00:08:10,436
- But I feel like if you rank him a three,

202
00:08:10,436 --> 00:08:13,689
he's at such a critical
position that it's either

203
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:16,686
you rank him one, because he
needs treatment right away

204
00:08:16,686 --> 00:08:19,651
or he's going to die.

205
00:08:19,651 --> 00:08:21,166
- [Voiceover] Okay, so you're saying,

206
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:24,867
he's got to be one, based
upon all the symptoms,

207
00:08:24,867 --> 00:08:27,416
based upon his vital signs, the condition

208
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,997
that he was brought in.

209
00:08:29,997 --> 00:08:31,576
If you're not going to rank him one

210
00:08:31,576 --> 00:08:32,781
you might as well just let him die.

211
00:08:32,781 --> 00:08:33,432
Is that what you're saying?

212
00:08:33,432 --> 00:08:34,381
- Or early on.

213
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,354
Like, you can't wait too long, I guess.

214
00:08:36,354 --> 00:08:40,738
- You've got to rank him
one to three, otherwise.

215
00:08:40,738 --> 00:08:42,807
- [Voiceover] So he's
like, what group were you?

216
00:08:42,807 --> 00:08:44,226
- We're F.

217
00:08:44,226 --> 00:08:47,319
- [Voiceover] You're F, so you had him,

218
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:48,108
okay you had him at a two.

219
00:08:48,108 --> 00:08:48,599
- Yeah.

220
00:08:48,599 --> 00:08:50,007
- [Voiceover] Okay, alright, 
so you're saying

221
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:50,934
he's a top three?

222
00:08:50,934 --> 00:08:52,902
- Yeah, especially.

223
00:08:52,902 --> 00:08:54,081
- [Voiceover] You had a hand up.

224
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:55,894
- Oh, I was just agreeing with him.

225
00:08:55,894 --> 00:08:57,569
If we thought we had any
chance we should be like

226
00:08:57,569 --> 00:08:59,489
let's not waste any time to finish this

227
00:08:59,489 --> 00:09:02,326
either that or just make him seven.

228
00:09:02,326 --> 00:09:04,278
- [Voiceover] Okay, good point.

229
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:05,483
Brian?

230
00:09:05,483 --> 00:09:07,339
- Well, were were thinking...

231
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:08,576
- [Voiceover] Speak up
a little bit please.

232
00:09:08,576 --> 00:09:11,125
- Well, we were thinking that even though

233
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:13,098
he's unconscious and having seizures

234
00:09:13,098 --> 00:09:15,818
he was a crooked patient,
but compared to like

235
00:09:15,818 --> 00:09:17,930
the other ones like Albert or Mark,

236
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:21,013
his symptoms weren't
that of like great danger

237
00:09:21,013 --> 00:09:24,500
as the others, and even
though his body temperature

238
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,636
was 109, that could
have been because he was

239
00:09:27,636 --> 00:09:29,929
going through heat stroke,
but now that he's in Asprins

240
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:31,764
they're a cool environment.

241
00:09:31,764 --> 00:09:33,342
- [Voiceover] You bring up heatstroke.

242
00:09:33,342 --> 00:09:34,900
Why do you think he's
going through a heatstroke?

243
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,916
- Well, I don't know,
because he was unconscious,

244
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:40,425
and they said he was
dehydrated and everything.

245
00:09:40,425 --> 00:09:43,912
Well dehydration can be due to heatstroke

246
00:09:43,912 --> 00:09:47,411
and like I also figured it'd be heatstroke

247
00:09:47,411 --> 00:09:50,013
because his daughter...

248
00:09:50,013 --> 00:09:50,643
- [Voiceover] Monique.

249
00:09:50,643 --> 00:09:53,683
- Yeah, I'm sorry, Monique,
it said that she was dizzy

250
00:09:53,683 --> 00:09:56,104
and nauseous and if she
was in the same environment

251
00:09:56,104 --> 00:09:59,815
as Nelson was, then it's more likely that

252
00:09:59,815 --> 00:10:02,183
their symptoms are close to each other

253
00:10:02,183 --> 00:10:03,975
because if she's going
through like nauseous

254
00:10:03,975 --> 00:10:06,268
and like dizziness then it's
most likely that he is too

255
00:10:06,268 --> 00:10:09,938
because they're both in
the same environment.

256
00:10:09,938 --> 00:10:10,823
- [Voiceover] Very interesting.

257
00:10:10,823 --> 00:10:13,329
I want to come back to this point.

258
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:14,279
Ryan you've got your hand up.

259
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,718
What were you going to say?

260
00:10:15,718 --> 00:10:17,297
- I was just going to say that Monique

261
00:10:17,297 --> 00:10:20,710
has the same symptoms for heatstroke.

262
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,193
- [Voiceover] You're exactly right.

263
00:10:22,193 --> 00:10:24,593
Now my mind instantly goes somewhere here.

264
00:10:24,593 --> 00:10:25,489
Jordan, your hand was up first.

265
00:10:25,489 --> 00:10:28,326
- I was just going to say
that since their temperature's

266
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:30,299
so high, they're probably in shock

267
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:35,299
and always their temperature
is almost basically fatal

268
00:10:35,728 --> 00:10:39,226
levels, so just putting them,
they're going from a really

269
00:10:39,226 --> 00:10:41,317
hot environment to a
really cold environment.

270
00:10:41,317 --> 00:10:44,165
Or really cool compared
to where they were.

271
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:45,935
If they'll put them into
more shock which can

272
00:10:45,935 --> 00:10:48,463
also be fatal, which
means they're not exactly

273
00:10:48,463 --> 00:10:49,839
just because they're in a hospital,

274
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,044
doesn't mean they're necessarily going

275
00:10:51,044 --> 00:10:52,623
to get better right away.

276
00:10:52,623 --> 00:10:54,852
- [Voiceover] Okay, obviously
they need some treatment.

277
00:10:54,852 --> 00:10:56,591
You don't want to go from
one extreme to the other,

278
00:10:56,591 --> 00:10:59,744
but do you agree that they
need to be cooled down

279
00:10:59,744 --> 00:11:00,420
quite a bit?

280
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,214
- Yeah.

281
00:11:01,214 --> 00:11:02,088
- [Voiceover] They need to get cooled down

282
00:11:02,088 --> 00:11:03,688
and what else do they need?

283
00:11:03,688 --> 00:11:04,046
- Water.

284
00:11:04,046 --> 00:11:05,603
- [Voiceover] Water,
lots of water, correct?

285
00:11:05,603 --> 00:11:07,086
Yes?

286
00:11:07,086 --> 00:11:09,688
- You can't really say
that Monique's symptoms

287
00:11:09,688 --> 00:11:12,270
can apply for Albert too because Monique

288
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,072
was having like an allergic reaction to

289
00:11:14,072 --> 00:11:15,352
the bee sting.

290
00:11:15,352 --> 00:11:19,416
So, that's probably what most
of the symptoms are from.

291
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,112
- [Voiceover] We forgot
about the bee sting.

292
00:11:21,112 --> 00:11:24,568
It says she's dizzy,
nauseousness, has cracked lips,

293
00:11:24,568 --> 00:11:25,826
is having difficulty breathing, has a rash

294
00:11:25,826 --> 00:11:28,909
on her legs and stomach.

295
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:31,511
Okay, she got stung by a bee.

296
00:11:31,511 --> 00:11:35,831
- Like, you were saying,
the reason we put Monique

297
00:11:35,831 --> 00:11:38,967
as number one besides
experiencing possible

298
00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:40,759
heatstroke, we also have her experiencing

299
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:43,564
a very bad allergic reaction to the bee.

300
00:11:43,564 --> 00:11:46,625
It shows here that with
the difficulty breathing,

301
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:50,550
the bee sting, her body is having a very

302
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,939
poor reaction to the bee sting

303
00:11:52,939 --> 00:11:55,990
and that if left
untreated for longer times

304
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:59,041
without getting pills and
stuff like that or EpiPen.

305
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:02,051
- Getting what?

306
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:04,399
- [Voiceover] EpiPen.

307
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,457
- [Voiceover] You know what it is?

308
00:12:05,457 --> 00:12:06,775
- [Voiceover] Just say EpiPen.

309
00:12:06,775 --> 00:12:07,468
- [Voiceover] EpiPen, yeah.

310
00:12:07,468 --> 00:12:08,514
Epinephrine.

311
00:12:08,514 --> 00:12:09,399
- Epinephrine.

312
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:10,274
- Yes.

313
00:12:10,274 --> 00:12:14,199
- It should elevate them in the 
largest sense

314
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:16,151
where she could potentially
have life threatening

315
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:21,151
without her entire like,
respiratory system is closing off,

316
00:12:21,398 --> 00:12:22,934
she loses her breathing possibly.

317
00:12:22,934 --> 00:12:24,971
- Absolutely, she's having
the preliminary signs

318
00:12:24,971 --> 00:12:26,625
of an allergic reaction here.

319
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,342
Here's where my thought went and I said

320
00:12:28,342 --> 00:12:29,152
we'd come back to this point.

321
00:12:29,152 --> 00:12:30,240
Maybe Sean, you were going to comment

322
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,894
or somebody else.

323
00:12:31,894 --> 00:12:35,573
They're both out in the
wilderness, this canyon,

324
00:12:35,573 --> 00:12:38,912
they're both having heatstroke symptoms.

325
00:12:38,912 --> 00:12:41,792
Actually, Monique got stung by the bee,

326
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:45,162
she's having separate issues there.

327
00:12:45,162 --> 00:12:46,442
You don't see anything else different

328
00:12:46,442 --> 00:12:48,575
about these two individuals?

329
00:12:48,575 --> 00:12:49,503
Sean.

330
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:54,503
- One got to stay put
for a long period of time

331
00:12:55,796 --> 00:12:59,135
and assured a maybe cooler spot

332
00:12:59,135 --> 00:13:03,433
while the other still had to keep going

333
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:06,846
up through the sun and the heat

334
00:13:06,846 --> 00:13:09,150
to try to get to the top.

335
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,025
- [Voiceover] Do you think that would have

336
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:12,542
a difference in their physical?

337
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,856
- One gets to rest while the other still

338
00:13:14,856 --> 00:13:18,525
has to keep going and going and going

339
00:13:18,525 --> 00:13:21,938
another what, third of the way.

340
00:13:21,938 --> 00:13:24,104
- [Voiceover] Excellent point, you know.

341
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:26,141
What's the other issue between these two?

342
00:13:26,141 --> 00:13:28,263
Jack, you know?

343
00:13:28,263 --> 00:13:30,162
- Well like, they're both
in the same environment

344
00:13:30,162 --> 00:13:32,071
and they both have symptoms of heatstroke,

345
00:13:32,071 --> 00:13:34,556
but Monique got stung by a bee

346
00:13:34,556 --> 00:13:38,193
and at the same time Nelson has no signs

347
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:41,031
of any external trauma
or anything that happened

348
00:13:41,031 --> 00:13:43,324
to him that caused the symptoms.

349
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:48,324
So, it could have even
been a seizure or a stroke

350
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:53,030
made him lose consciousness and causes

351
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:57,286
a temperature to rise so
high is because he was

352
00:13:57,286 --> 00:13:59,792
probably thinking that
there was something off.

353
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:02,043
- [Voiceover] Interesting, interesting.

354
00:14:02,043 --> 00:14:03,184
Yes?

355
00:14:03,184 --> 00:14:04,805
- Would it be their age?

356
00:14:04,805 --> 00:14:07,354
- [Voiceover] Age, excellent.

357
00:14:07,354 --> 00:14:11,237
Look at the difference in their age.

358
00:14:11,237 --> 00:14:12,346
How old's Monique?

359
00:14:12,346 --> 00:14:13,189
- 18.

360
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:15,226
- Yeah, she's 18.

361
00:14:15,226 --> 00:14:17,842
Nelson, the dad right?

362
00:14:17,842 --> 00:14:19,268
He's 51.

363
00:14:19,268 --> 00:14:23,172
I'm not saying 51 is old,
but there's a big difference

364
00:14:23,172 --> 00:14:28,158
between 18 and 51, plus
the fact you add in

365
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,702
what Sean said, he's got
to hike out of this canyon,

366
00:14:30,702 --> 00:14:33,411
he's going to try to find help, right?

367
00:14:33,411 --> 00:14:36,451
Is he having to expend a lot more energy?

368
00:14:36,451 --> 00:14:37,038
- Yeah.

369
00:14:37,038 --> 00:14:38,104
- And he's got to go uphill.

370
00:14:38,104 --> 00:14:39,683
- He's go to go uphill, yeah.

371
00:14:39,683 --> 00:14:42,093
It's hot, he's got no water,
he's got to go uphill,

372
00:14:42,093 --> 00:14:47,093
he's losing, basically, control of his body.

373
00:14:48,717 --> 00:14:49,965
No energy, no water.

374
00:14:49,965 --> 00:14:50,573
Erin?

375
00:14:50,573 --> 00:14:51,970
- And that's why we had
Nelson as number one

376
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,517
and then Monique would go second

377
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,053
because they both had
like the heat problem,

378
00:14:55,053 --> 00:14:57,559
but Nelson was having,
it was much more severe

379
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:59,906
with him because of
his age and everything.

380
00:14:59,906 --> 00:15:02,764
And Monique, she was sitting
there for three hours

381
00:15:02,764 --> 00:15:04,439
after being stung by a
bee, so it wasn't like,

382
00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:08,545
so we put her close up to the top because

383
00:15:08,545 --> 00:15:11,009
there was, she's already
been waiting for long enough.

384
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:12,908
She needs to get help like right away

385
00:15:12,908 --> 00:15:14,283
because she was sitting
in the shade waiting

386
00:15:14,283 --> 00:15:17,622
for hours while her dad
had to go struggle up

387
00:15:17,622 --> 00:15:20,544
the top of the canyon.

388
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,920
So, they were in a really bad situation

389
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,030
and they just needed help immediately

390
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,608
because they'd been
struggling long enough.

391
00:15:24,608 --> 00:15:25,867
- [Voiceover] Absolutely.

392
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:27,584
What?

393
00:15:27,584 --> 00:15:30,612
- During our discussion
we were kind of using...

394
00:15:30,612 --> 00:15:32,448
- [Voiceover] Speak up
a little bit, sorry.

395
00:15:32,448 --> 00:15:34,186
- Okay so, during when we were discussing

396
00:15:34,186 --> 00:15:37,397
the age, we were thinking
also Monique but...

397
00:15:37,397 --> 00:15:38,623
- [Voiceover] Which group
were you real quick?

398
00:15:38,623 --> 00:15:39,338
- E.

399
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,479
- [Voiceover] You were E, okay.

400
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:42,356
- So, like what we thought was that since

401
00:15:42,356 --> 00:15:45,215
Monique is 18 years old, verses Nelson

402
00:15:45,215 --> 00:15:47,700
is a 51 year old, well like, it makes sense

403
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,303
that Monique has a stronger immune system

404
00:15:50,303 --> 00:15:52,958
because she's more young and she has more

405
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,764
nutrients in her body whereas Nelson

406
00:15:55,764 --> 00:15:57,043
could be different, but
we don't know if he has

407
00:15:57,043 --> 00:16:00,265
any diseases like diabetes
or high blood pressure.

408
00:16:00,265 --> 00:16:01,982
It doesn't show, but I'm
just saying in general.

409
00:16:01,982 --> 00:16:05,608
We were writing specific
about his other health

410
00:16:05,608 --> 00:16:07,837
because I wrote that down.

411
00:16:07,837 --> 00:16:08,669
- [Voiceover] Age related diseases.

412
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:09,533
- [Voiceover] Age related diseases, yeah.

413
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:10,877
So, we're missing some medical history.

414
00:16:10,877 --> 00:16:13,042
- Yeah, so it's possible
there because he's older

415
00:16:13,042 --> 00:16:14,706
and because his immune
system isn't as strong

416
00:16:14,706 --> 00:16:16,797
as Monique's is, we have to like,

417
00:16:16,797 --> 00:16:20,125
or doctors have to like
protect them with treatment

418
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,906
more early because his immune system

419
00:16:21,906 --> 00:16:24,903
is much more weak
compared to his daughter's.

420
00:16:24,903 --> 00:16:26,439
- [Voiceover] Absolutely.

421
00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:31,036
As doctors, medical
history is so important.

422
00:16:31,036 --> 00:16:33,745
It's so important in the triage process

423
00:16:33,745 --> 00:16:35,750
and we've been through this folks.

424
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,372
You know, you go to the doctor's office,

425
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:41,414
you go into the hospital, you know,

426
00:16:41,414 --> 00:16:44,496
in addition to while they're
taking your vital signs,

427
00:16:44,496 --> 00:16:47,472
what are they asking?

428
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:50,331
What are they asking when you go in?

429
00:16:50,331 --> 00:16:51,344
- Medical history.

430
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,048
- [Voiceover] Oswell?

431
00:16:52,048 --> 00:16:55,344
- Have you had any previous stuff?

432
00:16:55,344 --> 00:16:57,360
- [Voiceover] What's stuff mean?

433
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,549
- Like surgery, so like problems.

434
00:17:00,549 --> 00:17:01,893
- [Voiceover] Okay, other
medical conditions.

435
00:17:01,893 --> 00:17:02,725
- Yeah.

436
00:17:02,725 --> 00:17:04,602
- [Voiceover] Okay, what's
another question they ask?

437
00:17:04,602 --> 00:17:05,487
Very simple.

438
00:17:05,487 --> 00:17:07,002
- [Voiceover] Has it ever happened before?

439
00:17:07,002 --> 00:17:08,111
- [Voiceover] Has it happened before?

440
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:09,508
- [Voiceover] Is it hereditary?

441
00:17:09,508 --> 00:17:10,340
- [Voiceover] Could it be hereditary,

442
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,380
what's your family's history?
And I think that's what Brian,

443
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,718
you were relating to back there.

444
00:17:16,718 --> 00:17:18,340
What are you here for today?

445
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:21,081
Okay, let's look back
in the chart, should I?

446
00:17:23,831 --> 00:17:27,182
- At this moment when he
comes into the hospital,

447
00:17:27,182 --> 00:17:31,459
he's obviously not
having symptoms of having

448
00:17:31,459 --> 00:17:33,411
high blood pressure in the past

449
00:17:33,411 --> 00:17:37,304
and high blood pressure
might have actually helped.

450
00:17:37,304 --> 00:17:38,488
- [Voiceover] Oh, so you're asking about,

451
00:17:38,488 --> 00:17:39,842
you're referring to Nelson?

452
00:17:39,842 --> 00:17:44,842
- Yeah, because if he
had high blood pressure

453
00:17:45,207 --> 00:17:48,994
then that might have
actually helped keep his

454
00:17:48,994 --> 00:17:53,335
blood pressure up to normal
if it went down severely

455
00:17:53,335 --> 00:17:56,865
because of what happened in the canyon.

456
00:17:56,865 --> 00:18:01,865
But because it's so low, I
would guess that he doesn't

457
00:18:02,209 --> 00:18:05,078
have a history of high blood pressure.

458
00:18:05,078 --> 00:18:08,075
- [Voiceover] Okay, you might
want to disagree with that

459
00:18:08,075 --> 00:18:10,429
and take history out of it.

460
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:12,534
Blood pressure is obviously low.

461
00:18:12,534 --> 00:18:15,392
I think we addressed this a second ago.

462
00:18:15,392 --> 00:18:18,059
Why do you think it's low?

463
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:18,923
Sarah?

464
00:18:18,923 --> 00:18:20,501
- Because everything else that's going on,

465
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:23,061
it's also affecting blood pressure.

466
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,938
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I
think, I truly believe

467
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:27,487
with the limited amount
of information we have,

468
00:18:27,487 --> 00:18:30,303
I truly believe that
because of the dehydration,

469
00:18:30,303 --> 00:18:34,292
the heatstroke, the no
energy, no nutrients,

470
00:18:34,292 --> 00:18:36,681
I literally think this entire body,

471
00:18:36,681 --> 00:18:38,121
all the systems...

472
00:18:38,121 --> 00:18:38,932
- [Voiceover] Shutting down?

473
00:18:38,932 --> 00:18:39,839
Shutting down.

474
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:41,630
I really do think that.

475
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,444
But it's a good point that you bring up

476
00:18:43,444 --> 00:18:46,740
because his blood pressure's 85 over 50.

477
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,382
Does anybody, has anybody ever taken

478
00:18:48,382 --> 00:18:50,217
their blood pressure before?

479
00:18:50,217 --> 00:18:53,566
Okay, 85 over 50, that's low.

480
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:56,958
I mean that gets to
borderline point where,

481
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,389
you know, you're dizzy, I
mean you could have an episode

482
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:01,640
because that pressure of your blood going

483
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,520
through the circulatory
system, it's not high enough.

484
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,075
I mean that gets borderline,
with instead of having

485
00:19:07,075 --> 00:19:08,871
to take medicines for high blood pressure,

486
00:19:08,871 --> 00:19:13,871
you got to take medicines to
bring your blood pressure up.

487
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,559
I think his body's just shutting down

488
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:17,596
and you bring up a good point,

489
00:19:17,596 --> 00:19:19,196
but I think in this case
just with everything else

490
00:19:19,196 --> 00:19:23,474
going on, I think his
body's just shutting down.

491
00:19:25,394 --> 00:19:26,824
Okay.

492
00:19:26,824 --> 00:19:27,890
- Honestly on the side of that,

493
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,490
besides you were saying
like high blood pressure

494
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,770
could actually help.

495
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,925
During the scenario that he's in,

496
00:19:32,925 --> 00:19:35,805
high blood pressure
like with it's problems

497
00:19:35,805 --> 00:19:38,898
that it could cause with
it's possible weakens

498
00:19:38,898 --> 00:19:40,402
the heart, could have actually killed him

499
00:19:40,402 --> 00:19:42,983
during the long, extended
time of trying to get

500
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:44,369
to the paramedics.

501
00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:45,884
That was due to the fact
that the high blood pressure

502
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:50,065
has the (mumbles) of hurting
muscles at a much different rate

503
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:51,772
than most people.

504
00:19:51,772 --> 00:19:54,257
That this test could have possibly failed

505
00:19:54,257 --> 00:19:59,257
during the time to get to a
paramedic without (mumbles).

506
00:19:59,305 --> 00:20:02,566
And plus even had he survived
the high blood pressure

507
00:20:02,566 --> 00:20:06,907
and got on the top, the
shut down of major systems

508
00:20:06,907 --> 00:20:08,837
in his body would have still
caused the blood pressure

509
00:20:08,837 --> 00:20:12,528
to get down so that there's
no possible low levels

510
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:15,109
that could even cause problems.

511
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:17,775
- True, yeah Blythe?

512
00:20:17,775 --> 00:20:21,964
- Like on the graphs, I
feel like there's Nelson,

513
00:20:21,964 --> 00:20:24,698
his blood pressure and the
blood pressure of Elders

514
00:20:24,698 --> 00:20:27,791
was like similar because it was 80 over 50

515
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,553
whereas Nelson was 85 over 50.

516
00:20:30,553 --> 00:20:33,732
But we just talked about how like, Nelson's

517
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:38,732
blood pressure could be
low and this other instance

518
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:43,250
it might not be, but with Elder
he has a head injury and...
