1
00:00:00,443 --> 00:00:02,146
- [Student] Also causing habitat loss--

2
00:00:02,146 --> 00:00:03,213
- Anyways.

3
00:00:03,213 --> 00:00:07,505
- [Student] Indirectly through
our use of C02 emissions.

4
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:13,262
- It says that...

5
00:00:15,678 --> 00:00:18,164
It is a naturally occurring greenhouse gas

6
00:00:18,164 --> 00:00:20,074
and we want to keep that, right?

7
00:00:20,074 --> 00:00:21,974
We want to keep it naturally occuring,

8
00:00:21,974 --> 00:00:24,108
we just wanna work on our--

9
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:25,147
- [Brown sweater] Levels.

10
00:00:25,846 --> 00:00:26,455
- Yeah.

11
00:00:26,455 --> 00:00:30,001
Because our impact is not exactly natural.

12
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:33,185
- [Student right corner] It's
not like we're trying to stop the

13
00:00:35,026 --> 00:00:38,551
unhuman-related processes.

14
00:00:39,027 --> 00:00:41,928
Just like, what we're
doing to increase it.

15
00:00:41,928 --> 00:00:44,925
Because like, it's been staying at a level

16
00:00:44,925 --> 00:00:48,456
until we started releasing a bunch of CO2,

17
00:00:48,456 --> 00:00:50,311
and then it went up,
so it's kind of obvious

18
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:52,300
that we're the cause of that.

19
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:55,400
So, I don't think it's going to go down,

20
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,900
then what it was before, normally.

21
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:03,791
- [Brown sweater] Yeah, I
think it's highly unlikely

22
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,545
that this would ever happen.

23
00:01:05,545 --> 00:01:07,514
- [White sweatshirt] Yeah,
and 20 to 40 degrees Celsius

24
00:01:07,514 --> 00:01:08,809
is a lot, too.

25
00:01:23,068 --> 00:01:25,782
- I highly doubt this would happen.

26
00:01:26,482 --> 00:01:29,292
If we reduce the CO2 emissions,

27
00:01:29,948 --> 00:01:32,907
in what we're doing, this
is kind of ridiculous.

28
00:01:34,652 --> 00:01:35,539
- [Brown sweater] Give some
more evidence for that.

29
00:01:35,539 --> 00:01:36,051
- [Teacher] Why?

30
00:01:36,051 --> 00:01:37,208
- [Brown sweater] Yeah, why?

31
00:01:38,463 --> 00:01:40,131
Explain why do you feel that way?

32
00:01:42,804 --> 00:01:45,310
- Because carbon dioxide is part

33
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,614
of the natural carbon cycle, yeah?

34
00:01:47,614 --> 00:01:50,787
But we're contributing to make more of it.

35
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,265
- [Black sweatshirt]
There's so many economies

36
00:02:00,265 --> 00:02:02,313
and stuff that are
dependent on it right now,

37
00:02:02,313 --> 00:02:06,302
that are not going to get
rid of it for a long time.

38
00:02:09,566 --> 00:02:11,699
Therefore, there wouldn't
be such a drastic change

39
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:13,534
in the amounts of carbon dioxide,

40
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:17,101
that there wouldn't be a drop
of 20 to 40 degrees Celsius.

41
00:02:19,059 --> 00:02:20,528
- [Brown sweater] Because
we don't plan to tamper

42
00:02:20,528 --> 00:02:22,399
with the natural...

43
00:02:24,805 --> 00:02:26,378
Flow of the carbon cycle.

44
00:02:26,725 --> 00:02:29,258
We just want to tamper with our

45
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,866
(speaker's voice distorted)

46
00:02:30,866 --> 00:02:32,189
which will take a long time anyway.

47
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:34,434
So, we're going to be up
and up and up for a while.

48
00:02:36,477 --> 00:02:38,707
- But we kind of already
did tamper with the CO2,

49
00:02:38,707 --> 00:02:41,586
the natural ones, because
yeah, we're trying to reduce

50
00:02:41,586 --> 00:02:44,035
our own personal emissions,
now that we're doing it now,

51
00:02:44,035 --> 00:02:47,470
but we've already gone
in and tampered with it.

52
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,862
We've already cut down
millions and millions of trees.

53
00:02:50,862 --> 00:02:53,800
We've already, so can we talk about...

54
00:02:58,007 --> 00:03:02,968
I'm trying to touch into
what we've done in the past,

55
00:03:02,968 --> 00:03:06,494
and how if we kind of try and back out now,

56
00:03:06,494 --> 00:03:09,784
then we leave the Earth
in a sticky situation.
Does that make sense?

57
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:12,994
- [Black sweatshirt] Well,
I do have a question.

58
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,691
I don't remember, does
the greenhouse effect

59
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:21,625
exist naturally, even as
like a little bit, right?

60
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:24,169
- [Red hat] Yeah, we just made it bigger.

61
00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:24,918
- So it's like, they're claiming

62
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:26,102
that without the greenhouse effect,

63
00:03:26,102 --> 00:03:29,376
the Earth's average temperature
would drop drastically,

64
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,734
well obviously because
the greenhouse effect

65
00:03:31,734 --> 00:03:35,264
exists naturally, but we're making so much

66
00:03:35,264 --> 00:03:37,536
of the greenhouse effect that
we're trying to bring it down

67
00:03:37,536 --> 00:03:39,424
to normal levels. We're
not trying to bring it down

68
00:03:39,424 --> 00:03:41,370
below normal levels.

69
00:03:47,874 --> 00:03:50,893
I think they're saying that
this is going to happen

70
00:03:50,893 --> 00:03:54,978
if it's below the normal
level, but the problem is that

71
00:03:54,978 --> 00:03:57,111
we are already above the normal level,

72
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,434
so if we bring it down,

73
00:03:58,434 --> 00:04:01,425
it's not going to make it
a complete effect anyway.

74
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,780
- [Blonde hair] I mean,
they are right saying

75
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,543
that it's going to get significantly
below, as everyone said,

76
00:04:07,543 --> 00:04:10,209
it's not going to be to the
point where life will not exist.

77
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:14,966
But I mean, the process by
which sun penetrates the earth,

78
00:04:14,966 --> 00:04:17,915
like some of the heat is
retained because of that effect.

79
00:04:18,827 --> 00:04:20,566
And what we're doing is enabling

80
00:04:23,236 --> 00:04:25,386
the Earth to retain more
heat than it normally does.

81
00:04:28,038 --> 00:04:30,523
So by releasing some of
it, by reducing emissions,

82
00:04:30,523 --> 00:04:32,671
we are making the Earth much, much cooler.

83
00:04:35,866 --> 00:04:37,466
- [Black shirt] But we also can't get rid

84
00:04:37,466 --> 00:04:40,756
of the greenhouse gases
already in the atmosphere.

85
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,805
So, those would stay
there, and our temperature

86
00:04:44,805 --> 00:04:47,312
probably wouldn't drop as much,
probably still would drop,

87
00:04:47,312 --> 00:04:49,908
maybe not as extreme.

88
00:04:51,887 --> 00:04:54,255
- [Student] And also, we live in a world

89
00:04:54,255 --> 00:04:55,759
where we use so much carbon dioxide,

90
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,522
there's no way that we're
going to get it to the level

91
00:04:58,522 --> 00:05:02,398
of just the natural processes.

92
00:05:02,968 --> 00:05:06,055
I mean, at least not in a ten year period.

93
00:05:06,356 --> 00:05:07,821
- [Red hat] I was wondering
how long it thought

94
00:05:07,821 --> 00:05:11,320
we were going to slow
so-called global warming.

95
00:05:11,785 --> 00:05:13,752
It doesn't really give us a projection.

96
00:05:14,334 --> 00:05:15,241
- [White sweatshirt] I
don't think we're going to

97
00:05:15,241 --> 00:05:18,861
have another ice age for a long time.

98
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:23,658
- [Black sweatshirt] I mean,
we're having a mass extinction

99
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:26,159
as it is, the way we are right now.

100
00:05:27,712 --> 00:05:31,317
I think if anything,
reducing it would help stop

101
00:05:31,317 --> 00:05:32,847
the mass extinction.

102
00:05:35,028 --> 00:05:36,522
- I think we've kind of
talked about all we can

103
00:05:36,522 --> 00:05:37,583
at this point.

104
00:05:44,997 --> 00:05:46,138
- Alright, so, at this point,

105
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:48,389
if you feel like you have talked a lot,

106
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,501
in an effort to get you to stop,

107
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:51,877
I'm going to have you actually,

108
00:05:51,877 --> 00:05:53,594
I want you to scoot your chair back

109
00:05:53,594 --> 00:05:57,167
like a foot or two, for the next one,

110
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:59,507
to give some other
people a chance to talk.

111
00:06:03,216 --> 00:06:06,228
Yeah, I have two, you want
the good ones with lotion?

112
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:12,592
- The next one, sorry,

113
00:06:12,592 --> 00:06:15,956
is, "Concerns over CO2
emissions are unfounded."

114
00:06:17,637 --> 00:06:19,071
Somebody want to read?

115
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:24,415
- Okay. "Concerns over CO2
emissions are unfounded.

116
00:06:24,581 --> 00:06:26,506
"Water vapor is a leading greenhouse gas.

131
00:07:10,152 --> 00:07:12,748
(laughs)

132
00:07:14,696 --> 00:07:17,382
- Would that be parts per million for ppm?

133
00:07:17,382 --> 00:07:18,274
- Yeah, parts per million.

134
00:07:25,054 --> 00:07:27,934
- Water vapor unit, really, really.

135
00:07:27,934 --> 00:07:31,763
Okay. We have a whole water cycle,

136
00:07:31,763 --> 00:07:34,505
I know we have the whole
carbon cycle and everything,

137
00:07:34,505 --> 00:07:37,538
but we have contributed so
much to the carbon cycle.

138
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:40,563
I mean, and global warming
hasn't really been a problem

139
00:07:40,563 --> 00:07:43,497
until recently, gee, I wonder why?

140
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:46,413
Maybe because, I don't know, we
are emitting a lot of carbon.

141
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:48,691
I mean, it's not like we've
been emitting more water,

142
00:07:48,691 --> 00:07:51,010
you can't create more water.

143
00:07:53,315 --> 00:07:55,346
Okay. Yeah, I'm done, I'm sorry.

144
00:07:56,237 --> 00:07:57,741
- [Far right corner] I
think if you explained

145
00:07:57,741 --> 00:08:00,088
what the greenhouse effect actually is

146
00:08:00,088 --> 00:08:02,663
it will disprove the water vapor theory.

147
00:08:03,037 --> 00:08:06,014
Because the way the
greenhouse effect works

148
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:10,850
is completely unrelated with water vapor.

149
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:17,090
- [Red hat] How?

150
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:21,145
- [Far right corner] Well,
because like, isn't the greenhouse

151
00:08:21,145 --> 00:08:25,693
gas a gas that lets in
sunlight, but it prevents the heat

152
00:08:25,693 --> 00:08:28,375
from leaving, or whatever
or something right?

153
00:08:29,486 --> 00:08:33,213
But water doesn't, I don't
think water does that.

154
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,126
- I thought it was a greenhouse gas.

155
00:08:36,126 --> 00:08:38,384
We learned about that in chapter 20.

156
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:39,647
But...

157
00:08:41,697 --> 00:08:42,946
We did it on the worksheet, maybe,

158
00:08:42,946 --> 00:08:44,685
or the thing that we had
for homework last night.

159
00:08:44,685 --> 00:08:46,684
It's considered a greenhouse gas.

160
00:08:49,175 --> 00:08:50,769
That's all I know.

161
00:08:51,075 --> 00:08:53,158
- [Red hat] You know what effect it had?

162
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,042
- Sorry.

163
00:08:58,691 --> 00:08:59,993
- No, it is a greenhouse gas.

164
00:08:59,993 --> 00:09:01,177
I remember reading that.

165
00:09:01,177 --> 00:09:02,334
But--

166
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,787
- [Teacher] You can grab
a textbook, if you'd like.

167
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:10,248
- [Sweatshirt with number]
Keep talking, Elizabeth.

168
00:09:17,315 --> 00:09:19,054
- Water vapor has always been there.

169
00:09:19,054 --> 00:09:23,048
It has always been at this level.

170
00:09:23,704 --> 00:09:24,744
Am I wrong?

171
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:29,293
- [Blonde hair] Well, I
mean, if our CO2 emissions

172
00:09:29,293 --> 00:09:32,888
are increasing, and global
warming is happening,

173
00:09:32,888 --> 00:09:36,792
then you would be
releasing more water vapor.

174
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,504
I mean, heat would cause that to happen.

175
00:09:43,507 --> 00:09:45,405
- But then technically this is an effect,

176
00:09:45,405 --> 00:09:47,959
it's not a cause, then.

177
00:09:53,629 --> 00:09:55,201
- [Teacher] Is it possible to be both?

178
00:09:59,644 --> 00:10:00,569
- Maybe.

179
00:10:00,569 --> 00:10:03,603
- [Red hat] Like a positive feedback loop?

180
00:10:10,062 --> 00:10:11,933
- [Teacher] What do you
know about water vapor?

181
00:10:15,231 --> 00:10:16,776
- [Elizabeth] It's a greenhouse gas.

182
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,603
We know that now.

183
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,037
- Isn't it when water evaporates.

184
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:24,829
- [Student] Clouds.

185
00:10:26,136 --> 00:10:27,481
(students laugh)

186
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:29,192
- [Teacher] Nope, that
is an excellent point.

187
00:10:29,891 --> 00:10:31,997
- Hold on, you guys, what do clouds do?

188
00:10:32,782 --> 00:10:35,282
They block sunlight.

189
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
(students talking over each other)

190
00:10:43,032 --> 00:10:44,429
- So, if the global temperatures rise,

191
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:45,560
there would be more water vapor,

192
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,632
because there would be more fluctuations

193
00:10:48,632 --> 00:10:50,226
of creating water vapor?

194
00:10:51,576 --> 00:10:53,309
- [Teacher] Don't look at
me, look at your people.

195
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,403
And people who are on the outside

196
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,751
are not supposed to be talking.

197
00:10:56,515 --> 00:10:57,863
- [Sweatshirt with
numbers] Well, just like--

198
00:10:59,843 --> 00:11:01,091
- [Teacher] Well, she can finish.

199
00:11:01,091 --> 00:11:02,781
- [Sweatshirt with numbers]
Sorry, sorry, no go ahead.

200
00:11:04,016 --> 00:11:06,760
- Go ahead, finish. She said 
you could finish.

201
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:08,345
- Oh, Okay.

202
00:11:08,345 --> 00:11:10,915
Well, when water vapor, think about it,

203
00:11:10,915 --> 00:11:13,102
when you like boil water, it's hot,

204
00:11:13,102 --> 00:11:14,404
and it creates water vapor.

205
00:11:14,404 --> 00:11:17,209
So, increases in global temperature,

206
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,673
there would be a possible connection

207
00:11:19,673 --> 00:11:22,291
between increased temperature
and increased water vapor.

208
00:11:25,134 --> 00:11:26,542
- Hot air rises.

209
00:11:26,542 --> 00:11:28,350
- Which way would it be though?

210
00:11:30,697 --> 00:11:34,280
Because if increasing
temperature causes increase

211
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:38,131
in water vapor, does that
mean increase in water vapor

212
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:40,194
causes increase in temperature?

213
00:11:46,696 --> 00:11:50,503
- [Blue scarf] Well, you said
that water vapor is clouds,

214
00:11:50,503 --> 00:11:55,059
so wouldn't, clouds would block sunlight,

215
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:57,122
so wouldn't that decrease temperature?

216
00:11:57,689 --> 00:11:59,720
But that's kind of like contradictory.

217
00:12:01,443 --> 00:12:02,813
- [Teacher] Can that happen, though?

218
00:12:04,886 --> 00:12:08,588
- [Blue scarf] Like how hot air rises,

219
00:12:08,947 --> 00:12:11,133
and cold air drops,

220
00:12:11,133 --> 00:12:14,605
so maybe, forgot what
that process is called.

221
00:12:25,085 --> 00:12:26,546
- [Black sweatshirt] Well, it's
like sometimes when you're

222
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:29,404
on like islands, or something
that it's like all cloudy,

223
00:12:29,404 --> 00:12:31,495
but still really hot and humid,

224
00:12:31,495 --> 00:12:35,062
so maybe it can increase the temperature.

225
00:12:37,543 --> 00:12:38,311
(says teacher's name)

226
00:12:38,311 --> 00:12:39,102
- [Blonde hair] I have a question.

227
00:12:39,102 --> 00:12:40,770
At what altitude do clouds form?

228
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,509
- It depends.

229
00:12:42,824 --> 00:12:44,322
I mean they can form at ground level.

230
00:12:44,509 --> 00:12:45,907
That's what's basically fog.

231
00:12:45,907 --> 00:12:48,786
- [Blonde hair] What's
the highest altitude

232
00:12:48,786 --> 00:12:50,525
that clouds are going to reach?

233
00:12:50,525 --> 00:12:52,194
For the most part, like on average?

234
00:12:52,776 --> 00:12:55,447
- I have no idea, that
is an excellent question.

235
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,511
- [Blonde hair] But
like what part of their,

236
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:59,180
is it under the stratosphere?

237
00:13:01,021 --> 00:13:03,126
- There's a laptop over there
if you guys want to get it.

238
00:13:05,692 --> 00:13:06,940
No one's ever asked me that.

239
00:13:07,882 --> 00:13:08,906
That's a really good question.

240
00:13:08,906 --> 00:13:09,849
I don't know.

241
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,659
I know that they're
throughout the troposphere,

242
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:18,282
but I'm not sure how high up
in the stratosphere they go.

243
00:13:18,282 --> 00:13:21,199
That's a really good, I don't know.

244
00:13:27,156 --> 00:13:28,750
- [Black hair] Can I read
something really quick?

245
00:13:30,335 --> 00:13:32,564
"Four natural greenhouse
gases in the troposphere

246
00:13:32,564 --> 00:13:34,907
"are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane,

247
00:13:34,907 --> 00:13:35,931
"and nitrous oxide.

248
00:13:35,931 --> 00:13:38,928
"These gases have been present,
in varying concentrations

249
00:13:38,928 --> 00:13:41,489
"in the troposphere during most
of the Earth's long history.

250
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:42,950
"Fluctuations in the troposphere,

251
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:46,587
"concentration of these gases,
especially carbon dioxide

252
00:13:46,587 --> 00:13:49,499
"and methane, plus changes in solar output

253
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:51,536
"are the major factors causing new changes

254
00:13:51,536 --> 00:13:54,096
"in the average temperature
of the troposphere

255
00:13:54,096 --> 00:13:56,245
"over the past 400,000 years."

256
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,298
And then it just talks about how

257
00:13:58,298 --> 00:14:00,592
from the beginning of the
industrial revolution,

258
00:14:00,592 --> 00:14:04,698
human actions have led
to significant increases

259
00:14:04,698 --> 00:14:07,765
in carbon dioxide, and therefore

260
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,135
it correlates the relation

261
00:14:11,135 --> 00:14:14,852
to the increase in
temperature of the globe.

262
00:14:24,105 --> 00:14:25,955
- I just read another thing.

263
00:14:27,753 --> 00:14:30,484
"Additional clouds can
have a warming effect,

264
00:14:30,484 --> 00:14:32,969
"positively back by
absorbing and releasing heat

265
00:14:32,969 --> 00:14:34,478
"into the troposphere.

266
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,524
"Or a cooling effect, a negative effect,

267
00:14:37,524 --> 00:14:39,800
"by reflecting more
sunlight back into space."

268
00:14:40,222 --> 00:14:42,286
So, they can have a warming effect.

269
00:14:57,768 --> 00:15:00,082
- So, should we be
worried about water vapor

270
00:15:00,082 --> 00:15:02,028
more than carbon dioxide?

271
00:15:02,386 --> 00:15:03,564
- [Students] No.

272
00:15:04,168 --> 00:15:04,983
- Why?

273
00:15:08,178 --> 00:15:09,341
- [Black hair] Because doesn't the CO2

274
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:13,932
cause the warming, which, never mind.

275
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:15,308
- [Teacher] No no, keep going.

276
00:15:17,426 --> 00:15:18,892
That was good, keep going.

277
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,048
- [Black hair] That was it.
- [Teacher] Okay.

278
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:22,722
(laughter)

279
00:15:27,165 --> 00:15:28,530
- Well, based on what she just read,

280
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,410
and based on everything we
know about carbon dioxide,

281
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,823
we know that carbon dioxide
can lead to a lot of effects.

282
00:15:37,127 --> 00:15:38,380
A lot of them bad.

283
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,191
And one of the major
things is that it does lead

284
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:44,113
to more water vapor, and if
water vapor is such an issue

285
00:15:44,113 --> 00:15:46,791
in terms of global temperature increase,

286
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:50,012
then you would think their first thought

287
00:15:50,012 --> 00:15:53,163
would be decrease carbon
dioxide emissions.

288
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,253
But, no.

289
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,805
- Can we directly regulate water vapor?
-No.

290
00:16:05,477 --> 00:16:07,466
Can we directly regulate CO2?

291
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:10,747
- Yeah, we can decrease our emissions.

292
00:16:10,747 --> 00:16:12,677
We can switch to alternative vehicles.

293
00:16:12,677 --> 00:16:14,833
We can find other sources of energy.

294
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,923
I mean there are a lot of
options with water vapor,

295
00:16:16,923 --> 00:16:18,246
we just have a water cycle.

296
00:16:18,246 --> 00:16:21,894
We can't tell the water
vapor to stop rising

297
00:16:21,894 --> 00:16:23,472
into the clouds, like,

298
00:16:23,472 --> 00:16:25,211
"Yeah, can you just pause for a moment?"

299
00:16:25,211 --> 00:16:27,669
No, we can't do that,
because it's a natural cycle.

300
00:16:36,357 --> 00:16:37,414
- [Teacher] Are we done with that one?

301
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:39,327
- So, what do we have so far, Nida?

302
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,667
- Well, that heat would cause the release

303
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:49,221
of more water vapor, and clouds
can trap and release heat,

304
00:16:49,221 --> 00:16:50,890
but they can also cool.

305
00:16:51,664 --> 00:16:55,730
And concluded that clouds are
water vapor, first of all.

306
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,535
(laughter)

307
00:16:59,068 --> 00:17:01,042
What we were saying, should
we worry about water vapor

308
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:02,812
more so than CO2?

309
00:17:02,812 --> 00:17:05,852
Probably not, because we can regulate CO2,

310
00:17:05,852 --> 00:17:07,126
but not water vapor.

311
00:17:12,262 --> 00:17:13,835
And water's a greenhouse gas.

312
00:17:14,715 --> 00:17:16,124
- I call that using science.

313
00:17:16,124 --> 00:17:16,743
(says teacher's name)

314
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:18,273
- [Blue scarf] I have a question for you.

315
00:17:19,463 --> 00:17:21,041
In nuclear power plants,

316
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,563
how the steam comes
from the cooling tower.

317
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,750
Is that water vapor emission?

318
00:17:26,172 --> 00:17:28,199
- That is considered a
water vapor emission.

319
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:29,852
- [Blue scarf] Okay, so
maybe we could control

320
00:17:29,852 --> 00:17:33,078
that aspect of it, control the steam.

321
00:17:35,046 --> 00:17:37,329
- One additional thing to
just sort of keep in mind,

322
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:38,673
and we'll talk about this later,

323
00:17:38,673 --> 00:17:40,646
is what we call residence time.

324
00:17:40,646 --> 00:17:41,898
Does anyone know what that is?

325
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,427
Residence time is how
long a chemical stays

326
00:17:46,427 --> 00:17:47,839
in wherever it is.

327
00:17:48,357 --> 00:17:50,448
And so one of the things
that we're concerned about,

328
00:17:50,448 --> 00:17:53,264
when we look at a chemical,
is its residence time.

329
00:17:53,264 --> 00:17:55,397
So, if we're talking
about a water pollutant,

330
00:17:55,397 --> 00:17:56,241
what's the residence time?

331
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,819
How long is it going to stay in water?

332
00:17:57,819 --> 00:17:59,440
Is it going to break down quickly,

333
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,744
or is it going to be very persistent,

334
00:18:01,744 --> 00:18:03,935
and is it gonna last
for a really long time?

335
00:18:04,688 --> 00:18:06,363
So, when we were looking
at greenhouse gases,

336
00:18:06,363 --> 00:18:08,314
we're also looking at
what's the residence time

337
00:18:08,314 --> 00:18:09,285
in the atmosphere.

338
00:18:09,285 --> 00:18:12,538
How long does an average
molecule stay in the atmosphere?

339
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:15,877
And water vapor tends to cycle
in and out of the atmosphere

340
00:18:15,877 --> 00:18:20,073
a lot quicker than some of
our other greenhouse gases.

341
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,631
Its cycles are usually
on the order of days,

342
00:18:23,631 --> 00:18:28,047
whereas others are on the
order of months to years,

343
00:18:28,047 --> 00:18:31,315
versus like, do you
guys know what CFCs are?

344
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,780
The ozone-depleting compounds.

345
00:18:34,692 --> 00:18:36,847
Chlorofluorocarbons, we'll
talk more about those as well.

346
00:18:38,037 --> 00:18:41,049
CFCs are also a greenhouse
gas, but their residence time

347
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:44,371
in the atmosphere is more
like hundreds of years.

348
00:18:45,092 --> 00:18:46,553
Hundreds of years to thousands of years.

349
00:18:46,553 --> 00:18:49,726
That would be something we
would be more concerned about.

350
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,131
- [Blue scarf] So like, the residence time

351
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,310
of something radioactive
could be like its half life?

352
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,168
- Yep.

353
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:01,461
And then a third factor that
we look at is also how potent

354
00:19:01,461 --> 00:19:02,995
of a greenhouse gas it is.

355
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:08,782
Some gases have more warming potential,

356
00:19:08,782 --> 00:19:11,197
and some gases have
less warming potential.

357
00:19:11,662 --> 00:19:12,664
So, we also want to look at

358
00:19:12,664 --> 00:19:15,069
what is its potential for heat trapping

359
00:19:15,662 --> 00:19:18,194
versus its concentration?

360
00:19:20,173 --> 00:19:21,799
And we'll talk a little
more about that, too.

361
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,568
Alright, we have two
left. I'd actually like

362
00:19:24,568 --> 00:19:29,538
for you to pick one. I'm thinking maybe

363
00:19:29,538 --> 00:19:31,138
you should do the freezing temps one,

364
00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:32,343
because we already kind of talked

365
00:19:32,343 --> 00:19:36,034
about the cloudy one, but if
you want to do the cloudy one

366
00:19:36,034 --> 00:19:37,489
you can do the cloudy one.

367
00:19:38,188 --> 00:19:39,842
- [Blonde hair] You suggest
the freezing temperature one?

368
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,896
- That's my suggestion,
but I won't be upset

369
00:19:42,896 --> 00:19:44,074
if you overrule me.

370
00:19:45,199 --> 00:19:46,911
- Let's do freezing temperatures.

371
00:19:49,157 --> 00:19:50,379
- Does anybody want to write--
