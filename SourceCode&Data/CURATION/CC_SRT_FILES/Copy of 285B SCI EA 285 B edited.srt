1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,894
- And why face changes are
different at different pressures.

2
00:00:02,894 --> 00:00:05,389
And so I think that at a certain
pressure, they're so close

3
00:00:05,389 --> 00:00:07,711
together that they
aren't a gas anymore

4
00:00:07,711 --> 00:00:10,167
and they become a liquid.
- Cool.

5
00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:11,797
- Because the difference
between a liquid and a solid

6
00:00:11,797 --> 00:00:15,351
with the atoms is that the solids or,

7
00:00:15,351 --> 00:00:18,079
the difference between a
liquid and a gas with the atoms

8
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:20,552
is that the gases are more spread out.

9
00:00:20,552 --> 00:00:23,061
And the liquids can still move freely,

10
00:00:23,061 --> 00:00:25,447
but they're more close together, so.

11
00:00:25,447 --> 00:00:25,889
- Okay.

12
00:00:25,889 --> 00:00:27,874
- We thought that in a liquid, they can't

13
00:00:27,874 --> 00:00:29,883
move as freely as it can in gas.

14
00:00:29,883 --> 00:00:30,491
- Yeah.

15
00:00:30,491 --> 00:00:32,511
- Yeah.

16
00:00:32,511 --> 00:00:35,135
- Well, another gas has to expand,

17
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:37,955
well it does expand to fill
its container.

18
00:00:39,795 --> 00:00:40,725
- Yeah.

19
00:00:40,725 --> 00:00:43,499
So does that have anything
to do with how they move?

20
00:00:43,499 --> 00:00:47,145
- Well, you said that some,
tried to, sometimes they

21
00:00:47,145 --> 00:00:50,140
don't always expand
as much as they can,

22
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,266
but I think they do.

23
00:00:51,266 --> 00:00:53,205
My guess is probably
the distance between

24
00:00:53,205 --> 00:00:55,167
the molecules is based
on how big the space is

25
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:56,907
'cause you think of pressed gas.

26
00:00:58,077 --> 00:00:59,480
- What are you guys all thinking about

27
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,128
of what you're hearing?

28
00:01:02,378 --> 00:01:03,456
- Well...

29
00:01:03,456 --> 00:01:05,032
- Do things sound reasonable?

30
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,328
- Yeah.

31
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,943
- Is this a question that we need to

32
00:01:09,943 --> 00:01:11,887
maybe think about a little bit more?

33
00:01:11,887 --> 00:01:15,416
Just how spread out do things
have to be to be a gas?

34
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:17,576
At what point does that
matter or not matter?

35
00:01:17,576 --> 00:01:19,108
- Uh-huh.

36
00:01:19,108 --> 00:01:19,955
- Okay.

37
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:22,277
[students laugh]

38
00:01:22,277 --> 00:01:24,669
We're gonna keep that one on the books

39
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:26,285
for something we need to check into.
