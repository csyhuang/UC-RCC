1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:06,000
(whispering)

2
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:09,131
- We gotta work quiet.

3
00:00:12,273 --> 00:00:15,023
(mumbles)

4
00:00:20,676 --> 00:00:23,676
- It's three and a half inches long,

5
00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:25,727
and is it?

6
00:00:30,796 --> 00:00:32,296
Seven centimeters.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
- Keep going, gotta keep going.

8
00:00:57,341 --> 00:00:59,758
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

9
00:01:04,056 --> 00:01:06,723
- It's probably about one pound.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:30,000
(whispering)

11
00:01:33,247 --> 00:01:34,997
- Okay, yeah let's go.

12
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:52,414
- I don't know how...

13
00:01:52,414 --> 00:01:54,223
- You measure it with this,

14
00:01:54,223 --> 00:01:56,223
inches then centimeters.

15
00:02:05,072 --> 00:02:08,125
- One inch.
- That's one inch.

16
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:09,125
- One inch.

17
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:11,208
- Yeah, then do it across.

18
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:20,038
- We need one inch, one and a half.
- One and a half.

19
00:02:32,826 --> 00:02:34,409
- Three and a half.

20
00:02:38,214 --> 00:02:39,297
- You got it.

21
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,272
- It's a bone, got a bone.

22
00:02:59,936 --> 00:03:03,269
- Pick it up.
- It'd be easier if we could pick it up.

23
00:03:05,783 --> 00:03:07,408
- Here's a bone.

24
00:03:07,408 --> 00:03:08,991
- There's one yeah.

25
00:03:20,808 --> 00:03:24,725
- You all, let's put it in the middle.
- We gotta tear it apart now.

26
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:40,722
- We don't have to tear
it apart even more.

27
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,500
- It's a bone. It's part of that.

28
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
- Wait, hold on, hold on.

29
00:03:52,745 --> 00:03:56,412
- (mumbles) and feathers.
- You all start pulling those ones.

30
00:04:09,064 --> 00:04:11,731
- It's on my finger!
- There's a ball.

31
00:04:13,228 --> 00:04:14,728
- It's a bird, it's a bird.

32
00:04:14,728 --> 00:04:15,853
- No, look at this claw.

33
00:04:15,853 --> 00:04:17,020
- It's a bird, it's a bird.

34
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,524
- It's a birdy bird.

35
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
- Look, there's its, wait where's its?

36
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,500
- There's its teeth and there's its--

37
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,500
- It's a skull.

38
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,939
- You all be careful with those little ones.

39
00:04:40,634 --> 00:04:43,134
- Just broke it.
- Oh my god, I found something.

40
00:04:45,558 --> 00:04:47,808
(laughter)

41
00:04:49,183 --> 00:04:51,350
- You guys are being mean.

42
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:10,000
(whispering)

43
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
- A skull.

44
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
- I found a skull right there.

45
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:57,000
(whispering)

46
00:05:59,303 --> 00:06:01,053
- How many skulls did you all predict

47
00:06:01,053 --> 00:06:02,923
would be in your owl pellet?

48
00:06:02,923 --> 00:06:03,923
- I put one.

49
00:06:05,027 --> 00:06:07,267
- One? How many have you found so far?

50
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:09,022
Was it right?

51
00:06:09,022 --> 00:06:10,427
- We found a couple bones.

52
00:06:10,427 --> 00:06:13,510
- What about skulls, how many skulls?
- It's tiny.

53
00:06:16,428 --> 00:06:20,595
Alright, how can you determine
what kind of animal it is?

54
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,624
How much did it weigh?

55
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
- Ten grams.
- Ten grams.

56
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,213
Do you think,

57
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:41,091
do you think its weight
has anything to do with

58
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:43,008
how many skulls inside?

59
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,713
Why would that have anything to do with...

60
00:06:46,713 --> 00:06:49,843
- Because the skull might weigh

61
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,176
about two grams maybe.

62
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,739
- I think here's another skull.

63
00:07:00,739 --> 00:07:02,486
It's got a lot of bones in it.

64
00:07:02,486 --> 00:07:03,444
- Okay, see if you can determine

65
00:07:03,444 --> 00:07:04,944
what animal it is.

66
00:07:07,147 --> 00:07:09,480
- Looks kind of like a teacup.

67
00:07:12,818 --> 00:07:14,345
- This is a rat skull

68
00:07:14,345 --> 00:07:16,234
because I can see its teeth right here.

69
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:19,817
- I know, Jake found
another skull I think.

70
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,500
- This is a skull.

71
00:07:32,144 --> 00:07:33,644
- This is so cool.

72
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
- Let's get playing boys and girls.

73
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,253
- You all, I think this is what we got.

74
00:07:57,253 --> 00:07:59,003
- No, that is a bone.

75
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,374
- No look, look.

76
00:08:02,924 --> 00:08:04,706
Where's the claw?

77
00:08:04,706 --> 00:08:05,609
And look at this claw.

78
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:08,442
I think it's the same.
- And then look.

79
00:08:10,612 --> 00:08:14,612
- Look, let's see.
- Oh, that's a skeleton.

80
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
- Oh, that is a skeleton.

81
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
- Ooh, my touching it.

82
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
- A whale,.
- Ooh yay, we found a skeleton.

83
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:23,313
Look at the skeleton Chloe.

84
00:08:23,313 --> 00:08:24,563
- It's a skull. It's a skull.

85
00:08:27,393 --> 00:08:28,893
- Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.

86
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
- Put the feathers and stuff over here.

87
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
- Or whatever it is.

88
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,000
- Yeah, we need to (mumbles) the feathers.

89
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:41,026
- Look, this is soft.

90
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,500
- It's not soft, it has something.

91
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
- There's a little baby bone.

92
00:08:55,977 --> 00:08:58,227
- It looks like a squirrel.

93
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,000
- Look, I got a baby bone.
- No, seriously.

94
00:09:01,305 --> 00:09:03,699
- What animal did you
predict you would find

95
00:09:03,699 --> 00:09:04,699
in your owl pellet?

96
00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:05,532
- A bird. A bird, a gopher and a rat.

97
00:09:08,467 --> 00:09:09,467
- So what have you,

98
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:11,375
have you decided what it is?

99
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,758
- A bird.

100
00:09:12,758 --> 00:09:15,616
- How did you determine it was a bird?

101
00:09:15,616 --> 00:09:18,616
- We found like big claws like this.

102
00:09:22,445 --> 00:09:25,355
- How can you be sure that it's a bird claw?

103
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:27,043
- Because these are usually as hard

104
00:09:27,043 --> 00:09:28,043
and like sharper. 
- We put this.

105
00:09:33,825 --> 00:09:35,575
- Oh, we got the skull and we got a skull.

106
00:09:37,263 --> 00:09:38,764
- How many animals,

107
00:09:38,764 --> 00:09:40,793
how many skulls have you found?

108
00:09:40,793 --> 00:09:42,876
- We only found like two.

109
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:46,334
This is what I was thinking. You
know how it has sharp stuff up there?

110
00:09:47,328 --> 00:09:49,856
- What's a way that you
can determine what it is?

111
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:53,689
- I think we got a bird,
we got some more claws.

112
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,500
- However much bones you find...

113
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:00,803
- Compare the bones that you found

114
00:10:00,803 --> 00:10:02,970
to the bones on the chart?

115
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
- I found another skeleton.

116
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
- Keep working.

117
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
- It has to be a bone, this might be something right there.

118
00:10:24,516 --> 00:10:25,349
- Let me get that out,

119
00:10:25,349 --> 00:10:28,432
because I haven't got anything out yet.

120
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,500
- We got two skulls.

121
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,200
- I found something, I found this.

122
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
- Another skull.

123
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
- Yeah, I think.

124
00:10:51,081 --> 00:10:52,831
- Found another bone.

125
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,400
- You did?
- Yep.

126
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,500
- We found all sorts of, here's another, this 
is a claw.

127
00:11:04,657 --> 00:11:05,824
- It's a bird.

128
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
- Is this a bird claw or, I don't know.

129
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
- I think that's a...

130
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:23,131
- Where's the bird skull?

131
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
- Found something.
- What is it?

132
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,500
- Wait, hold on, wait.

133
00:11:36,193 --> 00:11:38,889
- I think we'll find another skull.

134
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:41,222
- What do you think this is Daniel?
What do you think this is?

135
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
- I don't know.

136
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,500
- Know what that is?

137
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
- I bet that's probably something.

138
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
- I think this bone might be something found in its arm.

139
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
- You all, look what I found.

140
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
- I think this is a skull right here because...

141
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,500
- We got them two, don't worry.

142
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,500
- We got a bone, we got a bone.

143
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
- We got the same skeleton.

144
00:12:22,885 --> 00:12:24,228
- Have you determined

145
00:12:24,228 --> 00:12:26,112
what your animal is?

146
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,937
- No, we don't know.

147
00:12:27,937 --> 00:12:30,354
- I think this is an eyeball.

148
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
- We got a bunch of eyeballs.

149
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
- Here, let me see that.

150
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
- Look, look, look.

151
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
- It's a tooth.

152
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
- Eyeball.
- Let me see.

153
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,000
- Look, I found this. 

154
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,500
- This is the (mumbles) part of the eyeball.

155
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
- Look, look, I found the--
- Ew!

156
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:14,820
- I found the pelvis! I found the pelvis.

157
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:25,000
(children talking over each other)

158
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
- The owls are on this chart.

159
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:44,000
(children talking over each other)

160
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
- I think that might be something, wait.

161
00:13:49,000 --> 00:14:04,000
(children talking over each other)

162
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
- With the tweezers.

163
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
- Here's an eye socket.

164
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
- Over there somewhere.

165
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
