All right. We've been talking about listening and viewing. I have our chart to help us out, and I wanna see if you can tell me what effective and respectful listening and viewing looks like. Matthew.
Um, looking.
Looking. Okay, so our eyes need to be...?
[Together] Watching.
Watching. Christopher.
Hands.
Oh, what do our hands need to be doing?
Still.
They need to be still. Matthew Pelkey.
Mouth shut.
Our mouth shut. Our lips are...
Closed.
Closed. Collin.
Don't lay on the carpet. Don't be silly.
That's right. So tell me. Help her out, Jacob. Our feet what?
Be quiet.
Our feet need to be quiet. Maddie, can you help me out with one more? We've done eyes watching, lips closed, feet are quiet. What do we need to do? Who can help her out? Alice, I see your hand raised.
Ears.
Listening.
Ears listening. And one more. Let me see if-
Hands to yourself.
Adam.
Keep your hands to yourself.
Hands are still. Okay, so let's do our checklist. We said eyes watching. Let me see those beautiful eyes. I don't see Layla's. I need you to turn your body. Very good. Next, ears listening. Does everyone have their ears listening? Next, lips are...
Closed.
Unless I call on you, just like I did with all of our helpers, hands are...
Still.
Still. So Catherine, I'll tie that shoe in just a minute. You put your hands still in your lap. Perfect. And our feet are...
Quiet.
Oh, I love it. Are we ready to view our video?
Yes.
Perfect. Okay. I want to be sure you can see before we begin, because we're going to turn out our lights. All right, what do we want to find out? I want you to watch for what type of weather you see. What are we watching for?
What type of weather.
Weather. And what tools are the children using to observe that weather? So the second thing we need to watch for? Tools. Listen and watch for the tools. And have we had an experience like that? So let me see those beautiful eyes. Let me see them. Face forward. Lights helper. Where's my lights helper?
Claire.
Claire, would you mind turning out our lights? Okay. Do we know what we're listening-
Yeah.
...and watching for? Okay. Eyes forward. I'm going to be seeing who's doing their job. Ready.
The wind is blowing my hair, but then it's very strong today. We decided to blow bubbles. They're blowing away. That's Oliver blowing bubbles, too. Oh, Amy's bubble just blew away. It was so windy, the wind is making the bubbles.
The wind's pushing out the bubbles, and then the bubble comes out.
We didn't even do anything. All we did is hold up the bubble wand.
Whoa.
You can't see the wind, but you can see what it's doing.
That looks like fun.
What are they doing?
My dad gave us some old sheets to tear up so we could make some streamers.
Is he having fun?
That's Oliver, and the streamer just went in his face.
What are they doing?
Let's see what they're doing. Let's watch.
I was pretending the streamers were the hair of this pig, because the little knot is really shaped like a head, and the rest of the stick is their body. And if they have branches growing on them, that's to me their hands and their legs, or something.
All right. It was very short. Well, did you enjoy that?
Yeah.
I want to see that again.
Good. Go turn on our lights.
Again.
Now. Oh, we might watch it again later. So let me see if you were listening and viewing our video. I'm going to check by answering these questions. Now, if you know the answer, what are you going to do?
Raise your hand.
Raise your hand.
What weather did you see? Let me see someone I haven't heard from. Emily, what type of weather did we see?
Blowing.
It was blowing what?
Bubbles.
Wind.
Wind. Blowing wind.
What tools were the children using to observe the weather?
Bubbles!
Bubbles. And what did they do?
They ripped the paper.
They ripped them, and they put them on the stick. Have we had a similar experience?
Yeah.
Yeah, for the bubbles.
Yeah, let me see who's... let me see who I haven't heard from. Clara, what did we do?
We blowed bubbles.
We blew bubbles. Did we have to go like this?
No.
Did we have to do that?
No.
What happened when we put it in the bubble solution and put it up? What happened?
The wind blew it.
The bubbles blowed out.
All right. So now we're going to do a think-
[Together] Pair share.
I want you to turn to your partner that you talked to yesterday.
Okay.
I want you to share how you observed the wind. We had a lot of windy weather yesterday. Talk to your partner about where you observed the wind. Emily, she'll be right back. You be thinking. Jacob, what did you see yesterday?
[inaudible]
Wind. How did you see it?
[inaudible]
What did it blow?
[inaudible]
The trees? It blew the bubbles the other day. Collin, what did you see?
[inaudible]
Perfect. I like that. You used the tools we made in school. Marcus? Are you back? All right, we just got through watching our video, talking about our wind observations. Now I want you to tell me what effective speakers do. I'm going to call on some people I haven't heard from yet. Marshall, tell me one thing an effective speaker does.
Speaks slowly.
Speaks slowly. All right, let's see what else effective speakers do.
They keep their eyes on the audience.
Eyes on the audience, just like mine are on you right now. Bronwen, show that you're listening. Raven?
[inaudible]
Show your work. I want to see that beautiful work. Who else has read? Who can tell me another one? Who have I not heard from today? Who have I not heard from today?
You haven't...
Wesley. Wesley, what else should a good speaker do?
Volume up.
Huh?
Volume up.
Volume up. We want to hear what you have to say. All right. Clara, tell me something else.
Be still.
All right. Oh, you need to stand still. Should you sway back and forth when you're presenting your work?
No.
No. Okay.
Have we covered it all?
Yes.
Let's see. Let's remind ourselves. Look at your-
[Together] Audience.
Speak-
[Together] Slowly.
Stand-
[Together] Still.
Volume-
[Together] Up.
Show your-
[Together] Work.
Okay. Now remember, don't hold up your thumbs up sign until I ask if that person did these jobs. My first speaker is Holland. Holland, will you please come up? Okay. Okay, go ahead.
I can see the wind blow a horse's..
Huh? Horse's what?
Tail.
Okay. Did Holland look at the audience when she presented her work?
Yes.
What do you think?
Good.
Hold up those thumbs up signs. We want to give her good feedback. Put your thumbs up sign down. Thank you, Holland. My next speaker is Alice. Alice. Thank you for choosing a safe path. Come on. Good. All right. Let's watch our speaker. Remember.

Did Wesley stand still?
Yes.
Yes. Good job. All right. Thumbs up sign if he, yeah, if he stood still. Good. Our next speaker, Sofia. Sofia, come up. Okay, let's start out like this. Loudly.

Did Sofia have her volume up?
Yeah.
She did a much better job. Let's give her those thumbs up signs. Good job. Oh, I don't see everyone's. Thank you, Adam. Good. Thumbs up sign down. Matthew Bashir.
I can...
Oh, hold on. Are your friends listening to you? Let me see if you're remembering, if your eyes are watching and your ears are listening. Christopher, we want to see you look at the speaker. Turn your body this way, please. Thank you.
I can see the wind blow kites.
Very good. Show your work. Oh, they've already got those thumbs up signs. Friends, do you believe that he showed his work? Is he showing everyone? Good. Why, thank you, Matthew.
What does that say?
Hmm?
Why is the [inaudible]?
What is that? His kite is in the shape of a...
Star.
Star. Isn't that beautiful? I love those details. Catherine, your turn.
I can...
Oh, hold on one second. I'm sorry to interrupt. Eyes forward. Eyes forward. Good job.
I can see the wind blow my star. I can see the wind blow leaves.
She wrote two sentences. Show your work. Very good. Did Catherine look at her audience when she presented her work?
Yes.
Good. Thumbs up signs. Christopher, Romley, Emily, we want to see your eyes up here. Thank you. Aiden. Aiden. All right, Aiden, we're going to do a quick check. May I please have this? It's okay. Accidents do happen. I just didn't want you to get hurt.
What get hurt?
Because you're holding it... we want to be safe with our materials. Criss-cross. Very good. Aiden, I love the details in your picture.
I can see the wind blow...
Down.
...down the tree.
Show your work. Nice. Oh, thumbs up signs. He spoke very slowly.
