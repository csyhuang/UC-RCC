[Voiceover] Who came up with the definition for radiation? Peter, you had a good definition, could you repeat that, remind us?
I don't remember it exactly, but it was something along the lines of anything with waves that move, waves that are radiated, I mean.
[Girl in purple] Didn't you say it was waves that are spread?
Yeah, waves that are spread by something, and they usually have energy with them. Like, the sun sends its radiation to the earth, in the form of light, heat, UVA, UVB rays.
[Voiceover] Okay, so with that understanding, would you guys say that all radiation is harmful?
[Voiceover] Not all.
Yes. To a degree, all of radiation is harmful. But just, it depends on how harmful.
But so then, what is like, when it's not harmful?
It's very, very, very.
Not, almost?
It's almost negligible.
[Voiceover] What types of waves that radiate, or what types of radiation do you associate with being not harmful?
[Peter] Radio waves. (students agreeing)
[Voiceover] Any others, Jordan?
Microwaves?
[Voiceover] Visible light.
Yeah, visible light isn't really that harmful.
[Voiceover] What about microwaves, that's a good one. What do you guys think about microwaves?
I thought they were dangerous, but somebody told me that they weren't.
They're not really that harmful are they? I mean-- (cross-talk)
[Voiceover] You probably shouldn't stand in front of it.
Saying they're not that harmful?
They're not. I mean, I think probably like extended exposure to them would be bad, but I think that could be the same with a lot of things.
[Jordan] The door shuts when you use the microwave too.
[Voiceover] What about then, where do they fall on the spectrum, what makes you think they're not dangerous? Or that they are?
[Voiceover] Because they are longer than light waves.
They've got longer wavelengths.
[Voiceover] Which what does that mean?
They have lower frequencies. They don't carry as much energy with them. Lower frequencies.
[Claire] Let me consult my chart.
[Voiceover] Okay, good idea. Or can anyone help her? What was your question Claire?
Oh, I didn't have a question.
[Voiceover] Oh, okay.
What was the question? Why is she looking at her chart?
Nope, same (mumbles).
We think they're not dangerous because they have a longer wavelength and a smaller frequency than light. Light is (mumbles).
[Voiceover] Okay good, so I think this is a good segue to the next question, which is, why are some electromagnetic waves considered dangerous to humans, while others aren't?
Do you know what a segue is?
[Voiceover] Okay. Which ones have more energy than others?
Gamma rays and X-rays, and UVH rays?
[Voiceover] Okay good, Peter did you have something you wanted to add?
To what he just said?
[Voiceover] Mm-hmm. Okay, good, and, can you repeat that, Sam?
Some electromagnetic waves are more dangerous because they have much more energy.
[Voiceover] Okay, good. So ultimately, what is that energy doing? Why is that harmful to us?
Can stimulate cell growth (mumbles).
The more energy it has the more like, materials it can penetrate. Like visible light wouldn't really cut through you, but gamma rays could, like travel through skin. And X-rays can.
[Voiceover] What did you guys learn about perhaps in biology? Cancer (mumbles).
Well that it's, when cells grow too fast, the abnormal growth of cells keep reproducing and...
There's a mistake in the coding of the DNA, and then everything just goes haywire and, the cells, like what Caleb said, grow at abnormally fast rates, and they just take over that area and spread.
Well yeah, they stop functioning as normal cells, and their sole function is to reproduce, and to continue growing and then they eat portions of other cells.
[Voiceover] Okay, so what do electromagnetic waves have to do with this extra energy? This dangerous energy?
Well wouldn't like, Cho said they would like stimulate the growth and, or is that not?
Why do they stimulate growth?
[Cho] Because they have energy.
What does the energy do to stimulate it?
[Voiceover] What were you going to say, Ronnie?
Well, I just said that they trigger, they don't like stimulate, I mean cell growth to an extent is necessary (mumbles). But they can trigger something dangerous, like with (mumbles). I don't really have like the percent (mumbles) or anything but...
[Voiceover] What else might control cell growth?
DNA?
[Voiceover] Okay good, yeah.
Lots of energy can. Can energy alter DNA? I feel like it can't.
Well, isn't that what it's doing if it's triggering abnormal cell growth?
I don't know.
[Voiceover] Is anyone in here, have you taken, or are you taking (mumbles) biology?
I took it last year. I kind of remember what we talked about with cancer.
[Voiceover] It's okay, and you guys have actually come to a good conclusion, that it does lie in the DNA, and that, you know, certain types of radiation can cause mutations in DNA that affect the cell cycle. So, when we think about cancer a lot of times, in light, or electromagnetic waves, a lot of times we think about skin cancer. And we talked a bit about that yesterday. We also probably notice skin variations among different people from different regions of the world. So, how does skin color variation, how do you think it relates to the amount of UV radiation that a particular population receives?
[Caleb] You mean based on their race?
[Voiceover] Just based on their geologic background. Geographic background, not geologic.
Well I mean, people with darker skin tend to not get sunburned as much as somebody with really, really pale skin.
I don't think that's true, I think it's just that it doesn't show up as much, like you can definitely still get sun damage--
No, of course you can still get sunburned, but I don't think it's like--
[Sam] It's harder?
I think so.
[Voiceover] I think it's just less noticeable.
Yeah, I think it's just less noticeable, I really don't think it has anything to do with-- (cross-talk)
[Voiceover] Okay, so you're getting the same amount, good, you're getting the same amount of radiation, sure.
[Sam] Is sunburning caused by like the amount of light we absorb, our skin absorbs?
It's actually, it's in their, Grace and Lana's video. About how (mumbles).
What did we do?
On your presentation about sunburn. How sunburn works. I don't remember (mumbles).
[Voiceover] Okay, so ultimately I guess, I'll restate the question. So, how does skin color relate to the amount of UV radiation a certain population may receive? We see a lot of variation, so a lot of people often times say, "Oh, why do people in, "in countries that are near the equator, "Why are they darker, wouldn't that make them hotter?" Because we tend to think of dark colors as absorbing a lot of different wavelengths of light. Is that true, is that what's happening? It seems kind of...
Wouldn't that make you sweat more then? Which would be good if it was hot.
I guess sweat (mumbles).
[Cho] Sweat is just to release the heat on your body.
No, but that's what I'm saying, like if you get hotter quicker, then you would start sweating earlier, which cools you down.
[Voiceover] What is the pigment in skin that causes color variations?
[Students] Melanin.
[Voiceover] Okay, good, alright. So, people who have darker skin, do they have more or less?
They have more.
It's in eyes, too, right? It's what causes eye color differences? Maybe I'm making that up, but...
[Voiceover] What do you think the purpose of the melanin is? Is it to absorb, Grace offered one theory, what's another theory too there? There are several different reasons. What does it do to UV light? What's different about people that live say, in the equator regions, like the (mumbles) and people who live up north?
They don't get sunburned if they live there.  I mean...
There's like nothing to (mumbles).
Yeah, exactly. People who live in northern climates are much more likely to get sunburned, because they're not exposed to that much sun, or their relatives weren't. And as they adapted they just passed on that trait of having fair skin. But, I don't know why. Do you know, Miss Roseborough?
[Voiceover] Yeah, I have an understanding, yes. And when I think about it, I kind of think about the actual pigment itself, and what it's doing, and where it's located on the body. What it may be serving to do.
[Cho] Doesn't it synthesize vitamin D for us?
That would make sense.
Yeah that's, vitamin D from sunlight, I guess that's why.
[Voiceover] Okay, so people who have more melanin have, live in the sun, you know they have more exposure to the sun. Why do they need that extra melanin?
[Girl in bandana] To protect them.
[Voiceover] Okay yeah, so let's go with that, to protect them. From what?
From the radiation like, I guess if you're out in the sun more, you need more protection, so like, it's kind of like a built-in sunblock.
[Voiceover] What would it protect? So, it's on the surface, right?
Protects the inner skin? It protects the outer layer, right?
[Claire] Epidermis.
[Voiceover] Yeah, I feel like Ewan brought up something like this yesterday when we were talking.
Is that why they, you have lighter on your hands?
Oh, I think that's the thing about like, gamma rays, for example, being more, like that was one of the (mumbles) question, because they have more ability to penetrate through skin, and (mumbles).
[Voiceover] Okay, so really what's happening is the melanin actually absorbs the wavelengths of light that would normally penetrate the skin.
How does it do that?
[Voiceover] It just doesn't, the energy is just sort of dissipated as heat, and so...
You get the heat but not the radiation?
[Voiceover] Right, exactly, so it doesn't go further into your body.
So, darker people get less sunburned than fairer people, because of that?
Well, does it necessarily have to do with sunburn?
And they're less likely to get skin cancer?
[Voiceover] Yeah, I'd say they're less likely to get skin cancer.
When you get tan, are you getting more melanin in your skin?
[Voiceover] Yeah, what's happening when you get tan?
So, shouldn't tanning make your skin stronger?
Well--
If it increases melanin?
I don't think it's necessarily increasing it.
[Girl in bandana] Because the tan goes away.
Oh.
So, it's like you have whatever your natural skin color is, then that is determined, how much.
Okay.
[Voiceover] Okay, so next misconception, that a lot of people have, or just something that I've always wondered about. I don't know if it's a misconception or not, but I'm thinking about colors that we associate with certain, just everyday things. So, when I go into the bathroom, when I go into the kitchen, I see red and that indicates the faucet that I turn for hot water, and blue for cold water. Why do you think those colors were chosen and is that always true?
[Students] Because fire is red.
Water and ice is blue. It's not really blue, it's more clear.
White and blue flames are much hotter than red flames.
[Voiceover] Yeah, explain that.
[Caleb] I don't know, I guess back, a long time ago before they knew that--
The hottest part of the fire is at the top, and if you think about a flame, usually you see a little blue or white part at the bottom, and then it's the red orange at the top.
Which is where it would be the hottest.
It's hottest at the top.
But there's, at the top it would be starting to cool off as it gets away from--
At the peak it's the hottest. But then the bunsen burner, the hottest part is like...
Yeah, the hottest part of the flame is the top.
You get a marshmallow, you put it at the bottom?
No, sir!
[Voiceover] What color is at the top, guys?
[Students] Red.
[Girl in bandana] White.
Or orange. (cross-talk)
Blue and white at the bottom.
It's an experiment, Miss Rose, let's do experiments on fire.
[Voiceover] That's a good idea, I think we should at this point.
Do you have bunsen burners in here?
[Voiceover] No, I don't have a gas source. So, let's just go back, I even broke it down, and I was thinking about well, where did this come from? I was thinking, what wavelengths of light are being absorbed by the color red, and what are being reflected by the color red? And so is the color red actually hotter? How could I relate that to temperature? How do you even relate a color to temperature? So, just the color red, what's it reflecting? What's it absorbing?
What color does it reflect? It reflects red.
And it absorbs green and blue. Or cyan.
[Voiceover] Right, so, going back to the, what makes it that color, its natural frequency, what types of waves are causing it to change in temperature? What's happening as a result of different white light say, striking it, and its actual reflection and absorption of different waves of light? Would red or blue actually be hotter? As a pigment?
Blue should be hotter, because it has more energy, it has the shorter wavelength and greater frequency.
Yeah, Sam's right.
[Voiceover] So, with a pigment? Think about a pigment first.
What about it, just think about it?
[Voiceover] Yeah, so certain wavelengths of light are being absorbed, and certain, wavelengths of light are being reflected. What does it mean when a pigment absorbs wavelengths of light? What happens to the energy that is being absorbed?
It transfers to the medium?
[Voiceover] Okay, good.
I was going to say the pigment has the same frequency as those wavelengths, so...
[Peter] Probably right.
[Voiceover] Okay good, so it absorbs, so let's think about blue again. How could you apply that? What wavelengths of light does it absorb?
[Peter] Shorter wavelengths than red.
Well no, blue absorbs red and green, so this would be, longer wavelengths and lower frequencies.
So, red would absorb the blue. Therefore it would absorb the higher frequency, had more energy, which means it would be hotter, right?
[Voiceover] What do you guys think? Can you restate that?
Sorry, because red absorbs blue, and blue has a higher frequency, the red would be absorbing the higher frequency, which means it would be getting more energy from the higher frequency. So, red would be the hottest.
The man has a point. I agree with Peter.
I agree with it, too.
I agree with Peter.
[Voiceover] Yeah, that's sort of the conclusion I came to, the only conclusion. Then I started thinking more, I was like, well how does this apply to stars? So, if I see a star that gives off a...
