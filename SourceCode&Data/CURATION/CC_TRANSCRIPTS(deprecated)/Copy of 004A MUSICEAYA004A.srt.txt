™ª [music] â™ª Great job, thank you for playing along. It's so much nicer to play with live accompaniment than it is recorded. Your assignment, two weeks, be able to play an improvised solo in this key, in F concert utilizing the Dorian and Mixolydian scales. We'll leave in just a moment, just relax. Utilizing the Dorian and Mixolydian scales. I'll ask you to play live, on this Bosaladera. I also, want you to, outside of class, find a Latin piece of music, it doesn't have to be bossa nova, that you can play along with identifying the Dorian and the Mixolydian scale that fits that key. Pick a song that you can identify the key, and that you feel comfortable playing in that key, to bring back and play for us. I want a recording here so, you're going have to find a mp3, CD, DVD, something along that you can get to class. So you can share this information with each other, Questions? Time frame is two weeks. If you went through this quickly, tell your buddy how long you got and what you have to do, go. That's a great question, thank you. Yes, yes, do it in vibes, it will be wonderful.
