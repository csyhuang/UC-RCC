Right here. Okay, so is that gonna tell us what one of our asymptotes is?
Yeah.
Yes, because your asymptote is where this would be undefined, right? So, it's gonna be X equals what?
Positive two?
Positive, but, okay, if we put positive two there, we have two plus two.
So, it'd be negative two?
Negative two, that's why we have an asymptote that X equals negative two, okay? Now is there another number out here?
No. No, so what would that other number be? See there is one here, but there's not one here.
So it'd just be zero.
So, it'd just be zero. So, does that tell you what your other asymptote is? Y equals zero, 'cause f of x stands for... that's your y isn't it? Okay. So, you can tell by looking at the function itself, what your asymptotes are gonna be. Okay, tell me what this asymptote's gonna be, your x, your vertical asymptote.
 Zero?
 Zero, X equals zero, so you're gonna be drawing your asymptote right there. What about your y? Remember how we covered this up, and you would have y equals what?
Negative one?
Negative one, y plus negative one. So, the function itself tells you your asymptotes, doesn't it? Okay, does that help?
Yeah.
 Okay. 
 All right, so...
 No, but it's like that right here though.
 But see she has negative two.
 Right here.
 Then how did she get the, did we write the first one wrong then?
 'Cause x equals zero.
 No, because she got zero and negative two, and that's what I got. You wrote it down wrong.
 Where?
 Right here, 'cause zero is supposed to be on top. Oh, so, no, never mind, you got it right.
 It's the same. I just switched these around. No, but you're right because you know how x is vertical, okay, so, for this one it's going to be, the x is going to be negative 2, right?
Mm-hmm.
Okay I got it.
 So wait, the asymptote isn't the same thing as the parent function, right?
No.
Did you have the graph? Did it turn out?
And how do you know, up here?
Check this thing out.
Huh?
 So, what would the parent function be?
That's what I was trying to work out for you.
 Did you find the parent function?
For what?
It's not x squared, is it?
One over x.
 All of them is going to be one over x.
'Cause you can't just put x. She said put a one divided by x. That'd be the parent function.
 All right.
How do you know which is the parent function?
It's the one that's consistent.
That first one that you put.
It's the one that's exactly in between the first and third quadrant. This is your parent function. This is your parent function.
This one and this one, right? So blue right there and right there.
But you totally ruined it.
Yeah.
Yeah, the colors I used are kind of weird.
Do you have a red? Are you using it?
This is the graph, right? So, if it's the first one and the third one, right?
Hey wait, that first thingy comes out at negative three, not negative two.
Hm?
 This first little line right here comes out negative three, not negative two. Is the parent function still, I mean, is the asymptote still negative two?
I think
 
So, how is one negative two?
 You gotta switch it, because the one x plus two when you use the calculator you go into a negative, so the y would be zero because it's not going to negative.
How would the y be zero, the y is a negative?
You got em' switched, all you gotta do is switch em'.
I'm not understanding. She busy.
Okay. Oh, I know why. It's because we don't have no y in the equation. Like this one, it'd have a y. The y would be negative one. And on this one, we don't have it, so, automatically the y would be zero and the x would be negative two.
That makes more sense.
 All right you got it.
Yeah I had to think about that.

 So, that's how you do it.
So, then the asymptote is the...  right here?
 Uh-huh.
Which one?
So, then the translation is the down one.
Wait, what?
The translation is the down one.
So, what is this down?
 Let me plug it in. Divide by x parentheses... One over, divided by x minus one.
Okay, so we don't need no parenthesis?
 No.
 I'm almost done.
You're crossing it, that's the y, yeah. But that's the x. This is x and this is y.
Yes.
 Well, look on the sheet. It will show you that, um...
I basically used this one as an example. It's like the same type of format that the problem is.
Okay.
Okay, yeah that makes sense.
So, the asymptote is zero.
It says h equals x .
Yeah.
Yeah, so zero, yeah wait... Yeah.
 This is the graph you start with?
Yeah, that makes more sense 'cause that's how the graph is. Okay, we got the asymptote. X equals, is it zero? Yeah, and then y equals negative one. And the translation is one unit down. Do you have a value?
Yeah.
Uh-oh.
So, it'd be three units down. We would put this on negative three cause that's y. So, since it's y, we would have to put it on negative three and zero.
Right?
 'Cause it's the same as this.
Yeah.
And then y equals negative three.
Yeah, x equals zero and y equals negative three. Translation, three units down.
Wherever the lines, like, go the furthest but don't touch.
Okay.
Oh, you're just marking down the asymptotes?
Yeah. She said she forgot, yeah, so I guess you can just put up there yellow.
Okay. Are you on number four?
Yes.
So, on number four it would be five units to the left.
Number four, yeah, yeah, you're good.
Okay.
She just told me, she just told,
I just wrote it wrong I guess, then.
How do you know how to graph it with... ?
Like in the calculator?
In here. And it's really not good to graph it here.
Yeah.
Okay.
This seems to be not that hard, now that I get it.
Really.
Like, remember how Grayson thought that it was three I knew she was wrong... .
I mean, I didn't think it was wrong.
You just instinctively knew that it was wrong.

 Is it going to have a vertical shift also?
Yep, up, down, down.
Okay, up or down?" Down how many?
Two.
On number five?
Oh, three. It would be three.
Three. Okay, so you're going to have two shifts on number five, right? Okay?
Uh huh. I haven't plugged it in yet.
We're going to have a shift here, right? What would make that undefined? If x equals...? How about positive two? Because two minus two is zero. I mean, the zero is where you needed to be. So, x equals two, right? Okay, now, what are we going to do with this thing out here? That's a vertical shift of y equals... negative three. Y equals negative three.

So, we have two translations, okay? Two units right and...
