Okay, would the person who is currently writing, please stand up?  
Alright, nice and loud. What did you guys put? And why?
Nicholas Carnatkey created the perfect tangent of calculating all the key transient effects on the core to predict, to create the perfect amount of work.
Okay, very good. John, nice and loud.
Marie Curie.
Okay.
Discovered that radiation...
Okay. What about you guys? 
Alright. Two claps for these neighbors. 
Sit down. Pass the board one person.
What would be, this is an opinion question, what do you think would be the result, if scientists didn't communicate their findings to the community at large? Go! 
Do we need to write this down on the board?
Just give a bullet sentence. 
Do we have to pick a scientist for this one? To prove it?
Nope. This is just an opinion. Just give me, like, a one word bullet, would be fine.  Okay. Pass the board one person. And would that person please stand up? Troy, what did you guys have?
There would be multiple theories on how things worked. Society would be stagnant and Newton's hypothesis...
Newton was actually asked by a college of scientists about the thoughts of gravity and stuff, and he didn't think it was important. So when he found out, a few months before that, he didn't publish it, until they asked him about it, and then he republished to them, so they could hang out with everybody else.
Okay. Excellent. What do you guys have?
There would be no uniform units, therefore there would be no real way to judge one's discovery, and you couldn't really bounce one idea off another.
Okay. What'd you guys have?
We said that we wouldn't have the technology that we have today because scientists tend to go off of what other scientists have done. Because I know that Celsius went off of Newton's ideas of how the poles were flat, and so he went on an expedition and found out that they were.
Okay. Very good. Alright. Two claps for all our neighbors.  Pass the board one person. Okay. I like this one. If you could interview any of the scientists that we've looked at today, who would it be and what one question, would you be sure to ask? Okay. Go!   Okay. Stop right there. Pass the board one person. Please stand up. Please stand up. Who's going from this group?
Andy.
Super. Okay. Nice and loud. Let's use active listening. John, who would you guys pick and what question would you ask?
Marie Curie.  I said it right.
And what question would you ask, dear?
If she got any oppression from the male scientists.
Okay. The oppression from the male scientists. I like it. What about you guys?
We would ask Thomas Edison, "What inspired you to create the phonograph?"
Excellent. Okay. Back there. Who would you pick and what?
We were also going to ask Thomas Edison to see how other people felt about his invention of light bulbs.
Of the light bulb, specifically. Okay. Brandon?
We had Albert Einstein and our question would be, how did he come up with all his theories, if he couldn't pass high school math?
Okay. What'd you guys put?
We picked Oppenheimer and we would ask why he went into this? If he realized what he actually made?
You probably can't see it, but they have written on the board, "The Manhattan Project." Okay. Very good. And you guys?
Oppenheimer. What his thoughts were of the morality of the atomic bomb.
Okay. This is a really great segway to what we're going to do next. Big claps for all these guys.  Please move into your catwalk formation. Find a partner. Go! In ten. Without the boards! Just yourself. Just your bodies! Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Oh, we have a partner whose hand is up. Four. Looks like, there we go. Three. Two. One. Be sure to, oh, we need a real quick hands up, don't we? Hand ripple! Establish who your partner is.  Wow! That was emphatic! Okay! Be sure you're using active listening, because I will quiz you. Here's your question: "How are scientists affected by social issues?" Social issues going on in our culture. How does that affect what scientists can and can't do, or what they think? The person who woke up the earliest will answer this question and then stand back to back. Go!  When you're done, stand back to back! Okay. Face me. Since this one is kind of a shifting gears one, I want to let you volunteer. Did anybody have a really good answer that their partner gave? Yeah?
Interference from the church.
Okay. Definitely a social issue.
If they don't have their research believed, they could not receive funding, or just get shunned, basically. If it disagrees with what the society basically believes in.
Okay. So, you could be shunned, you could risk your political or your religious beliefs. Em?
Problems with morality, like testing on animals.
Okay. Did you guys want to add something down there?
No.
No? You're good?
They said what we said, basically.
Okay. This question is for the other partner. "Why do you think scientists try to understand the natural world?" Think for a few seconds. "Why do scientists try to understand the natural world?"  Okay. Give your answer, then stand back to back. Go!  Okay. Face me. I'm going to let you guys volunteer on this one, too. Who had a partner with a really good answer? Yeah?
It's just human nature to question things.
Okay. Very good. Since we got the bigger brain with all the cool parts to it. We just question. Okay. What'd you guys have?
Because they're extremely curious on how things work and why certain things do what they do.
Okay. So we're very curious creatures.
How to make things in everyday life easier?
Ooooh! That segways to my next question. Split apart! Brody, take the catwalk. Logan, take the catwalk. Hey, you guys were my first ones last time, too. Aw, such love!
I was the first one last time.
Were you?
Yeah!
Oh, I just remember those two catwalking together. Okay. Shift us down two! Super. Shift down two. And a real quick hand ripple to establish your partner. Hand. Hand. Hand. Hand. Hand. Hand. Hand. Hand. Hand. Hand. Hand. Hand. Super! Okay. The person who has ordered the most ID badges this year is going to answer the following question. Shh!! Here's your question. Five. Four. Three. Two. Thank you. Here's your question. "What motivation is there to develop technology to meet human needs?" What motivation do scientists have to create technology that meets human needs? Think about it. Go!  Okay. Split apart. I'm just going to randomly popcorn on this one. Brandon, what'd you guys say?
We came up with, make life easier.
Okay. To make life easier. Alright. What's something you guys said?
Money and power.
Money and power. Interesting. What's something you guys said?
To decrease death. Like, medical science.
Okay. So, let people live longer? Probably also live more quality lives? Excellent! Okay. Take the catwalk. Take the catwalk. Shift down two partners once she gets down there. Shift down two. Super! And a quick hands up! Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Uh oh! There we go. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Now, everybody, take three steps that way. One. Two. Three. Super! Okay. This time, the person with the longest hair is going to answer the question. "What evidence can you cite from today's scientists that we've discussed, where something microscopic, something you can't see, was being sensed or manipulated?" What is an example of the scientists we learned today, hold on, just one sec. What is an example of something the scientists we learned about today, hold on, hold on, hold on. I had a request to restate the question. "What is an example from the scientists we learned about today, using, sensing or manipulating something that is microscopic or can't be seen?" Okay? Now go.  We certainly cannot see that. Except on the macroscopic level, we can see the results of it.  Brandon decided to use a lifeline called phone a poster. So, Brandon, what was your answer?
I found on, Thomas Edison found radio waves.
Okay. Very good. Face me, please. Emily, what's something you guys talked about?
Marie Curie found radiation from atoms.
Okay. Very good. Erin, what's something you guys talked about? 
Okay. Very good. Take the catwalk. Take the catwalk. On the catwalk. Alright. PG! PG! PG! Thank you!  Scooch down. And, hands up! Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Hands. Super! Okay. The person, whose last digit, in their address, is the lowest, is going to answer this question.  Okay. Here is your question. We talked a second ago about the fact that scientists are naturally curious about our natural world, but many scientists have learned to manipulate our natural world. "What is your opinion of scientists manipulating, using for our benefit, our natural world?" Okay. Go.  Okay. Face me! Nice and loud so everyone can hear. Brian, what did your group discuss?
We thought it all depended on humanism. How they thought the humanism in relation to all the other creatures of the world, that they feel like they're higher than all the other creatures, then they can do what they want to the natural world.
Okay. So, as long as it's being used for good.
I guess.
Okay. With the benefit of humans or the world in general? Kind of a socialist view?
The world.
In general. Okay. John, what did you guys say?
Yeah, what did we say?
Pretty much the same thing.
The same thing, pretty much.
Okay. So, are you, specifically, looking at human needs or more, global?
Human.
Okay. What about you guys? What did you partnership talk about?
That it was okay to a point. There was a point when you should not manipulate the natural world. Like, taking a dolphin from one ocean and moving it to another.
Okay. So, who should decide what those points are?
I don't know.
Okay. Alright. That segways us to the next question. "If you were..." Let's see, let's do this. The person with the most buttons on is going to answer this question.  Okay. "If you were the scientific consultant to President Barack Obama, what percentage of our National Budget, should be spent on science, and why?" Justify that amount. Go! It's a percentage. So, we're not talking a dollar amount. What percentage?  Well, it doesn't really matter. Do you think half of our budget? Do you think a third of our budget? You think a quarter of our budget?  I don't know. You could delineate that. Okay. I could tell by looking at you guys, that we've got a couple of folks that feel kind of passionately about this, so spread back apart and face me. What did you guys say?
Well, I said that 15% is a good amount because then, it puts enough money forward to get going and leaves money for other things that we need.
Okay. Now you guys had a very specific take on it. What did you guys talk about?
We talked about if medical, if the percentage was accounting for medical sciences, as well, as it should and, if it is, then the percentage should be increased to help.
Like 50 to 60%, if medical is included.
Okay. So, we have to look at the different kinds of research. Are we just studying stuff to study stuff? Are we developing a technology that will help human need? Are we looking at medical? Alright. Very good. Take the catwalk. Take the catwalk. On the catwalk. They do their little turns on the catwalk. On the catwalk. Okay. Of the science, of the person...
We haven't scooted.
Oh, scoot down. I'm out of order. Thank you. Scoot down. I got so excited about the questions. Scoot down. Scoot down. We will! Okay. Here we go. We're creatures of habit sometimes. Hands up, real fast. Make sure you've got the right partner. Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. There we go. Okay. The person, whose third, no. The person whose last digit in their cell phone number is the highest.
