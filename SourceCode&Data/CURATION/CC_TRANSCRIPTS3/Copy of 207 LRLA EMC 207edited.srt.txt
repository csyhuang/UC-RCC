Welcome to Mrs. Dunford's first grade classroom. Here you see a Word-Work center, where students are working to build words. All around the room, student work is proudly displayed along with anchor charts to anchor student learning. At Computer Center, students are working on differentiated computer programs based on needs. At Listening Center, students listen to stories to build their fluency. Above them is our Word Wall, which displays our sight words. Our Center Chart. The students are working on the Smart Board to integrate technology into reading. Here we have students at Read To Someone, where they are enjoying reading books to each other. Around the back of our room, books are separated into book bins for genres and they have their book boxes. At Read To Self area, students read independently and enjoy reading in our tent. In the back, we have our marble jar for compliments and our How Was Your Day board, along with our Helper Chart. And last we have My Table, where I work with small groups based on needs. Thank you for joining our classroom.

 "Liked bedtime stories."
Where would that one go? Let's see... Cassandra?
 Childhood.
Childhood? Why do you think that it would go in Childhood?
 Because his grandpa and grandma read him some stories.
 Because they read him stories, didn't they? Good job. That completes our graphic organizer on Maurice Sendak. Now, I have your own biographies for you to read. Everyone should know where they go. And your own shoe biography for you to fill out because remember we're going to do a display in our hallway that's called Famous Footwear and have our shoes displayed for everyone else to see. Alright, right now I want you to stand up. I want you to glue cotton on your shoes.  Stick some marshmallows in your mouth, and go to your area to read your biography.  
 Alright, I want you to sit a little more in a circle and then I want you to read two pages and then I want you to fill it out, okay?  Can you read the title? Can we read the title together? Ready?
 "Joseph Burcheck"
Good. Who's Joseph Burcheck?
Him.
Yep, that's right. Open up to page two, Dalton. There you go. Stephanie, can you start for us?
"Joseph Burcheck" grandma and grandpa . There were lots of beautiful plants and hills where they live."
"Grandma had many books she liked to read and so did Joseph."
 Good. Stop there and look at your graphic organizer. Look at your shoe. Is there a part of that shoe that you can fill out?
Yes.
Which part do you think? You think Family? And you think Childhood, Dalton. Let's start with Family. What part do you think would go in Family?
Grandma and grandpa.
Grandma and grandpa. That he did what with Grandma and Grandpa?
Read books.
He read books with them. What else did he do with them? Can you re-read this part?
"There were a lot of beautiful plants and hills where they lived."
"They lived." What do you think that means? That he what with his Grandma and Grandpa?
Lived.
He lived with them, that's right. So can you write that in Family? Put that in Ideas. And then let Dalton tell you what he thinks goes in Childhood, okay?
Got it. 
 What do you guys filling in? 
How do you spell "lived?"
 L...
No, lived.
 L-I... V-E-D.  Who does his live with?
He cheated.
 Grandma and Grandpa.
His Grandma and Grandpa? Is that what you were going to add to the graphic organizer? You're exactly right. You're doing a good job. Jenn, I think she needs the marker. There you go. Keep it up. Keep up the good work.
 H-E R-A-N  
 "Her family was quick to hang up her work." Your turn.
 "Her family was quick to hang up her work."
 Nice job. And we have a Family section on here, so what do you think Dylan? What did her family do?
 Put her pictures up.
That's exactly right, they "hung up her work." Good job Dylan. I'm going to show you where. Right here. T-H-E
Do you know why they're putting that in Family? Can you tell me? Because her family did what? What did her family like to do?
Put pictures up.
Hang up her pictures, that's exactly why they're adding it to Family.
 Go ahead and finish what you need to write.
 You've got to finish it, Dylan. You're doing a great job.
 There you go, her work. 
Why is this a biography?
 Because it tells by a... girl and she's writing books. And she was reading books and writing.
You're right, it's a biography. A biography is a story about a real person and that's exactly what she was. Can you read me one of these?
"When Amy was little, she liked to read."
 Good. And why does that belong in Childhood?
Because she was doing it as a child.
 She was doing it when she was little. You're right. You're exactly right. Now, who's going to fill in the ideas? Who knows where did she get her ideas from? Do you know where she got her ideas from?
 From the books.
From the books. Well, actually, where did she get the ideas for the books? Can you read this part for me?
"Amy liked  about a lot of books. Things people say help Amy."
What helps Amy?
"Things people say."
Things people say. So where does she get her ideas from?
People.
People and the things that they tell her, right? Things that they say. Can you write that in the Ideas part?
Yes.
Good job. The things that people say are what help her and give her ideas. Houston, can you help her direct that? That would be great. You guys are doing a fantastic job. 
 Oh, you wrote the wrong stuff. You're writing on the wrong side. You're writing on the wrong side. 
She's writing that whole section. Why? Can someone tell me why she's writing that in Childhood? Clint, do you know? Why is she writing that in Childhood? Why is she writing that Joseph did things with his Grandpa in Childhood?
 Because he used to watch him play guitar and go in the woods with him and talk nice--
Did he do that when he was an adult or when he was a child?
Child.
Right, so is that why it would go in Childhood?
Yes.
Jeffrey, can you tell me what is this story about?
 It tells real stuff.
 It tells real stuff about what?
Joseph Burcheck.
Joseph Burcheck, yep. That's what it does. It tells real things about him. You guys are doing great. Keep up the good work.
