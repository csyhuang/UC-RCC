It'll disintegrate 
 Okay. So, as a quick vote, how many people thought, on this one, oh, sorry, Kevin, go ahead.
Also, I think it's gonna decrease, because, the paper's gonna burn and incinerate, but also, the match, when you light the match, it's gonna burn, too.
Okay. Some of you, maybe, forgot about the match. I haven't heard you mention it, until just now, so that, not only is the paper gonna burn up, but so will, at least part of, the match. Okay, 'cause it's burning too, alright? A quick vote. How many people, on this one, said the mass would go down, would decrease? And how many said it would increase? And, how many said it'd stay the same? So, the majority of you are on the decrease side, on this. Okay, here's my next question. We've now heard what a bunch of people had to say, about each different situation. One, if it would increase, or decrease, or stay the same. My question to you now is that, after listening to all the people throw ideas out there, has anybody changed their mind on any of these? In other words, like, maybe for the ice in the water one, I was thinking it was going to increase, but, after listening to every one, now, I think it's gonna decrease.
