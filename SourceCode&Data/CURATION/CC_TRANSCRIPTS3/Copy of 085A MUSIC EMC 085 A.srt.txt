 Okay, why don't you come up and try that? Click on the heart. Oops. It's not quite high enough. Hold on one second. Let me minimize it. Okay, now try to get it. A little harder. And you have "Ti ti." All right, let's try the second beat. Don't raise your hand yet. We haven't done it. Sing it and clap.
