Brooke, what did you choose?
 The cylinder.
 Why?  Okay, five, and what about you, Ms. Leah?
 Cylinder.
 Why?
 Because it has two faces.
 It has two faces, and what about you, Ms. Cecilia?  The sphere, and why, you need to write your words down. Okay, so write your words down so you guys can hand in your sheet.
 Who thinks wants to cut? Who think will cut? Here, what about Samantha, then you? Okay, and then me, then Brian. Okay, but he goes, you too. You called... You want to hold and stretch? Well, that's the one you're doing, and you'll be cutting. Okay, so Katie cuts, then Samantha, then me and then Brian. He is going to roll the shapes down the hill. I'll stretch, and you can hold, okay?  Samantha... Wait guys, this is...
 Guys, it's the sphere. Spheres. Those are spheres.
 That's the cylinders. No.
 This is the sphere color, you already got...
Here, how about I'll be...  Who wants cylinder, raise your hand. Who wants sphere? Who wants cylinder? So, it's three versus one. So, do the cylinder first and then use... 
 Fine, I'll get on it.
 You guys working it out? Alright. 
 Yes, Blake, what do you need?
 We need more string.
 You need more string? Okay, alright. Keep that one right there, and roll one of your other shapes and I'll get you a longer piece of string.
 Okay. 
 Hold on, I got it right here. I'll tie it on there, how's that?  Okay, is that going to work for you? Alright, Isaac, go ahead and stretch it out.
 How long it was?
 We need to hang that up. 
 You can cut this tie.
 Okay, I'll cut this time. I'll have... Don't roll it now. I can measure it. I'll cut it. Now, Leila roll it down.
 Move the cylinder!  
 Blue, blue, oh we have only blue?
 When you guys are measuring, who's doing the holding? You are? Okay Foster, hold it. Who's doing the stretching? Because you're going to have to stretch it out, you can't cut it until it's stretched. You're stretching, and so Sierra's cutting? Okay Foster, you hold it, you gotta stretch it all the way out. Yeah, okay, cut it right here. Like that. Here, there you go. Open it a little bit more. There you go, okay. And Foster go put it up on the graph, and Sierra you can throw away the extra. Okay, good job. What shape is this, Hunter?
 Sphere.
 Sphere, alright,  and what do you know, what's special about the sphere? It rolls, and what's really special about it?
 It has no faces.
 It has no faces, you're brilliant.  Okay, the next one... 
 Whoa!
 You can cut it. You may be able to... 
 I want to straighten it. Measure it. 
 The sphere went the farthest? So, was your prediction right, Jackson? Was your prediction right?
 Yes. No.
 No.  So, you want to circle no, and you want to circle yes. Anthony, was your prediction right? Okay, so you want to circle the check mark for yes, your prediction was right. And then you guys can get some crayons and draw your observations, and what you saw in your experiment. 
 I think... The cylinder.
 Okay, who's letting this go?
 Me.
 Okay, you can't measure it till she lets it go. Ready, go Cecilia, let her go.  Look at the poor little cube. Why do you think it doesn't go very far?
 Because it has sides.
 What kind of sides?
Squares.
 And they're what?
Flat.
 Flat, alright, but now you've picked it up and you can't measure it.  Alright, who's doing the holding? Okay, now hold on a second Leah, so when you measure you want to turn it this way, so the edge is right up against the ramp, and then you hold it tight, and then you can cut it right here, okay? Alright, so who's holding, you are? Okay, alright--
 You hold this, you hold that. Okay, can I go hang that up? Now, we do some... 
 Okay, hold on, can you hold this away for a second while she sends it down? Ready? Okay, ready? Alright, now are you the holder? Okay. Use the stretcher.
 Try and stretch the...
 So, Katie, you took Brian's turn last time, honey, so it's his turn. Okay, girls, what shape is this one?
 Rectangular prism.
 And what's special about it?
 Because... Because... Because it has... Because it has rectangle.
 Rectangle what?
Faces.
 Faces, and they are...
 Flat.
 Flat rectangles, right, so did it go very far?
No.
Did anybody pick the rectangular prism to go the farthest? You picked that one? Okay, so now you know, it didn't go too far. Alright, so now you're going to try your...
 Cube.
 Cube, okay good.
 Who's cutting now?
Who? Who's sliding it? Samantha!
 No, I didn't slide it down before.
 Samantha didn't...
 So, were you right Leila?
 Yeah, you did!
 Yes or yes ma'am?
 Yes ma'am.
 Alright, so you can circle your prediction was correct, and then, was your prediction correct, Isaac? No, you guys said the cylinder went the farthest. Was your prediction correct? Okay, so you circle here, your prediction wasn't correct, and then, was your prediction correct, Aspen? No, and what about you Blake, yes? Okay, so now you guys can go ahead and clean up all of your stuff, and then you can get one of the crayon caddies and draw a picture of what happened. Blake, I want you to help your team clean up before you start drawing your observations.  Good job team!
 Hey, that's mine! That's my pencil! 
 Wait, I'm not ready yet, I'm not ready yet.
 I got it right. I got it right.
 Yeah, I got it right. I got it right.
 So, which shape do you guys have left? What is that?
 Cone.
 The cone, and what's special about the cone?  And so what happens to it?
 It slides.
 It does slide on its face. What else is special about the cone, Cecilia?
It rolls in a circle.
 Why?
Because...
 You okay?
Because it has a flat face.
 Mm hmm, and what else makes it roll in that circle, Leah?
It has a point.
 It has the point on it, so this is your last one to measure?
 Yes.
 Okay, yes or yes ma'am?
 Yes ma'am.
 Alright, good luck.
 You throw that away, I'll throw it away.
 So, was your prediction correct, Hunter?
 Yes.
 Yes, so the cylinder went the farthest for you guys? Okay, so Sierra, if the cylinder went the farthest, your prediction wasn't right, so now you're gonna circle the X. Does it matter that you are right?
 No.
 No, you're just predicting, and that means you're guessing, you don't have to be right. Circle the X, and then go ahead and draw your pictures.
 It's orange.
 So, you guys are gonna show the cylinder going the farthest.
 Just do it. Do it here.
 Now, I don't know what's going the farthest.
 It was probably cylinder.
 Yeah... 
 Okay, so what shape went the farthest for you guys?
 Um, the cylinder.
 The cylinder, so was your prediction correct? Was yours? Was yours?
 Mm, no.
 What shape did you predict?
 Um, the sphere.
 Sphere, but the cylinder went the farthest, so were you right? No, so did you circle the little X on the bottom? And then you can do your picture. Was your prediction correct, Brian? Okay, so circle the check mark and draw your picture, and then you guys can copy the graph from the board on the back, so you can show your parents what happened. Good work team!  All right, so this team's all set? Okay, so which one went the furthest for this team?
 The sphere.
 The sphere, okay, so was your prediction right, Cecilia?
 Yeah.
 Okay, was yours right, Brooke? So, does it matter if you got it right? Not at all. Alright, so then draw your observations, draw what happened, and then you can draw the graph on the back. 
 Now we have to draw the graph on the back.
