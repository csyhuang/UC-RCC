Boys and girls, these are words you use when speaking, when you're talking about cause and effect when speaking. Because it's snowing, I need my heavy jacket. That's cause and effect. These are words we use with speaking. These words, let's say them just one time for a little pronunciation practice. Thus.

 And the fact is.
These are pretty much words we're gonna use in writing only. We don't really speak these words, not often, very rare. These we used in speaking: since, because, and so. And these are the words you're gonna be using today. You're gonna be using them to write some simple sentences that show cause and effect relationships. These are more when you're writing an essay, an essay, like maybe for the ELA, or when you're writing an academic essay. Okay, so we have one more. You guys are doing so great. And I have a lot of stuff here. I have a one, two, three--

Boys and girls, now you all have in front of you two worksheets. You have one worksheet in front of you, you have two different ones. Many of you have this worksheet, and many of you have this worksheet, okay? I just gonna do one quick sentence here. Because it is hot, I'll need my--

 Shorts.
Okay, so it's sunny and I'm gonna need my shorts and sunglasses. I got 'em. I'll need my sunglasses and shorts. And "because" here, this is what you call a transition word. This is what we're working on. Now, if I have this here, Juan Pablo you have this worksheet. We have cause and effect. If I have this here, we have, let's say, since it is raining, I'll need my raincoat. And that's a coat for rain. It's on your list there. So, what is this word here? Say it with me: since.
 Since.
"Since" is a transition word. In speaking, and then sometimes writing like this style of writing, you would use these words. All the time in speaking, you show cause and effect. Since I don't have any money, I can't buy anything to eat tonight. Because it's raining, I think I'll go to the movies. Cause and effect, boys and girls. Use it each and every time you think about, speak about cause and effect. Now I want you to try this with your partner, and then we're gonna practice speaking these out. On three, I want you to go. Three, two, one, go.  Use the examples, use the sentences. And here's some more additional examples for you.  Do you see it up top? Clothing. Right here. Clothing. How would you make "clothes" out of that? Can you see it? Give it a try. Can you read this to me?  What do you need when it's hot?  Okay, so you see the list right here? Which items are for hot? Which items are for cold? Can you try to write that for me? I'm gonna come back. 
Look at the charts, they are there to help you.  You see the chart that I made? So, let's try something. I want to try something. Can you read me, actually read Hon Lu your first sentence. And you read her your first sentence. You first. Partner A, partner B. Partner A, go. You first, you're partner A.
Because it is raining, I need my umbrella and raincoat.

Okay, now you're speaking to each other, not to me. Okay, keep going. Go.
Since it is sunny, I need my sunglasses. 
Can you write that there? Look right here. That list, for you. Okay, you see on the...
