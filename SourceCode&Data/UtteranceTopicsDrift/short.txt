I went to the bank to fish for gold.
At the bank I saw that the bait was old.
So I went back to the car and did what I was told.
I called the bank, and they put me on hold.
When teller came on, he said the bait still good.
And assured me that the fish would still see it as food.
So, I went back to the bank- the same place where I had stood.
And hoped that my luck would differ from my mood.
